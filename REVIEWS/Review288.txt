		<shortDescription>Noir at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Humphrey Bogart died nearly fifty years ago, but polls still put him at the top of all-time Hollywood stars. What turns a man into a legend? The man himself wasn't much: a slight build, not too tall, no Stallone muscles to swell his suit. What he had in classic films like `The Maltese Falcon' was a voice that cut through a script like a knife. `The Maltese Falcon,' directed by John Huston in 1941, reprised Dashiell Hammett's thriller. (It had been filmed before.) Hammett practically invented the tough guy so deep in cynicism nobody could hope to put anything past him. The novel, thick with plot, wasn't easy for director John Huston to untangle. Few people who cherish this film can summarize its story in a sentence or two. I'll try. San Francisco private eye Sam Spade (Bogart) is pulled into the search for a fabulously valuable statue by a woman who seeks his help. First, his partner is killed, then Spade pushes through her lies to uncover connections to an effete foreigner (Peter Lorre) and a mysterious kingpin (Sydney Greenstreet). The story unfolds like a crumpled paper. But the whodunit becomes less important than how we respond to the strong screen presence of Bogart and his co-stars. That's what makes `The Maltese Falcon' a classic. We see more and appreciate more each time we watch it. The art of Huston and Bogart doesn't come across until a second or third viewing. Huston invented what the French called film noir, in honor of Hollywood films (often `B' movies, cheap to make, second movies in double features) that took no-name stars into city streets to pit tough guys, often with a vulnerable streak, against dangerous dames. Audiences knew that when the tough guy said, `I'm wise to you, babe,' he'd be dead within a reel or two. Bogart was luckier than most noir heroes, but it cost. Struggling to maintain his own independence ? against the claims of love or his own penchant towards dishonesty ? the Bogart hero can do little better than surrender, with a rueful shrug, to the irony his survival depends on. The climax of `The Maltese Falcon' ranks with the last scene of `Casablanca,' another Bogart vehicle, in showing how the tough guy has to put himself back together after his emotions almost get the better of him. That assertion of strength, bowed but not broken, defines the enduring quality of Bogart on screen. For Huston, telling this story posed a different problem. Telling it straight wasn't possible ? too many twists. Huston chose to focus on characters. One way to appreciate Huston's choices is to LISTEN to the movie. Hear the voices. Notice how in long sequences narrating back story, Huston relies on the exotic accents of his characters to keep us interested. Could we endure the scene in which Greenstreet explains the history of the Maltese falcon unless his clipped, somewhat prissy English accent held our attention? Also, we watch Bogart slip into drug-induced sleep while Greenstreet drones on. Has any director thought of a better way to keep us interested during a long narrative interlude? And is there a bit of wit in our watching Bogart nod off during a scene which, if told straight, would make US doze? All of this leads to the ending, minutes of screen time in which more goes on, gesture by gesture, than a million words could summarize. He loves her, maybe, but he won't be a sucker. The cops come in, and the emotional color shifts to gray, the color of film noir heroes like Bogart. Bars on the elevator door as Brigid descends in police custody foreshadow her fate in the last image of Huston's film. But after the film, we're left with Spade, whom we like and loathe, a man whose sense of justice squares, just this once, with our own, maybe. Black and white morality prevails in a black and white movie, but Sam Spade remains gray ? and so does our response to this film classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bogart. The coolest guy to ever live?Have you ever wondered what makes someone possess an essence that's defined as being "cool"? They seem to have that combination between imagery and soul that few people truly have. Is it in the style of clothes you wear or one's knowledge of independence? Is it the way you comb your hair or your unkempt humility for everything out there? It could be in your talk or how you walk, but maybe it's more about what you say and where you're going. In a sense it's an attitude that seeks to define character and break the mold of control. It's the fine line between knowing when to speak up and when saying less means more. So is Bogart the coolest guy to ever live? In a single word, absolutely.The Maltese Falcon is basically a showcase for Bogart. A role that seems to be made for him, even with two previous attempts at the film. He is and always was born to play Sam Spade. The tough guy private investigator, who always has the right things to say. More likely to fire a witty comeback than a gun. Able to fall in love, even if only for the moment, and then send her to the gallows. All in the name of doing the right thing. It's not an emotional business.The movie itself wrote the book of the crime and mystery drama story. Probably the best written plot in it's genre. No doubt that Bogart makes the character come alive, with that infectious voice and his uncompromising demeanor. But the movie itself is, to say the least, very good. The ending just does it for me. The last couple of lines are some of the best in film history.Although it took me a while to finally see this film, I realize that it's one of Bogart's triumphs and has all the main reasons why I love the guy so much. Please, see this film and remember Bogart as he was."Heavy. What is it? The, uh, stuff that dreams are made of."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart, the hero who was exactly right for his time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Forties were the years when Hollywood decided that the mystery thriller deserved big-budget, big-star treatment, threw up a new kind of hero who was exactly right for his time: they were the fabulous years which established the private eye adventure as the irremovable all-time favorite in the whole field of suspense? The field was so rich, the choice so lavish in that decade, that it was difficult to know where memory should stop and call "Encore".As the author of the screenplay, Huston made every effort to do justice, and remain faithful, to Dashiell Hammett's novel? But in remaining faithful, the newest version asked audiences to accept the complicated plot at its full strength and that is where the film's main flaw occurs? Names, murders, and intrigues turn up so quickly that it is extremely difficult to understand exactly what is happening in this tale of an assortment of characters in search of a fabulous jewel-encrusted statue? Probably in no other film will a viewer find a gallery of such diverse human beings whose perfect1y constructed portrayals remain permanently locked in one's memory? Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy is a striking picture of feminine deceit and betrayal? Able to shed tears on command, she is a confirmed liar who can be as deadly as she is beautiful; she can make passionate love to Bogart, but wouldn't hesitate a moment to kill him if it suited her plan? Her performance is surely one of the screen's most brilliant portrayals of duplicity masked with fascination? Sydney Greenstreet, in his movie debut, was equally memorable as the menacingly mountainous man behind the search for the elusive black bird, and almost stole the picture? Cunning, determined, appreciative of the fine arts, Greenstreet?who seemed to get more dangerous as he got more imperturbably polite?is a man who would devote his entire life to a single quest if need be? Peter Lorre's Joel Cairo was a resolute picture of classic villainy? With curled hair and impeccably clean dress, he is an unpredictable accomplice of Greenstreet, difficult to deal with? But it is Bogart's portrayal of Sam Spade that remains classic in its construction? Obviously cynical, he still maintains his own code of ethics which he adheres to faithfully? He is doubtful, but not foolhardy? He is courageous, but not without fear? Spade uses everyone he comes in contact with? He wins not because he's smarter than his enemies, but because he is the only character in a central position? Spade is every bit as ruthless as the crooks who try to use him? His tactics in dealing with them, however, are necessary for his survival...His treatment of the two women in the film seems equally as harsh, but neither is a wide eyed innocent and both attempt to deceive him in one manner or another? His exchanges with Brigid O'Shaughnessy are electric... Their mutual attraction is undeniable... But Spade will play the fool for no woman? He is a loner, but he has contacts, and knows where to go for what he wants? Even with very little money, he is totally incorruptible? He has no apparent friends? He is laconic, but he can throw a wisecrack as fast as he can throw a punch..."The Maltese Falcon" molded the image we remember of Bogart all through the early years of the Forties?an image elaborated upon and reinforced in "Casablanca," and the one which all Bogart fans remember with great affection and admiration?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon has a totally atypical Hollywood history. After two previous filmings of Dashiell Hammett's novel, the third time a classic film was achieved. Usually the original is best and the remakes are the inferior product.These characters that John Huston wrote and breathed life into with his direction are so vital and alive even 65 years after the premiere of The Maltese Falcon. You can watch this one fifty times and still be entertained by it.I'm not sure how the code let this one slip through. Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade is partners with Jerome Cowan in a detective agency Spade and Archer. Client Mary Astor comes into their office requesting help in getting rid of a man who's intruding in on her life. Jerome Cowan as Miles Archer eagerly takes the assignment and gets himself bumped off for his troubles.Cowan is quite the skirt chaser and he certainly isn't the first or the last man to think with his hormones. That's OK because Bogart's been fooling around with his wife, Gladys George. That gives the police, Barton MacLane and Ward Bond, motive enough to suspect Bogart might have had a hand in Cowan's death.As fans of The Maltese Falcon are well aware, there's quite a bit more to the story than that. Bogart's investigation leads him to a crew of adventurous crooks, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook, Jr. who are in pursuit of a statue of a Falcon that is said to be encrusted in gold and precious jewels. The Maltese Falcon is a milestone film role for Humphrey Bogart. It is the first time that Bogey was ever first billed in an A picture while he was at Warner Brothers. In fact this is also John Huston's first film as a director. He had previously just been a screenwriter and in fact got an Oscar nomination for the screenplay he wrote here. There are some who will argue that this first film is Huston's best work and I'd be hard up to dispute that.After a long career on stage The Maltese Falcon was the screen debut of Sydney Greenstreet. Greenstreet may be orally flatulent here, but there's no doubt to the menace he exudes while he's on screen. Greenstreet got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Donald Crisp for How Green Was My Valley. Greenstreet created quite a gallery of characters for the next ten years, mostly for Warner Brothers.A favorite character of mine in The Maltese Falcon has always been Lee Patrick as Effie, the secretary at Spade&amp;Archer. She's loyal, efficient and crushing out on Bogey big time. This and the part of Mrs. Topper in the television series Topper are Lee Patrick's career roles. I never watch The Maltese Falcon without hoping that Bogey will recognize how really "precious" Effie is.The Maltese Falcon will be entertaining people hundreds of years from now. And please no more remakes of this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch mystery that kicked off the film noir genre of the 1940s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Maltese Falcon", scripted and directed by Hollywood first-timer John Huston (from Dashiell Hammett's novel), would go on to become an American film classic. Humphrey Bogart chews the scenery in his star-making turn as acid-tongued private eye Sam Spade, whose association with the beautiful and aloof Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor), neurotic Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), and morbidly obese Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet, in his Oscar-nominated screen debut) over the recovery of the title object, sets in motion a movie experience that is as much crackling as it is dazzling. While much of the action and dialogue is considerably dated by modern standards, the film's essential power to mystify and entrance remains undiminished despite its age. While this was the third adaptation of Hammett's story (the first was made in 1931 and the second was "Satan Met a Lady" (1936)), this is also the best remembered and most praised, due largely in part to Bogart's seemingly effortless portrayal of the tough but softhearted, world-weary hero. Mary Astor and Lee Patrick were, respectively, the definitive femme fatale and girl Friday, and the villianous roles of Cairo, Gutman and Wilmer (Elisha Cook Jr.) were equally remarkable. What may not be wholly obvious is the fact that these three men have homosexual tendencies (as given in the novel), but just look at what's given: Cairo's delicate speech and manner, Wilmer's questionable quick tempered attitude towards Spade (could this be covering up the fact that he finds Spade attractive?) and Gutman's clutching of Spade's arm when Sam arrives at his hotel room. A polished film noir that gave rise to Bogart's mounting popularity. (Sidenote: The character of Sam Spade was originally offered to George Raft, who turned it down. Raft also turned down "Casablanca" (1942), "High Sierra" (1941) and William Wyler's "Dead End" (1937), all of which went to Bogart and helped to boost his star status. Bogart had Raft to thank for his enduring popularity.) A must-see masterpiece. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, smart noir whose pace covers the plot holes and is based on some great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Private detectives Sam Spade and Miles Archer are hired to follow a man called Thursby for a woman. When Archer is murdered and Thursby gunned down, the police and Spade are keen to get answers. When the woman reveals she was lying about her motivations and her identity (she is really Bridget O'Shaughnessy), Sam finds out that she and Thursby were hiding a valuable statute of a falcon. The situation gets more complex when Bridget and Sam come under pressure form other sources that also want the falcon for themselves - namely the pompous Kasper Gutman and the weasely Joel Cairo.The fact that this film is considered a classic almost makes it difficult to come to this with an objective view, but I did the best I could when I came to see it again for the first time in quite a few years. The film is pretty much a classic that deserves it reputation and stands out as a great bit of hardboiled detective stories from the period. The plot is a little complex at the start as the characters are introduced, but it quickly settles down to be a film with a solid plot that is enjoyable despite the fact that it falls down occasionally. The plot details are too often blurred or just forgotten about - giving the impression of a plot that is more complex than it actually is. However this isn't a problem as the film has enough pace and tough energy to cover these weaknesses and never let you linger for very long on them. The direction from Huston is very good, using almost totally interior shots to increase the tension and the feeling - amazingly this was his first film as director, but you wouldn't know it to watch it. Of course, needless to say, the writing (both source and screenplay) is top notch and is one of the big selling points of the film.The dialogue is really tough and full of memorable lines, 'When you're slapped you'll take it and like it' probably being the one that everybody remembers. A big reason that the dialogue works as well as it does is down to the fantastic performances from all the cast, although having said that it is dominated by the lead. Bogart summed up his most famous roles for future generations in this one film. He is a complex guy who we're never sure is straight of crooked, he is tough and violent - sleeping with his partner's wife and unafraid of anything. The dialogue fits him like a glove and this is one of my favourite of his performances as it is the one of the ones where he seems to have got everything bang on. Astor is good because, for me, she doesn't fit into the usual role of femme fatale - she is quite needy and demur and that is even more dangerous than the women who are overtly sexual and manipulative, as they were frequently in the later noirs. Lorre is the wonderful, weedy, snivelling character than he does so well and is remembered for. Likewise Greenstreet is a great actor and manages to be overblown without being silly. Cook has a small role but shows his talents in little ways - his reaction when he realises how expendable he is to Gutman is great.Overall this is a classic film that will please all fans of detective stories and the noir genre. It has a flawed plot but it's dialogue and tough energy cover those up enough to keep things moving all the time. The characters are complex, none more so than Spade himself who is as smart as he is gullible and as cold as he is loving , and they are brought to life by a series of great performances. On top of all this, the film is dominated by a Bogart performance that acts as a perfect example of his most famous work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Entertaining Films of Its Kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a fine combination of cast, characters, story, and atmosphere, this classic is one of the most entertaining films of its kind, enjoyable even after several viewings. It gets you right into the action and introduces you to a list of interesting personalities, who mesh together nicely and who are also matched well with the cast members. Beyond that, it's also effective as a character study involving greed, trust and distrust, and conflicting ethics. Sam Spade is an ideal role for Bogart, giving him plenty to work with and some very good dialogue as well. Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet are very entertaining, providing suitable foils for Bogart, and they really take the film up a notch. The rest of the cast also works well (worth mentioning is Elisha Cook, Jr., whose character doesn't do a lot, but who provides Bogart with some very amusing moments at his expense). The story is nicely adapted from the novel, and each scene is constructed well, with everything moving along nicely from start to finish.If you are a fan of either film noir or mysteries, make this a must-see. There are very few films that work as well as "The Maltese Falcon".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fat Man Cometh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered by many film historians as the very first noir film, "The Maltese Falcon" is cinematically important also for making Humphrey Bogart into a Hollywood star, and for being the debut of John Huston as film Director.The film's story is complex and convoluted, typical of detective films of that era, and involves a valuable statuette. The plot stalls and meanders throughout most of the film, as we encounter an assortment of strange characters and side issues. But this is not a plot-driven film. It is character-driven.And the main character, of course, is PI Sam Spade (Bogart). He's not a particularly nice guy. He comes across as overconfident and egotistic. He smirks a lot. But he's tough as nails. And he knows how to nail the bad guys. A big part of the film is Spade's relationship to femme fatale Brigid (Mary Astor). They engage each other in a battle of wits. And there's more than a hint of romantic involvement between the two. But Brigid is the one who propels Spade into the deceiving and double-crossing world of bad guys who yearn with greed for the priceless Maltese Falcon.Enter Kasper Gutman, that thoroughly rotund and intimidating (in a gentlemanly sort of way) king of greed, portrayed with verve and panache by the inimitable Sydney Greenstreet. Gutman, AKA the "Fat Man", is nothing if not erudite and self-assured. In one scene, Sam Spade makes a bold offer. Gutman responds articulately: "That's an attitude sir that calls for the most delicate judgment on both sides, because as you know sir, in the heat of action, men are likely to forget where their best interests lie ...".And Peter Lorre is a hoot as Gutman's mischievous elf, Joel Cairo, who tries, without success, to threaten Sam Spade, but only succeeds at getting on Sam's nerves.The film's high contrast B&amp;W lighting renders an effective noir look and feel, one that would be copied in films for years to come. Acting varies from very good to overly melodramatic. The script is very talky. For the most part, the film is just a series of conversations that take place in interior sets.Stylistic and cinematically innovative, "The Maltese Falcon" has endured as a film classic. I suspect the main reason for its continued popularity is the continued popularity of Bogart. But I personally prefer the performance of Sydney Greenstreet, the enticing fat man. Yet, together they would reappear in later films, one of which would follow, in 1942, as the classic of all classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic with good reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there are films that are considered classic for their technical achievements and classics that resound with audiences for a feel-good emotion, The Maltese Falcon stands in that group that is a classic for every aspect of its creative makeup. With a brilliant script, talented direction and some outstanding performances, The Maltese Falcon stands up today as well as it did upon release.When Sam Spade -- played brilliantly by Humphrey Bogart -- and his partner Archer are hired to tail a rich eccentric by a woman who claims her sister is being unwittingly kept separated from her by the rich eccentric, it seems like just another case. But when Archer and the eccentric are gunned down and all fingers point to Sam Spade for conflicting yet damning reasons, Spade is thrown into a whirlwind of deceptions that all point in one direction: a Maltese statue of a falcon.Bogart demonstrates clearly why he is one of the great classic actors of the 20th century, and indeed one of the most natural screen actors ever. His charisma, charm and intense masculine looks give him a presence that simply dominates the screen. With a host of other great talents to fill the screen, there is not a moment of wasted performance. The direction is tight and driving and the pacing never lets up. And the script demonstrates why there are less and less truly great films being released in present day: the writers and directors of the golden age of cinema knew that subtlety works ten times more effectively than the modern in-your-face all-the-time works.The Maltese Falcon is a timeless work that deserves its place in the list of greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Humphrey Bogart makes his highly deserved tryst with super-stardom in John Huston's directorial debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven decades have passed but the suspense and thrill of The Maltese Falcon still reign supreme. The movie, despite being in black &amp; white, appears strikingly refreshing both to the eyes and the intellect. Primarily remembered as John Huston's directorial debut, the movie played a decisive role in giving Film-Noire its true identity as a genre. The Maltese Falcon also gave Humphrey Bogart his highly deserved super-stardom that had hitherto eluded him. Huston creates an environment of suspicion, doubt and uncertainty that is so convoluted that even Hitchcock would be proud of it. The movie has multiple layers of mystery and suspense that keeps the viewer engaged throughout. Sam Spade is a private detective who runs an agency with his partner Miles Archer. An ostensibly naive lady, Miss Wanderly offers them a task to pursue a man, Floyd Thursby, who has allegedly run off with her younger sister. The over-simplicity of task arouses Spade's suspicion, but Wanderly's lucrative offer makes the duo overlook it initially. Miles is killed during the pursuit and the police inform Spade of the mishap. Spade only discreetly tells the police that Miles was after a man named Thursby without disclosing anything about Miss Wandely. The police soon find Thursby dead as well and suspect Spade for killing him in an act of revenge. Soon Miles Archer's widow shows up at Spade's office and insinuates of her romantic involvement with Spade, who shuns her away after she tries to incriminate him for the murder. The police come across an anonymous lead and begin suspecting Spade for killing his partner, Miles. The plot thickens with the entry a couple of obscure characters including Joel Cairo, who happens be an acquaintance of Miss Wanderly. He is in pursuit of a highly precious, antique, gold statuette of Maltese Falcon and offers Spade five grands to help him find it. A game of cat and mouse soon ensues, between the various stake holders, which becomes deadlier as the stakes are raised. Humphrey Bogart perfectly fits into the shoes of Spade?a sleek and sharp sleuth?and makes it his own in a manner that only someone of his grit and caliber could. Bogart is in top form right from the inception to the finale, stealing the spotlight in almost every scene that is he is part of. Bogart could only demonstrate his prodigious talent and acting prowess in short bursts during his long "B movie" stint in which he was mostly type-casted as a gangster. The Maltese Falcon was Bogart's big break after years of anticipation and he didn't leave a single stone unturned to prove his mettle. Bogart shows his class and stamps his authority as a performer during the portrayal of Spade: he is ever so quick-witted thanks to his sublime articulacy and his prowess at repartee seems unparalleled; the inherent cynicism in Spade and the perspicacity with which he operates soon became Bogart's trademark and catapulted him to super-stardom. Many regard Bogart's performance in Casablanca as his absolute best, but I rate his portrayal of Spade second only to his supernal portrayal of Dobbs in The Treasure of Sierre Madre, where he took acting to hitherto unattainable and unforeseeable heights. John Huston uses the Midas touch he had as a screenwriter to strike all the right cords in his directorial debut. Almost everyone in the supporting cast gives a memorable performance with special mention of Peter Lorre as the deceptive Joel Cairo, Sydney Greenstreet as the witty yet dangerous Kasper Gutman and Mary Astor as the scheming Brigid O' Shaughnessy. The taut plot of the movie, which is masterfully adapted from the novel of the same name by Huston himself, is well complemented by the impressively written dialogs that are delivered with an equal prowess. Amidst the everlasting suspense the movie has an obvious undertone of dark humor that adds great value to the movie. The cinematography undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the time.The Maltese Falcon is not merely a Noire masterpiece but also a testament to the true spirit of cinema that has kept itself alive despite decades of relentless mutilation and sabotage in the name of commercial movie-making. Despite being devoid of modern-day gimmicks the movie is incredibly high on suspense and holds the viewer in a vice-like grip throughout its runtime. It's a real shame that movies like these are seldom made these days. The tone of the movie is such that it makes suspense thrillers of today appear like kids cartoon. PS. The movie is an ode to Bogart, Huston and all those who made it a reality. It's suspense cinema at its absolute best with a completely different treatment to themes propagated by the likes of Hitchcock. It's a must for all the Bogart fans worldwide, and absolutely essential for all those who have a penchant for Film-Noire as a genre. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best detective story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. I didn't love it until I'd watched it a couple of times.And I didn't love it quite so much until I'd read Harvey Greenberg's "Movies on Your Mind." But I now think that, within the strictures of its budget, it's about as good as it can get. Sam Spade is a marvelous character in this film. He gives practically nothing away, while gathering information from others simply by letting them talk, kind of like a shrink.And it's hard to believe that they could have found a cast that fit the templates of the novel so perfectly. Sidney Greenstreet IS the "fat man." Peter Lorre IS the queer. My nomination for best scene: When Greenstreet attempts to peel off the black enamel from the captured bird and finds that it's nothing but lead and begins to hack away at it, as if it were alive and he were trying to kill it. Nothing is more amusing than a fat man lipid with rage.If you see this one, and I hope you do, make note of the phenomenal black and white photography. (I hope you have a good connection.) Watch, for instance, the glissade of the camera when Bogart says, "You have brains. Yes, you do." In case you're worried about this being too sophisticated for enjoyment by an ordinary audience, I should mention that I showed this (in one connection or another, I forget) to a class of Marines at Camp Lejeune. They enjoyed the hell out of it, especially the scene in which Mary Astor kicks Peter Lorre in the shins.Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Maltese Falcon' is the granddaddy of the modern detective movie, as well as the first of the 'film noir' genre, which should impress any film buff looking for an 'essential' film for his collection...But even if you're not, I'd STRONGLY recommend this film, as a terrific mystery with a first-rate cast!Hollywood legend has it that George Raft had been cast as detective Sam Spade, in this third version of the Dashiell Hammett novel (it had been filmed 10 years earlier, with Ricardo Cortez as Spade, and a few years later, with Bette Davis in the Astor role). Raft refused to work with novice director John Huston, however, and Humphrey Bogart, fresh from his breakthrough success in 'High Sierra', inherited the role...and a legendary team was formed! Huston was a master of sharp, witty dialogue and character, and nobody could play a loner with a code of honor better than Bogart; together, they were unbeatable!The premise involves a statue of a falcon said to have a fortune in jewels under the lead paint covering it, but this is really a tale of greed, betrayal, and murder. The cast of characters is unforgettable; in addition to Bogart's Spade, there is the beautiful and mysterious Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor), slickly effeminate Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), gregarious and self-centered Kasper Gutman (Sidney Greenstreet, in his finest role), and Gutman's young, psychotic hitman (Elisha Cook, Jr.). Even the minor characters are indelibly etched, with great performances by Lee Patrick, Jerome Cowan, Barton Maclaine, and Ward Bond.We follow Spade, as he journeys deeper and deeper into a web of deception, hunting for the statue and investigating his partner's murder, while becoming romantically involved with O'Shaughnessy. The film never loses momentum, and the climax has the kind of irony that became a John Huston trademark!'The Maltese Falcon' is a tale that never gets old, and if you have never seen it, check it out! It truly is "the stuff that dreams are made of".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Maltese Falcon" would be nothing without the muscular, cynical, and very entertaining lead performance from Humphrey Bogart. Well, 'nothing' maybe a bit of an overstatement- the film is inventive and interesting otherwise but Bogart's performance makes the film. This film established his career, helping him escape the dozens of cheap crime films he was in prior to this film. It's easy to see why audiences were impressed with his charismatic portrayal of no-nonsense tough guy Sam Spade. I wasn't overly impressed with Mary Astor's performance in the film; she wasn't a compelling love interest and failed to live up to the script's strong characterization. Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, however, completely make up for Astor's performance.This film was John Huston's debut film, and it doesn't really feel like a debut film. It's quite accomplished, actually. The film is heavily stylized, perhaps more than any other film before it. It is also unflinching in its moral ambiguity (it was named the first film in the 'film-noir' genre by French critic Nino Frank, though I think other films qualify such as Howard Hawks' "Scarface") portraying harsh, cruel, cold individuals. Sam Spade is a realistic character, stylized perhaps, but realistic. He is not the perfect John Wayne all-American hero; he is harsh, cold, and even capable of murder. When his partner is killed Spade does not feel much of anything, reacting indifferently to the death and even kissing his widow during their first meeting after he hears the news. John Huston wanted this film to be more character-based and less plot-based than the two previous adaptations of the novel (which he called 'wretched pictures'). The care taken to provide good characterization in the script is clear to the audience. Indeed, "The Maltese Falcon" has a fairly complicated plot and it's easy to understand how a film can get bogged down in the plot and fail to entertain the audience or even tell a good story. Huston made a wise choice in reducing the plot to the background and focusing on the characters and dialogue.Huston also pays close attention to visual composition of shots, painstakingly recreating the sleazy underbelly of San Francisco. San Francisco is traditionally used in film as a romantic setting, and it is remarkable how drastically different Huston's portrayal of the city is from the norm and how effective it is. Huston, after writing the very fun and smart script, storyboarded every scene in the film and the attention to detail is clear to those viewing the film. Often such meticulous planning carries over to the screen and interrupts the dramatic flow, but not in this case. The film flows exceptionally well and feels much shorter than its 100 minute running time. The result of all the care that went into the film is, by all accounts, excellent entertainment. It's smart, stylish, generally well-acted, and always captivating. "The Maltese Falcon" is surely one of the most promising debut films in history, promise and potential which Huston most certainly delivered on later in his career.****/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mystical Narrator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.There are films which shuffle the vocabulary of past films, and then there are the few films which add to that vocabulary. This is one such, and all the more remarkable because it was Huston's first.His vision was shocking and established a new genre. The conventional filmmaking skills are pretty poor on this. The photography is soso, the editing poor, the women's acting atrocious. But the manipulation of the narrative in this way was new to film.Until this point in Hollywood product, the camera was the surrogate of the theater audience-goer. You could trust it. The convention was that you (the camera) would know more than the characters you see. And everything would make sense.Here, some new things are introduced:-- the world is against the characters; everyone's life is bleak; no happy ending is in sightMany people think this defines noir. (Later, the photography would be bleak as well.) but there is another innovation here:-- the world is against you the viewer to the same extent as the characters. You get no special breaks.This was a big deal. The same year, Orson Welles would break the position of the camera. No longer would it be bound to where a human would be naturally placed. But here, the very soul of the viewer was compromised: you are swept up in the rules of the created world.That created world itself wasn't so novel to the book writers, but the notion of a mystery gave a special scaffold. The whole game there is to establish a detective in the world. Then there is a game among you, the detective and the author to see who can outguess whom. It was a great invention in narrative.Here, you still have three players, all trying to trick one another, but the author gets in the first trick -- declaring that you do not have the safety of your seat, your perspective, your own world: you have to live in the created world, the same as Spade.The Malta business was built into the book to add some notion of the ancient supernatural as an excuse to disrupt the reader. They got it all historically wrong (they meant the Knights Templar, the same folks who hid Indiana Jones' ark), and in any case glossed over that element in the translation from book to film. I think Huston was smart enough to know what he was doing. I don't think the actors were. Fortunately, Bogart was effectively mean. But for my money Sidney Greenstreet is the genius here. He is the one around whom this noir world is created, so with Huston can be considered the co-inventors of the genre.As with Huston, this was Greenstreet's first film. Imagine that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Detachment as Aura...and the way they talk!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon (1941)What makes Bogart so cool? And what makes The Maltese Falcon with its ludicrous plot and foamcore characters so untouchable? Three things, in, uh, spades: pace, script, and archetype. All of these make for a stylized film--no gritty realism, no method acting, no penetration. No social commentary. No innovation. Nothing really but a beautiful sprint that leaves you breathless, but not tired. The film is about style, and coolness (not to be mistaken for hipness--cool as in chilled, unflappable). It has aura, and clever detachment. Even the characters are detached. They are pulled by the events but never, except when the fat man gets out his pocket knife at the end, swept away. One by one, these really great actors get to sharpen the edges of their two- dimensional selves, and it's really amazing to watch.This is John Huston's first film, and like that little first film by Orson Welles released just six months earlier, it has a scary mastery to it. But if Huston, like Welles, rode the talents of many studio professionals at their peak, he pulled the film away from cinematic excess into what almost feels almost like a fast, and highly distilled, adaptation of a theater production. (It's based, of course, on the detective novel by Dashiell Hammett.) The movie talks a lot because there isn't much to show--nothing physical really happens beyond a couple of fisticuffs--but such talk! When Sydney Greenstreet as Kasper Gutman first meets Bogart's Sam Spade and they share a drink, sit, and light up cigars, Greenstreet (also in his first film) bobs and feints through some fabulous wordplay, ending, with the camera low to make his size only larger: "I'll tell you right out, I'm a man who likes talking to a man who likes to talk."Bogart says, "Swell," and he talks without giving an inch. He really is "cool" in that way Bogart, through most of his movie roles, still defines for us decades later. Huston must have felt the transcendent power of the still rising star (Casablanca was still a year away) because, ultimately, the film is a vehicle for Bogart being Bogart, in the face of three or four counterparts who are each at their archetypal best. And gosh, Bogie sure knows how to take a gun away from hapless bodyguard played by Elisha Cook, Jr.The film is no empty exercise in expertise. It creates a fictional world we can understand top to bottom because it's so simple. We enjoy all the principals so much, we happily tag along on the unfolding trail of this improbable "black bird" and its sudden arrival toward the end for the sake of soaking up the characters, as characters. And look how even Bogart at one point looks jittery compared to Greenstreet, whose ponderous ease and guffaws in the face of trauma won him an Oscar nomination. Peter Lorre, plausibly uncertain and almost tender (and who's to say whether homosexual, too, in an wan, period stereotype) in his attempt at badness, is a marvel, someone you talk about later, someone who can parody himself in Capra's 1944 Arsenic and Old Lace (which shares a screenwriter with another Lorre film, Casablanca).Spade's cynicism, his wariness, his occasional up-and-up certitude (he gives the money back!), and his willingness to laugh at it all, above all, overcome weakness like his so-called romance with the Mary Astor femme fatale. The end actually falls a little flat because we don't believe in their love, but we're not sure he did either. And did we ever believe her? In fact, isn't that part of the trick here, not believing anyone, ever?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cant say much for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i wont say it was an awful movie, but i was not terribly impressed. i guess the story was kinda cool with Spade being a somewhat crooked private detective, if you give him enough money he'll really do anything. it was a fairly fast paced movie, but that definitely does not mean it was exciting. there was a whole lot of word games, some of which became a little too confusing for me at points, you really have to be paying your full attention to keep pace with some of the conversations. as for the photography, i thought it was really pretty good. the use of light was pretty clever in a few different shots. there was also one pretty darn long take at one point, very subtle though. as the rating reflects i didn't like the film as much as most people, but to each their own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bogart made this film watchable. The rest of the cast acted well in it too though and and some of the dialogue is superb. However, upon viewing the film, I discovered that the story itself lacked any real zest or spark that could keep my interest. I had referred to the high rating on this website and the 5* rating Empire (film magazine) had given the film when it came to making my purchase, but needless to say I was very disappointed.After much double crossing amongst the ensemble cast, the movie lets us know the movies main concerns - the whereabouts of the Maltese Falcon and who killed Miles Archer. By this time, however, I had lost interest in the film considerably and I was neither surprised to discover who had killed Mr Archer nor did I care for the character who had. Also, the fact that the Maltese Falcon itself doesn't turn up in the end made the main resolution of the film redundant, futile and again highly predictable. So to conclude, I wouldn't call this movie good nor would I recommend you watch it. And the only reason it got 4/10 (2*) as oppose to 2/10(1*) is because of the intense and often intriguing performance of Humphrey Bogart as Samuel Spade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absorbing and worthy suspense film about blackmails , killings , corruption and strong intrigue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one of the all-time grand films , a classic Noir Film with gritty interpretation , atmospheric settings and powerhouse filmmaking , at John Huston's first effort directorial . This is a story as explosive as his blazing automatics . Womanizer Sam Sapade is a two-fisted and cynical private detective operating in the big city . When his secretary tells him the new customer (Mary Astor) waiting outside his office is a knockout, he wastes no time before seeing her. It turns out she's a knockout with money. And she wants to spend it on his services as a private detective . This lovely dame with dangerous lies employs the services of the notorious private detective . She has some story about wanting to protect her sister. Neither he nor his partner, Miles Archer, believes it. But with the money she's paying, who cares? The job proves to be more dangerous than either of them expected. It involves not just the lovely dame with the dangerous lies, but also the sweaty Casper Gutman (Sidney Greenstreet) , the fey Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) , and the thuggish young Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr) . Three crooks, and all of them are looking for the statuette of a black bird they call the Maltese Falcon . Spade is quickly caught up in the mystery and intrigue of a statuette known as the Maltese Falcon . As Sam fights to get hold of a black bird ¨the stuff that dreams are made¨ (a line suggested by Humphrey Bogart was voted as the #14 movie quote by the American Film Institute) . This first-rate and entertaining picture draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows Dashiell Hammett's book fairly closely otherwise , he also wrote ¨The thin man¨. Twisted film Noir about murders , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the novel ¨The Maltese Falcon¨¨and screen-written by the same Huston . Frustrated at seeing his script for Juárez (1939) rewritten by Paul Muni, the film's star, John Huston vowed that from then on he would direct his own screenplays and therefore not have to see them get meddled with. He was fortunate in that he had a staunch ally in the form of producer Henry Blanke who was happy to fulfill Huston's wish. Word-for-word and scene-for-scene virtually the same as the original novel. It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail .The climactic confrontation scene lasts nearly 20 minutes, one-fifth of the entire running time of the film. It involves all five principal characters, and filming required over one full week . Here Bogart is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the tough-talking P.I. Although George Raft was originally cast as Sam Spade , he allegedly turned it down because it was "not an important picture," taking advantage of a clause in his contract that said he did not have to work on remakes . For decades this film could not be legally shown on US television stations because of its underlying suggestions of "illicit" sexual activity among the characters (i.e., O'Shaughnessy's promiscuity, indications that Joel Cairo was a homosexual). Much of the movie is filmed over Humphrey Bogart's shoulder so that the audience can be in on his point of view. His scenes with Mary Astor are awesome and at their best compared to those he subsequently shared with Lauren Bacall in ¨Dark passage¨ , ¨Key Largo¨ , ¨The big sleep¨ and ¨To have and to have not¨ . The couple Bogart-Astor throws in enough sparks to ignite several lighters . This was the first pairing of cynical Humphrey Bogart and Femme Fatale Mary Astor . Mary Astor's off-screen notoriety was instrumental in her casting , she had been in several scandals concerning affairs she had been involved in during her marriage. And she was having an affair with John Huston during the making of the film. Magnificent support cast , here was the first pairing of Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, who would go on to make nine more movies together. Exciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by Arthur Edeson and magnificent musical score by the classic Adolph Deutsch . And also shown in horrible computer-colored version . The motion picture was masterfully directed by John Huston ; filming was completed in two months at a cost of less than $300,000. A former version in 1931 by Roy Del Ruth , it was also pretty good starred by Bebe Daniels as Ruth Wonderly , Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade , Dudley Digges as Casper Gutman and Una Merkel as Effie Perine . In fact , Warner Bros. planned to change the name of the film to "The Gent from Frisco" because the novel's title had already been used for this The Maltese Falcon (1931) , the studio eventually agreed to keep the original title at John Huston's insistence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 103The Maltese Falcon is one of the most famous film noirs, the film that made Humphrey Bogart a star, and an American classic.I have no idea why. Collectively, the Maltese Falcon is not an interesting movie and I frequently found myself trying to stop from nodding off. The story is not interesting: we don't like Miles, so we don't care that he's killed. That short scene with him dying was particularly bad. Miles stands, smiling with a goofy expression at the camera when a gun in first person shoots him, and he doesn't react until he's shot. It's cheesy, and the scene is poor overall. So we never care to learn who killed him. The whole plot is just silly, actually. Sam Spade tries to find a statue with a woman and a couple of bad Bond villains. There's little tension, action, or suspense in the entire movie. It seems the story simply progresses towards a finale that just... happens. Several things are poorly explained, so poorly that I don't know who is responsible for 2 of the murders, why a boat burns, or how Sam acquires a certain package.Speaking of Sam, his acting is one of the few highlights. Not his character though. Humphrey Bogart delivers as the snide main character, but I didn't like him, except for his action at the very end. He's just not a good guy.Another problem is Mary Astor. I learnt, post-viewing, of her wild private life. I wouldn't have known it by seeing the film. She's not a very good liar character, I feel she was horribly miscast. She doesn't have any edge, and she and Bogart have no chemistry.The three villains are similar. None of them are intimidating, except the boy, but he's too stupid or hot-tempered to be dangerous. The other two are just silly.The Maltese Falcon didn't live up to the hype I had for it. It wasn't interesting and had little payoff. In my opinion, it is undeserving of the praises it has received. 7.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon is about a detective who solves the crime of his partner's murder by dogged determination.The main plot is the solving of the crime (which ends in success), with a minor love interest subplot that ends in failure (the detective gives up the love interest after discovering she committed the murder).As a story The Maltese Falcon largely flatlines.The main plot moves from discovery to discovery but the turning points feel arbitrary and not meaningful. As the story unfolds, the detective unravels the back story of what the treasure is and how it got here. But the back story's revelation doesn't create much meaning for us or the protagonist as it mainly involves the secondary characters while our main character remains immovable and static. The main character untangles the sordid histories of these secondary characters to solve the crime, but we are left with a feeling of so what? In the end we get two somewhat moral triumphs: one, the detective solves the crime of his partner's murder despite the police messing up their investigation. But this moral victory feels empty since he and his dead partner's wife are lovers, which throws him off the moral high horse. The second is that he gives up his feelings for O'Shaughnessy and sends her to prison because he finds out she turns out to be the murderer. This moral dilemma also feels empty because: A) so he cheated on his dead partner's wife who was his lover to be with this new lover and then gives her up, how is that a moral victory? and B) The two of them only have 2 or 3 turning points to develop their relationship and their love doesn't have much to stand on.So the story is reduced to rely almost exclusively on a classic who dunnit throughline with some great actors who are unfortunately trying to breath life into empty cardboard box of characters. In other words, a big waste of time.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film-Noir, mysterious and interesting, but fails to deliver a solid climax.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese FalconSam Space is a private detective, one day a mysterious woman comes to see her, she wants a man shadowed. Sam's partner does the job and gets killed, by who, is unknown. While investigating the murder he finds himself getting involved with dangerous men, seeking the myth of a Maltese Falcon statue, so valueable, they're willing to do anything it takes to get it.This movie is most of the way a real original film-noir, where our head character and supposed good guy finds himself getting involved in something larger and more dangerous than he should be able to handle. Although whether Humprey Bogart is playing that good a guy in his character, Sam Spade, can be discussed, Sam Spade is portrayed as a sort of egocentric partly greedy man, who is obviously supposed to be our hero, but on his journey we see greedy and often cynic and egocentric sides of him. The strength of this movie is the constant curiousity we have for how the story will unfold, there is always a mysterious look for the story, and it feels interesting because it is this detective story where we are participating in slowly unfolding the mystery. However, the movie has quite a few plot holes, and the many fast paced match cuts doesn't give us much time to think deeper into what's happening, everything is really going too fast, something that also means the atmosphere in the movie feels pretty non existant and my interest were never gathered 100%. The acting in the movie is actually quite great, especially for this old a movie. In older movies I often think that the acting seems to many of the actors to be awkvard, but not in this movie, in this movie it's quite convincing, despite a few flaws, flaws though that is a part of giving this movie the charming oldies feel.To sum it all up a bit. The movie, despite having quite a number of flaws, is overall an interesting experience, that will leave you guessing and hold your interest for most of the time, even though it has its drop downs, it's still a pretty well done mystery story, following the classic film-noir model much of the way. However despite having a good story, that unfolds good, but too fast, the movie never really managed to impress me with the climax, actually i felt the climax never reached the heights it should have. Something that leaves an overall less convincing opinion upon the movie, especially a murdery story like this, which is highly dependant on a good climax.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Private Conversations Have Not Been Such That I Am Anxious To Continue Them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Spade and Miles Archer run a private detective agency in San Francisco, and are hired by a Miss Wonderly to find her sister, who has eloped with a man named Thursby. That night both Miles and Thursby are shot in separate incidents, Wonderly disappears and Sam is the police's chief suspect for both murders. Who killed them, and why ?Like only a handful of other movies, it's hard to overestimate The Maltese Falcon's huge influence on the crime genre in specific and cinema in general. Of course there are films which preceded it about private eyes, slippery femme fatales, shifty suspects and twisting plot lines. It's not even the original screen adaptation of Dashiel Hammett's classic 1930 novel (Roy Del Ruth first filmed it in 1931, and it was remade again in 1936 as Satan Met A Lady). This version however combines an astonishingly assured performance by Bogart with an outstanding supporting cast, a brilliant head-scratching script by Huston and superb direction to create perhaps the definitive crime picture, and paved the way for many memorable film noir and gangster classics to follow. It's also important to note the small scale of the film - Bogart and Huston were well respected as a supporting actor and writer respectively, but it was Huston's debut as a director (arguably one of the best ever) and it made Bogart a huge star and cemented his reputation as a hard-boiled tough guy. The screenplay is very faithful to Hammett's riveting book, with only minimal abridging for such a deliciously deceiving story, and as with all the best crime fiction it's really all about the people, and what drives their darker personas. Bogart plays a fabulous thin line between good guy, world-weary cynic and dangerous bluffer as he plays off everyone out to chisel him, on both sides of the law. He is aided by one of the most memorable support casts I've ever come across; Astor is sensational as the serial liar/lover who's constructed so many false identities she's not sure of anything anymore, Lorre is superb as the dapper Levantine Mr Joel Cairo, all perfumed accessories and aloof mannerisms, Greenstreet is unforgettable as the corpulently wily Kasper Gutman ("By Gad sir, you are a character."), and arguably best of all is Cook as the psychotic gunsel Wilmer, who seems constantly poised to explode but instead suffers every indignity at the hands of Spade. The players bring Hammett's rich and strange characters to vivid life with such craft and intensity it's almost impossible to imagine anybody else portraying them. The rumpled detective has become such a staple of books and movies it's easy to forget its origins, but Bogart here will always be the definitive private eye. Crisply photographed by Arthur Edeson (who also shot Frankenstein and Casablanca), this is an unmissable forties classic and one of Huston's best movies. It's also a truly amazing book you must read, although in my view two of Hammett's other novels, Red Harvest and The Glass Key, are equally sensational. Trivia - the one-shot-no-lines-die-on-the-sofa scene-stealing character of Captain Jacoby is played by the great Walter Huston, the director's father.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The stuff that dreams are made of"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the movies we not only love but treasure, "The Maltese Falcon" stands as one of those films. Consider what was true after its release in 1941 and was not true before:(1) The movie defined Humphrey Bogart's performances for the rest of his life; his hard-boiled Sam Spade rescued him from a decade of middling roles in B gangster movies and positioned him for "Casablanca," "Treasure of the Sierra Madre," "The African Queen" and his other classics. (2) It was the first film directed by John Huston, who for more than 40 years would be a prolific maker of movies that were muscular, stylish and daring. (3) It contained the first screen appearance of Sydney Greenstreet, who went on, in "Casablanca" and many other films, to become one of the most striking character actors in movie history. (4) It was the first pairing of Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, and so well did they work together that they made nine other movies, including "Casablanca" in 1942 and "The Mask of Dimitrios" (1944), in which they were not supporting actors but actually the stars. (5) And some film histories consider "The Maltese Falcon" the first film noir.The moment that sticks out for me comes near the end, when Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) has been collared for murdering Spade's partner. She says she loves Spade. She asks if Sam loves her. She pleads for him to spare her from the law. And he replies, in a speech some people can quote by heart, "I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck. . . . The chances are you'll get off with life. That means if you're a good girl, you'll be out in 20 years. I'll be waiting for you. If they hang you, I'll always remember you."Spade is cold and hard, like his name. When he gets the news that his partner has been murdered, he doesn't blink an eye. Didn't like the guy. Kisses his widow the moment they're alone together. Beats up Joel Cairo (Lorre), loses patience with Greenstreet, throws his cigar into the fire, smashes his glass, barks out a threat, slams the door and then grins to himself in the hallway, amused by his own act.If he didn't like his partner, Spade nevertheless observes a sort of code involving his death. "When a man's partner is killed," he tells Brigid, "he's supposed to do something about it." He doesn't like the cops, either; the only person he really seems to like is his secretary, Effie (Lee Patrick), who sits on his desk, lights his cigarettes, knows his sins and accepts them. How does Bogart make a character get away with making such a dark guy the hero of a film? Because he does his job according to the rules he lives by, and because we sense (as we always would with Bogart after this role) that the toughness conceals old wounds and broken dreams.The plot is the last thing you think of about. The Maltese Falcon is a black bird (said to be made of gold and encrusted with jewels) has been stolen, men have been killed for it, and now Gutman (Greenstreet) has arrived with his lackeys (Lorre and Elisha Cook Jr.) to get it back. Spade gets involved because the Mary Astor character hires him to--but the plot goes around and around, and eventually we realize that the black bird is an example of Hitchcock's "MacGuffin"--it doesn't matter what it is, so long as everyone in the story wants or fears it.To describe the plot in a linear and logical fashion is almost impossible. That doesn't matter. The movie is essentially a series of conversations punctuated by brief, violent interludes. It's all style. It isn't violence or chases, but the way the actors look, move, speak and embody their characters. Under the style is attitude: Hard men, in a hard season, in a society emerging from Depression and heading for war, are motivated by greed and capable of murder. For an hourly fee, Sam Spade will negotiate this terrain. Everything there is to know about Sam Spade is contained in the scene where Bridget asks for his help and he criticizes her performance: "You're good. It's chiefly your eyes, I think--and that throb you get in your voice when you say things like, 'be generous, Mr. Spade.'"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Statuette To Die For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Maltese Falcon" is the unforgettable, groundbreaking crime drama which is regarded by many as the first film noir of the classic period. Its significance in Hollywood history is enormous as it provided John Huston with his directorial debut and Humphrey Bogart with the role which made him into a major star. Huston's screenplay famously remained very faithful to the style of dialogue used in Dashiell Hammett's book and in so doing provided some wonderfully economic and incisive lines, particularly for Bogart's character.Bogart's role also had a broader significance because as Sam Spade, he brought to the screen a new type of hard boiled detective who was destined to become the template for a whole succession of others who would appear in numerous films noirs particularly in the 1940s and 1950s. These men would be morally ambiguous , fast talking tough guys who had a cynical attitude to the world and who lived by their own set of principles.Sam Spade is no one's idea of nice guy. He keeps his emotions armour plated and when his business partner is suddenly murdered shows no concern of any sort. He had also been having an affair with his partner's wife but in his dealings with her, he also seems rather cold and offhand. Despite these characteristics and his obviously jaundiced attitude to life and people, his character is redeemed to some extent by a subtle quality which Bogart's innate charisma brings to the part.In "The Maltese Falcon" Spade is hired by a Miss Wonderley (Mary Astor) to find her sister. This job leads to the death of his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) and shortly after, to the murder of the alleged seducer of Miss Wonderley's sister. Miss Wonderley then contacts Spade and tells him that her real name is Brigid O'Shaughnessy and that the story about her sister had been as false as the name she'd given him and she then pays him to find out who was responsible for the two murders.Spade's subsequent investigations bring him into contact with Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), the "Fat Man" Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) and his henchman Wilmer (Elisha Cook Jnr.) and it becomes apparent that they are all on a ruthless quest to locate the priceless statuette called "The Maltese Falcon". Furthermore, he discovers that O'Shaughnessy's earlier subterfuge had been linked to the fact that she also had been trying to find the "Falcon". Spade eventually identifies the murderer and informs the police who go on to arrest the culprit.Brigid O'Shaughnessy had acted naive, timid and vulnerable when she had first encountered Spade but his natural scepticism prevented him from being taken in by her. Joel Cairo was a small, nervy, effeminate man and Wlmer was generally a silent presence during Spade's conversations with the "Fat Man". Gutman was sophisticated, good humoured and friendly on the surface but was also extremely dangerous and untrustworthy. He also delivers some amusing and eccentric lines such as when speaking to Spade he says "Now Sir, we'll talk if you like and I'll tell you right out that I'm a man who likes talking to a man that likes to talk".Bogart and Huston worked well together and went on to collaborate on other major successes such as "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948), "Key Largo" (1948) and "The African Queen" (1951). "The Maltese Falcon" was also a great box office success, was well received by the critics and was also nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Sydney Greenstreet) and Best Adapted Screenplay (John Huston).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it's just brilliant cinema is all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Spade, a tough private detective gets involved in a murderous hunt for The Maltese Falcon, a legendary statuette thought to contain diamonds.What can I possibly say that hasn't been said, written and studied by the greatest film critics and industry members, about The Maltese Falcon before? Well nothing by way of new stuff or a differing slant on the plot, I can merely concur and hopefully jolt prospective first time viewers into believing the reputation afforded this stunning piece of cinema.First off I have to let it be known that The Maltese Falcon is far from being my favourite Bogart movie, in fact it's not even my favourite Bogart movie from 1941, it's well trumped in my affections by High Sierra, but few films ever get as close to being perfect as the Maltese Falcon clearly is. The source from Dashiell Hammett is first rate, yet it took someone like John Huston (director and screenwriter) to bring it triumphantly together. It had been adapted for the screen twice before with less than favourable results, but Huston, working tightly from Hammett's dialogue driven astuteness, molds a claustrophobic, shadowy classic amongst classics, that in the process laid the cornerstone for what became known as essential film noir.You will search in vain for faults here, every scene is as tight as a Duck's bottom, not one filler scene is in this picture. The cast are across the board perfect in performances, Bogart (Spade) is peerless, Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet (film debut) and Elisha Cook Jr. stand out, but every other member of this cast add something good to this picture. The plot (of which I'm "so" not going to summarise for you) is complex to a degree, but really it all makes sense, you do not need to be Albert Einstein to knit the twisters nicely together. Also don't be fooled into thinking this is a film devoid of humour either, it has deadly wry smirks popping up all over the place, OK ,so they may be the sort of smirks brought about by devilish unease of admiration, but rest assured they are valid and integral to The Maltese Falcon's classic standing.I could go on fawning but I really don't need too, the Academy may well have saw fit to not award this picture any awards for 1941, but time is an immeasurable force sometimes, and time now shows that The Maltese Falcon stands proud as not only a Titan of cinematic entertainment, but also of technical movie brilliance. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film noir - but more holes than a Swiss cheese.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Private "dick" Sam Spade loses his partner to murder and finds himself surrounded by dubious characters searching for a precious antique.So much has been written about this film that it seems churlish and obvious to start repeating and paraphrasing. Certainly it delivers lightweight thrills, set pieces and sharp one-liners as well as any low budget film and is almost a template for the thousand laconic private-eye movies (serious and otherwise) that followed.It also set Humphrey Bogart on the road to being the ultimate (film) private detective: A wonderful invention in that they can be both criminal and policeman as convenience dictates. However, at the risk of seeming negative too soon, there is plenty of things wrong with this movie, most notably the one-dimensional back-of-a-cigarette-packet plot. Where is the suspense when pointing a gun at our hero makes no difference to his demeanour? Do we really believe that the villains will outwit Spade and actually carry off their quarry? Or that Spade will fall for the lame excuses and explanations given in the movie?Bogart is one of those actors that tries not to gesture or even blink. Variety comes by way of talking in double time or wisecracking. It really reminds me of what Robert De Niro said about acting "people don't show emotions - they try to hide them." The death of his partner (one of the driving points of this movie) doesn't seem to upset him too much, his first thoughts are about removing his name from the door! However, despite his lack of height or conventional good looks, the camera loves him and that is all that matters. He is cooler than a snowman in a North Pole blizzard.Lorre and Greenstreet are rolled in almost like a comedy double act, with all the menace of second-hand car salesmen (however many guns they pull out). We know that cheats don't prosper in this Warner Brothers film noir world, but they obviously haven't read the rules. They still seem to enjoy their moment of being "king of the castle" and chew the furniture to order, but these people are clearly not in our hero's league.While highly enjoyable, the Maltese Falcon hardly takes cinema to new levels. If Bogart had not made this movie, but everything else had stayed the same, it would be a totally forgotten work - like the prior version of this same film.Arm Bogie with a few one-liners, dress him in a dirty raincoat and plonk him on those cheap hardboard-and-smoke Warner Brothers sets and you have solid gold. You just can't go wrong. We will never see his like again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This website has ranked this film 69th out of the top 250 films ever made, and AFI has put this movie in the top 100 American films ever made!! Such accolades are thoroughly justified, mostly on account of the fact that the innovative plot that this film purveys, simply astounds the movie audience!! Humphry Bogart is sensational in this flick.. his classic line of "This is the stuff dreams are made out of" is one of the classic lines of any movie made period!! The whole film is about a lot of dialog which encompasses the art of conversation through conniving chicanery and negotiations with the sordid underworld!! (Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre) There is an underlying premise of greed and undaunted avariciousness, not to mention, a widespread ego maniacal obsession with everyone about winning the prize!! Everyone wants to best everyone else... Mary Astor (Chicago Society) is remarkable in this film... Her feminine wiles camouflage her ulterior motives... Taking place in San Francisco, this film evokes a camaraderie with ancient Eastern World artifacts of irreplaceable value... Straddling both sides of the fence seems to be the prerequisite that makes one single individual emerge victorious throughout this entire film..Guess Who? Watch the movie to find out!! This movie is superb, and it exemplifies the term "Classic" when it comes to the all time movies in the cinematic history of fine film making!! I give it five stars and so does virtually anybody else who has seen this movie!! THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Influential but overrated; novel much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Bogart's performance is classic, and Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet are terrific -- they usually are. But the film suffers from the production code of the day; Hammett's novel holds up, and the sexual politics of it wasn't allowed to be transferred to the screen (although it could have with better writing -- Casablanca has a lot of dark sex jokes).The biggest problem with the film is Mary Astor. I don't find her attractive and her performance is mannered and oft putting -- which is a disaster for a femme fatale. In the novel, the character comes across as much prettier and smarter, and the sexual relationship with Spade makes her much more devious; it also makes the love talk at the end and Spade's rejection of Brigid logical. In the film, when this conversation starts, one is left wondering, "What?" These two have barely been on screen together and now there's talk of true love?One part near the end illustrates the problem with the story as filmed: In the book, when Gutman claims a thousand dollar bill is missing, Spade makes Brigid get naked in the bathroom as he inspects her and her clothes to see if she took it. Brigid protests, but is not modest, and Gutman is surprised that Spade would do this. This scene reinforces Spade's cold demeanor, the sexual relationship between Brigid and Spade, and impresses Gutman with Spade's icy thoroughness. As filmed, Brigid just makes a silent, knowing nod of No, and that's that. The Hayes Code eradicated a key scene, and the writing didn't attempt to find a way to make up for this loss.If Brigid had been played by a smarter, more seductive actress and the sexual relationship between her and Spade been alluded to, then the dark motivations of the story and Spade's character would be fully realized. As it is, it's a well cast movie (but nearly destroyed by one casting flub, Astor) and influential in terms of character, pace, and camera choices. It may have been the first noir, but that alone doesn't make it a classic. As it is, watching it is more history than enjoyment, while the novel still holds up as well written detective fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the greatest movies ever made, why? Everything was about strategy, strategy which ultimately led to successfully walking away with the trophy (in a manner of speaking). Ultimately, everything turned out to be a false alarm, and it's back to the drawing board!! Seems as though this whole fiasco accomplished one thing however, it did serve as a tremendous test for everybody's morals, or, shall I say, the lack of them. You'll have to watch the movie to know what I am talking about!! This website ranks "Maltese Falcon" the 73rd best picture ever made. AFI (American Film Institute) rates "Maltese Falcon" 34th best American movie ever to be produced. Finally, the famous quote from "Maltese Falcon" "This is the stuff that dreams are made out of" is ranked the 14th most famous quote from any film made whatsoever!! What is so remarkable about this film is that it immediately establishes ground rules. These ground rules vicariously and unabashedly obviated all caitiff behavior for everybody involved! For purposes of survival, these wry mannerisms are instantaneously detected, and dealt with accordingly. The art of masquerading pretenses gets metaphorically and emphatically defenestrated with this film. Humphry Bogart (Who was on the head of the list as a desirable selection for numerous detective roles, and hence, Bogart was concurrently chosen with the advent of the "film noir") is absolutely sensational in this movie. His mercurial disposition establishes the premises which harbor his formidable awareness, this becomes his principle component for nourishing his yearning for survival. His chicanery is essential in terms of dealing with his predatory and nefarious adversaries. The disconcerting genre to "Maltese Falcon" cultivates an intrepid set of circumstances which makes the plot to this film plausibly entertaining. Interaction was predicated on going under the guise of a sordid collusion, as well as the clarification of euphemistic phraseology. The writing in the movie "Maltese Falcon" was very unique to the cinema in 1941!! Mary Astor plays the role of the spawn of a plutocratic offspring. Her inherent megalomaniac's nature seemingly accommodates her extra curricular activity of lying, it is just too bad that she is amongst a bevy of professional liars. These professional liars are boxed into a precarious situation whereby they must now tell the truth- This creates a very interesting paradigm!! The visceral affection between Astor and Bogart articulates both characters' struggle with a tenacious and lethal monotony. Sydney Greenstreet is virulently scruple-less beyond belief!! Peter Lorre and Elisha Cook are discarded in one way or the other, and, they become the newly ostracized guinea pigs for purposes of pecuniary expediency. It becomes a proverbial case of who is fit and trim for emerging victorious in an onslaught of sophisticated and conniving emotional game plans!! All film critics rate "Maltese Falcon" to be one of the most fascinating and well produced American films to ever hit the silver screen, I concur!! The plethora of prime quality acting performances in "Maltese Falcon" utterly astounds me!! Hal B Wallis is the executive producer of this movie (He is best known for "Casablanca"). John Huston directs this film, he is nationally renowned for other greats such as "Treasures of Sierra Madre" , "Key Largo", "African Queen" and copious others!! Huston also made an appearance in the all-time movie classic "Chinatown". The aggregate summation of this movie is that it possesses top notch talent from head to toe!! If you have not seen "Maltese Falcon", please make it a point to do so.... I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!!!! THE FILM "MALTESE FALCON" IS A TOTALLY MARVELOUS MOVIE!! PLEASE SEE THIS FILM!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt like I'd seen 'The Maltese Falcon' before, probably because as these things go it's pretty standard. A few dry quips, rapid fallings-in-love, double crosses, and characters pinging from hotel room to hotel room explaining the plot to each other while with every round of exposition it becomes less and less clear who did what to whom and why.I mean, it's fine but nothing special. It's worth watching for Humphrey Bogart, who is, as always, a magnetic screen presence, not the greatest actor in the world but a proper Movie Star. The highlight of the film for me, however, is the performance of Sydney Greenstreet, with his entertaining line in affable menace and a squeaky giggle that really tickled me.Solid stuff but nothing that really grabbed me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Maltese Falcon" is a crime movie in which we watch a private detective takes on a case that involves him with three weird criminals who want to find a very precious statuette. In this quest everybody wants to find this statuette because it is very precious and they will earn plenty of money from this.I liked this movie because it has very nice plot and many twists on it and this is something that makes this movie really good and interesting. I also liked this movie because of the direction which made by John Huston but also fro the interpretations of the cast. It has to be mentioned the great interpretation for one more time of Humphrey Bogart who played as the detective Samuel Spade and Mary Astor's who played as Brigid O'Shaughnessy. Another one interpretation that I really liked was the interpretation of Sydney Greenstreet who played as Kasper Gutman and in my opinion he was really good at it.Finally I have to say that "The Maltese Falcon" is an interesting movie to watch and the thing that makes it so interesting and unique is the really well written plot. This movie wants to show us that you can spend plenty of the time of your life searching for something and in the end it will not matter the result. The only thing that it matters it will be the searching of it and the fight that you did in order to succeed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Brain-Popping Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that require more than one watch to fully enjoy or understand. The Matrix and Inception are two great examples of this. I still know some people that have seen Inception many times and still don't fully get it. 1941's Maltese Flacon was (from what I know) the first movie to ever do this. A seemingly regular murder leads to another which leads to a quest for a little statue of a bird. How that happens requires many watches. What I like about these kinds of thrillers and mysteries is that I feel really good about myself and smart whenever I finally figure out everything that's happening. I may have mentioned The Matrix and Inception earlier, but The Maltese Falcon is less comparable to those two and more to The Usual Suspects and LA Confidential. The Matrix and Inception are sci-fi/action movies that are much better pieces of film, using techniques and special effects that no movies at the time had strength to do. The Usual Suspects and LA Confidential, on the other hand, have just crazy scripts that really screw with your mind. It took me about four watches before fully understanding The Usual Suspects. I'm about half-way getting LA Confidential and almost fully getting The Maltese Flacon. The general premise is detective Sam Spade's (Bogart) partner and a criminal are murdered after being set up by a woman (Astor). More murders and quirky characters are yet to come as the whole thing revolves around a statue of a bird. This is all I can say without giving too much away. Bogart delivers his best role as the film's first cool cop. I honestly find him better than Rick Blaine in Casablanca. What makes this so complex is all of the confusing points are explained so quickly in a weird order. That is clever, as it makes the viewer want to see it again and again. Bogart is such a cool character and the noir feel is awesome, so it is one to see several times even if it was easy to follow.</fullReview>

The story was very unpredictable and had several plot twists that kept my interest in the film. The action was very fast-paced and exciting. The lighting was very dramatic causing sharp shadows and low-lit streets which cause for an eerie and suspenseful style. The visual composition was very well done and the editing was flawless. Though the ending didn't provide all the information or tie up every single loose end, it was still satisfying and mysterious.

		<fullReview>Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and Miles Archer run a private detective agency in San Francisco. The Maltese Falcon is a golden jewel encrusted statue that the Knight Templars of Malta sent to Charles V of Spain in 1539 that was stolen by pirates. Miss Wanderly comes in to hire Sam to help recover her missing sister for $200. She is to meet Floyd Thursby that night with Miles following her. However Miles is shot dead that night and so is Thursby. Sam had been having an affair with Miles' wife Iva (Gladys George) and is a suspect for everybody. Miss Wanderly is actually Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) and she tells Sam that Thursby was her partner coming from HongKong. She begs him for his help but he doesn't trust her. Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), with gardenia scented calling cards, offers to pay $5000 for the Maltese Falcon but also held a gun on him. Sam gathers Brigid and Joel Cairo together. She reveals that the 'Fat Man' is around who turns out to be Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet).The crackling dialog comes fast and furious. It's a tough thing to get all at once. It's a great noir hard-boiled film. The character are hardnosed and classic. It's a complicated story with a lot of exposition to follow. That's its biggest weakness and its most enduring fascination. It's a story where everybody is a liar and nobody reveals the truth easily. Peter Lorre is absolutely devilishly creepy in his memorable role. He is part of what makes this a true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film marked the first successful film that star Humphrey Bogart did for writer,director John Huston. This is a riveting story of a private detective named Sam Spade (played by Bogart) whose partner gets murdered but at first no one even knows who did it. I have not seen a film in that genre from director John Huston since the Hitchcockian film Key Largo. In the end i kind of found it funny when i found that the falcon was priceless when i actually thought it was worth something. There is a lot of top notch performances especially from Humphrey Bogart,Peter Lorre,Sydney Greenstreet (in his film debut),and Mary Astor. Director John Huston's directorial genius aside from the great performances throughout the film is really what made the film absolutely entertaining. For some reason this kind of feels like a picture from Director Alfrred Hitchcock when it was not set up to be directed by him. But i had no problem with Huston's direction and i didn't find a false note anywhere or in any scene of the film.</fullReview>

The most interesting person in the entire film is Mary Astor. Her performance is the most complex but even her own story told by herself becomes a big question mark and is also dull just like everything else. With Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre one would think that they'd be seeing something similar to Casablanca which is far more entertaining that this. But even this trio cannot save this boring film. No, Shadow of a Doubt, Sorry Wrong Number, The Damned Don't Cry and Casablanca are much, much more entertaining than this.

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon, right off the bat, has very interesting technical elements. It has great compositions in its shots, it seems very balanced and clean, which is very different from many of the older movies I have seen before. Everything in the movie seems remarkably composed and tidy. The transitions between scenes are noticeable but not so noticeable that they become jarring and the editing seems well done. The long shots that they did--especially the very first one on the phone--is really interesting and feels new. It also has some amazing photographic moments, notably the scene between Mister Spade and the widow where the light is shining through the blinds onto the wall The acting and character seem so-so to me, though I believe a lot of the reason I have decided that I dislike it is not because of the quality of the acting itself and more that I was not very interested in the movie itself.

		<fullReview>I can attest to that it's a great joy to revisit a classic and be able to testify to its power. This is augmented by the fact that it's the one famous John Huston film I did not like, and I consider Huston the most talented and diverse of his Hollywood generation, he took more risks than anyone, with the possible exception of Hitchcock, but when Huston gambled - Freud, Fat City, Wise Blood - it was not to titillate his audience. We know this as the film that set the ball rolling on noir, a conventional credit, since a long tradition supports it both in film and print, but very much like Kane the previous year, the innovation here is that a large array of cinematic elements is made to coalesce into a confident, polished expression. Huston did not invent film noir, but watching this you get the impression that he might as well have.Now I was not a fan of this before because it lacked the most powerful engine of film noir; the invisible karmic design. It comes not from the Weimar narrative but the American print tradition of hardboiled detectives making the world spin fast enough to reveal itself. No, what this has going for it is something altogether different, either taken wholesale from Hammett or improvised by Huston on the set with this dreamy set of actors. The game is overcooked detective plot mischievously annotated with commentary on the process.Your first clue is the many times that Fat Man refers to Spade as a 'character', like a viewer gleefully amused from his armchair at Bogie's bluster and theatrics in his living-room. Bogie himself plays Spade like an actor performing according to the situation, and he's often seen exiting a scene of dangerous confrontation highly amused at his show.Your second clue is the many times that Spade drops hints of the movie being assembled around him, for instance commenting on the plot that it's 'ridiculous... or thrilling', or 'the lowlier the crook, the gaudier the patter' while he's very much a crook himself and spouting the gaudiest patter throughout the film. You can tell that everyone's having a helluva time playing their part, the effect is that often it feels like we're eavesdropping on a rehearsal; a story has to unfold at face value, while everyone relishes perfecting their trade. This is never more obvious than when the two policemen storm the hideout and everyone chimes in on the ridiculous story Bogie makes up on the spot.Third clue and one that wraps everything together, let's say the totemic object at the center of the ritual, is of course the highly coveted bird. We're told quite openly; the treasure was enameled to obscure it not once but twice, and of course the whole story behind it - involving knights, kings, buccaneers, and spanning centuries - is bogus, Huston's fabrication.So not one but two layers of polish concealing the thing that matters.One is of course the actual plot, a pedestrian, convoluted affair designed to throw off the audience into piecing together improbable clues and stories. Following this thread, you get the trite resolution that the actual bird is back in Istanbul with a Russian general Kemidov. Of course the film is going to seem slight for so much energy spent. Fortunately, this is easy to peel off now.The second layer is that every actor is performing two roles, and you don't know most of the time which one's on top. This is a little harder to keep track of because the camera will not clue you in, you have to closely follow the rehearsal. An example of this is near the end, when Bogie and Astor are taken in by the gang and Bogie for the umpteenth time starts riling up the gunsel - notably the only one in all this who's not an actor and basically this unpleasant stiff we first see, with no hidden dimensions, made to be German presumably so WWII US audiences would cheer at the abuse he suffers at the hands of Spade. The Fat Man presumes that Spade is merely bluffing because he knows they can't kill him so long as he knows where the bird is hidden. We presume this is part of the gaudy patter that buys time, and that Bogie is putting on a show. What is actually going on, is that Spade brings the gunsel to the boiling point where he knows he can knock him off and put his hands on the only gun in the room.So ridiculous detective story plus layered acting by the participants slipping from characters to commentators, all the fun being in following the roles a moment too late, being a step behind, the whole being spun again as the viewer is starting to orientate.And a whole other post should be devoted to the commentary of sizzling sexuality pushed off-screen to sidestep the Code, the shared soul between the three women, that Spade's secretary - a spinster, living with her mother - is in fact the highly deductive/detective mind, the cinematic history the bird maps to - rediscovered in 1923 in Paris and taken to Russia and out again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stuff that dreams are made of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Private detective Humphrey Bogart (Sam) is drawn into a case that involves finding a blackened gold statue of a bird that is covered in jewels - the "Maltese Falcon". He is approached by 3 individuals to help find it - Mary Astor (Miss O'Shaughnessy), Peter Lorre (Mr Cairo) and Sydney Greenstreet (Mr Gutman). These three individuals will stop at nothing to get it and there are also 3 murders that need explaining by the end of the film. Sam needs to piece together what has been happening.The cast are good in this film - except the very annoying pipsqueak that is Elisha Cook Jr, who is usually badly cast as a "heavy". What a joke! Well, he's cast as a "heavy" again in this film although they have given him what sounds like a suitably girlie name - "Wilmer". Everyone else does well with my favourite being Peter Lorre who provides some memorably humorous sequences, eg, his first appearance when he is so doggedly determined to search Bogart's office. Lorre also has an unpredictable edge to his character that is genuinely funny, eg, his declaration that he is tired and wants to go home at an opportunistic occasion and his non-greeting to Bogart one morning in a hotel. His dialogue delivery is inspirational at these moments. However, the dialogue, in general, was spoken quite quickly - it seemed like everyone was using too many words. In fact, you can't afford to let your mind wander at any point or you will lose the plot. A mention must also go to Lee Patrick who plays the secretary "Effie". She was very good in her role and deserved a bit of romancing.The story is good and Bogart is a bit of a ladies' man in this film which is odd coz he's got a weird mouth. Anyway, he knows what he is doing and I wasn't as sharp as Bogey in figuring things out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Noirs Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The noir The Maltese Falcon is directed by John Huston and stars Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor. The film takes place in 1941 San Francisco.The film starts out with a woman (Astor) going to the detective agency Spade and Archer to find out where her sister is located because she has been off with a violent man, Thursby. Later that night Archer is found dead after being shot. Then it is discovered that Thursby has been shot and killed as well. Sam Spade (Bogart) has to find out who killed his partner and what the reason it is that the person has done so. But then someone proposes to him a job where he must find a prized object, the Maltese falcon, for a large sum of money. While searching for this falcon he realizes that this prized object may have a connection to all the murders...The screenplay by John Huston was wonderful, he truly wrote one of the greatest film noirs of all time. The plot has many twists and turns and it is impossible to know which characters to trust and which are the good guys. It kept me wondering the whole time and the conclusion is very satisfying. Huston wrote an iconic character, Sam Spade, who spewed such brilliant dialogue, being that it was had so much wit.Huston's direction for the film was as well great. He set up what a great noir should be to all the noirs that followed. There were many brilliant shots throughout the film, one sequence in particular that comes to mind is when the character Wilmer Cook woke up how each character stared at him going from close up to close up. Along with the great shots Huston got great performances from his whole cast.The acting in this film was terrific. Humphrey Bogart gave a brilliant performance as always, comparable to his performance in Casablanca, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and The African Queen. Bogart spewed all his brilliant dialogue perfectly with such great facial expressions to go along with it. When people talk about great actors Bogart is always mentioned, this film has to be seen to know why. Mary Astor was very good as Brigid O'Shaughnessy, the whole time it was unclear whether or not she could be trusted. Peter Lorre gave a shining performance as Joel Cairo as well, always somewhat nervous yet wanted to be in control even though he never was. All the other supporting performances were fine as well.Overall I give this film an 8/10, usually I am not a fan of the noir genre but I feel this one is very good because of Bogart's fantastic performance and Huston's spectacular script and direction. I did feel romance was a little bit forced in this one, but I can excuse it. This film is recommended to anyone who likes noirs or Humphrey Bogart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody can be trusted. In the fast-talking, winner-take-all world of private investigation, you must always have eyes at the back of your head, otherwise, you'll wind up with bullets in your back. The overweight, conversational "Fat Man" (Sidney Greenstreet) has a few nasty tricks up his sleeve; the harmless-looking Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) is determined to complete the task at hand; the frustrated hired hoodlum Wilmer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) knows how to hold a grudge; the deceptive femme fatale Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) speaks naught but lies. This is the seedy world of private dick Sam Spade (the one-and-only Humphrey Bogart), a man who is used to being in control, always cocky in the face of danger, and never afraid to do what it takes to unravel a case. 'The Maltese Falcon' was the second great debut of 1941 (after Orson Welles' effort, of course), and even today remains a gripping and unpredictable thriller, with a perfect cast, intelligent dialogue and a twisted, winding storyline that will keep you guessing until the very end.Just last night, I was fortunate enough to attend a double-bill cinema screening of 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'The Big Sleep (1946).' The screening was my second viewing for both films, and Hawks' film seemed to receive a stronger audience response. Though both pictures undoubtedly emerge from the same storytelling mould, borne from the hard-boiled fiction of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, respectively, there are marked differences to be found in where each director places storytelling emphasis. Whereas 'The Big Sleep' wades determinedly through swathes of seedy characters, many faceless and unseen, John Huston is considerably more concise with regard to his characters and plot. Sam Spade's investigation revolves almost entirely around five central roles, close-knit acquaintances who are continually stabbing one another in the back. This degree of intimacy works well with the story, ensuring that each character has a well-developed personality and back-story to justify their behaviour through the film, however frequently they utilise lies and deception.'The Maltese Falcon' is often cited as the first true film noir, which isn't entirely accurate. 'Stranger on the Third Floor (1940)' and 'High Sierra (1941)' more closely exhibit the sensibilities of the style, whereas Huston's film is strongly indebted to the pulp crime films of the 1930s, such as 'The Thin Man (1934)' {not coincidentally a Dashiell Hammett creation} and its sequels. Indeed, 'The Maltese Falcon' was in fact the third adaptation of Hammett's 1930 detective novel of the same, but it is generally considered to be the best of the three. What the film did contribute, however, is Mary Astor as the archetypal femme fatale, a lying dame whose rottenness is evident from the beginning, but whose charms are such that men are putty in her hands. The notion of a strong, independent heroine had grown in popularity throughout the thirties, and here it was turned against the usual male oppressor. In the film's cruel but justified ending, Spade acknowledges being influenced by O'Shaughnessy's allure, but ultimately reasserts his dominance by condemning her to prison despite his possible love for her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most overrated movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon is a 1941 detective/crime noir film, directed by John Huston and stars Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor and Lee Patrick. Often considered a classic by many, a masterpiece by some and overrated by others one thing is certainly for sure...I have never been so disappointed and my expectations of a classic movie completely crushed like I was with The Maltese Falcon. While it does have a few saving grace moments overall The Maltese Falcon is a rushed, terribly written and at times a unnecessarily confusing film with unlikable characters and uninteresting plot. Lets however start with the few 'saving grace' moments in the film, first of all the initial murder of Miles Archer fantastically introduces us to this gritty world filled with lies, deceit and corruption. The scene itself was very well shot and gives the story a strong start ( which unfortunately later falls apart), the next is the very ending scene in which Sam Spade (our protagonist) utters that famous line 'The stuff that dreams are made of' which ends the film brilliantly and completes both the character of Spade and the movie's narrative in a conclusive and well rounded manner. The rest however is a huge mess, the dialogue is rushed, many scenes often feel either completely unnecessary or cut off too short, failing therefore to buildup tension or suspense. The characters communicate in a very unrealistic manner, one minute arguing the next siding with each other and then back to arguing without any real reason, all while completely hurrying through their lines and lacking any emotion. However, the script writing is by far the worst part, more than to often Sam Spade often seems to stumble over his lines, ramble on and moan and whine his way through, completely butchering any care or likability we feel for his character. The same can be said about Mary Astor's character, one minute playing the damsel in distress and love interest- the next being a traitorous coward. Overall, The Maltese Falcon is a huge disappointment with awful script writing, bland uninteresting characters, an over complex plot, subplots that seem to go nowhere or are abandoned entirely, a simple plot device that seems to drive all motivations to the characters (yet has a very little part to play in the overall story), horrendously forced and rushed dialogue and badly crafted scenes either consisting of nonsensical rambling, long drawn out conversations that progress nowhere or cut short destroying any emotion, tension, drama, suspense or interest. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See Casablanca instead. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>for Bogart, Lorre, and Greenstreet, with Ingrid Bergman instead of Mary Astor.Many other reviews remark upon the historic significance of The Maltese Falcon, and I acknowledge the movie deserves props for Bogie's turn as Sam Spade and for snappy dialog. But I have issues with TMF as a true classic rather than a relic of the early days of film noir.First, there's the femme fatale and alleged bombshell, Bridget O'Shaughnessy played by Mary Astor, whose performance has makeup an inch thick on it. Totally brittle from beginning to end. No chemistry that I can see between Bogie and Astor, or between Astor and anybody for that matter. Yes, Miles Archer goes gaga over her, because the script calls for him to. I haven't seen Astor in anything else, but surely she's been better elsewhere.Similarly, Mrs. Archer doesn't come off as worthy of Spade's attentions. She's mostly there to tip us off to Spade's being morally compromised. Second, I see many references to the menace exuded by Lorre and Greenstreet, but again I don't see it. Casablanca has Nazis in it, so L &amp; G can do what they do well as supporting characters without having to affect stagy menace. These guys ain't exactly Robert Mitchum or Jack Palance or even Edward G Robinson; I actually got the impression that L &amp; G are camping it up.Third, the quest for the Maltese Falcon just doesn't seem that compelling, even as people are being killed along the way. A great treasure like the "dingus" surely should have more interesting villains than this chasing it. Instead we get cartoonish characters, none more so than the pipsqueak Elisha Cook as Greenstreet's muscle. whom he allegedly regards as like his own son or so he says.In my opinion a movie about the stuff dreams are made of and the obsessions of those chasing those dreams shouldn't be pausing every so often for a chuckle or two. I don't think TMF ever made up its mind whether the characters should be taken seriously and tried too often to have it both ways.In sum, I feel like TMF is being graded on the curve. It's good compared to what came before it, but it's nowhere close to being in the same league as Chinatown, where John Huston, TMF's director, conveys the menace that Lorre and Greenstreet don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Mary Astor seems a bit matronly in this film. This version was made under the Hayes Code, meaning that the characters and their behaviour had to behinted at. Her character is a serial seducer who masquerades as a perfectlady, hence her tight girdle, dowdy but 'good' clothes and terribly Englishaccent. Her style of beauty, though, might be better suited to the 20s and 30s of her film heyday. Cairo, Guttman and Wilmer are gay in the book and the film is right to drop the hints it does. Look at the way Guttman clutches Spade's arm to him whenthey first meet, places a hand on his knee and pours him a stiff whisky. Theswooping soundtrack and Spade's raised eyebrows as he sniffs Cairo'svisiting card is supposed to give the game away. Sorry if I'm offendinganybody, but look up 'gunsel' in a slang dictionary. A theme of the film is that no one is what they seem. Even Spade isn't ascrooked as he's made out to be, angel. xxxxxxx</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third Time's the Charm in the 1941 Version of Hammett's Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic 1941 version of THE MALTESE FALCON (TMF) was the third movie adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's seminal detective novel about cynical private eye Sam Spade's adventures with the alluring but treacherous Brigid O'Shaughnessy and other greedy no-goodniks vying for the titular falcon statue. It proves the old adage "The third time is the charm." No wonder John Huston's taut, wryly cynical take on Hammett's tale put him on the map as a writer/director. His version has the best of everything in one package: the best private eye thriller, the best Dashiell Hammett movie adaptation, the best remake, and the best nest-of-vipers cast, including the signature Humphrey Bogart role/performance.Huston's powerhouse cast was born to play these characters. Between the perfect performances (even the great Walter Huston is memorable in his brief cameo as the dying Captain Jacobi), Huston's lean, mean pacing and striking visuals (Arthur Edeson's expressionistic photography and Thomas Richards' editing work beautifully), and the overall faithfulness to the novel, it's as if Huston &amp; Company just opened the book and shook it until the characters fell out, then started filming.Humphrey Bogart doesn't match Hammett's description of Sam Spade as a "blond Satan," but he's got Spade's attitude down perfectly, and besides, he's Bogart! What's not to like? Bogie deftly balances toughness, trickiness, and tenderness, but he never lets his tender side make a sap out of him. I find Bogart's Spade sexier than skirt-chasing Ricardo Cortez or Warren William in the previous films because the dames are drawn to Bogie because of his sheer charisma and strength of character, as opposed to him aggressively pitching woo at them until they give in from sheer exhaustion. In an early scene with Brigid, Spade has a line about how all he has to do is stand still and the cops will be swarming all over him; substitute "women" for "cops" and the line would still be accurate! :-) Mary Astor's real-life shady-lady past informs her spot-on performance as quicksilver Brigid O'Shaughnessy, but it's her watchful eyes, elegance, and that beseeching "throb in (her) voice" as she enlists Spade's aid that makes her so fascinating and believable as an avaricious adventuress with a prim, sweet facade?a woman who'd kill a guy as soon as kiss him, and keep him guessing about her intentions until the bitter end. That's what made Astor and Bogart such a great team; in their capable hands, Brigid and Spade are two wily, street-smart people who are onto each other as well as into each other.Every actor in TMF shines, from Bogart and Astor to Ward Bond and Barton MacLane as Sgt. Polhaus and Lt. Dundy, to Jerome Cowan as Spade's doomed partner Miles Archer, to Gladys George as clingy, vindictive Iva Archer, to the only cast members who reprised their roles in the otherwise so-so 1975 sequel/spoof THE BLACK BIRD: Elisha Cook Jr. as gunsel Wilmer Cook and Lee Patrick as Spade's trusty secretary Effie Perine. After Spade's tomcatting with Effie and other babes in the early films, it was refreshing that Effie's interest in Spade here is more professional than personal. There's warmth between them, but it stops well short of neck-nuzzling and lap-sitting. :-) Cook has many memorable moments, particularly one brilliant scene where he's on the verge of shooting the cool, calm Spade, his eyes filling with tears of rage as he whispers, "Get on your feet. I've taken all the riding from you I'm gonna take." When Wilmer comes to after Spade punches him out, dread and horror spreads over his face as each of the conspirators stares at him coldly (another triumph of editing and photography), and he realizes he's being set up as their fall guy. You can almost hear Wilmer frantically thinking, "Oh, s***!!!" Still, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre come closest to stealing the show. As Kasper Gutman, Greenstreet blends menace with avuncularity, his voice a cultured growl. Greenstreet's performance is so assured, it's hard to believe TMF was this veteran stage actor's first movie job, but it's easy to see why he earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. TMF made Greenstreet an in-demand character actor and one of cinema's most memorable villains, especially in his team-ups with Peter Lorre. Lorre's witty, sly performance as the smoothly effeminate yet ruthless weasel Joel Cairo is a marvelous addition to the rogues' gallery of lowlifes Lorre played over the course of his long career. After TMF's success, the great cast worked together in various combinations in many movies, including CASABLANCA. I've always wondered what a TMF caper film sequel following Gutman and Cairo to Istanbul would've been like, considering Greenstreet and Cairo's antihero buddy chemistry.TMF has so much memorable dialogue, often laced with sardonic humor, that I'd be virtually transcribing the whole script if I quoted all my fave lines. In my family, "The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter" and "When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it" have often been jokingly quoted. Then there's Gutman's deliciously ironic toast with Spade: "Here's to plain speaking and clear understanding." Plain speaking and clear understanding with this band of greedy, duplicitous cutthroats?! Good luck! :-) But the talk's a joy to listen to; as Gutman says, "I distrust a closed-mouthed man. He generally picks the wrong time to talk and says all the wrong things. Talking is something you can't do judiciously unless you keep in practice." TMF has one of cinema's greatest last lines, Spade's answer when Polhaus asks what the statue is: "The stuff that dreams are made of." I also love the climactic scene with all the principal players, especially the dialogue between Spade and Gutman about how to go about getting what they want ("...If you kill me, how are you gonna get the bird? And if I know you can't afford to kill me, how are you gonna scare me into giving it to you?...") Truly, TMF is "The stuff that dreams are made of"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another of those uncomfortable times where I have to step up to the plate as one of the few who finds a universally revered "classic" Overrated. THE MALTESE FALCON does have much going for it: It's got one of Humphrey Bogart's greatest performances as tough detective Sam Spade; some sensational dialogue; smart casting in Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet and Elisha Cook, Jr. (Mary Astor - not as smart); dark and brooding noir photography; but the most important thing goes wrong -- the plot is so highly convoluted, full of holes, and so nearly impossible to follow that it makes for a real headache-inducing 100 minutes. I liked the characters and actors so much that I really "wanted" to get involved in the story. But everything was strewn all over the place and confused me enough that I was prevented from fully getting into the movie. There have been some films that seemed incomprehensible to me at times, but as long as most of their loose ends become tied up by the time the end credits begin to roll, I'm usually a happy moviegoer. FALCON did not afford me that privilege and was very hard to follow. I can't consider that the mark of a great motion picture. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 1931 original is a better movie and got the shaft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As "classic" as this '41 version is, Roy Del Ruth's underrated original '31 version beats it out in a number of ways.Spade's relationship to women is much better defined in the original. Bogart kissing Archer's wife at the start of the '41 version feels like a throwaway. It's easy to forget they even had an affair half way through the movie. In the original it's a defining moment for Spade - painting him as a true womanizer. The film shows that Archer knows what's going on and isn't happy about it. Spade's happy/sleazy persona in the original makes much better sense than Bogart's tough, smirky one. While it's lovable, it doesn't service the drama as well. In the original, when Spade is alone with Ruth Wonderly at his place you wonder who is exploiting who and there's a lion's share of real sexual tension. It feels dirtier and truer despite being shot ten years earlier. It's great to watch.In Huston's remake, Bogart's too smart to be gotten and there's so little actual attraction it's all cat-and-mouse with no real chance of romance.When Ruth finally comes over to Bogart's apartment, Houston puts Cairo in the scene before the cops arrive. This kills all the sexual tension, turning it into more increasingly convoluted cat-and-mouse writing rather than something relatable.There are elements Huston added to the '41 version that further convolute the story. The entire scene in which Bogart messes with the Wilmer character in the hotel while speaking to Joel Cairo about his night at the police station is unnecessary and confusing. It's a scene that is smartly not in the '31 version.Lastly, the ending is so much more profound in the original that the '41 version doesn't hold a candle to it. "The stuff that dreams are made of" is a famous Bogart line, but is a sad compensation for the power of the original conclusion in which Ruth actually does fall for Sam, but he realizes it after it's far too late. The final scene takes place between them when he comes to visit her in prison, after getting a promotion. It's astonishingly heartbreaking and extraordinarily well done.History be damned.Incidentally Houston was nominated for a screen writing Oscar for this script. If you look at how much of the structure and screenplay remain the same in his remake, it's an outrageous nomination. The things Houston added actually detract from and confuse the narrative rather than making it better in any way.See the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good film, but too much talk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film received such praise because of the quality film-noir tag it got. It's authentic, an engaging experience for the viewer right into the insides of the detective world, a grand prize involved, the complex plot with various characters and sides leading to the one same goal, the acting is assertive, energetic...But all in all, what we really get is a ton of that fast tough-guy talk for the whole way, even the "action scenes" really are a steady-paced piece of narrative, and whether or not this film certainly has its qualities in what it does it is still non-stop dialog which requires all the viewer's attention while not delivering much more than just what one could expect at the beginning of it. There isn't much surprise, anything in the way of its basic plot, if not for the expected turns of tides as Bogart's character is one of great verve and guts, not willing to give away an inch to his dissidents.It makes for quite a linear experience, and while again it achieves what it sets out to do, for non-fanatics of the genre it remains there is a flatness about it with a tinge of predictability or even monotony, but a fine product of its realm nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark depths of a treasure hunt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night was time to watch "The Maltese Falcon" (1941) again. The lighting and camera work (Arthur Edeson, cinematographer) are exceptional, contemporary with Gregg Toland's in "Citizen Kane", also 1941. Good and innovative technique apparently spreads fast. The camera work gives us sharp and detailed interiors, backgrounds and foregrounds both in focus, achieving a freshness of look that does not age. Many times we see complete figures, head to toe, and bits of ceiling above. A good many low shots appear, such as those capturing Bogart comfortably reclining in his leather chair making a phone call and ponderous Sydney Greenstreet.This is a film with great and memorable characters. The characterizations allude to two and maybe three homosexuals. Notice how Greenstreet takes Bogart's arm and how he later places his hand on Bogart's knee. His walk and giggle are almost flirtatious. Peter Lorre's character is much more open about his proclivity and Elisha Cook Jr.'s sexuality cloudier. Nonetheless, he is a gunman acting tough who allows himself to be dominated by Greenstreet and pushed around by Bogart. He seems to have a sado-masochistic streak.The lesser parts add greatly to this film, and they include Bogart's secretary, Lee Patrick, Jerome Cowan's brief appearance as Bogart's partner, and Cowan's wife, Gladys George. They include Ward Bond as a friendly cop and particularly Barton MacLane as a tough cop who promises to be impartial to Bogart, either way. It's always fun to see Walter Huston stumble in with the Falcon baled up.Mary Astor's seductiveness is not flaunted. Director John Huston treats this subtly when she reclines. At that point, Bogart can't help but lean down and kiss her, enough to suggest what passes between them. After all, if Bogart could go with his partner's wife, why not with this attractive client? He treats it much less subtly when she asks Bogart how she can compete for his trust and help and he grabs her head and kisses her.As in the last time I watched this, I think Bogart's Sam Spade very early suspected Mary Astor, never really being fooled by her. His jabs at her holding back and at her schoolgirl manner make this verbally clear, but there also fleeting instances when we see it in his eyes in reaction shots. Nevertheless, the attraction was very strong, as is made clear in the closing speech.The main flaw in this movie is that the story rather lurches along from one conversation to the next, sometimes requiring long speeches to make its complexity comprehensible. The continuity of the action takes a little thought to discern and sometimes it's really elusive.But the movie has rightly achieved its iconic status as an early hard-boiled and cynical film noir. It was rightly placed in that position by early critics who invented the category of noir. Its emphasis on shady characters in a subterranean quest for a contested treasure who tangle with one another in opaque ways creates one facet of this noir story. These characters wave guns, drug drinks, pretend to be what they are not, and resort to murder if need be. They are obsessed with getting the jewel-encrusted bird. The hero, Sam Spade, is no prince but he does have a code. Although he speaks of bad nights after sending Astor over, he tells us they'll pass. He almost takes pleasure in telling her that he will indeed send her over. There is a certain cruel streak there. He's certainly hard-boiled and callous when it comes to Cowan's death. Any softness is slow to leak out or show. It becomes almost a business matter to him, which is perhaps his way of placing the pain into a place where it won't hurt as much or where he can avoid feeling guilty at cavorting with Gladys George.A noir film is a marriage of style and content, and there seem to be many ways of achieving this that allow for large variations in both. This makes it extremely difficult to define the category. Noir stories emphasize the darker sides of human passions, closing their characters into prisons of their own feelings, weaknesses, plans, desires and actions. They could be in the middle of a desert and still feel trapped or have been trapped. Those in quest of the falcon are trapped by their own desires. Bogart is almost trapped by attraction to Astor.This movie is a classic. It will later be matched by a good many others, which testifies to the capacities of movie-makers the world over. But as an early entry that retains its appeal and freshness to this day, it achieves a special status.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this case, the term "director's debut of" falling into the water. This beginning of a career for me is incomprehensibly good. I am aware that this is a film adaptation of the novel. However, this directorial beginning is rarely seen.The story revolves around a private investigator, who gets involved with three greedy, reckless and murderous adventurers who compete with each other to get the famous statue of the falcon encrusted jewels worth millions. The story is formidable circled, accompanied by excellent ?detective dialogues" and I have nothing to add. Layered story full of plot provides a true pleasure and unusual experience for film buffs, regardless of taste. The atmosphere is mesmerizing. Light, darkness and shadows cast in this film as much as those of flesh and blood. The term of Maltese Falcon is certainly mystical, but the mysteries of the statue is in relation to other elements of the film fell into the background. Humphrey Bogart (Sam Spade) with his left hand epitomized detective of all time. Ambiguous hero who is both honorable and greedy. Mary Astor as Brigid O'Shaughnessy is femme fatale. Damsel in distress or rather trouble in the girl. I think that Astor is not up to Bogart. Although I'm not sure in my statement given to the scene at the end of the film. Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo just shines. Slimy, polished and professional. He's hard to find fault with. Every phenomenon requires slap in the face, shifty is sleek and evil. Perfect. Sidney Greenstreet as extremely eloquent Kasper Gutman, the nicest character. The villain which is pleasant to look at. The dramatic declines other characters are great too.Spade is the heart of the story. The central figure around which everything revolves. A lone wolf who knows very well for himself, has his principles, but the game is only his, but others are just assistants, agents and sources. Masterfully complicated by the action in which the dark complications transform into each other. Houston with visible ease skipped by frame to frame, draws our attention to what he wants, no matter where the rich and multifaceted actions, scenario comes to the fore, while like lightning striking quick, witty and memorable dialogues. Elegant film, such as the waltz, and in places like the fast train, leaving more than enough room for nuances, good, evil and funny The camera is a precise and captures exactly what we need to see.THE MALTESE FALCON is a film about morality, justice, human imperfection, preferences vices from the perspective of the main character who is also a certain version of the anti-hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When I slap you, you'll take it and like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tough and gritty, the film noir classic The Maltese Falcon from 1941 has a fantastic cast, led by Humphrey Bogart in the role of hardboiled detective Sam Spade. A dame played by, whoops, a woman played by Mary Astor shows up in his office looking for a guy, but for reasons she's not being truthful about. A couple of murders later, Bogart comes to understand she and others are searching for a priceless antique, a statue of a falcon (from Malta, naturally). Bogart must navigate the waters between the police, who suspect him, the various tough guys, one of whom is the fantastic Peter Lorrie, and Mary Astor's character, who he's attracted to, but knows he cannot trust. Along the way, he'll blow smoke in a guy's face, take and give punches, and deliver several good lines, my favorites of which were "When I slap you, you'll take it and like it", and of course, the last one, in response to being asked what the falcon statue was, saying it's "the stuff dreams are made of". It's regarded as a classic, but for me it's good-not-great. I think one of the issues is the connection to Astor, I didn't see any real chemistry between the two of them, rendering a couple of the scenes false. It's certainly worth watching though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Maltese Falcon" is often regarded as one of the first black film, its birth and at the time of the American social and cultural trend of thought is closely linked. In the shadow of the great depression continued to cover nearly ten years later, the United States has just ushered in a burst of breathing machine, but quickly involved in World War ii. Rain and rain make people sad, desperate mood more serious. Disorder of social order, money to people, more and more confused and hopeless people, to become a true portrayal of black film.The concept of "film noir" without besides, low-key lighting, femme fatale, dark moist corner of the city, a paradox of the actor, ruthless killer, murder, evil. As a Bao Jiafen blind worship, affect their judgment. But what of that? This star is a part of the film, the film created a star, but also the achievements of the movie star. Bogart's fame is just because of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Huston's Directional Debut Is One Of The First Examples Of Film-Noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jam-packed with twists n turns from start to finish, presenting Humphrey Bogart in one of his most impressive roles, and also marking the feature film debut for esteemed filmmaker John Huston, The Maltese Falcon is regarded by many as one of the first examples of film noir and although its plot is always on the move, I wasn't entirely enthralled by it.Based on the novel of the same name, The Maltese Falcon tells the story of Sam Spade; a private investigator in San Francisco who takes on a case that results in his partner's death on the very first night, and involves not only his beautiful client who's very manipulative but three more eccentric criminals, who are on a quest to obtain a priceless statuette.Written &amp; directed by John Huston, this is a finely crafted mystery that instantly sets its tone &amp; is swiftly narrated from that point onwards but then, it also stays on the same level from beginning to end because of which there is no escalation in the story. But it nonetheless features some impressively staged camera-work &amp; tight editing which makes sure every scene has a role to play.Coming to the performances, The Maltese Falcon packs in a dependable cast in Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Gladys George, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet &amp; others and everyone is very poised in their given roles. Bogart delivers a supremely confident performance as the private detective Slade, Astor is overly melodramatic at times, Lorre is hilarious while Greenstreet steals nearly every moment he's in.On an overall scale, The Maltese Falcon never really steps on the wrong foot yet the entire experience of sitting through it was quite ordinary. There's rarely a moment when anyone isn't talking, which isn't a complaint for it kept the momentum going but none of its twists leave a lasting impression. The film is at its best when the screen is shared by Bogart &amp; Greenstreet and for that alone, The Maltese Falcon is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon isn't about the treasure of legend. Its about Private Detective Sam Spade's undertaking to find it. Humphrey Bogart play the part of aloof detective perfectly. Yet even though Sam doesn't personally care about anything in the mystery he still controls the scenes. The rest of the cast's performance don't match his but do perform considerably well. Although Mary Astor's performance as Brigid O'Shaughnessy is lacking. She never gives the impression she has any sort of plan or purpose, that she is weaving things behind the scenes, even though the script tells us she does. This stands out starkly when Sam and Brigid are alone together. The mystery is quite intricate as well, never once confusing the viewer but still not letting on any concrete clues. One flaw is that the score does not match the tone of the film. Whenever Sam successfully tricks another character in the film dainty lighthearted music plays. Supposedly this is to inform the viewer this is a clever "I gotcha" moment but it is unnecessary and lasts too long. Dainty music does not fit well in a dark crime mystery. Bogart's great performance holds this film together despite some immersion breaking flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching The Maltese Falcon. Film Noirs are always exciting to watch to me. It takes place in San Francisco and is about two partners, Sam Spade and Miles Archer, who are both detectives. A woman by the name of Miss Ruth Wonderly entered their office one night in hopes of hiring them to help her find her sister that is missing. Chaos breaks out the night Mrs. Wonderly came and asked them for help. Archer was killed while he was tailing a man. Nobody is who they say they are and Sam didn't realize what he had gotten himself into when he agreed to help Mrs. Wonderly. People are dying all over the place and people are put in danger all because they were in search of a golden statue of a falcon. Sam confronts "Mrs Wonderly" who was now known as Brigid O'Shaughnessy at the end of the movie about killing Archer where she admits that she did but begged him to not turn her in. Sam ended up turning her in and ending her life of crime and destruction that she was living. The lighting changes a lot throughout the movie as well as the lengths of long and short takes. They both change a lot throughout the film. The Maltese Falcon was entertaining to watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Huston (director of The Maltese Falcon) did an amazing job by keeping the viewers on their feet. By the two murders, the guy who follows Sam everywhere, and how Joel Cairo and Sam have their problems. For example, when Cairo comes into Sam's office and threatens him, I thought that scene was great for keeping the viewers interested. Also, another scene like that is when Sam sets up a meeting for Cairo and Brigid and the cops intrude. I loved the drama in the film. Huston used some close-up shots to display the items or scenes that you needed to be focused on. He also uses low-angle shots looking up at Gutman when Sam and Gutman have their meeting and a "drink" about the falcon. I also love how everything ends up in the end, you never know what's going to happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon was another great film that included Humphrey Bogart. Bogart's character in the film keeps the suspense going until the end when he states who killed Miles Archer, his partner in a San Francisco detective agency.A lot of long takes are used in this film during scenes of conversation on matters of trying to solve a murder mystery. There are also some scenes that include short fast takes of being zoomed in on individual faces to help us connect with each to see how they are reacting to the investigation.The dialogue of the film was creatively done to keep my interest as the film went on. The lighting on the movie was a lot of shadow and dim lighting to portray a setting of despair and unknown.The majority of the film is based on speech rather than physical action. Which in return the audience must pay close attention to so not to miss important details. This kind of directing and writing by John Huston creates a different type of film for audience to enjoy while along with the characters trying to solve the mystery.The search for the Maltese Falcon Bogart is able to solve the crime while keeping the Maltese Falcon. Ending of the movie is the best part for me with the conversation between Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) and him expressing his true feelings for her but that he must do the right thing for what she has done. His dedication to his job takes over his feelings. Money being the root of evil is the main reason for all this fuss over a Falcon that had no real significance all along. The Stuff that Dreams are Made of.... can turn out to be nothing but a nightmare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is supposedly one of the first of the film noir genre, but I ask, what's the big fuss here?Humphrey Bogart is Sam Spade and his partner, played by Jerome Cowan who briefly appears, is murdered.Before the murder, both guys are visited by Mary Astor, who in reality, steals the film. A very complex woman, Astor first comes across as sympathetic and vulnerable, but as the film goes on, she is shown to be in the thick of murder and intrigue. For sure, she is certainly the femme fatale here. Lee Patrick is convincing as the widow of Cowan, who really loved Spade. Peter Laurie is up to his old cynicism as ever and Sydney Greenstreet again proves that he shall do whatever is possible to gain his objective, no matter how sinister he has to be.The plot of trying to retrieve a valuable falcon statue from the crusade period is rather average at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blurring The Lines: The Maltese Falcon and Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1940s and beginning with films like John Huston's 1941 classic The Maltese Falcon, certain American crime films began to be made with sets of very differently imagined themes and characters as well as a new jangling aesthetic sensibilities. Where most American films in the 1930s and earlier were centred on clear and archetypal conflicts and motivations (for instance the oft-repeated rags-to- riches and good-versus-evil tropes), featuring characters that mostly stayed within easily identifiable limits, things changed in the 1940s. As is often the case with the emergence of new art forms, this new film noir 'mode' was probably borne out of a combination of important upheavals in the socio-economic, global political, and academic realities just prior to - and during - World War Two.A characteristic of film noir which seems to be part of its very definition is the permeating sense that pretty much everything isn't what it seems at first. This is reflected across virtually all the components of each film noir, from their plot to their aesthetic style. In The Maltese Falcon (as an early example of the movement), although the visual style is compelling, the truly disarming element is the complexity and ambiguities inherent in the plot and the characters themselves. The narrative here is built by laying layer upon layer of lies and hidden truths, adding higher stakes and more suspense with each sequence, right up until the very climax of the film when the actual truth of the affair is tortuously wrenched from the mouths of the caper's players by the hero, Detective Sam Spade, played with unremitting verve and intense presence by Humphrey Bogart.Spade's character is a perfect example of the central theme of the film (and by extension, many film noirs which followed it). His private eye isn't a policeman. He's essentially a gun-for-hire, and while he mostly seems to operate within the law, he is at least as sneaky and cunning as the criminals in the film. He lies to (mostly maladroit) policemen when it suits him; he engages in cloak-and- dagger surveillance; he is seduced and seduces his client to extract information from her? he seems to revel in his clever, silver- tongued confrontations with underworld types as he seeks to uncover the truth about his client, Miss Wonderly/Brigid O'Shaugnessy, and her association with a trio of greedy, unscrupulous fiends, and the mysterious falcon itself.When his partner is murdered at the outset of the story, he dispassionately tells his secretary to remove his name, immediately, from the office doors and windows. Moreover, it is soon revealed Sam had been sleeping with his partner's wife, who then is also jettisoned unceremoniously from the plot when she emotionally inquires as to Sam's involvement with the murder. This is not your typical good guy ? an anti-hero at best! Regardless of his personal failings, character quirks and borderline objectionable morals, Spade's strengths and his actions throughout the film make him a sympathetic character. This internal complexity, paired with a classic performance by Bogart, make him a much more human, three- dimensional character than was the norm in crime films before, and it became the mold from which countless iterations were shaped.Brigid, the other substantial character of note, is the prototypical femme fatale. She is similar to Sam in her manipulative intelligence and no-holds-barred pursuit of her objective; where Sam was working the case for cash (and to prevent being falsely accused of his partner's murder), Brigid coveted the priceless falcon. Nothing she says to anyone in the first 95% of the film turns out to be the truth. In fact, the plot of the film is essentially a quest to decode her lies in time to save Sam's reputation as well as to earn him a big payday. Her misdirection and convoluted machinations to manipulate the men in the film is nothing short of genius, but what makes eventually makes her the tragic figure is that her greed made her cross one moral absolute that Sam seems convinced of: as the murderer of his partner she must face justice. But even this judgement comes with words to the effect that it was one line he could not cross in the industry of detective work, not necessarily his own personal viewpoint. Oh, the humanity!There are many more examples of betrayals and wickedness in the film, including Gutman's willingness to frame his loyal hired gun "the fall guy" for the whole affair when Sam suggests it, as well as Brigid's seduction of the captain of the boat bringing the falcon to America resulting in his untimely end. These characters are the archetypes (including Gutman's 'Fat Man' kingpin-type and the queer- coded henchman Joel Cairo) which continue to inspire imitations, homages and parodies.The world was in a state of deep existential angst at the time this film was released, in fact, it was released only a couple of months before America would be shocked to its core and drawn into a true nightmare by the Pearl Harbour bombing by the Japanese. Rumours of German atrocities across the ocean, the ever-growing threat of fascism and the spectre of American political paranoia that was lurking just around the corner likely propelled the narrative and aesthetic style and themes exhibited in The Maltese Falcon to reach increasingly ominous and arresting heights before the first cycle of the film noir movement would arrive at its desinence in the late 50s.</fullReview>

I was just very appealing to the eyes. Definitely one of those go to the theatre type of movie. Meaning I would spend money to see it haha. The over all quality of the film was nice, the scenes flowed well and the acting from all of the characters was flawless. When watching I wanted to see this Maltese Falcon that everyone wanted, I wanted to see what the big idea was. And to find out that the one they had was a fake was a bit upsetting but blood pumping as well. I felt like I would go on the hunt to find what was desired by many. The film was also sad too. I say this because it turned out to be a action/ love story. I was really rooting for the romance that was but in place, it was sad to see that the main character had to give up his love for the justice of a fallen friend. Honorable. The facial expression Brigid O'Shaughnessy had while being arrested is and will be forever remembered in my head. You could see the heartbreak in her eyes and all over her face. It was so depressing...I wish she was a good guy but without her facade we would have lost some vital conflicts within herself and as well with the Samuel Spade. It seems as though her betrayal made the climax/story.</fullReview>

Sort of like a chain reaction? Spade takes on a case, his partner ends up killed and that sets off the entire movie. Though Spade seemed indifferent towards the death of his partner, and was rather a little intimate with his wife, his motives were clear if you ask me. He was going to get revenge, but Spade isn't the kind of person to just go about and spill his true feelings to anyone. I find that the movie did its job with the interactions and relationships. The script was well done and it helped you along the way. Who really did kill who? What's the real motive and why?

		<shortDescription>Memorable Performative Evocation of the Film Noir World of 1940s San Francisco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Structurally speaking, John Huston's film is rooted very much in the quota-quickie tradition. It is mostly shot in the studio, with some stock footage at the beginning of San Francisco; and the action zips by at a cracking pace in a series of sequences shot mostly in close- ups and two-shots, with the occasional zoom in on the characters' faces to signal some dramatic moment. Lighting effects are straightforward yet meaningful, such as the mirror-image of the sign outside Sam Spade's (Humphrey Bogart's) reflected on one of the interior walls, making us aware of the cramped environment in which the private detective operates.On the other hand, THE MALTESE FALCON remains a classic of its kind, due in so small part to the quality of John Huston's script and the memorable individual performances. As Spade, Bogart comes across as a tough, no-nonsense personality; but at the same time blessed with a sense of humor. After having lost his temper with Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet), we see him leaving Gutman's apartment and grinning to himself as he makes for the elevator. What we've just seen is a deliberate performance from Spade, designed to intimidate Gutman in spite of Gutman's bulk. On other occasions Spade registers his increasing strain with a grimace; after he wakes up from being drugged by Gutman, and kicked in the head by Gutman's sidekick Wilmer (Elisha Cook jnr.), he grimaces twice and totters towards the washstand, in an attempt to recover his sang-froid. The fact that he manages to do so is evidence of his tough, uncompromising nature. Bogart's characterization contrasts with that of Mary Astor as Brigid O'Shaughnessy - an actress par excellence, she possesses the ability to turn on vulnerability at will in order to persuade men to 'protect' her. The fact that she doesn't need protection explains why she is so dangerous; no one, it seems, can get to the bottom of her character, not even Spade. When, at the end of the film, she declares her love for the detective, we cannot quite believe her; and therefore we sympathize with Spade's eventual course of action.Peter Lorre turns in a memorable cameo as Joel Cairo - a fastidious, bespoke-suited person with white gloves and an elegant top hat. He seems the kind of person who should be capable of avoiding conflict, yet he keeps encountering it with unerring regularity, and coming off second best. His first confrontation with Space is especially memorable, as he holds up the detective with a shotgun, yet finds himself rapidly frisked of his possessions. Lorre's diminutive figure contrasts with that of the gargantuan Greenstreet as the master-criminal in search of the eponymous falcon. He manages to keep his cool even during the most stressful situations - aware, perhaps, that he holds most of the financial and muscular aces.The plot is a complicated one, but really does not matter in a film that is nothing less than a feast of great acting, with the entire cast at their best.</fullReview>

The main character hands the love of his life over to the police in the end; this shows his honesty and loyalty. Throughout the entire movie his goal is to find his partner's , not knowing it was the woman's case he was working on the entire time, and his/her motive behind it. The movie is primarily about deception lies and loyalty. This movie goes hand in hand with the other Bogart film 'Casablanca' when the main character, Bogart, has to pull back together his tough guy image, after showing a more emotional side.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the send-up THE CHEAP DETECTIVE, Peter Falk does a pretty good Humphrey Bogart- but nobody did Bogart like Bogart, and here he's at his very best. He delivers rapid-fire dialogue with a clipped precision and doles out punishment when necessary with two-fisted explosiveness. There's not a bad performance in the film, but my favorite (next to Bogart) has to be Peter Lorre as the sweet-scented Joel Cairo (an unusual performance, to say the least, for a film from this period). He takes it on the chin from pretty much everybody in the movie (the mere mention of Gutman causes him to go limp with fright), but forges ahead. THE MALTESE FALCON is one of those movies it's night impossible not to watch (as I did again just last night, when it turned up on Turner Classic Movies). One of the very best of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story surround a detective, Spade, who is trying to clear his name and uncover who is behind all these murders that seem to be caused by the lustful Maltese Falcon. This is a breakthrough role for Humphrey Bogart, who then gets the role in Casablanca, so it is fun to see him in this movie as well. He plays Spade well and really makes us believe he is this coldhearted and tough guy. The way the film was shot really gives us the over tone and mise-en-scene. The tone is very constant, most shots have low key lighting with lots of shadows to make the it dark and mysterious. There is also a lot tight frames, like scenes in Spades office, we are able to see how small the room is and the close quarters that Spade is sharing with dangerous men. By filming the shots so tight it induces a feeling of panic and anxiousness to the scenes. Some shots even include the ceilings of the rooms, which isn't very common, this also gives us the feeling of claustrophobia of these high powered and dangerous people gathered together. When the character Gutman is being shot the camera usually shoots him with a low angle, and we are looking up at him. It gives the effect of him looking larger and in power, making us the audience feel inferior, not to mention make his gut look even larger. (funny that his name is Gutman, coincidence..I think not!) Overall this movie was something different and had an interesting story line, reminding me a little of North by Northwest mostly because of the anxiety the movie made you feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story led by characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film had a great mystery (Which I wasn't spoiled on!) and a really diverse and interesting set of characters. Usually movies of this variety use their main character as a moral center; I really enjoyed that the Maltese Falcon didn't quite do that. Sure, Sam was our protagonist, but he was rough around the ages and put his feelings before those around him. That being said, my favorite relationship in the film was between him and his girl Friday, Effie. They worked against each other seamlessly and I would have gladly watched an entire movie about them. As film noir goes, this is up there for me in favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember looking at my movies list for class and seeing The Maltese Falcon and I got excited. I remember watching this in my Detective Fiction class in high school and loving it. I couldn't wait to watch it again. After watch Casablanca and seeing what a great job Humphrey Bogart did he did in that film, he killed it with the Maltese Falcon. Although Casablanca came out a year later he did an exceptional job. These types of old movies are my favorite. Old mysteries where the main character is some type of detective and tries to solve cases are the best. I try and follow along and solve everything myself. I would watch this movie over and over again and I have come to really like Humphrey Bogart and his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analysis for The Maltese Falcon (1941)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is another great because of Humphrey Bogart. I realized that there was some good setups for the film. The only thing that I really disliked about the film is that there was a lot of mystery about the murder of Miles Archer. I didn't like it, because I am one person who really dislikes violence in movies. However, I liked almost everything else, including the quote, "In 1539, the Knight Templars of Malta paid tribute to Charles V on Spain by sending him a Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with rarest jewels... but pirates seized the galley carrying this priceless token and the fate of the Maltese Falcon remains a mystery today." In terms of its successes, it's going to remain in movie history as one of the best films made in the 1940's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another film I've wanted to see for ages! And it didn't disappoint. I will definitely be watching this again, as it was difficult to focus on the plot and pay attention to camera and lighting work at the same time. Both of which were really lovely. There's probably some debate about this being film noir, but I think it qualifies?the lighting was just great. I love dark photography so of course film noir is a favorite. The camera angles and some of the tracking shots were particularly nice. I really love the characters in this. Although there is a "good guy" and a "bad guy" in the usual sense, all of the characters have their flaws. I especially like the scene between Brigid and Sam near the ending. Bogart was perfect for Spade, and his performance made the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dawn of American film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston jump started the "American noir" genre with this masterpiece. WB, the movie public, and of course, Bogart were lucky for sure that George Raft turned down the role. It marked the film debut of Greenstreet and the beginning of the Huston-Bogart team which reached it's zenith in 1948. That year they topped TMF with film's greatest ever, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Huston's incomparable talent for producing great scene after great scene is initiated here in his directorial debut. In his best films which are many there is no dead time because there is something significant happening in every scene. This movie has to be viewed at least twice to be fully appreciated because of the lightning plot speed. Bogart's unmatched screen presence is on full display as he appears in ALL BUT ONE scene and dare's the viewer to take their eyes off him. Still an all-time top ten American film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but not as intense as the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good movie but it is at best a watered-down version of the book. This movie does not even come close to capturing the cynicism that permeates throughout the book. Also, Humphrey Bogart is miscast as Sam Spade. In the book, Spade is six-feet tall, is muscular and has blond hair. He crosses the line separating the client from the detective so many times that it is clear that he has joined the gang that he ostensibly had been hired to investigate. He literally becomes one of the thieves, and they are thieves and murderers. Furthermore, Spade obstructs the police who are trying to investigate the case which is involves multiple murders, is not above shaking down people and beating people up and ultimately violates the rights of his client by gaining her confidence and then using the information derived to turn her in to the police, this after he had slept with, stripped her and humiliated her. True, the lady is a murderer, but with extenuating circumstances. Further, Spade is cold-hearted and brutal. He is not above have an affair with his partner's wife and when she comes by for support, brushes her off, this while she is in mourning no less. Now, the question is: why would anyone want to write a such a story? Of course, the answer to that question is purely speculative, but from judging from the nature of the story, the author has a cynical view of American society and questions the honesty and integrity of those institutions that are supposed to protect society. The depiction of the police as being little more than nuisances is a case in point. Two police detectives are investigating a double-homicide, which is serious business, and Spade is refusing to cooperate in the investigation, which, of course, raises suspicions as to his culpability in the crimes. There us nothing about Sam Spade that is heroic, genuine or worthy of emulation. He listens to lies for money and when he learns that the thieves are chasing down something that may be worth a lot of money, he joins the chase, abusing his client's right to confidentiality to extract information, not to help his client but to help himself. The movie depicts Spade in a different light. Here his is cynical but not as overtly brutal. He is not shown sleeping with the woman nor of stripping her naked. He is also shown as having a certain code of conduct which he follows while in the book the code of conduct is discarded in favor of crass expediency. Mary Astor is wonderful in the movie, but she too is miscast. The young lady, Brigid O'Shaughnessy, is a whore who is running with a rough crowd and then steals something from a group of thieves, from which the story evolves. She came to Spade for protection and Spade took her money, thus becoming her employee, and confederate. Now, the question of love between Spade and Brigid comes up in the story. Spade repeatedly evades that question, yet his actions speak louder than words, thus showing that he cannot be honest with himself. His actions show that he cares for her: he has the key to her apartment, he sleeps with her, he kisses her, her caresses her, and intercedes on her behalf when another man, Cairo, attempts to molest her. She has no shame with him. In short, she loves Spade, and in return, Spade informs on her because he doesn't want to become one of her saps, which he had already become the money he took her money. Now, does this mean the movie should not be watched. Of course not, it is a classic and is entertaining. But don't expect to find it as intense as the book, because it is not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The camera angles were supremely creative. Such as, profile and facial shots, sky view and other beautiful angles. I loved how the picture was visualised in San Fransico.For example, the city buildings, expensive cars, rich costume and production designing, the bridge of San Fransico and other high standard ingredients. The storyline was complex. It had pulling twists and turns. As an audient the film made me read between the lines. The title was extremely stylish and suspicious. In my opinion the monochrome, cinematography, exposer was well imaged. The movie director had more cinematic portraits than the city landscape. It was slightly disappointing for me. But on the other hand, I was very impressed with the orchestra. The instruments played it rich tunes. The treasured picture is a gift for film buffs and artists.I will give the movie an 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ward Bond plays a cop in The Maltese Falcon. The actor with the most appearances in American Film Institute Top 100 movies (7 in all) is electric in this picture His charisma catches your eye and his final line "huh?" should've been on the AFI's list of Top 100 Quotes. Bond's performance is...I'm just jerkin' your chain! Yeah, Ward Bond acts in the most AFI films and he does play a cop here, but Humphrey Bogart is the story. This was Bogie's big breakout (along with High Sierra that same year) and he lights it up. The man paid his dues for a while and played the heavy in 1930s films before they finally gave him the chance to be a leading man. Interesting that he often played shady "heroes"---including in The Maltese Falcon---rather than being straight-up nice-nice.Bogie's Sam Spade sees his partner get killed and he gains (and then loses) a love interest all in what seems like a few days. He also comes one phony statue shy of being a rich man. They all want that bird. Crooks all. Each of the villains in this piece is memorable: Sydney Greenstreet (debutting as Kasper Gutman), Peter Lorre (slimy and fey), Elisha Cook (weird, as always) and Mary Astor (constantly on the verge of hysteria or passing out).The last half-hour is tense, yet it's just 5 people waiting around in a room. Writer/director John Huston (in his own breakout) didn't change much from Dashiell Hammett's novel, making him a smart writer/director. Apparently, the AFI agreed. They had it at 23rd and then 31st on their 2 Top 100 lists. They're correct. This one is a honey. And Bogart is outstanding. He still had Casablanca and Treasure Of The Sierra Madre in his future, but his work in Falcon is...corny alert...the stuff that dreams are made of. And then Ward Bond follows with "huh?" See? Great follow-up line.

		<shortDescription>The birth of a genre, and it's a good one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Private detective Sam Spade's partner is dead, and he believes it has something to do with their newest client. Now he's joined the hunt for a mysterious statue alongside three bizarre criminals. As the hunt continues, no one knows who can be trusted.Maltese Falcon 4If you want to see the birth of a genre, look no further than The Maltese Falcon. This film opened the door for film noir to enter the American cinematic vocabulary. Two-time Oscar winner, John Huston (The African Queen) was the right man to direct a film like this. His adaptation of the novel by Dashiell Hammett (After The Thin Man) is a wonderful example of how to bring a story to life. In 1941, this film was good enough to earn Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Writing.Maltese Falcon 7The cast for this film is one of my favorite ensembles of the era. Humphrey Bogart (Casablanca), Mary Astor (The Great Lie), Peter Lorre (M), and Sydney Greenstreet (They Died with Their Boots On) come together with an incredible amount of chemistry. Greenstreet earned an Oscar for his portrayal of the obsessed business man and crook, Kasper Gutman. Peter Lorre is equally wonderful in his role as the flamboyant and bumbling thief. Mary Astor plays her part well also, working as a character who appears in many forms. Despite all of these wonderful performances, I think Bogart comes out on top. His delivery of the dialogue set the bar for future film noir actors. His natural ease in front of the camera works to his benefit as he plays the cool and calm private eye.Maltese Falcon 1The camera work for this movie is nicely done. It avoids any dramatic movement and remains unobtrusive throughout. Thankfully the film also had a great number of sets to film on. Set mainly at night, the film capitalizes on great lighting to create the shadows and the mood necessary for the story.Maltese Falcon 2The pace of the film is good, and I felt like the story avoided any unnecessary moments. The mystery and intrigue pay off nicely in this classic film. If you're into mysteries and you haven't seen this movie, I would suggest getting a copy right away. This is an awesome movie with great visuals and a wonderful score. I would also recommend this to fans of films like Dial M for Murder or The Big Sleep. I give this one 5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Movie that Deserves the Position</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most famous movies ever made. Based on a book the movie was first made in 1931 and later remade in 1941 with Humphrey Bogart playing the detective Sam Spade. Most critics, including Bill Collins, directs us to focus on the characters in the movie because it is the characterization that makes this such a great movie. I agree to a point, but I think the whole issue of the Maltese Falcon makes this such a dark movie.The book upon which this movie is based is considered to be a change in direction with the way detective stories are made. Edgar Allen Poe was the creator of the detective story and it was developed by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but their detectives were intelligent, honourable men. Sam Spade could be seen as one of the first "Down and Out detectives." The author of The Maltese Falcons describes private detectives as police officers who do not like to work with people but rather go it alone. These characters are more crooked and ruthless than police officers. It is no wonder that the police in The Maltese Falcon are somewhat cold towards Sam Spade. Spade works with fellow Detective Miles Archer and the movie opens with a young lady, O'Shannahey, hiring Spade and Archer to trail some guy who has stolen her sister from her. Suddenly Archer is shot and the movie starts into motion.The Maltese Falcon was a statuette that was stolen by pirates as it was being delivered to the King of Spain and it has supposedly surfaced in San-Fransisco. The movie is not a search for the falcon but rather people all wanting a piece of it. The fat man, who is the villain of the movie, wants the falcon and pays Spade a lot of money to get it. He doesn't want to part with his money and has his gunsel Wilma to dispose of Captain Jacobi and get the falcon.The harsh parts of the characters are revealed with the Fat Man willing to sell out Wilma, whom he claims to consider a son, to get the Falcon off of Sam Spade. And then there is O'Shannahey, a beautiful young lady who grabs Spade's heart, yet we know that Spade does not truly love this woman as we learn that he is having an affair with Archer's wife. O'Shannahey is not what we expect. At first she comes as an innocent woman who is looking for her sister but we find a web of lies and deceit surrounding her and the more we get entangled in the lies the more sinister O'Shannahey becomes.Spade is not a hero either, rather he is an anti-hero. He his selfish and cold, ready to betray his partner for a woman, and ready to betray his lover for his reputation. He slaps around Wilma and Cairo, treating them like little children. Spade is an arrogant, self-centered person and would rather look after himself than others.I think the ending of the Maltese Falcon is brilliant. I am one who looks more at the ending of a movie than the content because it is the ending that we are left with when we leave. The ending of the Maltese Falcon is not happy, nor is it sad. Rather we are just left knowing that life will go on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional (though flawed) film with brilliant performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I had watched this movie a couple of times before, when I saw a documentary that talked about, I decided that perhaps I hadn't given it its full due. So I pulled the DVD off the shelf last evening and watched it again...after reading about it on Wikipedia for some background.In terms of plot, I don't think it's any masterpiece, although it is a good story. I would fault the movie somewhat because during the first half hour (of 101 minute film) you may find yourself struggling to grasp what the movie is really about (although, since I had seen it before and read about it, I knew...but I still think the first 30 minutes meanders around quite a bit with no clear destination, although that's not to say it's not intriguing. But then, things begin to fall into place and you have the development of a good mystery. In the end, you may reflect and say: wow! It's amazing how much they packed into 101 minutes! It's interesting how many references to homosexuality there are in this film...and that they got away with some of them. First, Peter Lorre's character is clearly effeminate, both with his behaviors and his gardenia scented calling cards. In an early scene, Bogart says to a male detective of his male partner, "What's your boyfriend getting at, Tom?" And later, when Bogart slaps a thug, "When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it." But the reason this film is sooooooo good is the acting. Although he had already been in films from 1928 - 1940, 1941 was really the year that Humphrey Bogart came into his own right as a true star, rather than a supporting actor. And it was in this film, in my view, that he showed what would be a fairly common theme throughout the rest of his career -- a good guy who was just a shade away from being a bad guy. As Sam Spade, that persona worked well, and continued to work well for Bogart in any number of pictures. The female lead -- Mary Astor -- is perfect here as a woman who is acting an evolving part in a never-ending comedy of errors; you can see she's not to be trusted, although superficially she seems highbrow, while underneath she's really a con.Gladys George, who surprisingly gets third billing, is rather irrelevant to the story as Bogart's partner's wife. I don't think how good Peter Lorre's role is here as an somewhat effeminate crook; in fact, I would say it's brilliant, and perhaps his best role. Barton MacLane is around as a detective, but his acting is always pretty static. Lee Patrick is enjoyable here as Bogart's secretary.Surprisingly way down at 7th billing is Sydney Greenstreet as "the fat man"; but this was his first film...and he turned it into a gem of a role with his evil giggling; interesting to watch his early scenes here where he is filmed sitting and you see him at an odd angle from the belly up.I've always thought that Ward Bond was an underrated actor. Here as a police detective he gets better screen time. Jerome Cowan, as Bogart's detective partner doesn't last long...killed off within minutes of the beginning of the film. Of special note here is Elisha Cook, as Wilmer, an effeminate gangster (?) who plays it too tough only to be put down repeatedly by Bogart...a very good role for him. Interestingly, John Hamilton is around as the DA (he later played Perry White in television's "Superman" series. And you have to watch carefully for the ship's captain, who turns out to be Walter Huston, director John Huston's father, in an uncredited cameo.The bottom line of this film is the old saying that there is no honor among thieves. But few films have ever portrayed that concept with such verve. Highly recommended...an exceptional (though flawed) film.Walter Huston as Captain Jacobi (uncredited)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic in every sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dashiell Hammett's "The Maltese Falcon" was a great book, but it really says something when the movie version is even more enjoyable. Well- written and directed by John Huston, there's a playfulness that comes through not only in the script, but in Humphrey Bogart's performance (who was a terrific pick for Sam Spade, by the way). It's what makes it more than just a top-notch detective story; it's an undeniable classic. Bogie's got the tough-guy act down to a T (hell, he makes it look easy), and Lee Patrick makes for a great scene foil for Bogart (she brings her own moxie to the proceedings). Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet both excel at underhanded characters - Lorre, the slimy weasel and Greenstreet the refined wader of murky waters and smooth in a comical way (that chuckle is hilarious).The dialogue cracks like a whip, giving the ears a workout and making exposition scenes (dare I say it) exciting. "The Maltese Falcon" is more than a detective yarn and a film noir hallmark; it's just a consummate piece of classic Hollywood artistry. It's the sort of movie that leaves me hungry for more Bogey.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is arguably the first Film-Noir. While it is a groundbreaking style of slick sensibilities, Camera Angles, and crisp Performances, the witty rhythmic Script is foremost the Star here. There is a surrealist, not a realism to the Dialog. A Pulped Up patter that can be found in the best Crime Fiction of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and James Cain. In real life People don't talk like that. "What do you want me to do, learn to stutter" answers Sam Spade. The Film is iconic Bogart and his supporters are along for the ride. He is in virtually every scene and it is his ship that the barnacles attach. Everything is dependent on the Character of Detective as he wanders through this wondering about what to do and who to do it to next.Undeniably infectious, things move at a rapid pace and is fascinating to watch. Not without flaws, such as a wordy, wondering Story and some stiffness. Still it is an important Movie, although it suffers from being Studio bound and some rather annoying, feathery Music. The end speech where Spade verbalizes his reasons for his actions is rather badly Written and Acted and almost doesn't fit with the sharpness that led us there. In short it feels tacked on and simplistic. But the rather weak ending is not enough to keep this from being a new slice of Cinema for the Forties and beyond. It is worth most of its relentless praise. There is a lot here to relish and only a few things that keep this from Greatness.</fullReview>

So says Private Eye Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) to his professional client and would-be lover Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) after the ill-advised "confession" he's verbally abused out of her in regard to the death of his partner, Miles Archer (portrayed by Jerome Cowan, whose widow Iva, played by Gladys George, is his past and current bed mate, making Sam the #1 suspect in Archer's death!). This love quadrangle is completed by the fact that just before dying, Miles--no doubt sensing that partner Sam was dallying with his spouse--has pledged to get Sam back by boinking Brigid before serial womanizer Sam can have his way with this new girl drawn into the misogynistic orbit of Spade &amp; Archer, Inc. FORGET ABOUT THE BLACK BIRD. This 1941 version of the Dashiell Hammett novel THE MALTESE FALCON proves serial-killer-by-proxy Sam one of the most lethal murderers ever to run rampant with no weapon except his forked tongue! Sam obviously set Miles up for murder, directly leading to Thursby's killing, if not Capt. Jacobi's. With three or four more of Sam's clients and business associates set up by their turncoat money collector (who takes the concept of professional-client privilege 180 degrees in the wrong direction) for a neck tie party on the California gallows as this tale ends, the only question is whether his secretary Effie Perine (Lee Patrick) is Sam's co-conspirator and sadistic true love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Maltese Falcon" is John Huston's first film, which makes it one of the best debut films I've ever seen. There are a couple of small aspects of the film that don't work as perfectly as the rest, but those parts are hardly noticeable. What Huston has made is the first true film noir, complete with a troubled hero, the femme fatale whom he falls for, and an assortment of seedy international criminals. Dynamic camera angles and close-ups turn what would be routine melodrama into pure suspense. My only complaint pertains to the film's ending, which, if it had been done any other way, would have been more memorable. When people recall how great "Falcon" is, I doubt the ending is the first part of the scene that comes to mind. After going through the film shot by shot, I have a greater appreciation for just how innovative "The Maltese Falcon" really is. What makes the film so enjoyable is its many great performances. Humphrey Bogart plays Sam Spade, a determined private investigator, and Mary Astor plays the deadly Brigid O'Shaughnessy. The criminals are played by brilliant character actors Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook, Jr. The former two would appear alongside Bogart again the following year in the legendary Casablanca (1942). All of these actors give great performances with subtle nuances that make each viewing a new experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart plays the main character in this film which is a detective.This film really set him apart from other actors as a hard nosed character.This film helped jumpstart film noir. It has a lot of twist and turns in the film. The main character is always torn between a number of things including a women. The Film is full of a lot of intense scenes. Humphrey Bogart is a very round character in the film and is very good at a number of stuff. It is shot in low key lighting to add to the noir effect. It is full of suspense and tension. There is a very good supporting cast as well.The movie is full of mystery and suspicions a very solid film by Bogart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stuff that dreams are made of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Bogart in this film. His character was incredibly cunning and smooth. I always enjoy film noir, however this one seemed to have more to offer than the other I've watched. The story was completely unpredictable and I felt that I was constantly bracing myself for the next twist. The black and white cinematography and the low-angle camera-work definitely added to the unsettling emotion of the film. The movie was thrilling and the less-than-perfect ending was brilliant because it went against the grain. I thought it was interesting that they never divulged why the Maltese Falcon was so valuable and what it's purpose was. I like that they left it up to the imagination of the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually really liked this film! I wasn't really sure what to expect when I started watching this film, but I was pleasantly surprised. This film was surprisingly fast-paced for it's time period and that made it a lot easier to stay focused and involved in the film. Although I'm not usually a huge fan of mystery films, this one was really great.The actors were wonderful and the cinematography was great. I thought the editing was rather impressive too. The transitions between scenes were very smooth and you'd never really guess that it was filmed in 1941. I did not know this film was considered film-noir, but now after watching it, I completely understand why. The lights and darks in the film were really sharp and the amount of shadows present throughout was never too much. I honestly didn't think I was going to like it because I noticed that quite a few films from the 40's were very slow paced and jam packed full of dialogue. Although there was a lot of dialogue in 'The Maltese Falcon,' it worked. The pace of this film was perfect, the story was awesome and I never lost interest. I would highly recommend to anyone into 40's films or films falling into the film-noir category. Really great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole film-noir facade inevitably surrounding Bogart -and also Sydney Greenstreet- can no doubt compel anyone to approach this movie in a kind of vigilant and even serious stance.The entire cast is wonderful because it is exactly how it should be: we stand before the story of an adventure, with it's fantasy, it's mentions of exotic places, with it's unreal ending, interactions between characters, and the key dialogs forming part of this kind of fairytale.In this tale our main character is always right, he always manages to slip past dangers. There are fights and there are deaths, but there's no violence in this film.Is it really noir? Really? It's a brilliant film, surely, and made to be enjoyed in the simplest way possible: the way that Bogart does... having fun with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon is full of twists and turns and will keep you watching to the very end, and hopefully leave you satisfied as I was. There's quite a bit of information you have to keep up with but the story is worth it in the end. I loved the themes, and never knowing how far this mystery would go. There was just something about the plot that just felt good and reassuring. But I did have a few problems with the characters. Starting with Humphrey Bogart's main character.I just didn't find him particularly interesting. His motivations for his actions sort of threw me off from time to time, along with the women in his life, that sort of added a bit of unnecessary conflict. But in a way I suppose that's what made the plot turn in so many directions. The antagonists however were very good, and there's not much I would want to change about them. All in all I found this movie satisfying and a very good crime mystery film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Spade greatest investigation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon (1941) is a film noir directed by John Huston, and starred Humphrey Bogart with Mary Astor. Sam Spade (Bogart) is a partner in a street-wise detective agency in San Francisco. The partners are hired by Miss Wonderly (Astor) who claims to be looking for her missing sister. When Sam's partner is killed investigating the missing sister report, Sam takes charge to pursue the killer. We then learn that Miss Wonderly was actually involved with a trio of crooks all looking for a fabled, jewel-encrusted bird ? the Maltese Falcon. Using gumshoe skills, Sam is able to take control of the situation, and eventually discovers the secret behind the jeweled bird and learns who killed his partner. The Maltese Falcon is classic crime drama, which unitized low-key lighting to emphasize the mood and theme of the style. The deep shadows and sharp contrasts added to the suspense and intrigue built by the pursuit of the precious bird. Astor portrays a femme fatale, initially luring Sam's partner, Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan), and then Sam himself to aid her in a selfish pursuit of riches. One observes the use of low-angle lens shots to initially illustrate Sam's naivety at the start of the investigation; towards the end of the film, Sam gains the upper hand of all involved. With a run time of 101 minutes, The Maltese Falcon is a captivating film, and is a constant delight to view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bogart in this film was truly masterful in his performance, and I would easily place him in the top 5 Hollywood actors of all time. This movie IS, the classic crime film, and I have not seen another that can even rattle its position in my mind. While watching it your mind will jump from one thing to another while you are trying to figure out what will happen next, and a sense of danger and excitement will creep up your spine while you cant help but enjoy yourself. It is easy to see that so many old style detective films tried to catch some of the glory and prestige from The Maltese Falcon, and that is how I imagine why they became such a popular genre in and of themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a roller-coaster. From the first scene you would never guess that movie is about what it is about. Not saying you usually get a clear idea about movies from the first scene but you never would have even guessed what went on would be going on. It all just unraveled scene after scene after a certain point. Kept me on my toes for sure. The movie in general is a great mystery/action movie with Bogurt acting as the moral tough guy that saves the day. The movie was interesting in that I wasn't quite sure what the message of the movie was meant to be. I thought it may have been that people value material objects over human life, but I think in general it was meant to convey that people have the ability to make the right decisions and think for themselves. Overall I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if I particularly care for the movie itself. But once again, Humphrey Bogart does an amazing acting job in this film. Some people say this role was made for him, and I'd agree because he is just so wonderful in it. I would also say it is a noir film, a Hollywood crime drama. The photography is very well done in this film and it has great low-key lighting, which is typical of film noir. The visual composition of the shots is done very well too, as well as the editing. This is not my favorite Humphrey Bogart film though; Casablanca is but it is still a well made film. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in crime/detective films.</fullReview>

Bogart's part in this movie and his part in Casablanca are similar and is faced with similar issues that get solved in a similar fashion.The witty sarcastic humor in this film by itself makes this movie worth watching because even if you don't like the plot you will still enjoy the comedy embedded in there. In the ending one the part which was a little saddening is that he seems as if he fell in love but chose to not keep the girl when he clearly has the chance to do that.

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon is about a bunch of different people who are all after a gold falcon studded with priceless jewels. As detective Spade (Bogart) attempts to find the killer of his partner, her stumbles upon a group of men who are searching for the special falcon, and a woman who got in over her head. Bogart ends up getting his hands on the falcon and arranges to sell it to the group of men. After he sells it to the men, they all learn that it's a fake. In the end the group of men go off to search for the real one and the woman gets arrested for his partners murder. When I watched the trailer for this film I thought I wouldn't like it at all. Despite what I thought I gave the movie a try, and I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. I give this film an 8 out of 10 because of how well the movie is done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story was dark and rather disturbing due to the complexity of the plot, after all it's a novel by a great American writer adapted to the screen, and the various portraits of evil and brooding men. The photography was atmospheric, conveying all the heat and suspense artfully. I liked how well the story was developed as the film went along how the anticipation was carefully built and released in the well arranged conversations and dialogues between the characters. The acting was my favorite part though especially Sydney Greenstreet as Mr. Gutman, he was great at portraying his characters creepy nature, there was something about his size and manner of speaking that just made me uncomfortable. Humphrey Bogart was the quintessential detective bad-ass, he was cool and slick and I rooted for him even though he had a bit of an attitude.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematographic in this film was very affective. The low-key lighting gave it a dramatic effect, and the cameras angles brought a new perspective for viewers. The camera's low angle at times would show the ceilings of rooms. The scene where Sam Spade and Kasper Gutman are walking from one room to another, and then down a long hallway then up close to Spade's face then a glance at Gutman's stomach as Spade sees it. This was a very sophisticated camera shot for films of this time.The scenes and camera work were very interesting and distinct in this film. I also really enjoy watching Humphrey Bogart on screen. They couldn't have picked a better actor for the role, he always gets into his characters to the point that you forget you're watching an actor on screen. In the end he makes a decision similar to the one Bogart had to make at the end of Casablanca. it's interesting how the two have such similarities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I have seen a movie with Bogart that I haven't loved! This was an awesome film, with lots of suspense and brilliantly played out mystery. The story and relationship between characters was crazy, but that's what made it so good, for you were always left with a question in your mind as to when and what the next twist was going to be. Bogart was a brilliant detective, he did an excellent job playing the suave, cool, and brilliant. As the movie progressed you grew to love Bogart's character 'Spade' he was always ahead of the game, which not only surprises the antagonists, but also wows the audience. Huston did a fantastic job writing the story, he also gave Spade some really great lines that made you laugh your butt off and cheer for his brilliancy! My favorite line of Spade's was: after someone complained about his brilliancy, boldness, and accuracy Spade said, "What do you want me to do? Learn to stutter?" It was so brilliant and the way Bogart said it was just awesome! Phenomenal job I was blown away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The stuff dreams are made of"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just going to say this right now; I love film noir. It's always been one of my favorite genres for it's stylish cinematography, engaging stories, and overall dark tone. It's really fascinating seeing how this genre has evolved over the decades, and how they're just as big as they were years ago. But with all the great film noirs out there, I consider The Maltese Falcon the trendsetter of this genre. I don't want to say too much about this film, because knowing me; I'd probably give everything away. So I'll just keep it simple. Well it's everything I just described that makes this genre great. It has great cinematography, great atmosphere, great story, and great characters. It's just so classic it already seems like a cliché. This is one of Humphrey Bogart's best roles; he's one of the main reasons this movie is so great. He keeps it entertaining with his great performance; and I consider it his second best role (Casablanca being the best). Another reason I love this film is the villains. Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet as the villains are just classic bad guys, and I think they're equally as good as Bogart. Like I said, this is just a classic detective story; and it's great seeing these classic staples of the Golden Age of Hollywood. I love these kinds of movies for the cinematography, and watching the story unravel. I do think there are better mystery movies out there, but The Maltese Falcon is absolute Hollywood perfection. And much like the falcon statue itself, "it's the stuff dreams are made of".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for The Maltese Falcon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon falls among the better films that I have seen from the 1930's. This movie actually has an impressive story line, acting, and set. There aren't many flaws that I picked up on. This could be because I was too busy trying to keep up with what was going on in the movie rather than spending time searching for what was wrong with it. I enjoyed this. The movie may have been fast paced, but it keeps the audience interested, wanting to know what was going to happen next; they barely have time to predict it before the next exciting thing was going on. The story focuses on a group of mischievous people trying to track down a one of a kind falcon statue that is said to be worth a lot of money, and during their journey they come across a lot of drama and violence. I think I enjoyed this movie so much because it has an actual interesting story and the characters coincided with the script and layout of the film. I must say Humphrey Bogart did impress me much more with this film than in Casablanca, and is another main reason why I enjoyed this film so much. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who was looking to see a great old time film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stuff that film noir dreams are made of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston's take on the "The Maltese Falcon" (1941) was already the third adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's novel bearing the same title. Paradoxically it was this third attempt that marked the birth of something new: the genre of film noir. Many would follow in its footsteps repeating the same formula, but it was all here already: The expressionistic black-and-white visual style with its emphasis on the contrast between light and shadow, the elaborate scheme with lots of twists and turns, the cool private eye, the femme fatale - and an ending where the hero doesn't just get the girl and lives happily ever after. The dialogs have edge, are full of irony and black humor, entirely unknown in this capacity in earlier productions. In the center of it all: a certain Humphrey Bogart in his first major role which fits him like a glove, directed by the also debuting John Huston. Starring is furthermore the paradigm of what Hitchcock would call a "MacGuffin", a plot device created just for the purpose of driving the action: the titular Maltese Falcon.The film today is often under-appreciated - too many movies imitated, built on or considerably improved its creative new approach. Even the unshakeable, cynic sleuth Bogart with the "I do what needs to be done" attitude, the slimy Peter Lorre and the shifty Sydney Greenstreet would play similar roles again and again, and the influence the original had is therefore often overlooked. But make no mistake: The "Falcon" for the first time condensed style, great characterization and an intricate multilayered plot into an entertaining detective mystery, set in a world removed from our own that follows its idiosyncratic dark rules. The elusive "Falcon" still soars today for those who listen to its call - he's the cinematic pathfinder many others drew from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embodies so naturally so much of what the noir genre is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you're going back and watching classic films, sometimes you happen upon something that encapsulates its style or genre so essentially that you mistake it for being unoriginal. That's how I felt initially about "The Maltese Falcon," but it's far from unoriginal, especially when you consider the amount of talent it brought to the big screen in John Huston, Sydney Greenstreet and Humphrey Bogart.Of course the genre to which we're speaking in this case is film noir, evident enough by the amount of smoking in the film and the main character being a private investigator, though surprisingly there's no narration. Plus, it's driven by mystery and deception.Bogart stars as Sam Spade, whose P.I. firm of Spade and Archer gets a shakeup when a women identifying herself as Ms. Wonderly (Mary Astor) comes to their office and asks that they tail a Mr. Thursby, who she says ran off with her sister. Archer takes the job, though the woman's innocence looks like a sure rouse.Well, turns out indeed that none of that was true, as that evening both Archer and Thursby are found dead. Spade knows of the connection, and it puts him in a way with the police. He needs answers from Wonderly, who turns out to be named Brigid O'Shaughnessy, but he also needs money. He agrees to put up with her lies so long as he gets paid and gets a lead so that he can stay a step ahead of the police.Spade isn't crooked, but he's no saint of a main character. He's driven by the same things as the many supporting characters that become wrapped in this mystery and he's just as self- serving and manipulative. Spade sticks to his guns, which involves never getting in so deep that he can't keep his head above it all.Because Bogart practically created the mold for the noir protagonist, he deserves all the credit in the world as Spade. He owns every scene in the film (granted the camera only leaves his side once at the very beginning) and Only Peter Lorre, one of the greatest character actors of all time, can go toe-to-toe with Bogart as Joel Cairo, one of the men after the titular statuette. Astor has her moments in the film as her character's shell starts to finally crack at the end, but Bogart is the man here.Mystery drives the "The Maltese Falcon" more than suspense. The closer to the end the more the suspense takes over, but in the early going we are left without a clue as to what's going on; all we can tell is that everyone, especially Brigid, is probably lying. Spade has to work really hard to get a modicum of truth out of anyone, and only a person of his awareness has what it takes to sort through it all.The film is forthright in its deception and wastes no time trying to convince you of anything one particular thing being the truth. It makes it hard to care much at the beginning, but as all the players come into the picture with Brigid, Cairo, Wilmer (Elisha Cook Jr.) and Kasper Gutman (Greenstreet) it's easier to get a bit more invested in the outcome.As a first time director, Huston excels down the stretch in his debut and also at ratcheting up our interest after one of the film's many long dialogue-heavy scenes usually by giving us a mysterious or suspenseful image to carry our interest into the next scene or creating a major tone shift. It's not quite to a Hitchcockian degree, but it has a similar effect.When it's not long-winded "The Maltese Falcon" works. It engages its audience and keeps things interesting until the end with some performances that simply have come to define Hollywood's most classic genre.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>The Maltese Falcon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the directorial debut of John Huston (The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King), and I had really good things about it, even before I saw it listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically, set in 1941 San Francisco, Miss Ruth Wonderly (Mary Astor) comes to see private investigators Samuel Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) claiming that her sister has gone missing after being involved with a man called Floyd Thursby, and Archer offers to follow her as she meets this man at night. Spade meets Police Detective Tom Polhaus (Ward Bond) at the scene after being told that Archer was killed, and after calling Wonderly's hotel where she has checked out, and being grilled by Polhaus and his supervisor Lieutenant Dundy (Barton MacLane), he is told that Thursby was killed too. After a visit from Archer's wife Iva (Gladys George), who he was having an affair with, Spade meets Wonderly, who reveals her true name as Brigid O'Shaughnessy, she believes Thursby killed Archer, but has no idea who killed his partner, so he agrees to investigate both murders. Back in his office Spade is held at gunpoint by Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) who offers him $5,000 to help find a "black figure of a bird", there is a small fight between them, but he is apparently hired, and seeing O'Shaughnessy he sees that she and Cairo know each other. Being followed next morning by Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.), Spade tells him to pass his boss, the "Fat Man", aka Kasper Gutman (Oscar nominated Sydney Greenstreet), before he meets him in person, the boss is looking for a valuable bird statue called The Maltese Falcon, and after some attempted escapes he is offered $25,000 and a quarter of the sales from the bird. After having his drink spiked Spade wakes and sees a newspaper article with the departure time of the freighter La Paloma circled, so he goes to the dock, but it was on fire, so he returns to his office, and a man, Captain Jacoby (Walter Huston) bursts in clutching something wrapped in newspaper, he falls down dead, and the wrapped item is The Maltese Falcon. He phones Brigid to arrange a meeting to give her the bird, and after the phone goes dead he rushes to the address she gave him, an empty lot, so he returns home to find her, as well as Gutman, Cairo and Wilmer waiting for him, with guns pointed. Spade will not accept the $10,000 from Gutman unless he can hand in someone to take the responsibility for the murders of Archer, Thursby and Jacoby, he suggests Wilmer, and after negotiations this is agreed, and in a fight he is knocked out and given all the details he needs to make it convincing. The next day office secretary Effie Perine (Lee Patrick) brings in The Maltese Falcon for Gutman, but he is devastated to find out that the black statue is a fake, so he and Cairo decide to head back to Istanbul to continue their search for the real thing, and despite his feelings for her, Spade turns in Brigid for the murder of Archer. Also starring James Burke as Luke, Murray Alper as Frank Richman and John Hamilton as Bryan. Bogart established himself with this role as a leading actor, having done mostly supporting roles before, and with a witty script by Huston he really delivers his lines well, and the supporting cast are all good too, with Astor playing against type being the Femme Fetale, and Greenstreet proving himself a worthy Oscar nominee with subtle villain performance. I will confess I thought this was going to be different, I was expecting a gangster style treasure hunt film, and I didn't fully understand everything going on, but what I did pick up on was worth watching, it is a worthwhile classic film noir. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay for Huston. Humpherey Bogart was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 27 on The World's Greatest Actor, "The stuff that dreams are of made." was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 26 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge noir success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Maltese Falcon the viewer is able to get that eerie noir feeling right from the start. It strings you and doesn't let you move until the very last minute. That's what you would expect from a classic in this genre. It's surprising to say that this is John Huston's first feature film. A real career starter, as it quickly arose to the position of a quintessential entry in its type.It was also a breakthrough performance for Humphrey Bogart. After a few supporting roles and a few niche crime films he finally got a chance to present himself in the most memorable way. He plays Sam Spade, who, along with his partner Miles Archer, operates a detective agency. The boys are on a bit of hiatus, until that one night, when they are approached by a mysterious Mrs. Wonderly (later Brigid O'Shaughnessy). This meeting changes everything ? Archer is killed and Sam is left with an enormously puzzling, and murderous, riddle to solve. At this point it's easy to say that Bogart is the true, powerful force that steers the movie on its righteous path. This movie proved, not for the last time, that he was born for roles like this one.And apart from his performance it's crucial to mention other famous personalities that appear in this film. Peter Lorre is great as an overly anxious and ill-tempered Joel Cairo. But even more amazing is Sydney Greenstreet as Kasper Gutman, the greedy mastermind behind the heist. I love how he mixed the character's serious attitude with some of his witty and humorous mockeries. Then there is also Elisha Cook Jr. as Wilmer Cook, the weak-minded bodyguard and the biggest sissy of all.As for females in this picture, of course the one that plays the biggest part (and presumably the only one worth mentioning) is Mary Astor, who shines as Mrs. O'Shaughnessy. She is the cause of the chaotic turmoil that drew Sam into this foolish game of life-and-death in the endless race for the biggest prize of them all?Right now you are probably wondering why I didn't even once mention the titular Maltese Falcon, a bird statue of such tremendous value. People kill others just to put their hands on it. Well, as it comes out, it's basically used in the movie as a film plot device, called MacGuffin (the viewer knows that the object is highly desirable, but he doesn't know why. The narration leaves it open for interpretation). Actually, throughout the movie it is sometimes easy to forget what the whole mess is about. It appears back in the thrilling climax, as we have an opportunity to hear about its history and, finally, get a glimpse of it.'The stuff that dreams are made of.' ? utters Sam about the statue at the very end. This simple sentence definitely became one of the most quoted in the history of moving images.Considering the fact that the movie is mostly based on the speaking sequences makes the very clever dialogues even more appealing. And the overly gray atmosphere provides for a true noir experience. The one that will be appreciated by film viewers everywhere for ages. So if you consider broadening your knowledge in this specific genre, you don't want to miss out on watching The Maltese Falcon. Without the use of any special effects, the thrills that it delivers are on the highest possible level.</fullReview>

What a wonderfully black plot! A total antidote for the usual Hollywood happy ending.And the acting is a thing of beauty. I have watched this movie at least five times and have enjoyed it every time.The quintessential Film Noir movie.Even the fact that it is filmed in black and white is a joy, I love the cinematography and the look of the interiors,the look of the buildings, wonderful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A noir landmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many classic films, The Maltese Falcon just can't be as impressive now as it was when it was released. The main reason, however, is not that the film aged badly; rather that almost every aspect of it was copied, homaged and parodied so many times since, that it may appear as a a cliché, when in fact it's the original. For good reason it's often known as the original Film Noir - not counting early proto-examples like M - as it defined almost every rule of the genre (not including, surprisingly enough, first-person narration) so well, that less than a decade later it was easy for directors like Carol Reed, Orson Welles and Billy Wilder to deconstruct them effectively, making The Maltese Falcon look like a too simplistic take on a genre only a few years after it was made.But it stands quite well on its own merit, better in fact than many other thrillers of its time, thanks largely to the gorgeous black &amp; white cinematography, and thanks to the excellent performances from the entire cast bust especially Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet, who are incredibly realistic and convincing compared to what was the norm in American cinema at the time. While it doesn't quite stand the test of time as the masterpiece it's often named as, it does so as a very solid thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pivotal Moment in American Movies' History ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many aspects, "The Maltese Falcon" doesn't really help when it comes to convince people uninterested by anything 'old' or in black and white. You might want to prove that this is the film that established Humphrey Bogart's stardom as the new anti-heroic figure of American Cinema, or as everyone knows, paved the way for the noir genre, at a crucial time when people matured enough by World War II could assimilate the cynical and dark undertones that governed the hearts of the characters, in a shadowy black-and-white cinematography. You might as well praise the merits of John Huston's directorial debut and his powerful writing transcended by Bogie's unique nasal delivery. Anyway, say what you want about "The Maltese Falcon", its reputation is untouchable, but it's one of these films that need an extremely strong attention and mind-dedication, or in the best case, a second viewing, to appreciate its greatness.It's almost impossible to summarize the plot while discussing or reviewing the film, everything goes so fast, the plot is amazingly intricate, you'd probably be called a genius if you got everything at the end on one viewing, but the movie is not about the plot, it's a movie of style and characters. Take the villains' team, "The Maltese Falcon" is supported by a trio of supporting characters as eccentric as unscrupulous: Peter Lorre, the sinister looking but delicate and suave Joel Cairo, Elisha Cook Jr., the constantly bullied character actor as Wilmer Cook, and towering them, there's Sidney Greenstreet as Kasper Gutman, the refined mastermind in a deservedly Oscar-nominated performance. Look at them three, you might never have seen "The Maltese Falcon", but you did see these archetypal characters in a cartoon, or a film, the overweight, hypocritically friendly crime boss, the refined effeminate psycho and the young thug, and it's a delight to watch them as everyone has at least one shining moment.The mission of these villains is to get a precious statuette, by any means and at any price, the 'Maltese Falcon', a Golden Falcon "encrusted from beak to claw with rarest jewels" offered by the Maltese Templar Knights to the King of Spain, before being stolen by pirates, and whoever owned the Falcon rarely died of natural causes. Many recurrent 'Hustonian' themes are foreshadowed in this masterful debut : the alienating power of greed to make one sell his soul, a cynical and detached view of life made of murder and deception, the eternal theme of failure highlighted by the realization that the bird is fake, letting all the protagonists in an equal position of losers. But a loser, Sam Spade certainly isn't, as the movie ultimately consecrates the triumph of noble and virile principles over manipulative feelings.This is probably the highlight of the film, when Brigid O'Shaughnessy, Mary Astor as the deceitful femme-fatale who asked for Spade's protection, revealed herself to be a calculating monster under that gracious mask of femininity, and eventually the murderess of Sam Spade's partner, Archie Miles. Sam didn't like Miles, he hardly blinked an eye when he learned about his death; he apparently had an affair with his wife, which quite doesn't paint a sympathetic portrait of the character, and makes him suspect number one in the police's book; but when Spade realized that Brigid, who played so well the part of the poor victim, inspiring his famous "You're good. You're very good" comment, killed his partner, he knew he could never have lived with himself if he covered her. The unforgettable line "I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck" is the perfect illustration of Spade's cynical predisposition to accept the fate of a person he genuinely loves, to accept the possibility of never seeing her again, as a man of principles. People were tougher in these times, and needed a model, someone they could identify with on the big screen, the final minute is simply the revelation of a character, of an actor, of a new star.Humphrey Bogart is one of these actors who achieved stardom the hard way, the long way but when he did, he never left it, and after "The Maltese Falcon", he never was a second-billed actor. Only for that, Huston's film deserves all the praise. Indeed the 'Falcon' helped to widen the range of characters Bogie could play, he who got his breakthrough role as Duke Mantee, the ruthless villain in "The Petrified Forest" gave such an electrifying performance, he had a short career, being the bad guy that makes the other bad guy look good (James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson) until Huston wrote him another leading bad-guy role for "High Sierra". But before becoming Bogart the apathetic and romantic lead that would pair up with the torrid Lauren Bacall, he needed a transition role, Sam Spade, the winning card of a brilliant career, where Bogart became the quintessential tough guy, at a time where male stars had to look like Clark Gable or Tyrone Power. Bogart looked like an ordinary man with an everyday look, but a man with an attitude, a heart, and a character. It's interesting how the statuette and scene stealer Gutman, always mentions what a character Sam Spade is. Spade inspired the respect of his own enemies and that was Bogie, the kind of man, you could love or hate, but never disrespect, before another defining role in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre".I think this characteristic mirrors what I think of "The Maltese Falcon' you might not like it, finding it too talkative, too slow, too boring, but never deny its greatness and significance in cinema's history. There would be a before and after 'Falcon', at least for Bogart, but we're talking about the greatest American star. And what better conclusion than paraphrasing his iconic quote and saying that "The Maltese Falcon" is simply the stuff that cinematic dreams are made out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film noir with an iconic performance from Humphrey Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For John Huston's directorial debut he chose to adapt Dashiell Hammett's hard-boiled mystery novel "The Maltese Falcon", which had already been adapted twice before (with little success). The result was a highly influential film that is today revered as a classic of American cinema.The story revolves around private eye Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) of Spade &amp; Archer detective agency. When Archer is bumped off while trailing a suspect Spade takes over the case and becomes embroiled in a mystery surrounding the titular bird.One of the film's strengths is the Oscar-nominated script by John Huston. It's been a while since I read the novel so I can't recall precisely how faithful it is but it bears all of the marks of quality craftsmanship in any case.Of course, the script wouldn't seem as impressive without some quality acting talent to bring it to life. Humphrey Bogart delivers one of the best loved performances of his career while Mary Astor shines in the female lead. However, in my opinion the film's best performance comes from the Oscar-nominated Sydney Greenstreet (in his first film role, no less). Then there's also Peter Lorre, who contributes a colourful performance in support.Huston's direction seems to show a bit of inexperience but that's a minor point. Most of the time, his direction, the cinematography of Arthur Edeson &amp; the Adolph Deutsch score combine to produce a trend-setting style. Some have referred to the film as the first major work in the film noir genre.In the end, while I appreciate "The Maltese Falcon" I think that it pales just a bit in comparison to 1942's "Casablanca", which reunited a few of the stars. However, since "Casablanca" is practically flawless there are few films that wouldn't suffer from comparison. In any case, "The Maltese Falcon" is a sterling example of film noir, justifiably well remembered after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A noir classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon, the film which for many defines noir. The film which many would argue invented noir. If this was indeed the first film noir the genre could hardly have gotten off to a better start. Powered by a thoroughly captivating performance from Humphrey Bogart the film is an undoubted triumph. And if it could be said to have invented noir it also in a way invented Bogart. This was the film which began his rise from background studio player to Hollywood legend. But for as memorable as Bogart is in the film he is by no means alone in his brilliance here. Mary Astor, Peter Lorre and a delightfully fiendish Sydney Greenstreet are all outstanding as well, each a worthy foil for Bogart. Great acting combined with a great, mysterious story. That's a clear recipe for success.The story unfolds in San Francisco with Bogart playing private investigator Sam Spade. He and his partner, Miles Archer, take on a seemingly simple case. A woman, Ruth Wonderly, hires them to tail a man named Floyd Thursby. Something to do with retrieving Ruth's wayward sister who is traveling with Thursby. Simple. Then Archer and Thursby turn up dead. Less simple. Now Sam Spade's got a mess on his hands. He's got a dead partner. And he's got the police sniffing around thinking he killed Thursby to avenge that dead partner. He's going to need to go to Ruth Wonderly and have her make some sense out of all of this. Which would be much easier if Ruth Wonderly actually existed.When Sam tracks down Ruth she comes clean. Her real name is Brigid O'Shaughnessy. The story about her missing sister was a bunch of hogwash. The real story? Well, we're not going to get the real story just yet. Even when Brigid "comes clean" she seems to have quite a problem in forcing the truth out of her mouth. She's still hiding something. What is this all about? Well ultimately of course it is about the Maltese Falcon. The black bird. What is the Maltese Falcon? That will be revealed in time. For now all we, and Sam Spade, really need to know is that people are willing to kill for it.It's a story of twists and turns, of lies and double-crosses. And undoubted danger. Menacing figures will enter the fray. The Fat Man, for instance. Real name Kasper Gutman. Downright terrifying he would be if not for the fact that, as played by Greenstreet, he comes across as a rather jovial fellow. Greenstreet created a terrific character here, one with great, quirky personality. A fiend, but a charming fiend. A man for whom obtaining the Maltese Falcon is his life's quest. His partner in crime is Joel Cairo, as played by Lorre. Cairo's no menace, he knows the value of the Falcon and wants it desperately but if he has to resort to violence to get it he's got problems. Violence is not his forte. When violence is called for that's what the Fat Man's got Wilmer for. Elisha Cook Jr. plays this part, the henchman who would love nothing more than to empty a few slugs into Sam Spade. Overshadowed by the bigger stars Cook does very well with this smaller role. All the supporting players do well, there's not a false step anywhere. But of course the movie belongs to Sam Spade. To Bogart.Bogart's performance in this film is legendary, and rightly so. Everything swirls around him. It's a great story, full of great drama and mystery, punctuated by wonderfully memorable dialogue. If the story has any flaw at all it would probably be that Sam Spade falls for Brigid O'Shaughnessy much too quickly, especially considering what she's gotten him caught up in. Everything unfolds so quickly he really has no time to know her, much less love her. But if Sam and Brigid have real feelings for each other that will make the climax much more powerful and dramatic. So even if this whirlwind would-be romance strains credulity a bit we'll just go with it. With the way Bogart and Astor play off one another so beautifully it's hard to really complain. With this film it is very hard to complain about anything. The Maltese Falcon. The stuff that dreams are made of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Very Best of the Film Noir Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would normally put the plot here, but the film is so well known, I will not even bother.Mary Astor stars, looking like a hideous mess. Peter Lorre, one of my all-time favorites, appears as a hapless henchman. And Humphrey Bogart is the legendary Sam Spade, the private detective that trumps all others (though I think Adrian Monk gives him a run for his money for private eyes based in San Francisco).Everything about this film was practically perfect, with Bogart being a very smart yet seedy character, conning people trying to con him, getting the girl, getting blamed for murder, fighting crime... it was just great. The film's best parts are when the dialogue gets out of hand and the characters try to talk over each other and scam one another... such classic personality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Maltese Falcon is like a mind game played by crafty people. It is constantly twisting and turning, yet in the end, it works very well as an old-school mystery-drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In classical Hollywood cinema, The Maltese Falcon came first on many counts. It was the first film directed by the legendary John Huston, the director of classics such as The African Queen (1951) and The Treasure of Sierra Madre (1948). It was also the film that propelled Humphrey Bogart from a B-list nobody to an A-list hero, molding him into one of the medium's greatest stars. In addition, the film was also one of the first few films that kick-started the sub-genre of film noir, influencing many films from Reed's The Third Man (1949) to Polanski's Chinatown (1974).The Maltese Falcon brought Peter Lorre (who made his name as the villain in Lang's M (1931)) and Sydney Greenstreet into the limelight as talented supporting actors, both of whom would collaborate with Bogart again in Curtiz's Casablanca (1942). Bogart plays Sam Spade who runs a private investigation agency together with Miles Archer, his co-partner. When a mysterious woman calls upon them to help her tail a suspect, Archer is murdered that night. Spade digs into the mystery and finds himself embroiled in a crime to steal a prized statuette of a falcon.The Maltese Falcon features memorable performances from Bogart, Lorre, and Greenstreet. Dialogue-heavy and with a strong focus on character development, Huston's film is neatly balanced between seriousness and playfulness. Sarcastic exchanges of remarks by the trio as they try to one up each other in an elaborate game of verbal ping-pong inject both comic relief and tension to the proceedings. The screenplay, also written by Huston, is deservedly nominated for an Oscar.Igniting the Hollywood film noir wave of the 1940s, The Maltese Falcon may not have as distinct a visual style as Casablanca or Welles' Citizen Kane (1941) where low-intensity lighting and shadows create a strong contrast between black and white, but it has a strong plot rooted in crime-fiction with the central figure as a cynical private detective who is not your archetypal hero. Huston's feature debut lays some of the groundwork that would become a staple of future noir pictures.The Maltese Falcon remains engaging by modern standards. By opting not to show the statuette of the falcon until the last fifteen minutes, Huston creates intrigue in the viewer. Moreover, the characters in the film do seem to have hidden agendas and ulterior motives, but they never reveal their true intentions but merely hint at what is to be expected. In a way, The Maltese Falcon is like a mind game played by crafty people. It is constantly twisting and turning, yet in the end, it works very well as an old-school mystery-drama.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stuff that dreams are made of &amp; the stuff that started an amazing style of film making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't give any plot details here except that this is a wonderful crime mystery that started the classic film noir period of Hollywood. The movie starts with these lines scrolling. "In 1539, the Knights Templar of Malta, paid tribute to Charles V of Spain, by sending him a Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with rarest jewels ----- but pirates seized the galley carrying this priceless token and the fate of the Maltese Falcon remains a mystery to this day ---". So we know that we have to find the falcon &amp; in the process we deal with lies, murders, characters full of deceit &amp; cunningness. You know the typical film noir settings.The Maltese Falcon is the first movie directed by John Huston who in his illustrious career was nominated for 15 Oscars. The beauty of the film is that there is not a single waste line nor a single waste shot nor a single waste performance. Everything is so perfect &amp; each character is very well developed. I felt Huston has filtered the movie like water, over &amp; over, until it became so perfect.The performances in the movie were of the highest order.Brigid O'Shaughnessy is not your typical film noir femme fatale as this is only the start of bigstudio film noir. I felt that Brigid O'Shaughnessy was the perfect template for the future femme fatales such as say Double Indemnity's Phyllis Dietrichson or Vertigo's Madeleine Elster. Although Brigid was responsible for the deaths of 3 people she never appears as a threat to the protagonist Sam Spade. Astor was very good in the movie. She keeps her best for the climax confrontation with Bogart.Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo gave an amazing performance. You can see the power of his performance in the climax where he goes from delighted look while opening the package - exploding on Gutman after knowing the truth about Maltese Falcon - controlled dialogue &amp; expression after Gutman says that they will revisit Istanbul. Simply brilliant.Sydney Greenstreet enters the movie only around the 50 minute mark. He was 60 years old, this was his debut performance &amp; he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. His years of stage experience shows in his portrayal of Kasper "Fat Man" Gutman. Those subtle expressions &amp; gentle laughs. Simply wonderful. Elisha Cook Jr. in one of his early roles as Wilmer "Little Boy" Cook, the cold assistant to Gutman is good. Do the words Fat Man &amp; Little Boy ring anything in your mind?Bogart lived the role of Sam Spade. That he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for this is quite a puzzle for me. Either the real nominees have given all-time greatest performances or the Academy is dumb. Bogart's Sam Spade is one of the meanest, ruthless heroes that you will see. I heard that the original Sam Spade in the novel was a 6 feet heavy built figure. Bogart is not a big person physically but he more than makes it up with his voice &amp; mannerisms. See that scene where he mocks his partner's widow by saying "You killed my husband Sam. Be kind to me". His clap, his smile &amp; his subtle expressions in that scene were as mean as you could see anywhere. Or that scene where he says "Ya with $10000 insurance, no children &amp; a wife who doesn't like him" about his dead partner. Or the scene where he says "When you're slapped, you'll take it &amp; like it" and slaps Joel Cairo. Bogart's Sam Spade is arguably the most ungenerous &amp; masculine character until Marlon Brando gave that tour de force performance as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar named Desire. In a way, even Sam Spade was not a complete film noir protagonist because he was always in control of the situation except for that one scene in which he is intoxicated. Even there I didn't felt that he could be harmed.Think about the fact that Bogart was not even the first choice to play Sam Spade.Cinematography is by Arthur Edeson, who has worked for almost a 100 movies prior to this &amp; he also did Casablanca later. He used some very innovative angles. You can observe that for most part of the film, the position of the camera is at the waist level. So we have a lot of low- angle shots which were made more famous later in Citizen Kane. The low- angle makes the already sinister characters more sinister.Max Steiner gave good background score for the movie. Editing is one of the key things for a crime mystery. Owen Marks did a fantastic job with editing. I only found one bad cut in the entire movie where Spade sends off Iva Archer before he gets a call to meet Gutman.All in all with one of the best ensemble performances that you would see in a film noir, superb script &amp; directing, great technical achievements this is one of those films that you shouldn't miss.In fact, I was so engrossed &amp; immersed in the story &amp; the performances the 1st time I viewed this that I completely forgot about the other aspects of the film. I rewatched this immediately to concentrate on the other technical aspects. For me the movie, the protagonist &amp; the femme fatale are not the ideal film noirs but rather the initial models which were developed into more defined figures for the next 2 decades of film noir. So, in a line, what is The Maltese Falcon? The stuff that dreams are made of &amp; the stuff that started an amazing style of film making.If you are interested in film noir, see my brief review of the BBC program The Rules of Film Noir at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1498172/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes the characters are a bit cardboard, and O'Shaughnessy's deadliness may seem a bit unsupported. Or is that just testament to the awful nature of evil? More significantly, perhaps, The Maltese Falcon could be a radio show, think about it!But somehow this film flat-out works. I think the talkiness may enhance the tension. You stick with the dialog, the characters, their interactions. There's nothing else to divert you, no pretty scenery. (I must say I do love the shot from floor level looking up at the seated Gutman.) There are some very funny lines (most if not all in the novel, props to Dashiell Hammett), but their tone is always very wise-guy. This is comic relief of a special type, if it is comic relief at all.There's a particular plot device here: two sides chasing after the same object. It's very effective. It's what drives The DaVinci Code. But The DaVinci Code is The Maltese Falcon on steroids. This is the pure form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stuff Dreams Are Made Of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How did it take ten years for Humprey Bogart to become a star? And how did it take three versions of Dashiell Hammett's story to make a great film? Who knows, but the important thing is Humphrey Bogart did become a star, and Dashiell Hammett's story did become one of the greatest films ever. First time director John Huston wrote a screenplay that stuck to what was already a great tale of detective Sam Spade (Bogie) and his involvement with a group of people (Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Elisha Cook) looking for the titular statue. The performances are all first rate (while Astor isn't up to the level of the other leads, she is definitely not as bad as some critics say), the script is incredibly well written, and the overall ambiance is as good as "Double Indemnity". Like so many other greats, from "Gone With the Wind" to "Casablanca", "The Maltese Falcon" also understands that a great ending line can easily become immortal, and of course today even people who haven't heard of the film probably know "The stuff dreams are made of". Although Fritz Lang's German film "M" technically began film noir, "The Maltese Falcon" was really the first of the genre to come out of Hollywood. As the genre is probably my favorite, I can tell you candidly that having seen just about every film noir there is, "The Maltese Falcon" is easily one of the three best, and undoubtedly an essential film that everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just by reading the name, you can't help but become interested in this movie. Both words awake a feeling of intrigue within us. Malta is such a little known country for most of us, and the falcon is such a grand animal, that we just rub our hands in expectations, and even more nowadays, since back then, both Boggart, and debuting director John Huston were mostly unknown.By the end of the movie, Spade (Boggart) will not be the only name you'll remember, because event though he dominates the screen by just being there, it is this wonderful portrayal of a detective which remains in our memories, and which has served as a role model for all detective characters after him. The rest of the cast is also perfectly chosen, specially by the newcomer screen actor Sydney Greenstreet, who plays Kasper Gutman, the fat guy, and another role model for villains in movies from James Bond to Mission Impossible. Cairo, portrayed by Peter Lorre, fits perfectly on his role, having that aura of queerness and ambition for the valuable artifact, and of course Mary Astor, even though her romance with Spade is not completely believable. The real magic of the cast relies on the chemistry all this actors share on screen, specially on the final scene.John Huston portrays for the first time on his career what greed can lead people to do and makes us cheer up for the Boggart character, whom even though is not an entirely politically correct character, still manages to appear heroic in our eyes.Hollywood might be very different if this movie didn't exist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe it all started here. John Huston's The Maltese Falcon initiated a genre and influenced countless imitators. It was the first noir and even if it's not the best, it's still memorable and enjoyable.Humphrey Bogart plays Sam Spade, a vicious, cynical detective who cheats his best friend. But when the story of a black bird carrying jewels results in his friend's death, even Spade is bound by a unique code of honor to track the killer. In his journey he meets femme fatale Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor), the effeminate Joel Cairo (a lovely performance by Peter Lorre), and the comical Kasper Gutman (Sidney Greenstreet. It's hard to see in this collection of villains anything threatening by today's standards. However their fluency is unmatched.Dialogues were always the best part of these movies, with their back-and-forth battle of wits and cool one-liners. And there's never a moment without some amusing line.John Huston proved he was a great writer and director with this movie. Already we see a talent for intricate camera work and atmospheric cinematography. Although he's crafted better movies, this is still one of his best and an amazing classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Huston's directing debut, Sydney Greenstreet's acting debut, and Humphrey Bogart's break-through role all come together at the right time in this third and finally right adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's novel. Bogart is smooth and cool as Sam Spade, a witty and smart private detective who stumbles across a plot to nab a priceless falcon thanks to a woman with a mysterious motive (Mary Astor), a man with seemingly limitless resources (Greenstreet) and his bumbling sidekick (Peter Lorre).What makes this film so interesting is that there is hardly any action at all. There is only one seen shooting scene in the first ten minutes and after that it is simply following Spade around until he uncovers all he needs to. This shows Bogart's ability to carry a film, Huston's writing ability as well as his direction that perfectly enhances the plot and always keeps moving forward. Despite the lack of action, the story is never boring and the end result more than satisfying. If you like any kind of mystery, this is a must-see. It's also a classic film showing the beginning of a new Hollywood genre, film noir, that practically changed the path of the industry.</fullReview>

The acting a treat, especially Peter Lorre (one of my all time favourite actors) and Sydney Greenstreet. The Photography is excellent, and the direction is fabulous by the great John Huston. It's interesting to compare this with the other big debut of that year: Orson Welles's "Citizen Kane". Even if "Citizen Kane" is more remembered, "The Maltese Falcon" had a much more wider affect than "Citizen Kane" did at the time of its release, because "The Maltese Falcon" created a genre: Film Noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As classic as Noir gets.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something very genuine in the pleasure of watching classic movies, and probably especially so for film-noir. Movies today, except for a few art-house works, tend to become as much about grandiose and fanfare as much about the movie itself. But watching classic cinema detaches the marketing angle of the movie, and you tend to watch the movie for what it really is.The Maltese Falcon is celebrated as one of the best noir movies ever made, and rightly so. Bogart plays PI Sam Spade with such craft and character that you wonder if they make men like that anymore. From the way he handles news, situations, women and enemies to his own style in the way he stands, speaks and reacts - without ridicule, Sam Spade epitomizes the classic detective that we have grown up watching cartoon characters and stereotypes imitate - whether it is to shake off a tail, confront the cops, cunningly use the display of anger to evoke a reaction or turn on the charm for the women around him.Complementing him is a host of equally rich characters in the forms of the highly-quotable king-pinesque Kasper Gutman (played by then débutante Sydney Greenstreet), damsel-in distress/femme-fatale Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) and the conspiring Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.).The Maltese Falcon is not a very confusing movie. It uses a simple formula of limiting the audience's knowledge to what the detective knows. And as he unravels the mystery more and more, the eventual barrage of information leaves you reeling for a an explanation that makes sense. And when it does, it's just in time to find out something more! As the movie ends, it becomes easy to acknowledge the brilliance of the story's setup and resolution, and the path it takes to get there.My Rating --&gt; 4 of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As as moderate newcomer to noir, and beginning working through the IMDb top 250, this is probably the best way to start. It is a terrible shame films are not often written this well anymore, and have such excellent acting talent. Despite being raised on modern cinema myself, this easily outshines anything made recently in pretty much every way. Everything is good about it, a story with good twists to keep you guessing, great dialogue, great acting (Bogart and Lorre are both amazing) and great atmosphere and mood. If like I did at first, you have any misconceptions about older B&amp;W movies, after watching this you will certainly change your mind. Its nothing short of outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall interesting but the story has flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maltese Falcon is a detective story with Humphrey Bogart in the lead role. It is competently shot and has the proper period music, which as was usual at that time has something to be desired of its recording quality, but is otherwise perfectly acceptable. What is rough however is the story. The plot is interesting but there are a number of flaws, mostly centering around how this films deals with its characters and their dialogue.As the movie progresses, the conversation between the main male character and one of the ladies indicates a romantic relationship between them, but this comes as a surprise because the movie had not built up their relationship in that way so the romanticism comes out of nowhere, and ignores another relationship introduced at the beginning of the movie.At one point a new character suddenly shows up more than half way into the movie for a few seconds and from then on his name becomes an important part of the plot even though we was never properly introduced, so you start wondering if you missed a scene or something.It also has that really convenient bit where the bad guy decides to explain the events because...let's be honest, because the plot calls for it, which is not that bad other than being a movie cliché.There are several times when a character talks on the phone and talks in a manner that explains what is being said on the other side. Monologues are nice and all, but it also looks cheap and lazy, especially when it happens ten or fifteen times as it does.It is a shame because the acting itself is quite good and the dialogue can be smart. Humphrey Bogart has a specific style of delivering sentences, which does not sit comfortable with me, but he is acting well and he plays a fairly interesting character, a bit of a scoundrel in a way that you cannot quite read what his plan is. Something happens to his colleague and he shows no sorrow, which seemed like poor directing at first, but then his situation justifies such a reaction.One of the bad guys is played by Sydney Greenstreet. This old round fellow is adorable and speaks in the most amusing British manner. The movie could stand to lose Humphery Bogart, but not this guy.Another minor complaint is about the missed opportunity of an adventure. If you look at the poster which IMDb.com used for this movie, it shows the main character holding two pistols, a woman and the line "a story as explosive as his blazing automatics". Throughout the entire film only one shot is fired. The story is supposed to be about a golden falcon but the movie does not mention or show it nearly often enough. This could have been a much more exciting treasure hunt than what it ended up being ? a straight detective story, which is fine. This is the choice they are going with.Overall, an OK movie but the story has flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great classic, a great film, a great Bogart (Samuel Spade) in it, a great adaptation of the book. The film is generally a very faithful adaptation of the novel, although some scenes from the novel are not in the movie. It is a tribute to the "macho" image of the detective we have lost the past years. The film has a sense of humor the book lacks and an atmosphere that's hard to describe. A treasure that you could die for. A manly, unpredictable private detective with his own morality code. A crook smelling lavender (In the book. In the movie they say gardenias), a fat man and a breathtaking red-head, no one should trust. Those are the ingredients to the Dashiell Hammett story, which has been characterized as the best mystery novel ever written. (by Otto Penzler)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest and most enjoyable films I have seen. Bogart as Sam Spade is truly marvelous. Spade is sardonic, brave, devilish, knowing, a true character and possibly the most riveting on screen presence of all time. The plot is so engaging and inventive and the dialog so witty and sparky that I was welling up through sheer joy at the proceedings. It is also very moving in the standard sense. The noire-ish atmosphere is striking but not over done and every scene is framed beautifully and meticulously thought out. It is as tight a film as any thriller and puts most modern drama films to shame. I mean even the fight scenes are terrific. When Spade slaps around people it looks as if they really are getting a serious beating from a pro. The sound of the punching is not over the top like in some older films. It is as real as I've seen on film and I felt I was watching a film that was way ahead of it's time in that sense. I can't say enough good things about this picture. They almost certainly don't make 'em like this any more, and that's coming from a 27 year old who does like his occasional modern blockbuster. I have been banging on about this to all my family and friends and now it's your turn :) WATCH IT !!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did I kill him? I forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the novel, but I hear that it is even better than this, so it must be excellent(also, I understand that this is a close adaptation, and the only one at the time). This is one of those films that you hear you must take in at least once, so I was ecstatic to find this on sale. While I admit to overall liking The Big Sleep more than this(on account of Bacall, the romance and the relationship between her and Bogie... other than those three, they are amazing in all the same ways), this had me gripped throughout. I *love* noir, and this is one of the best of them, and required viewing for any fan of the genre. The femme fatales, and in general strong women, the funny, clever, sharp and swiftly delivered dialog, the editing and cinematography(the angles, the early pan onto the floor to reveal what it says on the window as the sunlight renders it readable there, and how incredibly *smooth* it all is) and the plot. There are a few holes in the story; however, this moves so fast, and you have to pay close attention to follow it all(and it won't hurt to treat yourself to additional exposures), that you barely realize this until afterwards, and it doesn't take away from the enjoyment at all. With deception at every turn, Sam Spade attempts to locate the legendary Maltese Falcon, with law officials convinced that he's involved with the death of two men. Humphrey is charming as always, Astor is compelling(you can sense that there's something to her role beyond the first impression she makes), Greenstreet is amiable(to an extent!), and this is Lorre at his sleaziest(without ceasing to be amusing). Elisha Cook Jr. is spot-on; I could go on. The mystery is engaging, and this is tense and suspenseful. There is disturbing content in this. The 2-Disc Special Edition DVD comes with an informative and researched commentary by the male lead's biographer Eric Lax, the documentaries Becoming Attractions and One Magnificent Bird(I will comment on them on their own sections here on IMDb), an authentic theater-going experience(when this movie was shown originally, there would be shorts, animated and live-action, before the feature presentation), meaning, The Gay Parisian, Breakdowns of 1941, Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt, Meet John Doughboy(all of which I will review on their individual pages here on the site), and finally, a trailer for this and one for Sgt. York, a minute and a half of newsreel footage, and one minute of make-up tests. I recommend this to anyone who likes this type of picture. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogey was perfect for his era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it. No one cares that this remake was too close to the 1931 original. No one cares that Bogey did better movies. No one cares what the box office performance was, or how long the movie is, or how YOU define film noir, or how YOU differentiate film noir from detective noir. This is the quintessential Bogart performance, hammered home by a similar performance in Casablanca. This is how we all (the baby-boomers) remember Bogey, and THIS is the Bogey we love. Did we love him as much as the submissive and sometimes mousy boat captain in "African Queen?" Well, of course we did. Did we love him as the gritty adventure-seeker in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre?" Well, of course we did. But we love him best while he's wearing the hat belonging to Sam Spade.I love this, even today, and watch it often.It rates a 9.4/10 on the Black and White scale from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often Imitated, But Original is the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many directors make one of their best films the first one they direct? John Huston does this here with the help of a great Hammett story which he helped adapt for the screen play. He had plenty of help from a great cast including Bogart, Greenstreet &amp; Peter Lorre.This was part of a group of films that Warner did in the early 1940's that put together Bogart et AL. and established him as a super star. It would lead to Casablanca and Sierra Madre and arguably some of the greatest films ever made in this era or perhaps in any era of film history.Sadly, the younger generation might not appreciate these films as much as they age, but the greatest generation has and they get better &amp; better over time. What is amazing is how Warner Brothers happened to assemble a group of films &amp; talent doing them during the late 1930's when they graduated from mob films into classic film noir. Warners &amp; Bogart made this film as much as staple of movies until the 1950's as any company ever did to influence an industry.Mary Astor is the femme fatal in this movie and any woman who played with Bogart always seems to be the right one. Bogart was one of those actors who brought out the best performances in actresses cast with him. This film had been made before in 1931 with famous actress Bebe Daniels, but once Warner released this version, the old one got completely over shadowed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw "The Maltese Falcon" I realized that Humphrey Bogart is legendary for a reason. Sure, there are some more famous movies that he's been in...but in this film he is so unflinching and believably bad ass that it makes you wonder 'was he really ACTING?' It seems like he's just being himself. More so than any performance I think I've ever seen.The story is great: a group of ne'er do wells is looking for a jewel-encrusted statue of a bird and private investigator Sam Spade (Bogie) gets mixed up in it. The plot takes many twists and turns and end in a grandiose Hollywood-style ending that leaves a wonderful taste in your mouth.Modern day actors should be forced to watch this movie fifty times before being allowed to act in a film. What Bogart does here has been unsurpassed. I love it. "The Maltese Falcon" is THE film noir classic.10 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Ado About Nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detective Sam Spade is the quintessential depiction of objectivism in this classic film noir of high wit and surprising twists. As all other characters chase "the stuff that dreams are made of", Spade casually cuts through their foolish antics with unwavering stoic strength. He is unmoved when his partner is murdered, as he is having an affair with his wife. He immediately casts all of Ms. O'Shaunessy's tales aside as "lies" in spite of her appealing looks and attempts at seduction (A man in love would not have sent her to the hole). He knocks out the quivering Joe Cairo with an easy jab. He deftly manipulates the Fat Man and his mutinous partners. As all of the other characters swirl about the film with high emotion, to the point of multiple murders, he is the bedrock of stark objectivism. He is the Anti-romantic hero in a dash for a prize that is a figment of the imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Spade - played deftly by Bogart - is a no-nonsense detective who gets pulled into this thriller when a beautiful dame, Mary Astor, comes to his office seeking his services. Suddenly Spades partner gets killed, and the action takes off.The brilliant cast also stars two veteran giants, Sydney Greenstreet as the mysterious Fat Man, and Peter Lorre as the equally mysterious Joel Cairo. The gunsel, played to the T by Elisha Cook Jr, is a classic role of superb supporting acting. What is this falcon, who has it, why do they think Spade has it or can get it, will he get it, what will happen when he does, and who killed Miles Archer?My only small critique of this masterpiece is that some of the scenes waiting and waiting could be cut a teeny bit to help move along the pace. But John Huston knows how to direct, and The Maltese Falcon is a must-see masterpiece for the ages. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film Noir That Dreams Are Made Of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bible forbids us from murder, adultery, and theft, but the characters in "The Maltese Falcon" do not have the time to think about their eternal fates in the fiery pits of Hell. They do have time, though, to worship a little black bird statuette encrusted with the finest jewels in the world ? and if they have to act against one of The Ten Commandments to get their paws on its onyx beak, so be it. Just thinking about The Maltese Falcon causes their eyes to glaze over, their mouths to water for the thirst of wealth.As Roger Ebert points out in his glowing review of 1941's "The Maltese Falcon", the film isn't just a classic audiences have come to fawn over over the years. Consider film noir didn't exist before "The Maltese Falcon" was released. That Humphrey Bogart was still a character actor hiding in the shadows of James Cagney and George Raft. That Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet were not yet the supporting player dream team doomed to live on the exaggerated pencils of caricaturists then and now. That John Huston had never directed a film before.I saw "The Maltese Falcon" for the first time five years ago, sitting in the pitch-black room of my grandfather's study with his dinosaur laptop on a Saturday night. Then, I was just becoming acquainted with black-and-white films, only familiar with the likes of "The Big Sleep" and "The Major and the Minor". All too young then, I found "The Maltese Falcon" to be too talky, to not have enough action. In my original review (my second, to be exact), I cited it as an overrated classic. How times have changed.It's talky, but not too talky; it's a classic, but not an overrated one. It's a cynical character study, the characters greedy, self-indulgent liars on the prowl for unfathomable riches. Instead of liking them, we're fascinated by their methodical actions. We don't connect with them on a human level; we feel the need to unravel their stacked façades, pulling apart the rambling lies and accidental truths spat out in an attempt to double-cross an obstacle. In his (arguably) career-defining role, Humphrey Bogart portrays Sam Spade, a smug private eye hired by the beguiling Miss Wonderly (Mary Astor). Wonderly claims that she is being hounded by a man named Floyd Thursby, needing immediate protection. Sam, nor his partner, Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan), believe her shaky story, but money talks, and she happens to have a lot of it. Later that night, while shadowing Thursby, Archer is shot to death in an alleyway. Thursby, as it turns out, was murdered that night too.Like all great film noir films, things are much more complicated than they first appear. Miss Wonderly's real name is actually Brigid O'Shaughnessy, and O'Shaughnessy isn't just a sexy dame gliding into detective agencies with falsely dramatic stories. She is actually a sinner desperately trying to get her hands on an international treasure otherwise known as The Maltese Falcon. Encrusted with gleaming gems, it is worth thousands. Also frantic for the treasure is Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), a mysterious European who walks around with a cane and flowery handkerchiefs, Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet), a cackling, walrus- sized socialite, and his sidekick, the mousy Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.).As the MacGuffin of the jeweled falcon hangs over the heads over the characters, all we can manage is a sense of bewilderment; they are so caught up in their lies, their temptations, that gone is their moral compass, their common sense. The masquerades they put on for Spade, who acts as both a potential fellow shareholder and an outsider, cross the line, in their own psyches, that is, between the real and the fake.Though "The Maltese Falcon" was adapted twice before, once in 1931 and again in 1936 as "Satan Was A Lady", the 1941 version bears the most distinct personality. In a world of detective agencies, trench coats, cigarette holders, and femme fatales, it is a carnival of film noir tropes before film noir tropes were even a thing. The dialogue is fiendishly clever, all characters putting on an act for the other at all possible times; Huston's direction is equally intelligent, complementing the auras of the characters with subtle camera tricks while keeping a sense of humor hanging above the dark motives of the plot.Just as unmistakable in memorability are the actors. Bogart's sniveling but tough persona is put to good use ? in other films, he's a sort of grizzled good guy; in "The Maltese Falcon", he's an anti-hero perhaps as greedy as the men he's trying to dig dirt on. Astor is the ultimate femme fatale, always seductive, always untrustworthy; Lee Patrick, as Spade's faithful secretary, leaves an impression with her adept tactics. Greenstreet and Lorre completely subvert the pitfalls most character actors face, immediately so large in their presences that Bogart and Astor frequently feel like supporting actors.Still more witty, unforgettable, and clever to me is "The Big Sleep" ? "The Maltese Falcon" comes at a close second. While it isn't as labyrinthine as the former, it is much more sordid and embracing of its corrupt patina. There isn't anything like it ? few crime films are as convincingly acidic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Private detective Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) finds himself with a murdered partner and a female client (Mary Astor) who is not who she says she is. Complicating matters is the arrival of two men, Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) and Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), seeking a priceless falcon statuette that Spade's client may know the whereabouts of.One of those classic films I can watch over and over. I'm a big fan of Dashiell Hammett's novel and this is by far the best version of it. The script by John Huston (also his directorial debut) is flawless with all of Hammett's best and punchiest lines included. The cast is extraordinary. Sam Spade is one of Humphrey Bogart's most iconic screen roles, perhaps second only to Rick Blaine. Despite two other actors playing the part before him (Ricardo Cortez and 'sort of' Warren William), it's a role Bogie made his own and now it's unimaginable to think of someone else as Sam Spade. Sydney Greenstreet makes his film debut as Kasper Gutman. Elisha Cook, Jr. is the tough-talking gunsel Wilmer. Signature roles for both. The great Peter Lorre is the effete Joel Cairo. Underrated Lee Patrick plays Spade's girl Friday Effie. Nice support from Ward Bond and Barton MacLane as cops who hassle Spade. If I could find any fault with the amazing cast, it would be Mary Astor simply because she's physically wrong for the part. Her character is supposed to be "a knockout." While physical beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I can't see anybody thinking moderately-attractive Astor fits the description. Still, she brings to life one of film noir's greatest femme fatales.Tough, smart, fast-talking, energetically-paced classic with many enduring characters, lines, and scenes. Other than that scourge of entertainment "the nitpicker," I can't see how anyone could not like this movie. It's the definitive private detective film. One of the all-time greats. The stuff that dreams are made of.</fullReview>

At least to me her screen presence was null, ie not sexy at all, therefore it was hard to understand why Spade would come close to being a "sap" for her. where were the smoldering looks, the seduction. where was the imposing, amoral spade? no this movie didn't work.. the one exception was Peter Lorre who was perfect casting as the levantine.

		<shortDescription>Taking a 47th Look at a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is undeniably an excellent movie, a fun movie, and one of my personal favorites. But taking my umpteen-and-fourth look at it, I came to a few realizations. What they amount to is that Huston's directorial debut was not as sure-footed as is generally thought. There are several very strangely edited scenes that suggest the editor needed to re-work the storytelling considerably in several places.Spade's second scene with Iva Archer clearly has a big piece hacked out of it. The scene is just getting worked up to something when there's a bad cut, and Spade tells Iva to go home. It revolves around the question of where Iva was at the time her husband was murdered, but the way it's cut, the question is brought up and then dropped rather unceremoniously. My assumption is that the scene was a red herring about whether or not she might have killed him, and it was later deemed unnecessary.Simiarly, the scene when they examine the Falcon has one cut to a very peculiar angle of Gutman, the only time this angle appears in the scene. Since every other angle is used two or three times at least, it suggests that there was a big chunk cut out here, where Gutman talks to Cairo about whether or not they should undertake the quest to Istanbul. Immediately after this cut, Cairo is suddenly on his feet and his attitude has changed significantly.Also in this scene, Gutman has two short but key lines that are clearly dubbed after the fact, and probably not even by Sidney Greenstreet himself - the voice sounds like anoher actor. While I don't want to reveal the lines because they involve a spoiler, it's obvious that the story was not clear enough as shot. There's also a shot that appears to be a single frame step-printed to create a short shot that didn't exist in the footage. Finally, Spade's last big scene with Bridgit O'Shaugnessy is kind of rambling and, if examined closely, has a minor continuity break. It feels like this scene has been re-arranged, that the different beats of it came in another order, or perhaps they are two different versions of the scene cut together. Of course, this is a long scene, ant it may simply be that the pieces of it, shot on different days, weren't matched very well in terms of angles and lighting.I'm not suggesting that this kind of editing was anything unusual. I daresay that an examination of another Hollywood picture of the era, if done with the same level of scrutiny, would turn up just as much editorial reworking. But the "classic" status of the FALCON makes these small discoveries very interesting. I would add that this movie was probably made very quickly, which would easily account for small mistakes and reconsiderations that needed to be made in the cutting room. I say this because, from a production point of view, it was clearly a lower-budget film that the studio ground out. The director - John Huston, was a screenwriter who got the to direct by offering to script it for free. None of the cast were major stars when the film was made. Bogart had only made one film of any significance in which he had the lead - High Sierra - made the same year. Mary Astor's star had peaked years before and was already waning. It was Sidney Greenstreet's screen debut. Peter Lorre was best known (in the US) for his series of MR. MOTO programmers, all relatively low-budget affairs. There are only two or three large sets used in the entire film - the usual street set, the lobby of the Hotel Belvedere, and the docks where the La Paloma is burning. Everything else is shot in offices, apartments and lobbies. They're probably all standing sets easily re-dressed for different films. There are no action sequences; I think there's only one stunt-man in the film, where Miles Archer is shot and rolls down the embankment. There are no car chases; I'm not sure if there's even a shot of a car in motion. It's mostly people talking and giving each other looks. In other words, it was cheap, and lower-budget films were usually shot on a tight schedule, perhaps four weeks.What makes it a great film is lively performances, deep directorial insight into the characters, intense camera angles, and a well-conceived plot that keeps you interested. (BTW, most of the dialogue comes directly from Dashiell Hammett's novel. The art of writing this screenplay was choosing which pieces to use.) What makes it fascinating is that none of the characters is easy to define. They are all untrustworthy, all hard to read, all concealing their true natures.It's probably worth an umpteen-and-fifth look.</fullReview>

Hollywood's star system may have died a death as the face of American cinema slowly shifted onto different levels, but it seems people just cannot get enough of this one hundred minute Humphrey Bogart vehicle that allows people to hark back to a time when set-shot, scuzzy, black and white film noirs were the mainstay for the cinematic crowd out for that genre; and people could see their acting heroes do what ever one-dimensional, 'tough guy' act it was that they did.A pet-dislike with The Maltese Falcon, although others will say it's all part of its genius, that I have is its low-key and minute look at a period in each of its character's lives. The film's item that springboards everyone into action is a small falcon statue, made by the Maltese for the Spanish in the 1500s, worth millions of dollars and is rumoured to be floating around the San Fransisco area circa 1941 when the film was set and produced. The tracking of the statue and the long history it carries is immense, rich and actually quite interesting; and yet The Maltese Falcon as a stand-alone film is only a brief glance into the lives of a handful of people; all of them squabbling with one another as they struggle with the finding of it. The film is an exercise in narrative; it revels in its labyrinth of a plot that doesn't really hold weight for its runtime. After an hour, we are ready for it to end; I failed to immerse myself in the lives of these people; I failed to connect with any of the predicaments and most of the film is a mundane, ponderous and somewhat daft passage of searching, talking, friendships, double crosses and make-ups.The film actually begins with a murder; a murder of a certain individual who is linked to the chief protagonist Sam Spade (Bogart) in the sense they were partners together in a private investigation firm. I always approach a film that has, in what is practically its first scene, a murder of someone, with a degree of trepidation. When a film begins as abruptly as this, it can use that killing on the thirty second or so mark as a reason to deconstruct why it was the perpetrator did what he or she did, as well as document the downfall of the victim in equal measure ? did they deserve it?; What did they do wrong?; Who were they? There's a wonderful moment in 1990's Goodfellas when the film catches up on itself following its opening scene which is a brutal stabbing and shooting of another gangster. We are thrust into the forefront by way of the director's shock tactics, and maybe we don't like it all that much. What follows is a documenting of one of the abettors and a scene much later on in which it becomes obvious who the victim was and why he had that happen to him.The Maltese Falcon carries none of that heart. The film is, in truth, a really soulless exercise; a film that has someone killed in what is a tragic waste of human life, and then just jogs on with everything else it wants to deal with in a casual and uninteresting fashion. Is the statue around? Who will end up with it? Who killed that guy we had zero affinity with in the opening? The film shoots along at a rapid old pace and yet is sophomoric in its story telling. It's a complete waste of everyone's time; characters and audience alike ? but hey, we get to see Bogart spit some one-liners and escape to the world of 'noir' for a hundred minutes; so who cares, right? There is that consistent ideology amongst critics, theorists and audiences alike linked to genre cinema, or 'genre film-making'; the ideation that if a certain number of boxes are ticked within certain genres, it garners a passing grade. The Maltese Falcon may well be one of the best genre pieces ever produced, what with its manipulation of light; its use of shadows; the desirable blonde who perhaps isn't all she seems; the downtrodden detective; the hard-minded cops that observe the lead tread between what's criminal and what's legal as well as the gruff voice-overs. In this regard, The Maltese Falcon is total noir; it is a less-than fascinating example of style over a substantial development of its two-bit characters and utter bore of a narrative. Perhaps it did set a trend for how noir was to be explored on screen; in that case, The Maltese Falcon is the filmic equivalent of an essay on the conventions of noir, as penned by John Huston - nothing more.It's not that I hate The Maltese Falcon, it's that I find it frustratingly turgid and inconsistent; characters will flick from liking one another to being one another's enemies, at one point a character even refers to Bogart as 'one of the wildest, most unpredictable persons I've ever known' in what comes across as a kind of self-aware line detailing the sporadic and inconsistent allegiances. Given the fondness I have for both the film and neo noir genres, not particularly taking to this might be the equivalent of a horror fanatic evoking a lukewarm reaction to Hitchcock's Psycho. The endless chasing and nattering on of this statue so steeped in history wears out its welcome as Bogart attempts to crack why his partner was killed so early on. It means 'who?' and 'why?' accompany, but do not compliment, 'where?' the falcon is. As an exercise in genre and laying out the ground rules, the film is somewhat appealing but it doesn't deliver for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spade, a man with six senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the people who have seen this film argue that it is not understandable how the private detective Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) arrived to his conclusions, finding out the real guilty people of the murder of his partner. Looking the film carefully, one can see that Spade is always laughing with some roguishness after questioning all people likely to be implied in the murder as well as in the business of the black bird. This is a sign that he was already "cooking" something in his brains but during the film he did not show any finding until its end. So this final part of the film is not illogic as some may believe. Talking concretely about the film I found that Bogart was the right choice of Huston to play the role of Spade. Before making the film the proposed actor was George Raft, but Huston never agreed having him for the role of Spade. Another important finding was the inclusion of Sidney Greenstreet for the first time in a big screen. Certainly he played very well the role of selfish and arrogant Kasper Gutman. The other components, Mary Astor and Peter Lorre did what was required from them. This is probably the first film noir and due to its quality one can see it from time to time repeatedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Birth of a Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It probably didn't know it at the time, but when "The Maltese Falcon" debuted in 1941, it was inventing a new film genre, one of my personal favorites: the film noir.Films noir got better later in the decade and throughout the 1950's; they got seedier, starker and more psychologically twisted. And if you can follow the plot of "Falcon," you're either smarter or paying more attention than I.But I don't know that anyone watches movies like this for the plot, and while I didn't see the "Great Film" in this that others seem to see, I still appreciate its place in screen history for kick-starting two things: film noir and the career of Humphrey Bogart.As long as Bogie's on screen, no one else really even matters, not even Mary Astor in a sizzling role. Though one can't overlook the presence of Peter Lorre, who makes any movie a bit creepier on the strength of his weird looks alone.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A portrait of cynicism - in black and (hardly any) white!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the Hollywood film noir par excellence, because it is - well - so black, including of course the fabulous black bird. There is hardly an uncynical line in the movie, and you can be sure that if any character says anything remotely soft they're lying! The whole theme of the film is deceit and manipulation, Everybody is trying to chisel everybody else, so that you have no idea who's on who's side. Is Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) for or against Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet); what was the relationship between Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) and dead Thursby; and where does Captain Jacobi (Walter Huston, briefly) fit in? You can't tell, and it doesn't matter, because the characters change their relationships as casually as they change their underwear. In fact, it could be argued that one of the only honest characters in the movie is the "gunsel" Wilmer Cook, played by his namesake Elisha Cook Jr, who is no more and no less than he seems to be - a cheap crook with gaudy patter. And what about Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade; is he the tough, but essentially moral, character, Bogart would play in Casablanca and The Big Sleep; does he behave ethically and honorably? Some postings on IMDb would have you believe so, but I think that beneath a fairly thin veneer of charm Spade is as cold, venal and self-seeking as the rest. His treatment of ex-lover, Iva Archer (Gladys George), goes beyond hardboiled-ness, and is downright cruel; the alacrity with which he erases his dead partner's name from the office door is cheap and mean; and does anyone believe him when he says that he will wait 20 years for O'Shaughnessy while she serves her time? (Though, with a good lawyer, she'll probably get off anyway.) In turning in the villains he seems to be acting as a good citizen, but is simply looking after his own interests, as he knows that otherwise the police will probably get him - in any case, since when has grassing been an honorable profession? The dialogue and acting in the movie are impeccable, with of course Greenstreet as the standout; his achievement is even more impressive when you realise that - after a long stage career - this was his debut movie at the age of 62! As someone else has pointed out, it's a pity that we tend to remember Lorre as Greenstreet's sidekick in this and subsequent films, though Lorre was a major film actor well before this; but this was probably only one of many disappointments in Lorre's career.Perhaps the most successful and satisfying aspect of The Maltese Falcon is its consistency of mood, even if that mood is unremitting in its cynicism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dashiell Hammett story becomes much-acclaimed directorial debut for John Huston, with definitive role for Humphrey Bogart as hard-boiled detective Sam Spade, here solving the murder of his partner while chasing down a priceless artifact which dates back to the 1500s. Third filming of this story (the others were in 1931 and 1936, the latter as "Satan Met a Lady") is set in San Francisco yet features practically no location footage (and the stock shots at the beginning are painful to look at). Set-bound noir seems awfully constricted, but Bogart is fully into his role and has a great time; supporting performances from Peter Lorre (a perfumed question mark) and Sydney Greenstreet are also excellent. Noir-addicts swear by the film, but it never really catches fire. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early film noir sets standards by explaining human race.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is known for being the definitive film noir. Twists, capers, madmen, seduction, betrayal, and murder, and all for what? A desirable object that may or may not be what we all hope it to be. This film is a classic statement on the human race, as a creature, or a population of greedy, powerful men. Bogart is swift and smooth,doing what he does best in this crime/drama. Many films that capture, or try to capture the same essence that this film creates are such movies as "Entrapment" and "Wild Things". The latter movie turned out to be a rather different story, but the previous is a good example of a modern film noir. The statement made at the end of the film describes the falcon as "the stuff dreams are made of". Back in 1941, we as humans were not ready to have this kind of power, and now, that propositions still goes today. "Sphere" has a good way of telling the same story at the end as Dustin Hoffmann explains that the human race cannot handle having a power of manifestation. Even though that is a totally different movie, it is still the same message to be said. It's a shame the message has been muddied all over in the past 60+ years. Maybe we will realize this again, until then? We as creatures are evil, greedy beings. Will there ever be an end???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, but not the definitive Maltese Falcon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon was John Huston's first chance at directing. He was 40 years old and he probably knew that if he failed he might never get another chance. And if that had happened, the Maltese Falcon would probably have been cut down and issued as a B film.Everything was against Huston. He had been lumbered with an aging second-rank actor, Bogart; a fading actress Mary Astor who was quite unsuitable to play a vamp; a beginner Sydney Greenstreet; and Peter Lorre who was type-cast as the same psychotic type he had always played since he starred in Fritz Lang's 'M' in the 1920s. The studio wasn't going to waste money on a new script, and had simply dusted-off the one that had been used in the 1931 Maltese Falcon. And in 1941 the plot would have seemed ridiculously old-fashioned, with it's fanciful history of the Black Bird, and talk of Constantinople, Hong Kong, the 'Russian', etc.What is miraculous is that Huston pulled it off so beautifully and created a film perfectly in tune with the mood of the times. It's not Film Noir as is so often claimed. There isn't the disturbing psychological tension that you get in real Film Noir from 1944 on. Neither is it the sleazy world of Dashiell Hammett - where's the sex element?Huston recasts the story in the early 1940s mould where the hard-boiled hero was king. Huston adds little touches to build up Bogart's tough-guy persona. Bogart takes guns away from the gunsel (which is quite unnecessary to the plot), and Huston also adds a typical hard-boiled scene in a hotel lobby.Nor can Bogart be allowed to appear as sleazy as Sam Spade was in the original book, so his affair with his partner's wife is played down - in fact in typical 1940s misogynist-fashion poor Iva gets all the blame! Neither does our hero strip-search Miss Wonderly as he does in 1931. And at the end his motives are the standard 'a man's got to do what a man's got to do' with no hint of the sleaze Dashiell Hammett envisaged. In the original story his secretary Effie is horrified at what he has done.In the 1931 version, Effie (played by Una Merkel) comes across as a believable character, but here she has been turned into a 1940s cliché. She is no longer a vulnerable teenage secretary for Sam Spade to paw, but a 'pal' who rolls cigarettes for him. This is to become part of Bogart's persona. In the Big Sleep a young female taxi driver is eager to give out her phone number to this middle-aged man, and another young woman closes her bookshop early just to get the chance to drink hard liquor with him - believable, it ain't!But it is to Huston's credit that he created all this and made such a superb 1940s-style film. There are only a few respect in which the film fails, and those are due to the changes Huston was forced to make in the 1931 script. For example, to suit Bogart's persona he has to live in a 'modern' high-rise building with elevators, not an old fashioned apartment block - and that precludes the fire escape by which Joel Cairo sneaks into Spade's apartment in the 1931 version. The scene in the 1941 version lacks the logic of the 1931 version.Similarly when Miss Wonderly says to Spade "But I thought you loved me, Sam!", the viewer might wonder how that came about. They have only seen each other a few times, and probably for less than an hour in total. The answer is a missing episode which the censors would never have passed in 1941. I won't give away what happens, but it's worth watching the 1931 version for that alone. In fact the scene where an apartment gets ransacked is as close to Film Noir as you can get.The 1941 version is a great film, but it's not the best version of the Maltese Falcon. In my opinion that has to be the 1931 version. The dialogue is exactly the same, the story has better inner logic, and when you get right down to it and compare the Miss Wonderly's, the sexless Mary Astor couldn't hold a candle to Bebe Daniells.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Huston's "The Maltese Falcon" is a beautiful film with an excellent story arc and captivating cinematography. The story told in "The Maltese Falcon" captured me from beginning and became quickly intriguing. At times, the movie can seem dialogue heavy, in my opinion, but that is also a reason why it can become so interesting from scene to scene. The most significant aspect of "The Maltese Falcon" has to be its cinematography. I enjoy a film's cinematography and particularly look for it when watching movies, especially the marvelous movies released during this time in history. In "The Maltese Falcon" the camera angles were slick and beautifully shot. The usage of light, and lack thereof paints a noir film masterpiece that I highly respect and revere. In addition, the cast played their roles perfectly and I especially enjoyed Humphrey Bogarts portrayal as the slick and savvy Sam Spade. He wasn't a traditional hero but was a relatable one that knew what it took to play ball with the best of them. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a masterfully crafted film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon features Humphrey Bogart as private detective SamSpade and Bogart plays the character exceptionally well. The movie uses the smooth talking Spade as the perfect protagonist for the film as well as the use of actress Mary Astor as a femme fatale. this was a common theme for films back in this time to include a femme fatale because it made for the main character to be vulnerable to being deceived or seduced by the mysterious woman and cause trouble. Film used the new style of film noir to give a sense of mystery and deception the film. Sydney Greenstreet plays the role of Kasper Gutman well as the the antagonist of the film and gives the movie a character to root against. The style of the film worked great with the screenplay and made for a true detective film that featured suspense, mystery, and cleverness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon is the story of a private detective named Samuel Spade. After a job goes wrong and his partner is killed Spade finds himself wrapped up in a nearly two decades long search for a priceless solid gold falcon statue. Spade comes face to face with the group of treasure hunters so eager to kill over the falcon but instead of becoming their enemy he is given the opportunity to retrieve the falcon for an unbelievably large sum of money.Samuel Spade is played by Humphrey Bogart, and oh man can this guy carry a film like an ox through the Oregon trail. Bogart makes Spade into one crafty mother-father, but in a way that keeps him cool as a cucumber. This guy's the real cats pajamas, the bees knees, see? And no pistol packing goon or dizzy broad is gonna get in between him and a fat stack of clams. Bogart's performance is impressive and thoroughly entertaining. He takes a character that even by 41 is already a stereotype and makes him into a complete standout. When I thought Spade was becoming flat and predictable Bogart surprised me with how genuine his outrage felt in his first meeting with Kasper Gutman. Bogart's performance makes you feel like he owns the words. He made his lines flow so smoothly into conversations it was captivating in that certain way that makes you forget you're watching an actor play a role in a movie. The only noticeable flaws in his performance were how goofy he looked in his fight scenes.Unfortunately, not every actor in the film was as convincing as Bogart. In fact, it really felt like he was completely surrounded by over-actors at all times. The characters played by Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook jr. were all especially guilty of this, and the skill with which Bogart performed just made for an even sharper contrast between him and them.I also had a bit of a problem with the conclusion to the Maltese Falcon's discovery. Once Gutman had scraped the black paint off the statue to reveal it as lead instead of gold, he began to go on the supervilliany type of "Now's the time where I reveal to the protagonist every last detail of my intricate plan!" rant. This has got to be one of the laziest ways to wrap up an otherwise fairly interesting story in the cinematic world. After learning so much about the falcon and hearing how precious and valuable it was there had been a lot of build up leading to this moment. It's not like the reveal itself ruined the scene, but there aren't many ways to more efficiently deflate a plot than with a quick summary of the details and loose ends. The Maltese Falcon was easy to enjoy. It came across as the type of movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and invites the viewer to sit back and relax while they watch. This however, can certainly hold some aspects of the film back from greatness. Bogart was completely out of everyone's league, and the film showed all the familiar symptoms of a less than seamless novel adaptation, but what we're left with is still a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking an old story and turning it into the classic which started the official run of film noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every few years or so, I revisit the classics of Humphrey Bogart, so many of which are films whose titles bring up an image, a quote, a pose or a visual of an unforgettable leading lady. "The Maltese Falcon" possesses all of these, a surprising feat because this is the third version of the same story, all gathered together now on a DVD which shows each of their individualities if not varying qualities. While elements of film noir existed in films long before this one came along, this became the definitive detective story upon whose basis the structure of film noir began.While the 1931 version of this is certainly a good film, this version is simply perfect, taking what had already been well done, later messed with (1936's "Satan Met a Lady") and fixed it to become an all-time classic. There's no sentiment or subtly to the toughness of the characters in this film, all amoral in one way or another, and all out for themselves. Even Sam Spade's loyal secretary (Lee Patrick) gets a bit more hard boiled than usual, and when the film got a misguided sequel ("The Black Bird" in 1975), Patrick was back, giving her character a really tough old bird viewpoint that makes you wonder what transpired in this character's life over the intervening 34 years.There's traces of rawness in the dialog that somehow the production code didn't pick up, particularly with some gay references (in a pedophile manner) concerning Peter Lorre's Joel Cairo. Yes, he is sleazier here than any other film he ever did, and that is saying a lot. There's more subtlety for Sydney Greenstreet's fat man than Dudley Digges in the 1931 version, but there's no denying that every time this man appears on screen, he is commanding attention. Elisha Cook Jr. (who also re-appeared in "The Black Bird") takes cowardly menace to a new level, creating a film noir archetype that he would repeat many times.The biggest praise for me here goes to Mary Astor as Bridget O'Shaugnessy, the femme fatal, an aging vixen still filled with sex appeal that she would show even in films into the 1950's. Had she not won a well-deserved Oscar for the same year's "The Great Lie", she surely would have taken it home for this. (Seeing her in this makes me wonder how the similar looking Alexis Smith would have done had a fourth version been made a few years later.) This version focuses less on the affair between Spade and his partner's wife (Gladys George) and onto the mystery at hand, adding some more detail to each of the sleazy character's personas that makes them even more unforgettable than they had been a decade before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon film noir based on the novel of the same title by Dashiell Hammett.Directed by John Huston,it features Humphrey Bogart as private investigator Sam Spade and Mary Astor as his "femme fatale" client. Gladys George, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet co-star in key supporting roles.The story follows a San Francisco private detective and his dealings with three unscrupulous adventurers, all of whom are competing to obtain a jewel-encrusted falcon statuette.Sam Spade is a hard-boiled San Francisco private eye who can be as unscrupulous as the next guy but also adheres to his own personal code of honor. Into the offices of the Spade &amp; Archer detective agency sweeps a Miss Wonderly, who offers a large retainer to Sam and his partner Miles Archer if they'll protect her from someone named Floyd Thursby. The detectives believe neither Miss Wonderly nor her story, but they believe her money. Since Archer saw her first, he takes the case and later that evening he is shot to death, as is the mysterious Thursby. Miss Wonderly's real name turns out to be Brigid O'Shaughnessey, and, as the story continues, Sam is also introduced to the effeminate Joel Cairo and the fat, erudite Kasper Gutman. It turns out that Brigid, Cairo and Gutman are all international scoundrels, all involved in the search for a foot-high, jewel-encrusted statuette in the shape of a falcon. Though both Cairo and Gutman offer Spade small fortunes to find the "black bird," they are obviously willing to commit mayhem and murder towards that goal: Gutman, for example, drugs Spade and allows his "gunsel" Wilmer to kick and beat the unconscious detective.Suspenseful, labyrinthine, and brilliantly cast, The Maltese Falcon is one of the most influential noirs.This film is still the tightest, sharpest, and most cynical of Hollywood's official deathless classics, bracingly tough even by post-Tarantino standards.And it is among the most important and influential movies to emerge from the Hollywood system as significant in some ways as its contemporary, Citizen Kane It's an action movie of sorts, at least by implication: the characters always seem keyed up, right on the verge of erupting into violence. This is a turning-point picture in several respects: John Huston made his directorial debut here and Bogart, who had mostly played bad guys, was a last-minute substitution for George Raft, who must have been kicking himself for years afterward. This is the role that made Bogart a star and established his trend-setting antihero persona. A classic movie that becomes better with multiple viewings indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a certain undefinable something which creates a warm spot in my heart for it.I have watched it a number of times now, and it's always good.I don't place Bogart on my top 10 strong male actor list, but I think it's his portrayal of the smart, ruthless and tough detective (pretty much a stereotype now,) which makes this film special.The somewhat convoluted plot probably creates feelings of love in some, and hate in others. You have to admit, though, that there's far worse. I just watched the movie 'The Big Bang', and it makes this movie seem simple in comparison :) The plot is not very clever in my opinion. Usual Suspects is more clever, for example.The 'femme fatale', if I may call her that, did not impress me.The dialog is great in some scenes, weak in others. So I think that's a wash :) So for me, it's not the plot, not the femme fatal. Maybe I love it for Bogart's character; like Bugs Bunny, I can only dream about being so much in command of any mishap I find myself in. And the movie drips with style, IMO. Style counts for a lot in my book as long as it's backed up with other elements.Honorable mention goes to Peter Lorre. You gotta love his rather original character. More interesting than usual crook stereotypes. I will let slide the possibility it's a weak attempt at portraying some gay stereotype and instead simply enjoy Peter Lorre's performance.</fullReview>

Wallis produced crime thriller also received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. Not a bad way for Huston to embark a prestigious career as a Hollywood helmer. Like most of Huston's pictures, "The Maltese Falcon" wraps up with a tainted ending. Meaning, the initial objective is never achieved. "The Maltese Falcon" concerns an international search for a valuable heirloom, the titular object, a black enameled falcon with gold and an array of precious jewels encrusted underneath the outer layer of enamel. This handsome falcon was designed as a gift for a greater power. People kill over the possession of this object. One character calculates its wealth at over $100-thousand dollars.As the film unfolds, a well-dressed dame, Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor of "Don Juan"), enters the offices of Archer and Spade. She spins a yarn as wild as a march hare about trying to get his sister away from the clutches of a married man. Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) listens attentively to her tale. Spade's partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan of "High Sierra") barges in without warning and apologizes. Sam summarizes Brigid's story and that she will meet Thurby in the lobby of a hotel. Immediately, an enamored Archer insists that he will be in the lobby, too, keeping a close eye on her. O'Shaughnessy pays Spade and Archer the sum of $200 dollars. Later that night, Miles is walking down Bush Street when he confronts an off-screen person and watches in surprise as the individual whips out a Webley revolver and put a bullet in his pump. When the authorities find Archer is sprawled dead on a slope after crashing through a fence. The police call Spade a little after 2 AM, and he shows up at the murder scene about fifteen minutes later. After he gets back to his apartment, he finds Detective Tom Polhaus (Ward Bond of "The Searchers") and Lieutenant of Detectives Dudy (Barton MacLane of "Prison Break") knocking on his door. They grill him about Floyd Thursby's murder near the Hotel Florence. Naturally, Spade cannot prove his whereabouts, but he isn't taken in for questioning. The following day, Miles Archer's widow Iva (Gladys George of "The Roaring Twenties") shows up at his office dressed modestly in black with a veiled hat. She asks Sam if he shot Miles. Spade chuckles and sends her packing. Although he doesn't do anything ostensibly illegal, Spade looks like he could be amoral, particularly because he is cuckolding his partner in his sexual relationship with the wife. Finally, he corners Brigid again and demands to know her real name and tells her that they believed her $200 instead of her story. He pleads for Spade to shield her from the police. Things grow complicated when three men show up and tell a story about the black bird and its rich heritage.Huston assembles a first-class cast, including Mary Astor as the treacherous Brigid O'Shaughnessy who harbors no qualms about lying. Peter Lorre is appropriately unctuous as the obviously homosexual Joel Cairo. Indeed, in the classic Dashiell Hammett novel, written in 1930, Cairo was described as 'queer.' Incidentally, Hammett has worked for the Pinkerton Detective Agency so he knew a thing or two about private eyes. Lorre leaves little to the imagination during his initial visit to Spade's office; he strokes an immaculate cane and rubs the handle across his lips. The Production Code Administration prohibited the depiction of homosexuals in movies when "The Maltese Falcon" was produced, so Huston and Lorre had to rely on physical and verbal discretion to communicate his gender identity. Sixty-year old Sidney Greenstreet made an equally memorable thespian debut as the loquacious, rotund but ruthless Kasper Gutman. As his two-gun toting bodyguard Wilmer, Elisha Cook, Jr. provided some quiet but ineffectual menace. Of course, Bogart ascends smoothly above the pack as the suave but shifty Samuel Spade. Spade is heroic, but little about him is virtuous. Humphrey Bogart has a field day with the character. When the police question him after the murder of Floyd Thursby, Spade asks them to remind him how he killed him.."The Maltese Falcon" is ten times better than "High Sierra" in part because Bogart is largely in control or recovering quickly. Lenser Arthur Edeson's low-angle camera set-ups contribute to the uneasy atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb cinematic entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon mayn't be the best movie I have ever seen, but it is along with The Asphalt Jungle, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and the African Queen one of my favourite John Huston movies. It is simply superb cinematic entertainment with a sharp and decisive screenplay, rich scoring, crisp direction from the terrific John Huston himself and gorgeous cinematography. The story is very well-paced and done with real panache, I didn't feel there was a wasted moment while watching The Maltese Falcon. And the acting is wonderful, Humphrey Bogart was made for the role of the cynical private detective Sam Spade, while Mary Astor is terrific as the femme-fatale, Sydney Greenstreet makes an impressive debut as Gutman, who lusts after the Black Bird and Peter Lorre is very entertaining as the whiny and effeminate Joel Cairo. Not to mention Walter Huston as the ship's officer. Overall, truly terrific and one to watch. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The start of Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film Noir is easily recognised as one of the best genres and periods in Hollywood history, offer audiences darker tales with faulted characters and often had a femme fatale love interest. This is a genre that has given us some real classics like Sunset Boulevard, Kiss Me Deadly and Touch of Evil. This is a genre that later influenced great films like Blade Runner and Sin City. The Maltese Falcon is recognised as the film that started this genre.Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) was a skilled private detective in San Francisco and a client, Ruth Wonderly (Mary Astor) asked him to find her sister. Spade accepts the case but his partner is killed it becomes clear that there is more to this case then meets the eye.Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) also offers Spade $5,000 to help him find The Maltese Falcon, a small black statue of particular value. Cairo had been betrayed by Wonderley and Spade quickly becomes entangled in this complex case.As well as being the first major film noir, The Maltese Falcon was the first film from John Huston, the director of The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen and The Man Who Would be King. This was also the film that made Bogart into a star. So The Maltese Falcon is an important film from a historical scene.Huston shows great skill as a director, having a dark tone, a strong tone, effective lighting to add to the mood of the film and uses few settings to effectively tell the story. Huston shows Spade's is a resourceful, clever and only uses violence when he has to do. The final took place in one room, showing Huston's skill with it's simplicity.Spade is a excellent example of a faulted hero. He is a womaniser and his primary concern is money: but these faults makes Spade into a more believable character and Bogart was excellent choice for the part. Lorre too was a good choice as the generic foreign villain (or at least on of them), showing he was a top performer. Elisha Cook, Jr. was also an actor of note in the role as Wilmer, a henchman for the main villain of the film.A skilfully made film and start of a great genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is The Stuff That Great Movies Are Made Of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being born in 1983, "The Maltese Falcon" proves to be a tricky movie to review. Obviously the movie is great, but I find it tough to review because is was so monumental at the time (and still to this day) and changed how many movies are made. Since I was not around in 1941, I could not experience the grandeur of "The Maltese Falcon" when it initially hit the scene. Beyond the cultural impact of this movie, I like it because there is a very interesting plot surrounding a very mysterious object. I continually give these types of mystery-thrillers positive reviews and this movie may very well be one of the best. The ending of this movie really makes you look back at everything that transpired and really makes you think of the movie as a whole in a very different light. On the surface it is just about some greedy people trying to obtain something very valuable. If we look deeper, it shows human ambition and the chasing of a dream. Beyond the wonderful story that this movie tells, "The Maltese Falcon" hits a home run with the acting, characters, set, and lighting. "The Maltese Falcon" is definitely a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talky Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A private detective finds himself involved with unsavory characters searching for a valuable statuette. Regarded by many as the definitive film noir, it does have going for it atmospheric cinematography, rapid-fire dialog, and tough characters, including a femme fatale. While many film noirs have convoluted plots, here it's so much so that the characters spend the whole film trying to explain who is doing what to whom. As Sam Spade, Bogart is as cool as they come. Astor, Greenstreet, Lorre, Bond, and Cook round out the terrific cast. It is an impressive directorial debut for Huston. However, it's too talky and unnecessarily convoluted to be regarded as a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great noirs tend to offer complex labyrinths in which we enjoy getting lost; conspiratorial worlds in which invisible forces push and pull us around like puppets on a string.What made "The Maltese Falcon" influential, though, is the way it communicates this conspiracy. Director John Huston fires his dialogue rapidly, his sets are resolutely claustrophobic, his plot impenetrable and his characters all existing within a mass of hazy motivations, unspoken schemes and sinister intentions. The very cinematic language of Huston's film was oppressive, every detail, word and object actively working against the viewer.And of course it is up to our intrepid avatar, Humphrey Bogart, to cutlass his way through this conspiratorial web. Through him we hack and we slash, peeling back the layers, trying to get at some truth. Whether we get there or not is unimportant. Noir's joy is this: getting tangled within a spider web of fate. And maybe even asserting a little control and pulling ourselves back out.Regardless, Humphrey Bogart is always a joy to watch. Whether he's playing Sam Spade in "The Maltese Falcon" or Philip Marlowe in "The Big Sleep", Bogart always brings the right mixture of cynicism, wit and toughness. He also always manages to look effortlessly cool.A great film noir is an almost tactile thing. Like reading a good Chandler, Thompson or Connelly novel, noir immerses you in a world that is as thick as it is black. "The Maltese Falcon" may not have the technical wizardry or scope of later film noirs, but it has a purity and immediacy that most of those films lack. It's also filled with little details that would immediately prove archetypal. The clothes, the cigarettes, the villains, the staccato dialogue, would all help shape the genre for future films. Even the film's final shot would be aped in Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner", both films ending with an elevator door abruptly shutting.What's also interesting is observing how noir has expanded as the decades have rolled by. In the 40s and 50s directors like Hawks and Huston gave us noirs confined to tiny rooms, their characters battling their way from one small sound-stage to the next. Nowadays noirs have the expansiveness of "The X Files" or "The Wire", their characters at the mercy of a far wider-range of forces (politics, science, sex, religion, money, mysticism, Hollywood, genetics, technology, screenwriters, family, fate, bureaucracy etc). The best modern noirs take place in a forever un-mappable universe, their heroes increasingly lost, set adrift in a world of conspiratorial influences so vast that the human mind can do nothing but succumb. True noirs of today can be thus "found" in films as widely divergent as "Ran", "Inland Empire", "Mulholland Drive", "The Wire", "Code 46", "Boarding Gate", "Eyes Wide Shut", etc etc. Of course nobody thinks of these films as "film noirs". They much rather champion self consciously emulative fare like "Blood Simple", "Fargo", "Brick", "LA Confidential" or "Red Rock West". But these are all retrograde noirs, nostalgic, content to ape convention rather than explore the world as better directors do. They reduce noir to a aesthetic choice, a kind of chic, designer existentialism, rather than anything more socially, psychologically or philosophically meaningful.Noirs almost always end with a downbeat ending, but "The Maltese Falcon's" is remarkably relentless. The "falcon" turns out to be fake, the bad guys realise they've wasted half their lives tracking it down, everyone loses money, Marlowe isn't paid and the femme fatale is subjected to a searing monologue in which Marlowe weighs the pros and cons of turning her in. It's all very harsh.10/10 ? A great film, every bit as juicy today as it was over half a century ago. Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little skeptical of this movie when my father first brought it home for us to watch. However, when I saw it, I was totally shocked at how well made this film was. The performances, the writing, the cinematography, it's all there. There is so much I could say about this movie, but I'll keep it short. The three performances I particularly want to praise are those of Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet. Bogart is so chillingly jaded and almost cynical that you find yourself hating him and at the same time wanting to be him. He's so cool that you just want to hit him. Sydney Greenstreet's portrayal is subtle and calculated, and treats you, much like the movie, like an adult that doesn't need everything spelled out for you. And Peter Lorre is so slimy and unlikeable; it's perfect. Also, the script itself is intelligent and well crafted. Overall, I totally recommend this movie 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Properly One Of AFI's All-TimeTop Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know where exactly "The Maltese Falcon" falls on the AFI Top 100 films list ? wait, let me look ? ah, number 23, down a few notches since the original list was published in 1997 ? but it is truly one of the great films. There are few films that whip out dialogue like this one.Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan, in his most famous role) are approached by one Miss Wanderly (Mary Astor) to place a tail on a fellow named Floyd Thursby. It is only later that night that Spade is informed of Archer's murder while following Thursby (we find out that Thursby himself had also been killed). Within a short period Spade meets Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), a very cool customer - a shady one at that - has several meetings with Miss Wanderly and deals with Archer's widow (with whom Spade has obviously had an affair). It also follows that the police are leaning on Spade for the crimes committed.Eventually we learn that Cairo has some relationship with a character named Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet in the role of a lifetime) and that all the parties Spade is dealing with are in some manner interested in the whereabouts of a figurine called The Maltese Falcon. This would be a great example of Hitchcock's MacGuffin device.In true film noir fashion, we are never sure of the motivations of any of the characters. No one appears to be what they say they are, including Miss Wanderly. I know of no murder, or any other crime, for that matter, that was solved by a detective in my lifetime. But here "The Maltese Falcon" delivers a theme that has been the fodder for literally countless murder mysteries ? books, films, radio and TV.You will hard pressed to find a single movie script that more closely follows the original novel. The dialogue is almost verbatim. At one point in the book Spade goes to John's Grill and has chops. It isn't on the menu anymore, but the restaurant still is a going concern in downtown San Francisco, the setting of this story. That isn't in the movie.For sheer gritty dialogue, terrific casting and a real mystery to boot you would be well served to make this an addition to your movie studies. It is a true classic. "Citizen Kane" is always touted as film with no flaws; "The Maltese Falcon" has some tiny errors unearthed by students of film (validating this film's importance, of course), but none of them materially affect the movie. Just sit back and watch it unfold.Four stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maltese Falcoln set the standard for all film noirs that followed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Maltese Falcon" was the 1st and one of the greatest film noirs. It set the standard and style for all of the brilliant film noirs that followed. What a tremendous cast of marvelous actors. It was the 1st film noir and therefore did not have a library of films in which to get ideas. John Huston, age 34, not 40 as indicated by another reviewer, was given his film directorial debut and turned out a classic and many other classics during his long career. A few people who have criticized this masterpiece don't seem to understand or appreciate old films, and this is unfortunate.This film is 68 years old and the script and cinematography hold up real well. I want to commend GEOFBOB from London, England for his perceptive analysis. He found flaws in Sam Spade's character in which Spade was cruel to Miles Archer's widow...I agree...and he thought Spade was callous when he asked his secretary to remove Miles Archer's name from the window the day after Archer died....Yes, this was terribly inconsiderate. Despite these flaws Sam Spade risked his life to get justice for his partner (Archer) and nail the 3 criminals. Spade had his code of ethics and this character set the stage for the Bogart persona.From 1933 until 1967 the Hays Code, strict censorship, was a dominant force in films. Prostitutes were called hostess' or dance hall girls. Homosexuals were called sissy's and their behavior had to be displayed in a exceptionally subtle way. (In the novel, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Elisha Cook were gay, but in the film it was only obvious that Lorre was a "sissy.") All films made during this 35 year period had to deal with this censorship.A viewer criticized Bogart's speaking voice and thought Bogart was new to talking films. Bogart, voted number 1 when the American Film Institute counted down the top 50 actors from 1915 through 1975, had a fine stage trained speaking voice, made 35 sound films during the 1930s and was Warner Brothers top supporting actor of that decade before becoming the superstar of the ages. Another viewer criticized the selection of Eliza Cook, a fine character actor whose career spanned 50 years, for portraying the bodyguard/killer and being too short and slight to be a menace. Cook's character was psychotic and killed 2 people without showing any remorse. A short and slight man with a gun and who is without conscience and unstable is just as dangerous as a big/muscular man. He only has to pull the trigger. After all Cook's (gunsel) tripped a helpless and drugged Bogart and then kicked him in the head when he was unconscious.What a great cast of characters, brilliant cinematography of the old San Francisco, fine editing, especially for 1941 and well written script and fine acting. Acting styles have changed since Brando started making films in 1950 and ushered in the method system, but the performances in this classic film were outstanding across the board, including Mary Astor, who did go a bit over-the-top, but then again this was before Brando and a full decade away from method acting.......definitely a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a mystery than a film-noir but it's a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, to be perfectly honest, this movie slightly disappointed me. I expected to get to see one of the ultimate film-noir pictures. However I've seen movies that are way less known but also just simply better than this movie is. But in all honesty, this movie of course still was a great one to watch, mostly because of its well constructed story and the cast of the movie. My expectations for it were of course probably just too high.It's a movie with a great constructed and build up story but as far as film-noir's go, I've just seen better movies. As a matter of fact I don't even really regard this movie as a film-noir. The story and atmosphere remains too light for it. It's more fair calling this movie a mystery movie in my opinion.For it's time the movie was quite new and genre re-defining with its storytelling. Perhaps the very reason why this movie is being considered to be an important and classic movie. Just like "Citizen Kane" wasn't THE best movie ever made, it was still one of the most important movies ever made because of the way it redefined film-making and story-telling within a movie.The characters are all being played by great actors but yet their characters all remain sort of flat. I known it's one of the points of a mystery movie to have mysterious shallow characters in it, in order to maintain the movie its mystery and a certain level of unpredictability but in this case it just isn't in the movie its best interest. Nevertheless you sort of tend to forget this because of the fine actors that are portraying the characters. Humphrey Bogart is at his best as a private detective. What I like about his character is that he is a person with his flaws and he is far from a straight honest man but he still has his morals and more noble side. He also teams up for the very first time with Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. When the 3 of them are together in a movie, it's always something special (also see "Casablanca".) As a matter of fact, this was Sydney Greenstreet's very first movie role. Quite amazing considering that he already was well in his 60's at the time. Nevertheless he performs as if he has done nothing else in his life before.It was also John Huston's very first directing job. This movie might also very well be his best known work but it isn't his greatest made movie in my opinion. His movie's such as "Key Largo" and "The Asphalt Jungle" are even better, despite being not as well known or world wide appreciated.Perhaps more of an important movie than it is really a perfect classic.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon (1941): Dir: John Huston / Cast: Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Elisha Cook Jr. : Directional debut masterpiece by John Huston about measuring life with material objects. Humphrey Bogart plays detective Sam Spade whose partner is murdered and he becomes a suspect. Bogart's first big role played extremely cynical as he faces off against numerous adversaries in search of the Maltese Falcon. This is a valuable object that supposedly hides jewels. He prides himself on his ability to disarm potential suspects through their own false confidence, including those whom he was introduced on good will. Mary Astor hires him and becomes laughably suspicious as he mocks her distracting behavior. She will face hard facts and realizations when Bogart solves the case. Interesting villains played by Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Elisha Cook Jr. They are in search of the Falcon and all have different encounters with Bogart. Greenstreet plays the sinister leader whom makes an offer to Bogart with regards to the Falcon. Lorre and Cook are all too ready to pull a gun and suffer the consequences. They stalk Bogart but fail to realize that he is several paces ahead of them in terms of skill. The murders are all in connection upon what one can achieve without thought or concern of what they ultimate take from the victim. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Maltese Falcon'. Bogart and Huston. Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Elisha Cook Jr, Mary Astor. A folly, a fake, a remake. Because there had been two previous versions of this story, one (in 1931) was very good, and another (in 1936) was rather too comical. So this 'Maltese Falcon' was the third version, and the best.The plot itself is rather complex, and full of gaps where a storyline should be. But the performances more than make up for that, and what performances they are. Set pieces you'll remember forever, the lift descending like the hangman's drop, the moment the bird is revealed as something other than all the cast hoped, the shadows in the lonely PI's office.Rightly lauded as a classic, this movie grows more exceptional with every viewing. Despite some plot discrepancies, it works, and works well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this classic film for the first time yesterday and having seen it I wonder why I waited so long to see it. The story was interesting and convoluted enough to keep me intrigued till the end.Humphrey Bogart plays Sam Spade, a private detective in San Fransisco. As the film starts a woman comes to his office telling him that her sister has gone missing in the company of a rather dubious man. Sam's partner Miles Archer volunteers for what should be a simple case in order to impress the client. Things don't go according to plan as later that night Archer is shot dead and shortly after the police tell Spade the man he was following also turns up dead putting Spade on top of the suspects list for the second murder. He soon learns that his client hadn't been telling the truth; there was no sister in fact the man she wanted following was a business partner who had double crossed her. When he returns to his office he is accosted by a man called Joel Cairo who says he is looking for a figure of a black bird that he is willing to pay $5000 for. It turns out that several people are searching for the mysterious black bird, which apparently is far more valuable than previously admitted. I won't say more about the actual story as that would spoil the rather surprising ending.If you are a fan of classic films or detective fiction you really should watch this, the story is gripping, the ending is memorable and the acting is very good. For its time is was unusual for films to feature good guys that weren't really that good but subject to the same temptations that real people might be.</fullReview>

I never knew about the relationship between the gunsel,or the real meaning of it until just a few years ago, not that it makes a difference or should it,but never the less, another fact,a Falcon fan of huge standing, did not know. Mary Astor played one of the all time great roles as a "femme fatale". Lorre was excellent as the "fruit flavored", yet vicious little crook.And Greenstreet's Gutman was dynamic. Even Elisha Wood's role was small,yet intense. Huston masterfully intertwined the roles together as a perfect lattice on a cherry pie. I laugh at the IMDb rankings,and see some of the newer(1980 to pres.)surpassing this one. Note to some of you "under 30 types",watch this film, and LISTEN to the dialog. Then look at the list,see what is there,and tell me this should NOT be a top 40 film of all time ALWAYS!The cast alone is like an all star acting team. Watch this masterpiece. I think one of Huston's best.I have seen it in the past 40 years at least 200 times, and still enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the stuff that dreams are made of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rare when you can pinpoint a single film as marking the start of a new genre, but "The Maltese Falcon" made history as the first and best film noir. This film is groundbreaking in so many ways: as John Huston's directorial debut; as Humphrey Bogart's first heroic role; and as the great Sydney Greenstreet's film debut. The Dashiel Hammett novel had been filmed twice before (once as a comedy with Bette Davis!) but never before had the ambiance of the cynical, hard-boiled private eye been captured so well. Bogie was at the top of his form, alternately amused and appalled by the quartet of grifters who would do anything to possess a mere statue. He plays each character like a violin and is always in control of the situation. Sixty-five years later Mary Astor is still sexy as the femme fatale Bridgid O'Shaughnessy; she and Bogie have tremendous chemistry. Greenstreet gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the fat man, Kaspar Guttman, almost the personification of moral dry rot, and there are outstanding performances by Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo (obviously gay, but it's never stated explicitly) and Elisha Cook Jr. as the neurotic gunsel Wilmer. The machinations in the last half of the movie are hard to follow, and one question remains unanswered: was there ever really a Maltese falcon or if the whole thing was a figment of Kaspar Guttmann's greedy imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A 'Ten' and It Is 'A Measure of Movies'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This "Maltese Falcon" of John Huston's is a movie by which to measure others. Certainly I didn't see its first run (I was 6 years old), but by the late '40s when I saw "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" as it came around, and also found "Casablanca" and "...Falcon" as they made return trips to our little town, I was attracted to Huston and Bogart. Also kept an eye out for Lorre, Greenstreet and all things film noir if Class A and not "budget." (But I have to admit that Mary Astor's hair style put me off as a junior high kid with other preferences for good looking females such as, shall we say, Betty Grable. But I learned to value Astor's performance here and elsewhere. Especially here. Great admiration.)May I explain that at a recent yardsale I found what we're calling my Maltese Owl. At a glance it resembles the falcon of the film. About half the size. Marked $4. Got it for $2. The important thing is it reminds me that some years ago I was given the video, later found a tattered copy of the novel, read it, slipped in the video and, with book and remote in hand, started and stopped and took notes. What a lot of fun.Years earlier I saw a great TV two-hour examination of how Hollywood propagandized WWII for our nationalistic use. The documentary emphasized group loyalty with some of Bogart's final words to Astor. This choice of scene, in which he tells her that his detective partner's death gave him an obligation, was deftly extrapolated to the individual soldier's loyalty for his buddies. Something like this: -He was your partner. It doesn't make any difference what you thought of him. He was your partner, and you're supposed to do something about it.- Here the documentary used Huston's voice explaining that Sam Spade is a man representative of those who "walk their own lonely road," true to themselves and therefore true to the concept of individual freedom and responsibility. Thoughts worthy of our Bill of Rights."The Maltese Falcon" and other really good films of that time did things like this unconsciously, better than trying too hard. There were of course many movies that deliberately portrayed Japanese and Germans as sub-humans. It was Hollywood's way of "assisting the war effort" (read: support the troops), but Hollywood later had to undo the hurt. It wasn't easy; and for some it wasn't possible to undo. The job was very well done.Thank our lucky stars (WWII phrase) that we have such good film literature as this savvy work of Huston and his crew telling a good story in the honest way. There are funny scenes like Bogart taking both of Wilbert's big pistols and telling the two-bit gunman: -This'll put you in solid with your boss.- And c.1940 topical references like Bogart handing the guns to Kaspar Gutman and saying: -A crippled newsy took these away from him.- It was years before I had enough information to appreciate that great throw-away line. A "newsy" was a boy selling newspapers on the street corner. More than one astute critic of culture has said that the best of any genre is most often in its beginnings. Film noir began with "The Maltese Falcon." It is really hard to find a more brilliantly filmed example with such fast, funny dialog and unsurpassed acting. (Check out the eyes and the cheeks of Bogart and Astor in the final scene when she says something like, -Don't say that. I can't tell whether you're joking. It's not funny.- And he says -Don't be silly. You're going over.-) For art and for entertainment, I give it a 10 as I do "The Treasure of Sierra Madre" and "Casablanca," despite their inconsequential faults. These three, and many others, are worth a very close study resulting in a deeper appreciation for film language in particular and art in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of--On DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seldom has any novel been so successfully interpreted on screen: in approaching Dashiell Hammett's seminal private-eye novel, director John Huston not only stayed meticulously true to the plot, he also lifted great chunks on the novel's dialogue directly into the script--and then styled the pace, cinematography, and performances to reflect Hammett's stripped-for-action tone. And the result, to borrow a phrase from the film, is "the stuff that dreams are made of." THE MALTESE FALCON is a iconographic landmark in twentieth century cinema.The story is well known. Private eyes Sam Spade and Miles Archer are employed by an attractive but decidedly questionable Brigid O'Shaughnessy to track down a man named Thursby--but within hours of taking the case both Miles Archer and Thursby are shot dead, and Spade finds himself embroiled in a search for a legendary lost treasure: the figure of a falcon, encrusted with jewels.The cast is remarkable. Humphrey Bogart made a name for himself first on the stage and then in films with a series of memorable gangster roles, and was fresh from his great success in HIGH SIERRA; Sam Spade, which offered a new twist on his already established persona, was an inspired bit of casting. Mary Astor had been a great star in silent film, but the late twenties and early thirties found her dogged by scandal; perhaps deliberately playing on those memories, she brought a remarkable mixture of toughness, tarnish, and absolute believability to the role of the very, very dangerous Brigid. And the chemistry between Bogart and Astor is a remarkable thing, a simmering sexuality that more glossy casting could have never achieved.The supporting cast is equally fine. Although a great star in Europe and the star of a number of 1930s films, Peter Lorre was still something of an unknown quantity in American film; Sidney Greenstreet was a minor stage actor with no screen experience; Elisha Cook was a well-liked but neglected character actor. But THE MALTESE FALCON would fix all three firmly in the public mind, and to some extent all three would continue to play variations of their FALCON roles for the rest of their lives.FALCON is particularly noted as one of several films that craftily circumvented the notorious "Production Code" by effectively implying but never directly stating the various sexual relations between the characters. Spade has clearly had an affair with Archer's wife, Iva; Archer is clearly a man on the sexual make, and leaps at the chance to tail Brigid. Lorre's lines effectively expose Brigid as man-hungry, and the script and situations do everything but flatly state that Lorre's character is homosexual. Perhaps most startling is the implied sexual relationship between Sidney Greenstreet and the hoodlum Elisha Cook, and the concluding implication that Lorre may well replace Cook in Greenstreet's affections. Just as the plot lines swirl and twist, so do the layers of innuendo and the tangles of sexual uncertainty--all of it adding to the film's feel of uneasy decadence and grittiness.The DVD bonuses are enjoyable but slight--two film trailers and a documentary that uses trailers to show how Warner Bros. marketed Bogart during the 1930s and 1940s. But even if it came without any bonuses the DVD would still be greatly welcomed: although it has not been restored in a computer-corrected sense, this is the finest print I have ever seen of the film, far superior to anything available on VHS. A great film, a true essential, and strongly, strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best remake ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film is considered by many film mavens to be the first film noir-- and a prewar one at that, most people don't know (although none of them are probably imdb users) this is actually the third film version of the Dashiell Hammett story. If you've ever seen the other two, you'll know why this is the one that's remembered.First of all the script is great! If you've read the original novel, you'll see very few changes in the adaptation. Some chunks of dialog are lifted directly from the text, which most of us know is a rarity in film making. After all, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!Next, the cast is superb! Humphrey Bogart, though not the first choice of the studio (that was George Raft, who had a clause in his contract that said he didn't have to work with first time directors) does such a convincing job as the hard-boiled detective, it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. With Mary Astor as the femme fatale, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre as the mysterious men tied together to find the strange statuette, the story almost tells itself.Moving on to the direction: Huston, especially for a first-timer really pulled it out for this one. I know many others have written more about this, so I'll just give up two specifics. First, even though he's not the focus of the shot, you can actually spot the exact moment Sam Spade figures out who killed his partner. No kidding, look for it. Next, when Wilmer is unconscious, the principals discuss what to do with him. When he wakes, the series of shots of them as he takes one look around the room says "Sorry pal, you've had it." No dialog, only their faces. Amazing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>over-dimensioned but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over dimensioned as it might be (there are a least half a dozen Warner detective films better than this), The Maltese Falcon is a film worth celebrating for a number of reasons. It introduces Bogart as a lead, and it is from Sam Spade than he will build his own screen myth; regardless of which side of the law he's standing, Bogey will always play Bogey. The film is from 1941, a very important landmark year in the American industry. It is through pictures like this one, Citizen Kane or High Sierra that American cinema started a new era where storytelling turns more novelesque, fragmentary and obscure. The setting is almost exclusively urban, the tone inevitably pessimistic. The characters' moral contradictions are expressed through multiple points of view, all deceiving and incomplete: it is in the spectator's mind that films will eventually make sense. The Maltese Falcon is also exemplary of the use of a fabulous McGuffin (the falcon itself) as a plot artifice, an excuse, a mean to order or justify a psychological character study otherwise loosen and disembodied. And last but not least this film introduces the wonderful Sidney Greenstreet &amp; Peter Lorre association in crime, a sort of memorable Laurel and Hardy of the Olympus of Noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart is the epitome of cool, and this film is arguably where he is his coolest. Bogart's breakthrough role (just a year before he was immortalized as Rick in "Casablanca") as Private Detective Sam Spade is only one of the reasons to watch this classic though. It features an amazing cast including Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre (who would join him in "Casablanca"). The story has not only great mystery and shock for the audience, but tells a touching story of greed, that would later be the subject of another classic Bogie and John Huston film, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre". The film is very witty and although not a comedy, is funnier than most comedies made today. This is one of the greatest films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some SpoilersIf ever a movie deserves to be labeled a classic- well, this is the one. Bogies real breakthrough signaled a new kind of tough guy, one who is perfectly ready to sacrifice anyone or anything for the sake of principle alone. Its perfectly feasible to imagine that Rick Blaine was actually Sam Spade at some time, before he ended up in Casablanca and Bergmans arms. They share the same point of view on most things, although Rick softens and does the "right" thing in the end. Joel Cairo is an excellent figure to have in the middle of a crimestory, conveying the European flamboyance which is either thoroughly inbred or totally phoney. A character Peter Lorre was born to play. Some people seem to think that Mary Astors Bridgid O´shaugnessey was a case of miscasting, but since she is rarely remembered for anything other than this picture, one might claim that they are not altogether right. I think she does a great job as the (at least) two-faced Brigid, who manages to sway Spade to take her side in the beginning, only to stumble and fall horribly at the finish. Elisha Cook Jr does the role of his life as Wilmer, the gun-tooting, hot-tempered youngster, with the countenance of a choirboy. A small role yes, but perfectly executed. As for Gutman, its hard to imagine anyone other than Sydney Greenstreet doing the part. His golden years was to come during the forties, as his whole movie-output was made during this decade, the first of which was The Maltese Falcon. He is the embodiment of knowledge, worldly charm, intriguing loquacity and the odd knife in your back whenever he finds a promising opportunity to put it there. Although Bogart carries the movie on his tense shoulders throughout, the cast is what makes it happen. And its superbly cast too, besides the already mentioned characters, right down to the easily-fooled Archer, Archers distraught wife, Spades more than able secretary, and the coppers, hassling him with accusations whenever the donut-shop is closed. Hustons first film deserves its status as the ultimate crime-noir, wearing the rugged mark of greatness with ease.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thus spake Sydney Greenstreet, who almost steals the show from Bogie in this all-time classic film adaptation of Hammett's story. The preceding reviews of this film pretty much cover all the ground that needs to be covered when reviewing one of the great films of the 40's or of all times for that matter. There's not much left to be said about the perfect casting, although I do feel that Mary Astor is just not seductive enough to have lured Miles to his death, enthralled Cpt. Jacoby, Thursby, or Sam Spade. Peter Lorre as the lavendar scented mincing Joel Cairo is priceless and the ever dependable Elisha Cook Jr. as the gunsel Wilmer is, as always, the consummate character actorThe story line keeps you guessing as to which side the characters are on and who will double cross whom......all for "the stuff that dreams are made of".Bogie is fabulous as Sam Spade; probably the defining role of his career and all the supporting players are right on target.....BUT Sydney Greenstreet as Gutman absolutely shines. A long-time stage actor, this was his first screen appearance and what a debut it is!!! His chuckling menace hits just the right note....frankly, I hoped he would escape to continue his quest for the Falcon. This film's reputation is well deserved and if, for some unknown reason, you have not seen it, by all means put it on your list of essential viewing. It is one of those films where everything comes together......it's a gem!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Big One From 1941</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1941 was a phenomenal year for films. The number of great ones is too long to list here. Two of the most beloved movies from this remarkable year are Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon. On the surface, they couldn't be more different, and yet there are at times amazing similarities and contrasts that makes them worth discussing together. For one thing both were the directorial debuts of men who would each play a dominant role in American movies for the next several decades, Orson Welles and John Huston. Kane was highly touted by its studio, yet created a sensation anyway; while Falcon was made on a modest budget and turned out to be the "sleeper" of the year, putting its star, Humphrey Bogart, in the major leagues once and for all. While Kane made its director a celebrity, Falcon did not do the same for Huston, though as the years went by he became as famous as Welles. Kane is flamboyant, adventurous, baroque and outrageous, moving all over the place in space and time. Falcon is small-scale, taking place mostly in cramped rooms, with few exterior shots, on standing sets. The cast of Kane consists mostly of friends and colleagues of Welles' from his radio days, while the cast of Falcon was made up largely of people who scarcely knew each other, though they would become friends later, and in many cases work again on other movies. Both films are mystery stories, but the mystery of Kane is the character of its larger than life protagonist, while the mystery of Falcon is the relatively prosaic matter of who killed Floyd Thursby. Kane is about a man who already has a lot of money, who seeks glory, while the Falcon is about people who could care less about glory but care an awful lot about money. Both films deal with relationships between people who use one another a lot, and neither ends (spoiler here?) happily. The Maltese Falcon was actually the third screen adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's detective novel. It's story is, again, like Kane, hard to follow. What makes it a classic is the way it's done. Everything about this movie is low-key. Voices are seldom raised. The photography is the opposite of flashy. As Sam Spade, the man who is working for three clients simultaneously, and who is out to find the fabled Maltese falcon of the title,--a black enameled figurine of a bird encrusted with jewels--longtime movie bad guy and soon to be superstar Humphrey Bogart gives a straightforward, unmannered performance, Hemingwayesque in its stoicism and sense of style. To put it another way, Bogart never overacts, but he never doesn't act. He's always in character. His work here is brilliant, and one of the reasons for this is that he never appears to be trying. It's one of the classic movie performances of all time, and yet it feels almost "thrown away", as if Bogart just walked into the studio, put on his suit, and decided that morning he was going to play a detective. He makes acting look easy.In support, Mary Astor is every bit Bogart's equal, and steals a couple of scenes from him with her chic cafe society manner, like a cross between Katherine Hepburn and Margaret Dumont. Peter Lorre, as an oily effete foreign gentleman, is at times hilarious, and is especially good in his hysterical outbursts. Elephantine Sydney Greenstreet's sleek international crook, with his line of pseudo-scholarly chitchat, is sublime, and almost (but not quite) steals the movie from his co-stars. I especially like the way this treacherous bon vivant goes out of his way to impress detective Spade, as if the two of them were giants among the pygmies. It's small touches like these make the film memorable as much as anything. Then there's intense little Elisha Cook, Jr. as Greenstreet's hit man, trying so hard to be cool. He's like a Spade wannabe, but he's too small and nervous to pull it off, and Spade exposes him for the phoney he is.Indeed, Spade is, of the main characters, the only real deal among them. The rest are not only criminal but unreal. They're an amusing lot, fascinating, even charming at times, but they're all false faces. What trips them up is that their phoniness makes it impossible for them to recognize the truth in others, and this is Spade's trump card. He may not know what's going on, but he knows what's true. The others have at times a better sense of what's really happening, but they don't know themselves, as each character gets tangled up in his own little web of lies and deceit. Spade exploits all this, often cruelly, and in the end gets to the bottom of things. An existential detective film? In a way it is. Citizen Kane's a bit like this, too, but here it's Kane himself who weaves the web, the others who stand by and try to figure things out.</fullReview>

One of them is The Maltese Falcon, the film that launched a new genre and the starring career of the century's most influential actor. Few, if any, films match the level of perfection achieved by John Huston and the cast in this film. It is still as sharp today as it was when first released, and that alone qualifies it for it's lofty status.

		<shortDescription>DVD shows film's flaws, but "Falcon" continues to entertain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got my DVD of "The Maltese Falcon" a film I've only been lucky enough to see bits of from time to time, and only once through in film class in college. A previous poster mentioned flaws in the editing. Yes, I noticed these flaws as well, especially now that the DVD allows the viewer to re-watch ad infinitum, not to mention scan forward, backward, and still frame ad nauseum. The film, we have to understand, was never meant to be seen this way I therefore find the editing jumps (more continuity problems than simple editing issues) goofy, but forgiveable. The movie is a riot, over-the-top entertainment, and if you don't have a good time watching this flick you need to have your head examined. This is pure fun; the suspense is rivaled only by the film's hilarious character studies (Astor, Lorre, Greenstreet, et. al.). I only hope that this film isn't remade with Tom Hanks as Bogie (who owns this role), Julia Roberts in the role of Brigid O'Shaughnessy, and Chris Rock doing a turn as Joel Cairo...but this is Hollywood, where nothing is sacred so I won't hold my breath.On second thought, it would probably be handled by Tim Burton who would make it snow halfway through the picture, feature his perennial star Johnny Depp as Bogie (blasphemy beyond compare) and Winona Ryder in the role Mary Astor played so beautifully. A computer generated "falcon" would be at the center of the film, as usual, but no doubt it would have a story of its own to tell in flashback, during which we would hear a chorus of children singing the regurgitations of Danny Elfman's previous rehashes lending what was once a darkly wry "film noir" study of greed and karma now a fairy tale of vacant characters and seen-once-too-often hooks and technique.Oh, I've been up too long and need a good sleep. ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definition of film noir. My favorite movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say the "Maltese Falcon" is a great movie does not do this film justice. If anyone is wondering why Humphrey Bogart has become a cultural icon, they need only view this classic to find out. He carries with him such an air of confidence and determination that he transcends the abilities of normal mortal actors of any age. His ironic nature with a sense of the absurd combines with an uncanny and unerring understanding of human nature in all of its subtle grandeur. This may seem a bit over- blown, but he is such an enigma that getting a handle on his precise character is a very daunting task indeed. I am speaking of Bogart the man as well as his role as Sam Spade. That is the foundation from which John Huston, in his first directing effort, constructed this seemless study of greed and lust for riches. This is a film about people who through circumstances reveal the true strength and fallacy of us all. And with all of this heavy handedness, there is room for very warm and comical structures to even out the story. I first watched this movie about 28 or so years ago. I loved it immediately and have allways considered this my all time favorite movie. If you could put "Citizen Kane","Gone With The Wind", and "Bridge on the River Kwai" together, that would be to me the essence of "Maltese Falcon". That is not to detract from each of these great films, I love them all. But their essence is very similar to "Maltese Falcon" in their basic structure and character maping. If you are interested in life at its best and a good understanding of yourself, then watch this great movie and be prepared to be astonished. Its the "stuff that dreams are made of".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maltese Falcon, The (1942) **** (out of 4)One of the all time great mysteries has Humphrey Bogart playing Private Detective Sam Spade. A simple visit from a mysterious woman (Mary Astor) turns into a game of lies and murders as Spade tries to find that black bird statue. This is without question one of the all time great films and I'd go even further to say that there's no a single weak frame throughout the entire film. This is a movie that gets better each time you view it, which normally isn't the case with this type of mystery. With a lot of mysteries, once you know all the twists and turns it makes the film rather boring to watch but that's not the case here due mainly to the wonderful screenplay and brilliant acting by the great cast. I've never thought that Bogart gets the credit he deserves but his performance here is terrific. His gestures and mannerisms are downright brilliant and I just love the look on his face when he goes to knock Peter Lorre out after Lorre makes the mistake of pulling the gun on him. If you've never paid attention to Bogart's face here then be sure to do so the next time you watch it. The supporting cast is one of the greatest to ever be brought in for a film as you've got Astor doing great work and I think this remains one of her greatest performances not to mention one of the greatest roles ever written for a woman. Peter Lorre is downright brilliant and really adds a lot of fun to the film and his scenes with Bogart are priceless. Gladys George, Sydney Greenstreet, Ward Bond and Elisha Cook, Jr. are also terrific. I think everything in this film is flawless even though I've read plenty of reviews who criticize the ending because the "mystery" is revealed through dialogue and not action. I certainly don't agree with this because this long dialogue sequence contains some terrific acting, which is a lot more thrilling than any action scene could be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the tightest film Huston ever made. Its better than the book because Huston ripped out all the worthless pages and boiled it down to its essence. But without the book there would have been no film, so good ole Dash gets the proper nod too, however the ultimate laurel has to go to good ole John. And Bogart. His best performance, his Spade is much better than his Philip Marlowe. However it is odd how virtually misread this movie has been. Everybody thinks it is about the Maltese Falcon. But if you stop and think a moment you see that that is impossible. The Falcon is not even mentioned until about a third of the way through. Yet Archer is shot within the first few minutes, and Spade is suspected nearly from the start. So the plot is fairly simple. But notice nobody here, or in Cinema mags, or Leonard Maltin, Roger Eb...well you get the idea. Nobody has ever mentioned what is obvious: the whole thing from start to finish is Sam Spade trying to CLEAR himself of the murder. Even the cops say so, and in the bargain he has that long great speech to the D.A. telling that particular guardian of the law either to book him or lay off and leave him alone. The Falcon is merely a device to keep things rolling along, like the Cherry Orchard getting chopped down by Chekhov, so he can let his characters talk. Spade was never remotely interested in the Falcon, and only marginally interested in Brigit. Notice in every scene, and he is IN every scene, all he is really doing is listening to lies, trying to figure out who killed Miles Archer: even that business at the end which everyone attaches so much attention, when a mans partner is killed he is supposed to do something about it, has nothing much to do with him. At bottom he is waiting out all the liars, until somebody tumbles with the truth and he can turn them in. Of course in the process he gets to listen to some of the most entertaining liars in the history of cinema. A great movie, horribly misread because of the wonderful slight of hand trick of hiding something huge in plain sight. If any film ever deserved a nine out of ten, it's this one. Can be seen and re-seen just from its rhythms and simplicity, from the sheer relentlessness of Spade trying to clear himself. Only the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers is its equal in tightness. And that's pretty fair company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, in order for a movie to be considered a masterpiece, it has to be flawless. Over the years, I have intentionally looked for weaknesses in this film, but to this day, I have come up empty-handed. Everything falls perfectly into place, from the dark, bleak, San Francisco setting, to the stereotypical, yet effective 'coppers', to each and every character. It's as if everybody involved in the making of this film knew they had a winner, and took it upon themselves to give a performance of a lifetime. Then there's Bogey...slick, cool, calculating and witty. This line from the movie had my then girlfriend and myself howling when I saw it for the first time: Cairo: "You always seem to have a smooth explanation handy!" Spade: "What do you want me to do, learn to stutter?" Classic, nuff said!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perfect adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I've ever seen such a faithful, pitch-perfect film adaptation of a novel. True, Hammett's "Maltese Falcon" does feature a nude scene and more explicit references to homosexuality, but aside from that, this film is missing nothing (and, arguably, it's all the better for avoiding the "direct" approach to certain issues). All you need to do is look at the other film versions of the same book to see that only this one is a classic; only this one really captures the right tone.Of course, that tone is somewhat unpleasant; Spade is not the nicest character, and everyone else is worse. It's perhaps hard to swallow that Spade would deceive and cheat his partner in so many ways, but then get worked up about the man's death. But I can buy it; aren't we all fallible and inconsistent? Certainly, Philip Marlowe presents a more likable figure in "The Big Sleep," but Spade is clearly a more well-defined character.The trouble is, "The Big Sleep" is noticeably more modern than this movie, and more entertaining. By comparison, "The Maltese Falcon" is not terribly sexy (I'm not sure that Astor works as a seductress) and rather slow-paced. However, these two sins don't detract (much) from the film's success. The supporting cast is so perfect (aren't Greenstreet and Lorre just the greatest character actors of all time?) and the music is so evocative that I can forgive the odd slip or slowdown.A perhaps pointless aside: Susan Sontag calls this a "camp" film, probably because it tries very hard to be serious but is, in fact, exaggerated and a bit silly. But exaggeration is exactly what the detective genre, and the original novel, are all about. "The Maltese Falcon" has no cause to be embarrassed by its camp label, then. It accomplishes what it sets out to do - it entertains while telling a rather lurid, over-the-top cautionary tale about greed and deception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best noir ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie may be the best film-noir ever made. I can't say I'd put it number 1, but it's in my top 5 (with The 3rd Man, Chinatown, Touch of Evil and Sunset Boulevard). The story is engaging and the pacing feels just right, as the audience tries to figure out the characters right along with Bogart. The best part of the movie (aside from the badass statue, which I'm trying to look for a replica of for my desk) is the acting. It's hard to think of many modern movies, especially mysteries which have such an excellent supporting cast. I wish the movie was longer and had more scenes with Lorre (who is as usual my favorite here). Still when one's major complaint with a movie is that a supporting role deserves more screen time, the movie must be good, and guess what, it is!Zoopansick</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon was the first film noir, the first major film role for Humphrey Bogart, and the first film to use the typical hard-boiled detective persona. It created the usual patterns for the film noir, such as its use of shadows, the untrustworthy characters, the complex and tortous plot, the bleak and melancholy atmosphere, and the pessimistic protagonist.Many film noirs are easy to forget, but The Maltese Falcon unforgettable, due to its memorable characters, such as the cynical Sam Spade, the femme fatale, Brigid O'Shaughnessy, the twisted Joel Cairo, the sinister Fat Man, and the low-life punk, Wilmer.The Maltese Falcon is a truly remarkable film that can be viewed without any attempts to follow it's plot. It is a tale of greed with several crooks all trying to get a hold of "the stuff that dreams are made of," the black bird statuette filled with priceless gold and jewels. It is a film well worth watching whether you are familiar with film noir or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Start of an Illustrious Filmmaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon(1941) Marked the directorial debut of a director who helped create the film noir genre. One of the greatest film debut by a director in the person of John Huston. The director shows off his talents in filming and story telling. Both Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon were done in the same year and done by talented and young directors. It is very rare that the first film of a film maker would be a masterpiece as with the case with John Huston's The Maltese Falcon(1941).Responsible for the transformation of Humphrey Bogart from Screen villain to Romantic tough guy. After the success of High Sierra(1940), the producers at Warner Brothers though it was time for a change in the film persona of Humphrey Bogart. This film and Casablanca(1942) help define the Bogart mystique. The actor's road to legendary status was difficult, long, but career rewarding. Bogart after The Maltese Falcon(1941) would not play a screen villain until the early 1950s with his role in The Desperate Hours(1955).There were many changes made in the film adaption of the book. First, the relationship between Sam Spade and Iva Archer is more complex and fully developed in the book than in the film. Second, a few characters are ommitted from the film like for example the daughter of Kasper Gutman, Rhea. Third, the homoerotic aspects of the book has been toned down with small hints scattered thoughout. Finally, a scene in the last section of the book where Spade asks Miss O'Shaughnessy to undress herself in the bathroom in his presence to see if she's hiding a 1000 dollar bill in her dress.Humphrey Bogart gives a great performance as the tough but romantic hopeless, Sam Spade. His performance is the role model for the behaviors of many detectives in many Film Noirs. The actor's performance is strong and three dimensional. The Maltese Falcon(1941) made a star out of Humphrey Bogart in the same way that Stagecoach(1939) made a star out of John Wayne. Humphrey Bogart was the ideal choice for the role of Sam Spade for its hard to see anyone else play the character with the same kind of restraint and subtleness as Bogart does here.The Greenstreet/Lorre/Cook Jr triangle is an intriquing element of The Maltese Falcon. The triangle motif is an essential part of the John Huston filmography. Motif of the triangle also shows up in Treasure of the Sierra Madre(1948), Beat the Devil(1954), and Annie(1982). The Gutman/Cairo/Cook threesome is the most memorable team of villains in film history. Beat the Devil gave a homage/parody to the excellent performances from the three actors.In the book, Effie Perine is presented as a tough minded secretary who is able to state her personal opinion to Sam Spade without backing down. In the film, she is basically a one dimensional character. Mary Astor plays the first Femme Fatal of the Film Noir era. No one plays a femme fatal with such erotic and intellegent tendecies like Mary Astor in The Maltese Falcon. The actress gives a perfect balace between being treacherous and vulnerable.A few themes find its way in the Maltse Falcon(1941) and other John Huston pics. One, theme of greed(Maltese Falcon[1941], Treasure of the Sierra Madre[1948], Beat the Devil[1954], and Annie[1982]). Two, theme of obsession(Maltese Falcon[1941], Moby Dick[1956], and Wise Blood[1979]). Three, theme of honor over love(Maltese Falcon[1941] and Prizzi's Honor[1986]). Four, theme of redemption(Across the Pacific[1942], Key Largo[1948], Red Badge of Courage[1951], and Fat City[1972]).A major mistake made by the filmmakers was the ommission of the Flitcraft tale from the film's plot. The tale of Flitcraft is about the unpredictable and unset patterns of nature. A line from the tale that follows in the idea of the previous sentence is "Life could be ended for him at random by a falling beam:he could change his life at random by simply going away". The Flitcraft tale is one element of the novel that made it fascinating to read. Its importance lies in the story's notions of the unpredicatabilty of human nature that applies to the film's main central theme.Both the main characters of The Maltese Falcon and Prizzi's Honor are given the choice of honor or love. Sam and Charley are in love with the main female character who has a shady past. The two characters from The Maltese Falcon and Prizzi's Honor are reluctant at first to turn on the main female character. In the end Charley and Sam decide that their honor must be upheld in lieu of love. Both Charley and Sam are broken hearted after each making their decision.The ending of the book differs from the ending of the film. The book ends with Sam Spade and Iva Archer getting back together again. The final scene of Prizzi's Honor(1986) is similar to the final scene in the novel of The Maltese Falcon(1941). The closest thing to another Humphrey Bogart is Jack Nicholson who would make an excellent Sam Spade or Phillip Marlowe. The acting is excellent and the San Fransico of the early 1940s is wonderfully depicted by John Huston.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon is one of the all-time great movies. It holds up to repeated viewings almost 60 years after its initial release.Bogey, in his breakthrough role, is terrific as Sam Spade. The rest of the cast is flawless. Mary Astor is sexy and mysterious as the femme fatale, Peter Lorre as the somewhat fopish Joel Cairo and Sydney Greenstreet as Casper Gutman almost steal the picture. Elisha Cook Jr. as Wilmer and Barton MacLane and Ward Bond as the cops, also stand out.John Huston, who wrote the screenplay and directed the picture, showed off his considerable talent to advantage in this his first major film. His father, Walter also does as nice turn in a cameo as Captain Jacobi.The plot has so many twists and turns and double crosses that it is difficult at times to tell who is helping who in the quest for the falcon. It is also of interest to note that very little violence takes place on camera. Most of the action in the story takes place off-screen.There's a great exchange of dialogue between Bogey and Mary Astor near the end when he figures out that she had killed his partner and as a result, she was "taking the fall".A truly great film - the stuff that dreams are made of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything Noir Should BE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love Noir the Maltese Falcon is THE MOVIE---A Perfect 10 in my book!!! From sinister bad guys, to black widows and "good guys" who fall more into the gray than the black and white and play on both sides of the law, the Maltese Falcon has it all!!! In terms of how the movie was filmed: Is there a better setting than foggy San Francisco to have as a backdrop for a dark crime movie? Most scenes are filmed at night and those filmed during the day are always filmed inside with particular attention paid to lighting and shadows. Even the sets are perfect; Scenes filmed indoors are almost always set in in hotels or stuffy apartments filled w/ over cushioned, ornate furniture. Throw the cast of characters into the mix and the sets somehow add to the sinister nature of the movie as a whole. From greed to lust the movie touches on quite a few of the "Seven Deadlies" and it delves into the darkest things people will do when they find themselves between a rock and a hard place. A fantastic film that is everything a movie from the film noir genre should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogey is great, this film is not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I really enjoy Humphrey Bogart. He's great. He was good in this. Some other performances weren't bad either - but also some were AWFUL (ahem, Mary Astor). But in this film the plot is *too thick*. I love a nice thick plot but this is over the top to the point of confusion. There is very little character development, IMO. The "love story" angle between Bogart and Astor was incredibly weak. To the point of being awful. The plot, scenes, and characters is just a big jumble of confusion to the point to where you don't really care what's going on in the story anymore. The one plus in the film, aside from Bogart, was some nicely written dialogue. But really this film does not belong in top 250, or at the least, belongs in the 200-250 range. A much better classic noir film is Double Indemnity, or even the Big Sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most overrated films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very overrated movie. I have seen it several times since I was a teenager, but it fails to impress. Why is it considered so great? When it came out it made a star out of Humphrey Bogart. He however would go on to make better movies. It was the first film of an heralded director in John Huston. He would go on to make far better movies. Bogart and Huston would go on to make together TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, KEY LARGO, and BEAT THE DEVIL, films more interesting and intriguing. This film also introduced Sydney Greenstreet to the screen, but looking at his villain, along with that of Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook Jr, there is no feeling of menace from them. Could this be that there characters have been parodied? If you want to see a good Lorre and Greenstreet film, see the under-appreciated MASK OF DIMITRIOS, where they are more believable, and more interesting.I have also seen the BIG SLEEP, which Bogart did many years latter with Howard Hawks. His Philip Marlowe was much better than this Sam Spade, there were more sparks flying between him and Lauren Bacall in that film than the character Mary Astor played. Also Elisha Cook Jrs. character in that film was more believable, and the one great menace in that film, was truly menacing.Watching MALTESE FALCON, feels like you could be watching a stage play. At the time I guess it popularized the genre of the Private Detective in movies. Films like MURDER MY SWEET, followed, a better film as well. Some have called this film a Film Noir, but with its flat boring lighting, I can't see it that way. I believe that had Huston and Bogart not made any films of great note for the rest of their careers, THE MALTESE FALCON, would not be the great film that so many consider it today, and would just be a footnote in the history of Hollywood. I understand Francois Trufaut did not consider John Huston to be a great filmmaker, could it be because he saw the MALTESE FALCON?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preposterous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having heard so much about this movie over the years I was surprised to find it so dull and so poorly executed. Of course there are good things about it: Peter Lorre's performance, aspects of the script, Sidney Greenstreet, and various amusing moments: but overall it's a poor example of the genre. First is the ludicrous plot. I don't expect this kind of movie to be realistic but it should at least be plausible. The movie begins well but as soon as Peter Lorre arrives the plot becomes so preposterous that it's almost impossible to believe anything that's going on. And what is that falcon prop supposed to be? It looks like something found at a fairground. It is supposed to be a work of the Renaissance after all even though disguised. The resolution of the plot is excruciatingly boring. Bogart was never much more than passable and this is not one of his best performances. At times he's called upon to act and fails miserably. The whole love story is so perfunctory that it has no reality whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie made great by Humphrey Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to call this movie film noir because it was released in 1941, but it has many characteristics that are typical in mid 40's crime dramas. The lighting had strong contrast between scenes varying greatly upon time of day. Darker events happen more at night, which fits with the mood set by lighting. The cinematography makes good use of the lighting, but the framing tries more to coordinate the positions of characters with the background depending on which way the walls and furniture are turned.Acting is mostly good. Peter Lorre does better than usual and is able to appear pathetic yet powerful and power is almost never associated with Peter Lorre. Humphrey Bogart steals the show and makes his character very interesting by adding subtle characteristics which make him seem more real. Mary Astor is mediocre. Acting standards were slightly lower than they are now, but even so she looks bad next to the other main characters when she is so important to the story.The story is great. It has a really good introduction and afterwards creates a build up that is slow yet exciting. The dialog is really good. It sounds fairly real, yet it feels as though there is a purpose to every scene which each one being connected to the other. It feels like a 5 act play. The last phrase Humphrey Bogart says perfectly summarizes the whole situation that occurs up until the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doesn't get better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever anyone talks or writes about how wonderful old movies are, I tend to think they're referring to either 'Casablanca' or 'The Maltese Falcon.' Is it a coincidence that both films star Humphrey Bogart? Maybe. Maybe not. The 1941 version of Dashiell Hammett's novel of the same name is a breakneck paced thriller, often thought of as the first in the 'hard-boiled' detective genre. No role ever fit Humphrey Bogart as well as Sam Spade, Private Eye. One of the great things about the movie is that in a sense, we are Sam Spade too. We learn clues as he does; nothing is revealed to the film audience before Spade discovers it. Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy brings the case of the missing statue to Spade, though not in so many words at first. In fact, we are quite deep into the film before we find out exactly what is being sought after, who is seeking it, and how valuable it is. O'Shaughnessy is a habitual liar, but more than that, she makes lying seem like an art form. It is quite entertaining to watch her spin tale after tale in order to obfuscate matters, though eventually we begin to feel Spade's frustration with her. He asks her at one point if there was any truth at all in the story she's just told him. "Not very much," she replies, one of the few honest statements she makes in the whole film. Sydney Greenstreet is the obese Kaspar Gutman (the actor's first screen role at age 61), and as with Bogart, never was there a more perfect match of character and actor. Greenstreet is very well-suited to deliver Gutman's literate yet verbose rapid-fire dialogue. Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) is his effeminate sometimes accomplice in the search for the 'black bird.' And Elisha Cook Jr. is the gunsel Wilmer, whom Spade loves tormenting. After relieving Wilmer of his two guns, Spade tells Gutman, "A crippled newsie took 'em away. I made him give 'em back." 'The Maltese Falcon' is so uniquely and believably of a time and place far removed from anything in our experience that it doesn't seem dated at all. It's a world that doesn't exist outside of detective novels such as the ones Hammett and Raymond Chandler wrote. Did it ever really exist? Probably not, at least not in the way they present it. But we are drawn into it and buy the whole premise, hook, line and sinker. Which is exactly what the greatest movies do. It is worth taking note of the climax, which is a surprising one, and not because the falcon turns out to be fake. The real surprise comes in Spade's final speech to O'Shaughnessy, where he tells her she's going to prison for killing his partner. It is an oddly moving, almost heroic statement about the private eye's code, about the life they choose to lead and the rules they go by. Spade, up to this point, has acted as though Miles Archer's death meant little to him but it is revealed at the end to be his primary motivation in solving the case and finding the culprit. O'Shaughnessy can hardly believe what she's hearing. Spade had no interest really in recovering the Maltese Falcon or any wealth he might possibly obtain from it; but his code required him to find the person who killed Miles and make sure that person didn't get away with it. She asks him if it would have made a difference if the falcon had been real. "Don't be too sure I'm as crooked as I'm supposed to be," Spade tells her, before handing her over to the police. The black statuette may be "the stuff dreams are made of," but in the end, that's all it is, a dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Maltese Falcon review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MALTESE FALCON The first film that John Huston directed was a short budget film called the Maltese Falcon. This film brought him fame and was nominated for 3 academy awards. Before becoming a director John Huston was a screenwriter. Film historians categorize Huston's Maltese Falcon as the first film in the "dark film noir genre".The protagonist of this movie is Sam Spade, played by Humphrey Bogart. Bogart portrays Spade as a tough, cold-hearted loner that lacks any compassion for others and is an emotionless bastard that only cares for himself. His cold-heartedness can be seen in the movie in his relationship to Brigid O'Shaughnessy, played by Mary Astor, whom later Spade turns into the police. Here he says probably the coldest line in the entire movie, "I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck. . . . The chances are you'll get off with life. That means if you're a good girl, you'll be out in 20 years. I'll be waiting for you. If they hang you, I'll always remember you." The movie starts in San Francisco, where a woman named Miss Ruth Wonderly, which later on in the movie you find that her real name is Brigid O'Shaughnessy, comes to the office of private eye detectives Spade and Archer. She tells them a made up story about being threatened by a man named Thursby, and Spade and Archer agree to help her. But what was supposed to be a simple task turned deadly. As Archer follows Thursby, Archer is murdered. The police later discover that Thursby was also killed, and Spade becomes the primary suspect in both murders. Later in the story, it turns out that Miss Wonderly had lied to Spade and Archer. She admits to Spade that she was actually looking for a small jeweled falcon statue, the Maltese Falcon, which is worth millions of dollars. Miss Wonderly is associated with several other dubious characters that are also trying to find the statue and will do anything to get their hands on it. One of these people is Joel Cairo. Cairo tries to hire Spade to find the black statue, but then uses a gun to forcefully search Spade's office thinking that the statue might be there. Spade later finds out that Cairo is connected to a man named Wilmer and his boss Kasper Gutman (the fat man).What makes the black bird so valuable is the history behind it. It was a gift from a group of crusaders to the king of Spain in 1539 for helping them get the island called Malta. The falcon disappeared when on a ship to Spain it was robbed by pirates, and its whereabouts remained a mystery until recently.Later on in the movie, a man from a ship that had just arrived from Asia arrives at Spade's office wounded by a gun shot and dies after delivering the falcon to Spade. He had been shot by Wilmer. Spade finally finds a way to work out a deal with Gutman, Wilmer, Cairo and Miss Wonderly when they meet in his apartment. He will hand over the bird to them if they agree to give him a portion of the money. Before handing over the bird to the group, Spade tells them that someone will have to take the blame for the murders of Archer and Thursby. They decided it will be Wilmer. He then hands over the falcon to Gutman and phones the police. However, while waiting for the police they find out that the bird is a fake. In the confusion, Wilmer mysteriously disappears (but is caught later by the police). Gutman says that he will not give up in his quest for the Maltese Falcon, and he and Cairo leave angrily before the police shows up at Spade's apartment. Moments before the cops show up, Spade interrogates Brigid (Miss Wonderly) and finds out that she was in fact the one who shot his partner because she wanted Archer to kill her partner, Thursby, so that she could have the bird to herself. When Archer refused she used Thursby's gun to kill Archer and tried to frame Thursby for the murder. But Wilmer had already killed Thursby by orders of the fat man because he considered him a threat. Spade has a tough time debating whether to turn Brigid over to the police or not. He knows that he loves her but he also knows that she is a compulsive liar and that he cannot trust her. She could betray him anytime and he cannot take that risk. He chooses to turn her into the police and justifies his decision by saying that when one's partner is killed, you just don't stand around and do nothing, you do something about it. He goes on to say "it is bad business to allow a partner in a detective firm to get killed without responding." Sam Spade might not be your ideal movie protagonist because of his lack of compassion and emotions. His cold heartedness almost makes him look just as bad as the real bad guys. But in the end he shows that he still has some values and that he can do the right thing. One wonders, however, what Spade would have done if the bird had turned out to be genuine. Would he have taken his cut and stayed silent, or would he still have turned Brigid into the police after he found that she killed his partner?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In his directorial debut John Huston could not have chosen a better movie or cast. Huston, who wrote the screenplay himself, stuck very closely to the novel on which the picture was based. The fine ensemble including the ever suave tough guy Humphey Bogart, Mary Astor, newcomer Sidney Greenstreet, Elisha Cook Jr., Peter Lorre and Ward Bond took a beautiful piece of Film Noir and turned it into a screen legend that still works well some sixty-five years later. Sam Spade would go on to be one of the most memorable characters in motion picture history, and the film is regularly regarded to be among the top 100 films of all time. I have seen the colorized version of this film and "frankly", as Rhett Butler would have put it, "I didn't give a damn." This film was made for black and white, to suit the mood of the piece. If you have not seen this film, you have really deprived yourself of something special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The black bird of happiness...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether The Maltese Falcon is the first Film Noir or not is open to debate, but it's easy to see why it is generally given the honor. All the parts are there: The hard-boiled story by Dashiell Hammett, the anti-hero detective, the collection of distinctive criminals, the less than honorable police, the femme fatale, the mystery that leads to greater mystery, the deep shadows, the unusual camera angles?particularly from the floor shooting up?the witty dialog, and the dark, uncompromising ending. Add in that it is a truly great film, and it's an excellent place to mark the beginning of a genre.The black bird of the title is the prize the story revolves around?but this is no Macguffin, as Hichcock labeled the item that everyone wants but is of no real importance. The uranium dust in Notorious is the perfect example of a McGuffin?if it had been a powerful poison or plans for putting together a fourth Reich, the story wouldn't have changed; all that mattered in that film was that there was something the bad-guys shouldn't have. But any change to the falcon (as was done in the 1936 version, called Satan Met a Lady, where the bird was replaced by a horn) would change the film. The black bird is more than just a prize. It is, as Spade says, the stuff that dreams are made of. It is mythic. It elevates the quest of the characters from just a desire for cash to something grander. It's something just a bit beyond reality. And that's what good Noir is. The Noir world is much like ours, except the dialog is wittier, the girls are prettier, the shadows are deeper, the sins are darker, and the prize, be it treasure or the truth of human nature, is more magnificent. You don't get more magnificent than the Maltese falcon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't know if many (any?) of you read the book, but it is almost verbatim...even as such, there are many books where we say "the book is better than the movie" with good cause. In this case, however, the movie far surpasses the book.If I have ever seen a movie where the characters were perfectly cast from the book/screenplay, it is this movie (close second, the Godfather series). Mary Astor is the lone 'maybe' but even she does a good job of it, and doesn't slow things down.pacing, execution of the plot, lighting, acting, directing...Hammett almost defined all of these things in the book, and they are all brought to life here. Excellent!!!!! My second favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stuff that dreams are made of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Maltese Falcon" is probably one of the two or three greatest screenplays ever written and yet it is hardly a screenplay at all. It's an almost word-for-word adaptation of the Dashiell Hammett novel and it was adapted by John Huston who knew he was onto a good thing. Huston had written movies before but had never directed one and this is one of the two or three greatest directorial debuts of all time. It's almost totally dialogue driven yet the camera movements are fluid and economical and then there's that cast, probably one of the two or three best casts ever assembled for one film. (These are among the finest performances any of the players ever gave but with dialogue this good that may have been easy.Sam Spade is still the definitive private-eye, both on screen and on the page and Bogart's performance was the best of his career. Any doubts as to his greatness as an actor will be quickly dispelled by one look at "The Maltese Falcon". As the deeply duplicitous Brigid O'Shaughnessy, (I haven't lived a good life; I've been bad), Mary Astor gave us the greatest of all screen femme fatales, the definitive role of her career and the one by which all the other women in all the other film-noirs should be judged. Then there is Sydney Greenstreet's 'Fat Man', (By gad, sir, you are a character), Peter Lorre's Joel Cairo, (When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it), Gladys George's black widow, (Be kind to me, Sam), Elisha Cook Jr's gunsel Wilmer, (the cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter) and Gail Patrick's hard-boiled secretary Effie. If Walter Huston's walk-on, drop dead cameo is nothing more than a favour to his son, it is still probably the most famous cameo in the history of movies. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How many movies mention Malta?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I have long been into geography and learned early on about Malta, I was fascinated when I realized that "The Maltese Falcon" referred to a statuette from that Mediterranean island. But even knowing that can't prepare anyone for what happens in John Huston's adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's novel. In the role that made him a household name, Humphrey Bogart plays the hard-boiled but good-valued San Francisco detective Sam Spade, embroiled in a search for the title object while investigating a murder. The sense of SF's foggy environs helps in giving the movie a noir feeling, as does the slew of characters: femme fatale Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor), weirdo Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) and slimy Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet), to name a few.Probably the most effective scene in the movie is when Sam first meets Kasper. While the camera looks straight at Sam, it films Kasper from below, so as to show how fat he is (to make him look menacing, maybe?). And as Sam leaves right after having exploded at Kasper, we see him laughing to himself; after all, a good detective knows how to feign anger.But no matter how you look at it, every part of this movie comes out perfectly. One of Sam's comments applies to movies: "They don't make 'em like that anymore." Very good. Also starring Barton MacLane (Gen. Peterson on "I Dream of Jeannie") and Elisha Cook Jr.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon (1941) John HustonLet me just come clean at the start with the Maltese Falcon: I watched this thing 6 times between the ages of 14 and 25, and could not follow the plot. I think I was thirty before I finally understood the damn thing.So this may be the last of my reviews you read, now that you know just how intellectually challenged I am (when I was I away at college, my sister would write me letters that began "I am writing slowly because I know you can't read so fast.")But even I recognize how clever this classic is put together. Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade is not as cool as MySpace's Dr. Clemens, but he is still a fast talking tough guy with Sherlock Holmes-ian logic.Peter Lorre (playing Joel Cairo) came to most of my generation through Bugs Bunny cartoons. Of course, we had no idea we were watching a Peter Lorre send-up grooming the monster's hair- but we film geeks got the joke about twenty years after we stopped our Saturday morning cartoons (which were replaced with 24 hour, 7 day a week cartoons). Who can imagine Steve Buscemi's career without the great Peter Lorre as a precursor? They both have those incredible hangdog looks and buggy eyes.A MySpace friend north of the border has ask that I take a look at some old classics. And in the interest of international brotherhood and harmony, I shall endeavor to give my insights on some favorites. As you can see, 200 words will require a new level of discipline when I talk about these all time greats. So put your patience pants on for the next couple reviews.MySpace.com/200WordCritic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a real joy to see this on the big screen again in the correct aspect ratio as part of the Bogie season at the NFT.Apart from the occasional dated slang - 'gunsel' for example, a word that was probably clumsy even at the time - the snappy dialogue holds up well and feels as though it may have been ahead of its time in 1941. A typical early exchange comes in the wake of Archer's murder when, after ascertaining that Archer was following Floyd Thursby Barton MacLane's cop asks Bogie 'Why was he tailing him?' to which Bogie replies 'He wanted to find out where he lived' in that laconic way he practically patented. The plot itself is fast moving and reasonably intriguing but watching it today most of the fun is in the ensemble playing and spotting Hollyood regulars like MacLane, Ward Bond, Gail Patrick, Elisha Cooke, etc plus the finest threesome since the Nat King Cole trio in Bogie, Lorre and Greenstreet. This was Huston's first stint as writer-director and arguably he never eclipsed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Maltese Falcon" is as close to perfect entertainment as a film can get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Maltese Falcon" is to film-noir what "Metropolis" is to sci-fi. It may not have been technically the start of the genre, but it was the film that really made everything come together. Sure there were plenty of forerunners, but "The Maltese Falcon" brought all the film noir trademarks together. A wisecracking and morally ambiguous anti-hero, an attractive yet dangerous female, shady gangsters, not to mention dark streets covered with fog and shadows. On top of it all is a classic mystery with a lightning faced pace and unpredictable conclusion. Both the direction and screenplay by John Huston are first-rate, which is particularly amazing considering this was his film debut. The plot is a bit difficult to keep track of initially, as it often is with these films, but everything comes together by the end. The dialog is always amusing, hard-boiled, and quotable (is that last line perfect or what?).The cast is a major part of what makes this work so well. In a part originally intended for George Raft, Humphrey Bogart turns in his star-making performance. He is perfect and creates a fascinating and complex anti-hero. Always with a clever remark and only interested in seemingly profit, Sam Spade is the quintessential film detective. The performance is so iconic that often when reading detective novels, I can't help but picture Bogey in them. Mary Astor is good also, cool and sexy and obviously not all she claims to be. The film is stolen however by the trio of heavies Spade has to deal with. Sydney Greenstreet is fantastic in his film debut as a debonair yet slimy man after the falcon. His henchmen are a pair of obviously homosexual gunmen, played by the always watchable Peter Lorre and the ultimate nebbish Elisha Cook Jr (he was typecast after this). "The Maltese Falcon" is as close to perfect entertainment as a film can get. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply a great film, with many points of interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this film again, as the first of the double feature of classic films our PBS station shows each Saturday evening.It is a classic in many areas, and its plot has been commented upon many times in the numerous comments in this site.I would simply add that it represents, in my opinion, the quintessential example of the film noir genre, the black-and-white films of the 1940's, and is the "breakout" film for the great Humphrey Bogart. (Although top-billed, his name was after the title, and instead of being shown singularly, he was listed first among four stars' names shown simultaneously on-screen.)It is memorable, also, as a film which included Greenstreet and Lorre, who, despite not having had the longest of tenures, and who were as far from leading-man types as anyone, are among the most-remembered in film history.Finally, Humphrey, Sidney and Peter represent examples of presences of average, very large, and diminutive physical size - whether on-screen or off. They also each possessed different, but extremely distinctive voices, all of which have been among the most-imitated by impressionists for the many years from their active periods to the present.All of the above, along with an outstanding story and supporting cast, are displayed in a thoroughly-entertaining fashion in this great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Maltese Falcon ( 1941)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" You. Uh?? You aren't exactly the sort of person you pretend to be are you?" A gallery of high-living lowlifes will stop at nothing to get their sweaty hands on a jewel-encrusted falcon. Private Detective Sam Spade ( Humphrey Bogart) wants to find out why-and who'll take the fall for his partner's murder. An all star cast including Sydney Greenstreet, Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook Jr. join Bogart in this crackling mystery masterwork written for the screen from the Hammett novel and directed by John Huston.The Maltese Falcon is more than just a simple detective story. It's a movie about human characters. And it deals with several themes over and over again: love, truth, lies, greed, lust to name a few. There are really no good guys to speak of. Spade himself, isn't exactly a decent guy as well. For one, his morals are portrayed to be lax. For example, it is revealed that he was having an affair with his dead partners wife, and there is more than one time where he mentions that he is in it ' for himself.' But Bogart is Sam Spade. There is a real force to his performance?.. An almost fierce animal like presence. The thing I love about Bogart is that in one scene he can scare the living crap out of you and in the next he would go all puppy eyed on you! Sidney Greenstreet's is beyond brilliant. His use of facial expressions and the way he delivers his dialogue is unbelievable. Most of the film, he is just sitting there, and yet he manages to capture so much. Remarkably, this was also his first on-screen appearance.Peter Lorre, is his usual creepy self, the way he almost whispers his dialogue is just insane. I also believe he is playing a homosexual, as his character is really prissy. For example, in one scene Spade smacks him in the face and say to him, " When your slapped in the face, you'll take it and like it." The only problem I had with the film was Mary Astor. I just found her ridiculous, I'm sorry??. But, I didn't buy her 'act' for a second, and I found a lack of chemistry between her and Bogart, as well. I think there were a lot of better actresses who could have played a better Brigid O'Shaughnessy. I'm a big Gene Tierney fan. Oh well, that is my only grape about the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definitive Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon (1941)The 1941 gem, the The Maltese Falcon is considered to be the first if not the definitive Film Noir film. The use of strong lighting, camera angles, deep twisting story and great performances. The Maltese Falcon starts off pretty slowly, starts as the standard detective story of follow this woman, then a murder, the main character is accused of the murder and must clear his name. The plot thickens quickly with whispers of a statue, a legendary statue. The plot undertow is quickly exposed as the main drive for all of the characters, including Sam Spade is greed. All five main characters are seeking this strange statue, bribing, betraying and even killing for it. Sam and Bridge betraying the love they have for each other. Kasper betraying and selling out the man who he treats as a son, his young assistant, perhaps sexual partner, Wilmer. The greed hits a fevered pitch when the statue is finally shown and all the characters get an evil look in their face thanks to an up shot. This kind of greed is also the fuel for other movies where vast riches are at stake, such as Rat Race(2001) or Resident Evil 2(video game,1998). The greed is also the reason behind the famous last line, "The, uh, stuff that dreams are made of." Since dreams often drive people. The greediest character is of course Kasper Gutman, who's shown as a large man. Often the camera is lowered to make Kasper appear bigger then he actually is, interestingly enough, Sydney Greenstreet, who played Kasper Gutman, was the largest actor the studio had at that point. There are two hints of the sexuality of Wilmer in the Maltese Falcon, in one line, Sam Spade calls Wilmer a "gunsel", which is slang for a young man kept by an older man for favors, also, Cairo tries to comfort Wilmer by rubbing his shoulders when Wilmer is set up to be the fall guy. The Maltese Falcon is considered to be the first film noir, but many people disagree. Many point to M as the first film noir, except it's missing a femme fetale. Others consider Strangers on the Third Floor to be the first true film noir. But most consider the Maltese Falcon to be a definitive film noir. The falcon's influence can be felt in several other film noirs, and can even be felt in recent movies such as Sin City, the archetype of James Bond can be traced to Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Sam Spade. The film has been spoofed in several different ways but mainly in the from of the characterization of Cairo. Peter Lorre's appearance and mannerisms from Bugs Bunny cartoons to the Simpson's to the cartoon version of Megaman. The Maltese Falcon continues to intrigue movie watches because it's film noir qualities of murder, a femme fetale , double crossing, greed , style, and crime to name a few. The driven performance of Humphrey Bogart and memorable performance of Peter Lorre, while the plot draws the viewer in and wonders who really has the prized statue and what will people do for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE definitive Dashiell Hammett Sam Spade movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now. listen closely people. This is one of the best remakes ever made. It makes you forget there was any other version. After Warner's did the first version (with Ricardo Cortez, Bebe Daniels, Dudley Digges and Dwight Frye whose title is "Damgerous Female" so as not to confuse TV viewers) They decided to make it into an ill-fitting comedy called "Satan Met A Lady' with contract players Warren Williams and Bette Davis, changing the Fat MAN to a Fat WOMAN (Allison Skipworth) and the result is horrendous. So along comes this new young guy and son of a then legendary actor Walter Huston gets a chance to direct his first film for the studio and they figure, "Okay. We already own the rights to the Hammett book and we've done it twice now. Let the kid try his hand at a remake and see what he can do." So Huston gets a top notch cast with Bogie, Greenstreet, Lorre, Mary Astor and Elisha Cooke Jr. and turns out a fabulous film with sharp dialogue right from the book, a PERFECT cast and despite what some other reviewers have said, the 1931 version is at best a rough draft and run through before the masterpiece that is THIS version. The black bird never looked so good or deadly.The chemistry alone is worth watching. This is the gold standard of the private eye and the film noir genre.And this comes from a guy who lives for good detective films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stuff Dreams Are Made Of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How did it take ten years for Humprey Bogart to become a star? And how did it take three versions of Dashiell Hammett's story to make a great film? Who knows, but the important thing is Humphrey Bogart did become a star, and Dashiell Hammett's story did become one of the greatest films ever. First time director John Huston wrote a screenplay that stuck to what was already a great tale of detective Sam Spade (Bogie) and his involvement with a group of people (Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Elisha Cook) looking for the titular statue. The performances are all first rate (while Astor isn't up to the level of the other leads, she is definitely not as bad as some critics say), the script is incredibly well written, and the overall ambiance is as good as "Double Indemnity". Like so many other greats, from "Gone With the Wind" to "Casablanca", "The Maltese Falcon" also understands that a great ending line can easily become immortal, and of course today even people who haven't heard of the film probably know "The stuff dreams are made of". Although Fritz Lang's German film "M" technically began film noir, "The Maltese Falcon" was really the first of the genre to come out of Hollywood. As the genre is probably my favorite, I can tell you candidly that having seen just about every film noir there is, "The Maltese Falcon" is easily one of the three best, and undoubtedly an essential film that everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Maltese Falcon' is a dynamite whodunit, one of the best in the business, as it takes tremendous risks, even in the first 15 minutes, by giving a landslide of plot information, and leaving us, the audience to try to absorb it all while this mystery is going on,. Let's see, Humphrey Bogart plays Sam Spade, a private detective who takes on a female client who complains that someone is following her. Sam's partner in the firm, Archer, takes on the case. Unfortunately for Archer and the person he is following, both of them are killed. Archer's widow comes to Spade's office, and Spade and Archer's Wife make out like there's no tomorrow. The police get suspicious of Spade, mainly because he didn't really come to examine Archer's body at the crime scene, and the fact they have suspicions about Spade and Archer's wife, whether Spade iced Archer for her. Now, I haven't even HARDLY given you the main plot yet, as a matter of fact, all of this happens in the first 10 minutes! And the Maltese Falcon isn&amp;#47978; even introduced yet! Nor is the Fat Man! Nor Peter Lorre! So all of this is just a blast, I'm not sure if I got all of it the first time round, but I can guarantee there will be subsequent viewings!</fullReview>

Not many films could pack so much suspense and tension in a scene with little action to speak of, that takes place for the entire third act in Sam Spade's apartment, but the verbal wit demonstrated by Bogart and Greenstreet along with the equally good performances of Peter Lorre and Mary Astor truly livens up what could really slow down the pace of a lesser movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably my favourite film (alongwith Amarcord) and certainly my favourite noir. It holds up to repeated viewings and you find something new to appreciate.The reasons that make this one of the greatest (why is it ranked only 53 on IMDb!!!) films of all time are the cast: Bogart defined the untarnished noir hero for future generations and you need to see him in this to understand the reason for his continued cult following.Sydney Greenstreet in his debut film role is stunning as Casper Gutman and his stage trained dialogue delivery is impeccable. Myrna Loy is a sly, crooked, shameless femme fatale "especially that throb she gets in her throat". There's the effeminate Peter Lorre, the dangerous Elisha Cook Jr. and the most nominated supporting actress never to win an Oscar Thelma Ritter. Director John Huston took an amazingly insightful decision in not changing the dialogue of the novel. I don't know if that's ever happened before or after in any movie (except those based on a play). The novels dialogues come out far more effective as film dialogue than any scriptwriter could have churned out.I suggest you watch this film a couple of times to understand the plot threadbare. Then watch it a couple of times to understand to appreciate the dialogue and acting. Then watch a couple of dozen times to soak up the atmosphere.....after that you're on your own.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film several times, and never fail to enjoy it and see different nuances upon each viewing. Huston's framing of Spade as this jaded, small-time PI, could only have been played by someone with the smoky charisma of Bogart. George Raft would not have been too bad, but he didn't carry that particular brand of attraction that might hold your interest. The details are wonderful, too. The rumpled, bachelor apartment that Spade lives in - devoid of any particular personal touch, but still wonderfully evocative of the time period. The lavish hotel suite that Gutman frequents, the non-descript office of Spade and his luckless partner, Archer, transport you back to the '40's whenever you see the film. The feeling is that of cigarette smoke just hanging in the air, thick and acrid and coloring this sordid atmosphere. Unlike several others here, I enjoyed Mary Astor's performance as the unsavory Brigid O'Shaugnessy, despite that awfully severe hairdo. You sort of know that she and Spade are playing a rather dangerous game with one another, yet there is a very palpable degree of sexual attraction to one another, as well as the inference of sexual activity, something not easily accomplished in the censor-heavy film industry. You know, "You use me, and I'll use you" - no strings attached. As well, there is the inference of Spade's prior involvement with his late partner's wife, Iva, who still has eyes for him, even after her husband's murder. The meeting of Spade, Cairo and Gutman is a meeting of three masterful actors with a terrific degree of wit and repartee. Lorre's Cairo is already painted as an effeminate character the minute he enters Spade's office with ironic music, and the scented handkerchief that is remarked upon. Greenstreet's Gutman is a worthy adversary, as admiring of Spade as well as contemptuous of this urban PI. It is interesting to see when the partners in crime - Gutman, Cairo and O'Shaugnessy, virtually claw at each other over this relic, sated with greed. They're certainly of a kind. Elisha Cook's little "gunsel" crackles with energy and the urgency of his mission - to track Spade. He's a little penny-ante, dimestore version of a gangster, and Spade has fun with him in the process. The gay aspect of his relationship with Gutman is mostly inferred in this version, as Gutman later admits he "loves him like a son", but was more openly expressed in the earlier film version when the Spade character called him Gutman's "boyfriend". The ending is powerful and brings to a climax this story of greed, deception, and basic human frailties. They really don't make them like this anymore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Logical; Powerful; the First Hard-boiled Detective Story; Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone finally had to make this film, and from a Dashiell Hammettnove; John Huston did, doing the final script himself. I claim this script is very different because instead of pseudo-Christian clichés, realpolitik arguments for the need to commit crimes or altruistic nonsense, Hammett portrayed a group of ruthless people going after a fortune, and ridding themselves of anyone who stands in their way. They unfortunately encounter a noir "hero'--a man whose ethics have to do with using his own judgment--and who is applying it to reality and to them. The cast is famously good under Huston's direction. Humphrey Bogart is logical and powerful as Sam Spade, a man out to avenge his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan). Archer's neurotic wife had seduced him and is still chasing (Gladys George). Enter those in pursuit of the "Maltese Falcon", an Hitchcockian Magoffin of first-rate usefulness to the plot. The quartet includes Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Greenstreet's hired gunsel, Elisha Cook Jr. What ensues is a series of explanations to the police, arguments, attempted murders, real ones and definitions of the quartet and of Bogart in terms of their willingness to do others harm in order to get the bird or not. Bogart's secretary is played by fine actress Lee Patrick, and Barton McLane is a tough and believable cop,aided by Ward Bond. This is not a great film; but it is the first realistic detective film of all time, and as such of huge influence on the genre, on writers including Raymond Chandler, Mickey Spillane, Frank Gruber and other early masters. Adolph Deutsch did the music. Like "Goldfinger", this is too pat a storyline to be great. But the logic is flawless; and the scenes where Spade argues for the need to blame the goings on on Cook and Astor are priceless: "I'm sorry, baby--you're taking the fall..." This is also the signature piece. of detective fiction, brought to a climax in Leigh Brackett's later script for "The Big Sleep". Perhaps not a classic; but the next best thing -- a very seminal success.</fullReview>

Acting was fantastic with the exception of Mary Astor, who slightly milked her role. Peter Lorre is just hilarious in this movie with his slightly psychopathic dialogue. The action though minimal is presented in parts that seem to make people lose interest and is then drawn back to see what happens next.

		<shortDescription>Flawed Bogart Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie's giant status notwithstanding, I see a lot of annoyances in this film. Firstly, the screenplay is sort of weak, with the dialogue just too too, even for a film like this. Bogart's playacting isn't good, and I just am never really convinced hes into the role. Contrast with his Marlowe where he looks completely at home. Mary Astor is a losing femme fatale, also very unconvincing and just too nutty to even begin to understand; zero sex appeal. Greenstreet's mincing bully, is always great and Lorre never misses. The look and feel of the film obviously is what makes it, you are defintitely very quickly sucked right in. Gotta love it, but wish it might have been better all in all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon is a classic example of film noir. Humphrey Bogart plays Sam Spade, a no-nonsense private detective who ends up searching for a mysterious jewelled statuette - the Maltese Falcon. However, he quickly realises that he is not the only person after the bird. Magnificent characters played by Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre add color to this film noir. There are plenty of witty lines uttered by Bogart, in one of his greatest roles, and this wonderful movie is packed full of suspense and intrigue - it has all the ingredients of a fantastic film noir!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon*Contain some spoilers*I supposed that The Maltese Falcon was created to defying the Production Code, which had Hollywood on its knees for almost decade now. I really enjoy this film since I saw this at my film class in high school and now, I owned it because it's very enjoyable film to watch. John Huston made very impressive debut with this film noir with his fast and furious style.Many would dislike style over substance but The Maltese Falcon is style over substance. I supposed that the studios are always worried about the plots so audiences can understand the movie but Huston used style technique by using stylishly dialogues between 2 characters. This film, along with Casablanca, launched Humphrey Bogart's career, rescued him from bunch of B gangster pictures and become top notch actor after this one. I have always wondering how the style works when Bogart told Mary Astor that she would go to prision for killing his partner and if she get out in 20 years, Bogart will wait for him. If not, then she'll be hang and Bogart say he'll always remember her. Very cold like Bogart's character's name Sam Spade. Very plain cold. Bogart is probably first antihero in cinema history and his actions may be bit shocked because he's gay basher, cop hater, hate his own partner but only person he like is his secretary Effie, who forgave his sins. I can't think of an excellent film noir next to The Third Man. It's very interesting how much everyone in film would gamble for ancient relic, which is The Maltese Falcon and Bogart play very dirty and I mean very dirty. I think it's one of the best films I've ever seen. I recommend it to everybody.****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MALTESE FALCON B&amp;W-101min****(1941)D:John Huston. Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Glayds George, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Ward Bond, Jerome Cowan, Elisha Cook Jr., James Burke. Top-notch, quick- paced film noir, the first of it's kind, based on Dashell Hamment's novel as private eye Sam Spade relentlessly searches for a valueable statuette. One of two career-making roles that brought Bogart to stardom and full of great performances with Astor as the definitive femme fatale, Lorre as neurotic Cairo, Greenstreet as morbidly obese Guttman, and Cook as gunsel Wilmer are remarkable. A must-see masterpiece. Huston wrote the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie came out in 1941, it was many "firsts". The movie was John Huston's directorial debut. It was also Humphery Bogart's first lead role as a hero and it set him down the road to get roles like Rick Blaine &amp; Philip Marlowe and become one of Hollywood's greatest screen legends. It's hard to imagine anyone else in the lead role (Sam Spade) and yet, George Raft almost played the part.This could also be seen as the beginning of the film noir movement that really picked up later in the decade. This low-key mystery used mostly indoor sets and got by on a minimal budget, but its style, cynicism, and darkness set a precedent.The Maltese Falcon was also the definitive detective movie and created the formula for every detective movie to come. If you compare movies from the film noir era as well as Chinatown, made a whole generation later (with John Huston playing an old man), you will find many of the same elements: a doomed femme fatale, sneering henchmen, well-meaning but meddlesome cops, and sophisticated villains. Kiss Me Deadly also uses the formula, with the lurid twist of turning the private eye's secretary into a sex kitten.The acting in this film is terrific. From Bogey himself, on down to the ineffective Wilmer Cook, every character is played convincingly with subtle nuances that make them legendary. No one can forget the steadfast secretary, Effie, or Iva, the jealous mistress, and of course, Brigid, Cairo, and Gutman, an unholy trinity of deceit and immorality.A definite classic. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic, but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a classic from which you can extract many lines and quote them as is. The acting is typical of that time frame of huge poised stars with attitude, and a lot of stereotypes.However, I'm a foreigner and this film is full of old slang English, it's quite hard to follow. Also the storyline and references to characters is pretty confusing too (intended). The suspense is very well taken care of.Overall I'd watch it as a classic, like I'd watch Citizen Kane or Casablanca, which I thought were better. This movie is made of the stuff dreams are made of until you watch it and then get disappointed... just like dreams :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: contains spoilersI can't add much to what's already been said about this tight little drama that launched a genre. The plot is labyrinthine (I've seen this film over a dozen times and I still can't tell you why Miss O'Shaughnessy shoots Miles Archer, not that it really matters), but the atmosphere and the characters are without par. Who but Sidney Greenstreet or Peter Lorre could play their respective roles? This film is also famous for helping launch Humphrey Bogart's stardom, rescuing him from mediocre bit parts. His Spade is tough, funny, and insensitive. Like the novel it was taken from, this film adheres to the standard cliches and language of the film noir crime drama: anti-social hero, seedy characters, dangerous femme fatale, bleak setting (shot in black and white of course). This film is a must-see for any student of the art. No, it's not deep, but remember, it started out as a pulp crime novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's little to say about this film that hasn't already been said. It's a great detective story with superb dialogue courtesy of Raymond Chandler. The cast is legendary. All the Warner contract players were in top form for this one. I agree with those who think that the role of Ms. O'Shaughnessy perhaps should've gone to someone more glamourous in appearance. The brutal truth is that people who are perceived as beautiful garner more sympathy than those who are not. I think this would've heightened the tragedy of the ending. Still undeniably a classic, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler I saw the Big Sleep in the theater and I fell asleep during it. I saw The Maltese Falcon and it is now my favorite movie. I have rented it before but whenever it is in a revival theater across town I always make time for the trek. I imagine everything has been said about the Maltese Falcon so I won't bother discussing what it is about. Instead I will focus on the characters. The characters are the movie. They are what make the picture. Sam Spade is sharp as his name indicates but flawed. He doesn't seem to care that Milles Archer was murdered. He continues an affair with his widow after the murder. Spade is out for number one and is trying to get his hands on the Falcon as well. But he has one redeeming quality that only his secretary can see. He sticks to his principles. The rapport between Spade and the secretary show that she is accustomed to his way of doing things and she has come to respect him. This is shown in the final scene with Miss O'Shannasy when Spade lets his true intentions show.My favorite character would have to be Joel Cairo. Some say that is has homosexual tendendancies along with Gutman. I don't buy that at all though. Liberal critics are always trying to place gays and phallicies in movies and most of the time it is usually a stretch. I interpreted Cairo's mannerisms and personality as pretty boyish rather than gay. Gutman was charming and eccentric but that does not mean he is gay. Look at Cairo's dialogue though. He is overly polite as if he thinks that will get him any closer to the Falcon. Also, next to E. Emmit Walsh he is the sleaziest character ever on the screen. You just don't get characters like this these days. I love the way Cairo TELLS Spade he is going to search his office and the way he threatens him only to have Spade disarm him like a child.Then of course there is the fatman, Gutman. He loves to relish in his own genius. He flaunts it in that first scene where he tells Spade about the Bird they are looking for. The final scene with Gutman in Spade's apartment when we finally get to meet the Bird is a wonderful exit for each of the characters. Cairo walks out sulking and crying, Gutman walks out with a confident grin on his face. Fine exits for great characters.The story fair, the mood good and the characters exquisite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic noir that made a bankable star of Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"...along these mean streets walks a man who is not mean himself, neither tarnished nor afraid...." Thus spoke Dashiell Hammett of his hero Sam Spade, the private eye introduced at the outset of John Huston's brilliant masterpiece The Maltese Falcon.Bogart carries the film with his genre defining personality, shades of which were later to be seen in other classics such as The Big Sleep. He is the not-so-aggrieved member of the partnership Spade and Archer. A crime is committed at the outset and the only clue is a lady Brigid O'Shaughnessy, played by an appropriately tricky Myrna Loy.Other characters are the effeminate Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) and the FatMan (played by legendary stage actor Sydney Greenstreet in a real tour de force). Huston showed excellent judgement in using the dialogue in the novel verbatim without any significant changes. This is one of the strengths of the movie as is the excellent black &amp; white photography.Altogether a cinematic masterpiece that defined a new and cherished genres that influenced movies as recent as L.A. Confidential and Memento.</fullReview>

I will start to write a couple of things about the technical stuff in this film. The cinematography is very powerful and Huston´s direction is amazing.The whole cast is excellent(Besides Bogart, specially Mary Astor and the great Peter Lorre). It has a superb complex, you do not understand so much in the start but later on in the film you understand everything perfectly. One of the things I like most about this film is the ending. If he would have picked the other choice in the film. I think it would have lost must of it´s power but the ending is absolutely masterful. It´s placed at number 45 over the 250 best films ever made which is great(For me it´s might 10-15 positions up).10/10</fullReview>

Huston used his first choice, Humphrey Bogart. Had Raft played Spade the film would have dissolved in mediocrity There are MANY super film noir pix.

		<shortDescription>Classic gumshoe tale with a great cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was John Huston's first film and some say his best. It features a most interesting cast led by Humphrey Bogart who, one can see, had a great time playing the devil-may-care and cynical private eye, Sam Spade, a creation of mystery novelist Dashiell Hammett, who also created another cinematic favorite, The Thin Man (1934) (and sequels) starring William Powell and Myrna Loy. Playing opposite Bogey as the tearful and treacherous Brigid O'Shaughnessy is Mary Astor, at the time in her mid-thirties and a veteran of many films going back to the silent era. Interestingly enough one of the films was The Runaway Bride (1930). In Hollywood the films never change, they just get make-overs.Peter Lorre plays the perfumed and villainous Joel Cairo in a style both humorous and sinister. His distinctive high pitched voice has become a staple of cartoon villains. Sidney Greenstreet, the rotund one, who catches up on his reading while they await the delivery of the falcon, plays Kasper Gutman, art connoisseur and sly crook. Elisha Cook Jr., the eternal little man with a gun, whose face seldom changes expression from that of hurtful vengeance, plays Wilmer Cook, Gutman's bodyguard.What makes this film the favorite of so many is the supremely confident manner in which Sam Spade deals with not only the motley assortment of crooks and con artists, but with the police, tearful women and the district attorney. He's a man's man whose rationality and good old fashioned common sense allow him to spot deception in the twinkling of an eye and give him the power to turn his back on love if there are strings attached. The cosmopolitan air and the sophisticated script allow the players full scope and they are fascinating to watch. Astor's fake tears and feigned innocence cause both Bogey and the audience to grin broadly. And the t?te-a-t?tes among all the characters, but especially between Greenstreet and Bogart and Lorre and Bogart--the big eyes, the greedy grabbing of guns--are the kind of scenes you can watch again and again with pleasure.Some see greed as the theme of this film, and indeed John Huston is very good at delineating the psychology of greed--witness also his The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)--but in the existential character of Sam Spade we see an American legend come to life. He is the thinking man of action living life by his wits and an independent code, the kind of man who takes life as it comes but without ever losing his sense of humor, the kind of guy we'd all like to be.There are a couple of earlier version of this film, The Maltese Falcon (1931) with Bebe Daniels and Ricado Cortez, and one starring Bette Davis and Warren William called Satan Met a Lady (1936), neither of which I've seen, but I understand that the 1931 version is very good. With help from a script by Truman Capote, Huston made a kind of a spoof in Beat the Devil (1954).Incidentally, in this and in The Big Sleep (1946), Bogart never really plays the gumshoe with the kind of hard-nosed disregard for conventional morality as envisioned in the novels, but is politically-corrected for the mass movie audience. Note here however that the first thing Sam Spade does when he gets the guys unconscious is to go through their wallets.Bottom line: a classic and a treat. Don't miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the classic talk tough real fast film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MALTESE FALCON is a classic tale of a gumshoe caught between several greedy factions wanting a valuable statue of a bird. The classic film, is mostly all dialogue and bogart dealing out mile a minute insults and threats to "would be assailants". The film was released in 1941, on the eve of the US entry into WW2. After this the next few Bogart films were war or espionage themed, yet he excelled at playing a smooth talking, tough as nails gangster or PI. When people think of JOHN WAYNE they think of westerns, war pictures or MC Q. When people think of BOGART they think of film noir gangster and PI films and films like CASABLANCA. Bogart was the poster boy for 1940's coolness in a suit and strutting on film into a crowded bar like he had a chip on his shoulder and he could kick the whole worlds ass. This is a fine film and well written. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not too many movies have the class and intelligence like THE MALTESE FALCON. Like a stage play, the characters are: witty, crafty, highly smart, and can speak and respond with the greatest of ease. THE MALTESE FALCON succeeds and suffers from this effect since slower people will have a very hard time registering what the characters are saying. THE MALTESE FALCON demands very little minus this fact and the superb acting make this a movie film buff's choice.It's San Francisco. A woman from New York walks into the office of Spade and Archer, two private detectives requesting they find her sister who is being held by a sinister man. Archer investigates and gets killed. Spade picks up and does some investigating of his own that leads him into a chase for the titled statuette.Yet another tale of greed, THE MALTESE FALCON has its own style of story telling. Much of the movie revolves around Spade's brilliance and intelligence by maneuvering around the police, Archer's widow and his own feelings to solve the mysteries and discover the whole story. This type of acting is a rare gem itself and is all done in only 101 minutes! Try recreating this movie today at such a time!</fullReview>

The use of 'High' and 'Low' key lighting to convey emotions to the audience, classic lines such as: When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it.

		<shortDescription>Impressionable Debut for John Huston</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon(1941) is a great film loaded with excellent images, acting, directing , and story. The theme of greed is very big in the films of John Huston. They play a major role in Treasure of the Sierra Madre(1948), Key Largo(1948), The Maltese Falcon(1941), Asphalt Jungle(1950), Beat the Devil(1953), and Annie(1982). The romantic style of The Maltese Falcon is used in Prizzi's Honor. In fact the main characters in the film make a choice at the end that they regret. Humphrey Bogart is hard boiled and tough as the detective, Sam Spade. Peter Lorre is uncharacteristicly thin for the role of Joel Cario. The film is not a faithful adaptation to the novel for many reasons. First, the relationship between Sam Spade and Mrs. Archer in the book is more complex and deep. Second, the film plays down the homosexual characteristics of Joel Cairo and Kasper Gutman. Third, the ending of the book is completely different from the film. Fourth, the book has Sam Spade tells the Falcraft tale to Brigid at Spade's place before Joel Cario comes in for a meeting. The exculsion of the Falcraft tale is a major one and this is something that I wished was included in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart is simply brilliant! Without a doubt one of his best performances. His character, Sam Spade, is such a fascinating character because he appears unscrupulous and somewhat crooked in his actions but, he doesn't hesitate to take the case to unravel the mystery of his murdered partner. Although Bogart, without a doubt, steals the show, Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet provide great precursoring performances to their later roles of Ugarte and Ferrari in Casablanca. Looking at the movie from a whole, I love the fact that their are basically only a small handfull of characters in the this film. When casts lack numbers, I believe it provides more insight to all the characters instead of trying to concentrate on a hoard of characters coming in and going out. Film Noir films always provide a unique way of shooting, and THe Maltese Falcon is no different. I loved this movie far more than Double Indemnity, which many consider the best of this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No other book ever captured the dark and gritty seediness of the noir thriller like Dashiel Hammet's Maltese Falcon , except perhaps Raymond Chandler's Big Sleep, and no other film has made such a stunning representation of a book like this one has. Much of Hammet's own dialogue remains in the script, with some strangely quirky phrases to give it flavor. Example...an odd exchange between Spade and Archer after Miss Wonderly has gone...... "you might have seen her first , but I spoke first" Spade....." you're a smart one.........yes you are." This movie has everything.......larger than life players with just enough eccentricity to make them unique ,a notion that you'd not meet this flamboyant ensemble in a hundred years of trying . And that's the whole point . The pace is quick and the banter is classic with few cosmetic diversions...the movie is all business . A curious sense of comfort commands the screen when Bogart's Spade is around, and he seems to dominate his scenes without diminishing the other performers.....something say a Marlon Brando couldn't do.Spade's dark moods and murky morals become clearer as the movie progresses , and even when events seem to spiral away from him , the viewer is constantly aware that he's in control . Beautiful touches from veteran actors complete John Huston's direction , ie.. Peter Lorre's subtle , sideways glances that tell the world that Joel Cairo ( Hammet's great gift for character names evident again) can't be trusted. Mary Astor's coquetish hand wringing and girlish hesitation belying her calculating menace. And who could ever play the cultured "fat man" villain better than Sidney Greenstreet? You could go on through every role in the movie because there is not one weakness .... and the seemingly "silly lines" in the script almost appear to be left in purposely to flaw what is the perfect example of film noir. Watch and enjoy. JC</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like its even more popular quasi-sequel "Casablanca," this film earned its following more as a charming showcase for irresistible personalities than for its nebulous story or the bogus dialogue its stars were compelled to enliven. Happily, it created a memorable persona for Humphrey Bogart, prolonging his sex appeal even as his once-beautiful face collapsed into prunedom, and gave Mary Astor a last shot at glamor before giving it up as Judy Garland's ketchup-making mother in "Meet Me In St. Louis." The only actor who really lost out on "Maltese Falcon" was poor Peter Lorre. Although brilliant as always as the enticing gay playboy Joel Cairo, the film would reduce him from an established leading player to "character actor" status, as though he couldn't hold up a film without being stapled to the side of the amusing but basically incompatible Sydney Greenstreet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon is a virtually perfect movie, made from a great American novel. Reputedly, John Huston had his secretary transcribe the novel, scene by scene, into screenplay form. Some implied nudity and sexuality in the book is even more distantly implied in the movie, but other than that the film is extremely faithful to the Dashiell Hammett original. The moody Max Steiner score, and the shadowy black and white cinematography, the supporting players, especially Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook, Jr., and the work of the stars, Bogart and Astor, all fulfill the descriptions and language of the book. This picture is worth seeing again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come closer...I want to talk to you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The above is from the trailer of "The Maltese Falcon", spoken by a black-clad Sydney Greenstreet, who wants to invite us on a magical mystery tour that ultimately is the first and final word on the detective genre. Raymond Chandler may be more renowned, but Dashiell Hammet (hailed by no less a personage than lawyer/child activist/neo-noir writer Andrew Vachss as "True father of the Black Mask Boys") put the gritty realism in the detective genre and very little, if any, of that grit is lost in this superb debut by one of Hollywood's finest craftsmen, John Huston. I first watched this when I was about 13 and though my recollection of the film has since proved to be hazy, I never did forget the feel of the film. It was like being slammed up against a wall by a sledgehammer. My subsequent reading of the novel itself was far from disappointing; I could virtually replay entire scenes of the film just by reading Hammet's spare but vivid descriptions.Entertainment Weekly described this film as "Bogie the Legend Pt. 1". Not quite true. Bogie's Sam Spade has a lot more rough edges than his subsequent roles in such films as "Across the Pacific" and "Casablanca". Bogie's frequently underrated skill as an actor makes Spade believable throughout. He has an iron-clad code of ethics that put him at odds with his "rogue's gallery of deceivers" (who only seem to believe in money), but he has no trouble whatsoever knocking Peter Lorre senseless or taking away Elisha Cook's guns as casually as a pickpocket would lift a wallet (though, to be fair, Spade is a lot more violent in his methods). Therefore, I think of Sam Spade as a "borderline" character, the one that stands between Bogie's earlier gangsters and his later burnt romantics. The final metamorphisis would not be complete until "Casablanca" came along.The rest of the cast is top of the line. Peter Lorre makes Joel Cairo out to be a slightly sinister, slightly spineless henchman. Mary Astor's Bridgit O'Shaugnessy set the model of the "femme fatale" that all such successors would follow. Elisha Cook as the hair-trigger Wilmer is a study in mindless viciousness. Finally, Sydney Greenstreet begins to carve out his own unique, oversized niche as the charming, polite, but ultimately slimy and loathsome crime boss that is Kasper Gutman. Say what you will about this movie's successors; ultimately, they're all just faded photocopies of "The Maltese Falcon". The stuff dreams are made of, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of tough talk...little violence. Some SPOILERS,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SAM SPADE gets wrapped up in the quest for the MALTESE FALCON when his partner gets whacked. This film talks tough but has little graphic violence, sure, PETER LOREE gets slapped around like a 25 cent whore a few times, and there is a little gun play.... but for the most part, it's tough talk. This film is a commentary on the quest for materialistic wealth in the form of the unattainable (a rare statue). Along the way Bogart locks horns with traitorous women, shadey underworld types, and abusive cops. Like most 1940's movies, the talk is tough, and when it comes to tough talk...well, er, nobody out-talks Bogart. This is film is a poster child for the FILM NOIR style of the 1940's. I tend to like this style, that hinges on the use of light and shadows. If you enjoy this era's detective film's...this one will be up your alley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really cool! It's one of my favorites from the old times! The cast was excellent, the storyline and plots were good too! Humphrey Bogart did an excellent job playing Sam Spade! He was always good at playing a detective, hero, or whatever. He was my favorite in this. Also, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre were good in this, too as the bad guys, Kasper Gutman and Joel Cairo. I've read the book, but the book is a little better than the movie. The best part was where they discover the Maltese Falcon was a fake, Joel Cairo kept screaming and crying at Kasper Gutman calling him an imbecile and idiot. Also, I liked Spade's realtionship with Iva Archer in this, too.  This movie is a true classic! It has mystery, drama, a little humor, and romance too! This flick has a little something in it for everyone. If you haven't seen it yet, then you don't know what you're missing! ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The key question of this great film and book is the understanding of the Spade character:On one hand if Spade is a loveless, mistrusting figure with no confidence in love and no sense of the chance for love that comes his way in the endor on the other hand if Spade is a realist who cunningly sees a trap that the female character is placing before him that most people would fail to see, because of the chance of romance and a happy ending ?To me he is a realist with ethics (not the stuff that dreams are made of). And the answer to this question of course gives the answer to whether his actions are justified.Many critics have, however, seen the Spade character as the classic film noir "hero", i.e. a mistrusting figure of no love ("it takes one to know one" etc.). As mentioned, I don't agree, but I guess we all have our gut feeling about such a matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MALTESE FALCON ( rating, * * * * ? out of 5 )This would have to be the coolest detective mystery ever made and probably the first in the genre of film-noir. It's mood, humor and rich texture providing the inspiration for many copies - some skillful, others just blatant and second-rate imitations.'The Maltese Falcon' is taken from the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name and is faithfully reproduced by writer and debut director, John Huston. It is however, a superior remake of the 1931 film of the same name. Hollywood has a fine history of producing shoddy remakes but in this case, the original is far from the best.There are many ingredients that make this film the timeless classic it is - Humphrey Bogart's discerning portrayal of Sam Spade, Mary Astor's sexy rendering of Ruth Wonderly, a support cast that includes perennial favorites Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, but for me it was the brilliant black and white photography. It delivers complete purpose to every critical aspect and generates a healthy measure of muscle with equally proportioned pathos.'The Maltese Falcon' moves at a scorching pace and this break-neck speed is derived from the snappy dialogue. As Sam Spade confronts Cairo (Peter Lorre) and delivers the line, "When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it," one can only sit in delightful anticipation of what will come next.Everything about this film is riveting as individual scenes begin to accumulate and form the basis of a structure that is both unique and highly entertaining. As the final credits appeared, I found myself wanting more - I wanted more charismatic villains, I wanted more heroes in the true tough-guy fashion, I wanted more deception, more posturing and more rugged suavity.'The Maltese Falcon' is all about delivering style with lashings of intelligent story-telling. Fifty three years after its first release, this movie is still going strong with elements that can still captivate constituents of generation X. For me, this only confirms what a splendid film this really is - because that is the true test of quality. And how does it hold up after repeated viewing? Even after the sacrilegious act of colorization, very well thank you.</fullReview>

What a pity Sidney Greenstreet was not "discovered" by the movies earlier. In his few remaining years he proved himself the perfect Hollywood villain.

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon is a movie that truly is several steps ahead of its audience at all times. It is extremely fast paced, well acted &amp; directed, and many plot twists right up until the final scene that keep us all in suspense. As the story opens, the San Francisco detective firm of Spade &amp; Archer take on a new client, Miss Wanderley, who supposedly is trying to locate her sister, and also claims to be in some sort of grave danger. Miles Archer, while shadowing Miss Wanderley that night, is shot down, the camera facing him, so we have no idea of the killer's identity. Sam Spade, while investigating his partner's death, finds out that Miss Wanderley is really Bridget O'Shaughnessy, who along with two wonderfully colorful characters, Kasper Gutman and Joel Cairo, are after a prized statue - The Maltese Falcon. A series of cat and mouse games played by all four, leading up to the climactic conclusion, makes for great entertainment. Humphrey Bogart, prior to The Maltese Falcon, had become type cast due to roles that had him portraying characters on the wrong side of the law. As Sam Spade, Bogart finally was given a part that would in turn lead to the personna he was to become most famous for - tough yet sympathetic, loyal, and sexy. In short, a man's man. It is impossible today to think of anyone else in the 4 lead roles except Bogart, Mary Astor, Sidney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre. This is Film Noir at its best, with John Huston doing a brilliant job of directing.</fullReview>

As one actor finishes a line, the other picks up and continues. The characters don't walk out of the room; they drift out. Bogart's character is so intelligent in this film; he is three and four steps ahead of everyone around him. The thing that I enjoy about old films like these is that they are timeless smart plots that make you think as an audience. There are times when I'm in a video store, and someone says, "I can't find anything." Little do they know that they are surrounded by classic movies. A new release is a film we have never seen.

		<fullReview>The noir film is one of the most visited genres of early Hollywood, and to this day none have been able to top The Maltese Falcon. It is, in ways, the definitive noir film. You have all the elements in there.. The detective, the beautiful woman who has some secrets of her own, the unsolved murder, and the brilliantly constructed plot which brings them all together. The Maltese Falcon is one of the first of the noir films, and definitely one of the best.Humpherey Bogart plays detective Sam Spade. A mysterious woman walks into his office one day and asks him to track a man for her. Sam's partner takes the job and he mysteriously winds up dead.As Sam investigates the death of his partner he finds out that it's not as simple as it seems. He soon finds himself in the center of a manhunt for a valuable statue of a bird known simply as the Maltese falcon. The mysterious woman is only one of a series of shady characters that are all attempting to gain possession of the statue. One thing leads to another and Sam finds out that he's much deeper into this case than he ever wanted to be. The truth is twisted, people are betrayed, and all is not as it seems.The Maltese Falcon is a prime example of how some people were just born to make movies. This film was John Huston's first, and he pulls everything off so flawlessly that you'd think he's been directing for years. Bogart is terrifically cast in the role of Sam, he practically defined the method of playing a detective in this film. You are him, uncovering clues and being doublecrossed as the movie progresses. This is one of the movies that made Bogie "The Man".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun fact: the Huston family has seen three generations of Academy Award winners. Even considering that, like American political 'dynasties,' there is no shortage of acting dynasties, such is an impressive feat. Nepotism can take you far, but only so far. You need talent. And this family had it. Onto the review.It's amazing how many people think that adapting books into movies is a new idea. Yes, one could argue that adapting the most popular books out there purely for the name value is new, but originality has never been one of Hollywood's strong suits. They are and always have been an enterprise, after all. Even when they didn't have to sell movies that were made for nine digits to a worldwide audience, they still wanted to line their pockets. You think that all those old Hollywood mansions built the Golden Age of Cinema were paid for by people who wanted to see only the most esoteric fare?After all this grand posturing, you may think that The Maltese Falcon was based on a book. And you would be right. I rarely hold back surprises. It was a fine book, written in 1929 by Dashiell Hammett. But its being forgotten or, at best, being known as just a shadow of the movie is not entirely insensible. Though I am a writer by nature, I verily say that a fine, well-paced novel does not hold a candle to a film that created a new genre.I am, of course, talking about film noir. It is one of my favorite genres of all time. Even works that parody it are automatically more likely to catch my eye. It is to me what Star Wars lightsabres are to many fanboys: a surefire way to catch my attention. It combines some of some of my favorite cinematic elements: stylistic darkness, an earned and not-dreary drizzling of cynicism, opening narrations, and so forth. Thankfully, I'm not the only one. Otherwise, we wouldn't have neo-noir films. I even like its name. Noir. Say it a few times and feel how good it sounds coming off your tongue. It means 'black' in French. And one should really use that whole sentence when saying such. Do not leave off the 'in French' part. Because noir movies are not just 'black'; they are black in a traditionally French way. There is no other genre where the name so informationally and stylistically fits the movies it entails.If nothing else, this movie is in my top one hundred films of all time merely because it both created the genre and is one of the best examples of it. You are not just invested in Sam Spade as he investigates, you are invested in him in a way that people at the time had never seen before. Of course, if you don't watch older movies, you may never have seen a film like this either.It pulls you into its climate, but it does not do so by overwhelming you with so much art and radiance that your mind has no choice but to be absorbed in it, like is the case with many great animated films (and the Mad Max movies). Nor does it do so by spiraling you down into a castle that seems to bend space and time, augmenting the fabric of reality itself, as is the case with many great Nolan and Kubrick films. No; it greets you with a crispy, worn, learned hand and asks you firmly to come along with it. Though it is perhaps based less in reality than even Nolan and Kubrick films, it makes you feel like you're in the truest sort of reality, like all the dark, most 'real' parts of reality have been smashed into one film.You may have noticed that I have not talked at all about the plot and characters. This is not because they are irrelevant or simple, because they are not. You can tell that this is an adaptation of a novel; after you've written for a while, you learn to recognize the fingerprints of a novelist anywhere you go. It is complex and multi-layered and not too concerned with making us go to bed with visions of sugarplums in our heads. But the tone and style of the film are so closely intertwined with the screenplay that it seems as if they are one. If I wanted to pick and choose only story elements, it would be like trying to pull red bands out of snakeskin....I'm not making a very good case for myself, am I?So be it. I will spare at least a paragraph to say that there is not a bad performance in the movie. Mary Astor as Brigid O'Shaughnessy, Gladys George as Iva Archer, and Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo are great. And Bogart is well... Bogart. In the AFI's poll of the greatest actors, he ended up first, ahead of Brando. That's about right. Brando is a better actor. But Bogart is everything a movie star should be. There's a reason that I encountered many references to him before I was even old enough to know who he is.This is a movie that I cannot recommend enough. No matter how eloquent I am, my words are, to some extent, futile. You have to see this movie to know full of what i am talking. If you have not seen this movie, see it. If you have seen it once, see it again. If you have seen it 37 times, watch it a thirty-eighth. Just watch it. It's... the stuff dreams are made of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the hero as a better shark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when John Huston took on the challenge of bringing "The Maltese Falcon" to the screen, he recognized a problem with Hammett's novel that previous screen adaptations had missed entirely.Hammett's Spade is an inveterate liar. Whatever his ethical commitment to his job, his partner, the law, in fulfillment of these commitments he just about never tells the truth.If audiences - of the book as well of this film - miss this, it is because the sea in which Spade swims is filled with sharks - thieves, killers, adulteresses, corrupt police and politicians. In such an environment, its probably best to keep one's teeth sharp and one's senses sharper. One can only accomplish something remotely heroic if one has first become a better shark.Does Huston manage to get this point across? Not entirely; it's really a difficult point to make in film, and the films that do make it strongly tend to be pure crime sagas, like "Public Enemy" or "The Godfather".Nonetheless, Huston certainly keeps us guessing on essential points, right to the end - and beyond. Does Spade really love O'Shaughnessy? If he could have gotten away with the real Falcon, would he have kept his bargain with Gutman? And now what's he going to do with his partner's wife, who was just a casual fling after all? There's no doubt that Huston directs the finale to be as final as can be - but the seriousness of such questions gives the film a weight it can't unload.Finally, it should be noted that Huston's gambit here would never have worked without exquisite performances from an ensemble cast.Improves on multiple viewings - give it a chance, it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart plays grimacing detective Sam Spade in John Huston's "The Maltese Falcon" - a classic film; and, it deserves that status, in many respects. The performances and "noir look" of the film help tremendously. Peter Lorre's was the best characterization - and, he's great with "The Fat Man" Sydney Greenstreet. Mr. Bogart was memorable, as was Mary Astor, but, I didn't see any special magic in their relationship (perhaps none was intended). It was nice to see Bogart paired with a woman closer to his own age. The weakest element in "The Maltese Falcon" is a story that never really takes a stranglehold on your mind; which is made worse by the fact that it always seems like it is about to - like there is some mysterious all-connecting story element to be revealed (perhaps none was intended). ******** The Maltese Falcon (10/3/41) John Huston ~ Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say but: "Excellent!" Humphrey Bogart is in practically every scene of this remarkable film. We all know that Bogie was a great star but he hadn't reached that point yet when he was cast in "The Maltese Falcon". Of course, he sort of owe all his good fortune to George Raft as we all know but could you even imagine Raft in this role. I certainly can't.As for the other performers, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet are the two most hilarious interpreters of evil ever to be put on film. It is easy to see why Warner Bros. tried to capitalize on this pair in numerous other movies of the 40's. As for Mary Astor, she really revels in "phoniness" and by that I mean portraying con man, one of the first played as a female.John Huston, the director, certainly knew what he was doing and he gets the atmosphere of 40's seediness just right. The movie is mostly played at night, as are many other detective movies. He knows not to inform us about too much of the story and when we see who actually "did it" it comes as a genuine surprise.So, if you are one of those who hate black and white movies, you might wanna avoid this, but if you can look beyond that you will never find one that still holds up today as one of the best movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Maltese Falcon' has one of those really intelligent scripts that might seem complicated but when watching carefully is very clear and very entertaining.what makes it so special in my opinion is that even though its old age (filmed in 1941) it could still be appropriate to watch and also impressive to the common viewer these days.Humphrey Bogart's very well acted private investigator Sam Spade, the star of this whole film noir piece is surrounded by more then a couple very "interesting" characters that give out some very nice performances as well and one peculiar golden falcon that makes them all twist and turn around themselves.one murder leads to the other and the guessing is left to us about who's responsible.justice, well not poetic but the kind of justice that will put a smile on your face when the credits will show up.you wont be disappointed for two reasons, the first one is that you wont have the reaction of not understanding why this is so highly rated or so well respected after finishing watching it.its pretty clear why it is considered a classic.the second reason is Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart), close to the end you will hear him say something that will sound like this "I Won't Play The Sap For You", to understand what it means you must watch the movie but ill just give a little hint that in contradiction to so many men that fell victim to the charm of a woman, Bogie does not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lost bird...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: Sam Spade is a private detective in San Francisco when a ordinary case that dropped in his lap suddenly evolves into a great and dangerous mystery. A beautiful woman under a false name says she wants a man followed in hope to rescue her lost sister. But that tail leads to Spade's partner getting shot dead, the woman's story quickly falls apart as more and more people turns up taking an interest in the case. Spade must keep his nose above the water in order to survive, and maybe make a profit out of it.Comments: A delicately put mystery, with twists and turns coming as quick and hidden as they can be. Which is both the main strength and weakness of the movie. You must keep alert to follow, which is good, the situation changes constantly. And the camera follows Spade, and takes his view as the story unravels. Which is good and neatly done. But this also leads to the state of me, as a viewer, being confused, and expecting being confused. You never really invest anything into the present situation, knowing that it will switch soon enough, so you never really get surprised when that switch comes. And that is the weakness. A great mystery with a twist must fool the viewer to believe the present, but at the same time subtlety plant a foreshadowing of the twist. So when the twist comes, and the situation changes, you'll be surprised, but when thinking/looking it over you can discover the leads and find the logic. In the Maltese Falcon you never really care to look for many leads, as you know them to be false... However, the mystery is entertaining to follow, but it is limited to just that, follow, a passive viewer. You can't participate to solve it...The actors give good performances. Bogart is there almost always and never misses a cue. His rambling speeches with some little quirks neatly inserted, as when he is at the DA's office, are great. But the best performance is the Fat man, although he can be a little too much sometimes. Haha - not that he is big - but he repeats himself a little too much sometimes.So, I felt it was a good mystery, but didn't quite live up to being #57 on the top list.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"When a man's partner is killed, a man's expected to do something about it." So says HUMPHREY BOGART in his star-making role under John Huston's direction in this taut thriller from a Raymond Chandler novel.Bogart handles all of his crisp, tough guy dialog in fine form, very expressive in the way he gazes suspiciously at the lying MARY ASTOR as the story's femme fatale--or in the sly way he deals with SYDNEY GREENSTREET, PETER LORRE or ELISHA COOK, JR. He actually becomes Sam Spade, as if he understands the character inside out.And contrary to others, I have to say that Astor (while looking a little matronly with that unbecoming '40s hair-do), does an equally fine job as the conniving woman who's at the bottom of a greedy plot. Astor has some great scenes where the camera looks into her eyes and sees all the complexities beneath the surface as she deals with others in a very nervous manner while she spins a web of lies that are making her uneasy. She's brilliant in the role.The cast does a tremendous job of bringing the story to life--and so, of course, does John Huston, who has firm control over the style of this extraordinary film noir. Interesting that he gave a bit role to his famous father, Walter Huston, who has a brief part as Captain Jacoby, clutching the sought after icon before he dies from a gunshot wound.Elisha Cook, Jr. does a standout job as Wilmer, tears streaking down his face when he has to take verbal abuse from Sam Spade. And, of course, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet were so impressive that they were paired in many a Warner film after this.By all means, well worth seeing and enjoying, fully deserving its reputation as a classic film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first true 'noir' and Bogart's star-making role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The, uh, stuff that dreams are made of' Humphrey Bogart came out of 1941's 'High Sierra' with more critical plaudits than he had enjoyed at any other time in his career with Warner Bros (with the possible exception of 'The Petrified Forest'). Except he wasn't yet a big star, and Lupino still got billing over him. That all changed when he took on the role as cynical detective Sam Spade in the classic 'The Maltese Falcon'. 'Falcon' also established John Huston's career as an exceptional film-maker, and the noir genre.Bogart oozes charisma as the hard-boiled detective Spade. It is a great acting performance that well and truly established the 'Bogart persona'. Spade is dry and cynical, untrusting and seemingly incapable of normal human affection, yet women are entranced by him and men are slightly awed by him. Spade is investigating the murder of his partner, Miles Archer. Things get very tricky, very quickly. Archer was tailing a man for an apparently concerned sister, Ms Wonderley (Mary Astor), when he just happened to be shot. But Ms Wonderley is not who she says she is. She's really a suspicious femme fatale named Brigid O'Shaugnessy who has her eyes both on Spade and on a jewel-encrusted statue of a falcon. Spade then finds himself mixed up with a whole bunch of shady characters who are all desperate to get their sweaty hands on this elusive bird.The falcon works as the McGuffin (a Hitchock trademark)in this saga. Everyone wants it, and would even commit murder to get it. Fat man Kaspar Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet, absolutely wonderful in the role) is particularly interested in the bird, and he is the one who has hired a whole team of high-living low-lives including Brigid, Joel Cairo (The marvelous Peter Lorre)and Wilmer Cook to get it in any way they can. Problem is, none of these would-be thieves are particularly trustworthy.Others have commented on Astor's unsuitability for the femme fatale role of Brigid. Astor does look a tad matronly as the dangerous woman Spade is most interested in, but her school-girl appearance and vulnerable manner add to the ambiguous nature of her character. Femme fatales are double-crossing, elusive, smart, dangerous females, and she has those qualities in droves.It is the first screen pairing of Lorre and Greenstreet in 'Falcon'. Greenstreat drips with perspiration and charm as the most intriguing character of the bunch, Gutman. Lorre's turn as the effeminate Cairo is spot-on. The portrayal of Cairo is also notable because of the homosexual element attached to it. Cairo is clearly gay by today's standards, and this is shown in Old Hollywood through his gestures, high-pitched voice and the gardenia-perfumed business card he leaves for Spade.Rising above all the shifty characters is the style. Indeed, style was probably the most important component of noir, and 'Falcon' has it in spades (pardon the pun). The plot is complicated and ultimately flawed, yet the shadows, lighting, mood and atmosphere are all perfect. 'Falcon' is positively dripping with suspense and intrigue, so we can forgive the dodgy plot for this. The script is immaculate, one of the best produced by Hollywood in the 40's, and the whole product is fresh. I doubt this film will ever get old.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie probably over 40 times and I loved it (except the colorized version). But my comment is not to add further praises to what I consider beyond praises. I just want to ask a question expecting that perhaps somebody might agree, and have an explanation. My inquiry is about the uncredited actor that play the short dead scene of Captain Jacoby of "La Paloma", while delivering the falcon. For years I have recognize him as Walter Houston, father of John. I could be wrong but look at him carefully. Did John got short of one actor at the time when his dad was by his side? Considering how famous was he at the time, is understandable that he did not desired credit, for such a bit part. There has to be some history behind this, if I am correct.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies of all time. One reason is the look of the film. It was released in the same year as Citzen Kane and praise for that film's innovations overshadowed it; but like Welles' film, The Maltese Falcon was one of the first great examples of the technique of "deep focus" cinematography, which allowed Huston to get great black and white images, that deep-grained clarity you appreciate but are barely aware of. He also used light and shadow to great effect, far more subtly than Citzen Kane. Of course it has stylised dialogue in the manner of the Hammett book upon which it is based, but the brilliant cast gives the characters real depth. The defining emotion of the story is greed and the hardness and ruthlessness that they all display to get their hands on the Falcon, best of all Mary Astor as Brigid. She's ambiguous to the end. You know she's as hard as any of them and you're never quite sure whether her vulnerability is real or a carefully controlled put-on. This is an intelligent film -- I would disagree with the reviewer who said it's complex from the start. It develops the characters and it makes twists and turns, but an averagely intelligent person would never lose his way. Anyone who likes good storytelling in film will want to see this, more than once.</fullReview>

With its superb cast,Mary Astor keeps you guessing almost to the very end that she is the protagonist. Bogart at his best, and the incomparable teaming up of Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, who could ask for anything more! In keeping with the genre Film Noir, the darkly lit scenes,the shadows,the camera angles and the speech patterns of the characters all contributed to this feeling of failure in the characters lives. All were greedy and all were losers. The superb direction of John Houston kept this picture at a high level. This was a typical John Houston flick. The unappreciated Elisha Cook Jr. as the psychotic killer, as always was outstanding. A wonderful movie that lived up to the novel and its author Dashiell Hammett.</fullReview>

Soon Bogart learns that there is a very rare statuette of a falcon that is made up of gold and priceless jewels under its molding.

Also Bogart has to constantly dodge pesky cops Ward Bond and Barton MacLane as he does his best to learn what the true mystery of the titled item is.

		<shortDescription>SPOILER ALERT: The Real Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film buffs are quick to point out that the Falcon is nothing but a McGuffin (a device that appears in the film and seems to drive the logic of the plot, but which actually serves no further purpose), but nobody seems to be interested in discussing what the plot is really about. The story of "The Maltese Falcon" is the one of Sam Spade solving the murder of his partner. It's an excellently crafted story and one which obeys the basic rules of mystery in that it gives the viewer all of the information available to the detective who solves it (or nearly all of it).When we see Miles Archer being shot, he is standing calmly with his hands in his pockets. He seems surprised as a gun is raised by an unseen assailant to shoot him, but not alarmed or afraid. At the scene of the crime, the police inform Spade that Archer has his gun tucked away in his hip and his overcoat buttoned. Spade informs the police that Archer had been tailing a guy named Thursby. Later, when Thursby is found shot, the police suggest that Spade had the motivation to kill a guy who had murdered his partner, but Spade does not respond. He only states that he has never seen Thursby, dead or alive. The only vital piece of information we haven't been given is Spade's opinion that "Mile's hadn't many brains, but he'd had too many years of experience as a detective to be caught like that..."At this point the movie goes off on the Falcon sub-plot, completely taking our mind off of the Archer murder. Spade has never said anything to suggest that he believes Thursby to be the murderer, but we, and the police, fill in that detail for ourselves. We forget about it and move on. It isn't until the final scene that this main plot of the movie re-emerges and we realize that solving the murder of his partner was Spade's motivation all along. "When a man's partner is killed, he's supposed to do something about it. It doesn't make any difference what you thought of him. He was your partner, and you're supposed to do something about it." If there is any flaw in this nearly perfect film, it's that the Falcon diversion is so effective that we still leave the movie not fully realizing what the story was actually about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bogart stars in this 1941 film, "The Maltese Falcon", near the middle of his 80-film career spanning 1928 through 1956, and a couple of years before his great role as Rick in "Casablanca." He plays Sam Spade who is hired to help recover the mythical Maltese Falcon, supposedly a jeweled statue from 1500s that was lost in a ship wreck. Each scene turns up new surprises, several people are killed, and eventually the bad guys get caught.We never see the real falcon, only the lead one that was recovered, so maybe there will be a sequel?? :-) This was writer/director John Huston's first film, and the snappy and often funny dialog is just so perfect. Bogart of course delivers them as only he could during those times. It reminds me of the style modern actor Matt Damon uses at times, to wit, his monologue in "Good Will Hunting" where he is explaining why he does not want to work on code-breaking for the government.Filming techniques have come a long way in 60 years, but it still is remarkable what they were able to do in the days before color and special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon is probably the best of the hard boiled detective films ever to be produced by Hollywood. Start off with a great story, and throw in a great actor to play Sam Spade. Bogart is crafty as Spade. He plays both sides in his hunt to find out who killed his partner. It all adds up to a mysterious black bird that men will pay handsomely for. An odd assortment of characters drifts into Sam's life. Brigid O'Shaunessy, a mysterious woman who may know more than she knows. A strange little man named Cairo who wants the bird. Mr. Gutman, also known as the Fatman who is willing to pay Spade an exorbant amount of money for the bird. The great fun in the film is watching the scenes of double crossing and outsmarting. Spade doesn't have the bird, but he plays his hand like he has it and in doing so, learns more about the bird, and to what means people will do to get it. In the end, when all is said and done, Spade sums up what the bird is, the stuff dreams are made of. Great entertainment that has rarely been copied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Private investigator Sam Spade becomes embroiled in a murky world of greed and murder when the beautiful Miss Wonderly enlists his services. With stylish wide-brim hat pulled down over one eye, the wisecracking Spade is the quintessential gumshoe hero. But is he good enough to take on the international gang of smugglers? Or will the doctors soon be "picking iron out of his liver"?Written and directed by a tyro John Huston, based on a novel by the great Dashiel Hammett and starring Humphrey Bogart, this film boasts the best of pedigrees. Gone are the frivolous thirties, with white ties, tails and blondes dancing on revolving stairs. The darker forties are ushered in by this 'problem' movie, in which motives are ugly, prospects of survival are grim and nobody can trust anybody. The influence of German Expressionism is everywhere - skewed camera angles and plunging perspectives reinforce the pervading sense of unease and insecurity. Who is double-crossing whom is almost impossible to work out in this merciless world where chivalry is seen as weakness - "When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it."Peter Lorre plays Joel Cairo as an exotic creature from seemingly another planet, with his gardenia-scented calling cards and purring obsequiousness. Mary Astor is good as the double-dealing Brigid O'Shaughnessy, and Lee Patrick is an inspired piece of casting as the cheerful, long-suffering Effie. Sidney Greenstreet commands the screen as Gutman, combining charm and menace brilliantly. Elisha Cook's memorably gauche Wilbur, the aspiring 'heavy', is great fun. Ward Bond is the affable detective, Tom Polhaus.Bogart is Bogart. Slick, sarcastic and far smarter than anybody else, he invests Spade with the definitive blend of tough talk and sex appeal. Spade certainly gets the girls, enjoying smouldering clinches with Iva and Brigid, and strong hints of a 'thing' with Effie. Gladys George is a camp delight as Iva the passionate widow, demurely retreating beneath her black veil. "By gad sir, you are a character," opines Gutman to Spade, and thedames certainly think so. Sex bubbles ominously under the surface in this 'new wave' of movie-making, in which the hero can retain our sympathy despite his illicit sexual liaisons.The film positively drips with style, and contains some superb touches. Archer's dead body, rolling downhill and throwing up dust, is almost beautiful. The dead man's empty chair silently rebukes Spade as he kisses Iva. Once Archer is off the scene, the new lettering on the doorglass can project our hero's name onto the carpet in a striking Expressionist flourish. Spade is always one step ahead of the opposition, an extraordinary man whose sharpness of intellect is demonstrated in the reading of Brigid's hat label, the luger reasoning and the business with the key. When Spade gets Brigid and Cairo together in one room to negotiate, his role as the arbiter and string-puller is illustrated for us by the camera's perspective, making Bogart's body loom large between the adversaries.The mere mention of the 'fat man', before he ever appears onscreen, is enough to cause perturbation in those who know him. This clever device sets up Gutman as the powerful malevolent force in the story. The sets are one of the film's triumphs. The hotel lobby is superb, as is the view down to the street from Spade's apartment window. Spade antagonises Wilbur effortlessly by blowing cigrette smoke in his face. When Spade first realises he has Gutman on the phone, the camera zooms in on him, graphically conveying his surprise. One enjoyable vignette is Spade's argument with the District Attorney, the 'ordinary joe' trouncing the panoply of the state."Falcon" is a masterpiece, the definitive noir with its mixture of suspense, style and black humour. The plot is clever and the acting terrific. As Gutman would say, "It was neatly done, sir, indeed it was."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This here, folks, is a classy movie. Sam Spade has got to be one of the coolest characters I've ever seen, played by the ever-slick Humphrey Bogart in his break-out role. The rest of the cast were great as well, especially Astor and Lorre. The plot kept me guessing until the final frame, and that last shot was phenomenal. I was very impressed by many of the shots in this movie, John Huston did a very good job directing this masterpiece. If you area fan of mystery films, don't put this one off any longer! It is one of the all-time classics, and deservedly so. Everything comes together perfectly, leading to a great ending, and a classic closing line.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't bear the test of time - only of historical interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film noir may have been ground breaking in 1941 but it is one of those films that just doesn't stand the test of time. It's too dated to be of entertainment value today.I can see Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Sam Spade is influential. But the other performances are kind of stiff.The directing by John Huston isn't great. People stand stiffly around while a very fake punch takes place between two people. The action is abrupt and comical shifting from no action to punch then no reaction. It's almost comical in it's absurdity. Selznick and Hitchcock did not direct so stiffly at that time. So it's not just that it's old.This is one for historians only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but a Masterpiece it is not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some Spoilers ahead.The Maltese Falcon has a lot going for it. What it did for the Film Noir Genre and Humphrey Bogart can not be denied. And it certainly is brimming with quotable dialogue. But its just not a masterpiece. I'm sorry, but its not.Humphrey Bogart and Peter Lorre are fantastic in their respective roles and the movie is worth watching for them alone. Sydney Greenstreet pulls off another good character portrayal as well. But Mary Astor is just dreadful. Am I the only one to see her reading from a queue card in her first speech in Spade and Archer's office? From then on she continues to be wooden and boring. No wonder Bogey turned her over to the other side in the end, I would have too. I saw better chemistry in my 8th grade science class.And what is up with Wilmer Cook. How did this guy get to be a gangster? He is incompetent and meek. What was the Gutman thinking taking on this guy? Brigid works herself into a tizzy when she first learns the Fat Man is in town, but Why? Because of this guy?The story does have a very tidy plot that is enjoyable to watch unfold. But why does Sam spade, who is smart enough to talk two policemen out of arresting everybody, give a gun back to Cairo AND Wilmer? You can say it's because he knew they needed him alive, but come on, its just plain stupid to give the enemy his gun back... twice. He should have learned his lesson the first time, or not bothered to take the gun away at all.Despite the problems I have, I'd still recommend this classic to anyone who enjoys a good movie, especially to Lorre or Bogey fans. But my recommendation comes with the caveat that Astor isn't worthy to be in this movie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first filmed noir story is a pure gem after so many years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston's first film, The Maltese Falcon, from Dashell Hammiet's novel, makes itself a classic on the first watch with two things- great story development and a great lead/breakthrough. Bogart, in his first role after a decade of B pictures, bursts with a range and scope comparable to Casablanca, and is as memorable as private investigator Sam Spade. After Spade's partner is shot following taking a case involving a Mr. Miles, Spade gets thrown into an intrigue, a deal, involving a gold encrusted bird. But there are indeed other parties as interested as him in finding it. Along with Bogart, Peter Locke, Sydney Greenstreet, and his female counterpart Mary Astor, all shine and make the cold hearted and darkly funny moments last after over half a century. As noteworthy as mystery films truly get. A++</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogarts acting was superb as always in this film. His character Sam Spade was played to a tee. It seems to come natural to Bogart playing this hard headed, I don't play by the rules private eye. I really liked seeing Humphrey Bogart take on one of his good guy roles. He proves his great diversity in character roles in this movie. The rest of the actors were brilliantly cast as well. While the acting and dialog in this movie was well done I really did not enjoy the storyline. It seemed very dull and the parts that were supposed to be exciting seemed uneventful. Not to say this movies plot did not have enough to its storyline. There was still enough turns in the plot and suspenseful parts the movie attempted to make thrilling. This movie is a classic Detective film that I believe Bogart saves with his acting and character once again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snappy and entertaining, but too faithful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredibly quick-paced and slavishly faithful to the novel, it definitely deserves its classic status, but I wouldn't call it the greatest noir ever made. Bogart is pitch-perfect as Sam Spade, and Lorre and Greenstreet do great supporting work, and the dialogue is just as slick and snappy as it is in the book. But that's because it's the exact same dialogue, save for the famous last words. For someone who'd never read the novel, I'm sure it would be fresh and exciting, but for me, having just read the novel, it was kinda boring. Same with the story; I knew exactly what was gonna happen. This is only a minor knock against the film, because it's solidly directed by Huston and it's very entertaining. But it's not a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The novel is like a shooting script for the film - in fact it's written like a film. When Mary Astor played this role she was about 35 and had just had a baby. She loved her bizarre hairstyle which was created just for her to tame her very curly hair. She had been a child star noted for her fine features and porcelain- doll appearance. That doll-like pretttiness, just beginning to tarnish, is perfect for the role of Brigid. Brigid is a woman who has traded on her looks and her "ladylike" persona (and total lack of morals) to live off men for years. She may be worrying that it won't work for her much longer. What she needs is a really big score - like a piece of the Maltese Falcon, or maybe all of it for herself. Mary plays her brilliantly. Her face seems to be burning away from within, and apart from her first appearance in Sam's office, where she was pulling out all the stops, she looks tired and haggard. So much for those who complain she's not a "babe". Another piece of trivia: gunsel was slang for rent boy, not gun man (according to Raymond Chandler). Yes, I agree that Guttman's voice saying "It's fake! It's phony" is dubbed on. And what happens to Sam's bed? In later scenes it has become a sofa and it wasn't the fold-up type... You can tell how many times I have seen this movie, the only one I've given 10 points to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If you lose a son, it's possible to get another. There's only one Maltese Falcon"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film noir was a boon to Humphrey Bogart. Essentially he could play the same roles as the cold, low down types he made supporting roles of in the 30s, but now these characters were in lead roles. Here he in his defining role, in a key film noir and debut of director John Huston.Film critics rarely agree on what was the first film noir. There are arguments for there being noirs before it, and there are arguments for it not being a true noir at all, but the Maltese Falcon is a convenient candidate for the primal film noir in the way that it seems constructed to announce itself and smash conventions. Conscience and cosiness are thrown out right from the start ? in scene one we are introduced to the cheerful and innocent Miles Archer; in scene two he is shot dead. As the plot bowls along there is nothing but greed, deception and double-dealing. When Spade does the decent thing it is only because, in his own words, "you're supposed to". Even the long dead crusaders aren't exempt from accusations. And, one of the least often cited film noir conventions, the women are the untrustworthiest of all.Also appropriate for the Maltese Falcon's status as a key early noir is the history of the novel it's based on. Cinema has always been some way behind literature in terms of what it can say and get away with, and Dashiell Hammett's novel had already been filmed twice, once as a heavily sanitised thriller and then again as a comedy, of all things. By the time Huston came along, cinema was acquiring a brutal honesty and his version is far closer to the original story than the previous two adaptations.Whatever its noir credentials, the Maltese Falcon also works as a great piece of entertainment. It's incredibly fast moving, with absolutely no excess baggage to the script. It is constantly engaging, which is strange since it is virtually all talking, with very little action. The answer to this is that the story is full of enough revelations and plot twists to keep the audience constantly engrossed. By the final scene ? a half-hour long tour-de-force ? your heart will be racing. The only downside to this spellbinding mystery structure is that the film will never be as exciting as the first time you see it.As for Huston, it's well known that he began his Hollywood career as a screenwriter. What's not so often acknowledged is that he was also a keen painter, and always considered this more important than his film career. His painterly influence isn't entirely obvious in the Maltese Falcon, it's not a pretty film as such ? although there is one very eye-catching shot of the burning Paloma ? but you can see he pays great attention to the set up of a shot. He has a real awareness of background and foreground, as well a knack for getting the perfect angle. He makes the already plump Sidney Greenstreet look like a small mountain.If following a director's themes and obsessions is your thing, the Maltese Falcon also provides a perfect example of Huston's cynicism for material goods (as embodied by the falcon itself) and his continual focus on failed quests and unachievable ends.The Maltese Falcon was bound to be considered a landmark film, marking as it does the debut of one of the greatest American directors of his era, the transition of a well-known character actor into Hollywood's top leading men, and in retrospect the beginnings of a whole genre. Aside from it's historical importance, it also happens to be one of Huston's best, one of Bogart's best, and one of film noir's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such stuff as dreams are made on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warner Brothers must have been really surprised at the rendering of this material in the hands of John Huston after the first "Maltese Falcon" starring Ricardo Cortez and the flippant "Satan Met a Lady" starring Warren William. What makes a classic? Well, there's a little chemistry involved, so it's not possible to totally define, but the 1941 "Maltese Falcon" fits the definition.Having seen the two misfires of this, the dramatic tone Huston took with the script serves the material very well. In the 1931 version, Cortez as Sam Spade is a relaxed playboy, and the emphasis seems to be on how many women he can shuffle around; the second is more on the style of "The Thin Man," with Warren William treating it all as a big joke. But in this "Maltese Falcon," the stakes are high, the danger is real, and the people are treacherous. We have a world-weary, no-nonsense detective in Bogart's Sam Spade, one who "may not be as crooked as you think I am." Instead of an obviously ruthless, sexy woman in the form of Bebe Daniels or the wide-eyed ingénue of Bette Davis, there's classy, serene, and beautiful Mary Astor - though Spade spots her shy demeanor as a put-on, he's still intrigued.Both Bogart and Astor are excellent, but two people bring this film up to a level undreamed of by previous directors - Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. Lorre as Joel Cairo is pure slime, and his scene with Ms. O'Shaughnessy (Astor) in Spade's office is one of the best in the film. Guttman (Greenstreet) has greed and obsession written all over his face, and Wilmer, his resident thug who's like a son to him, is incredibly cruel for the fun of it. Greenstreet and Lorre were in their day and in their way as big a team as Bogie and Bacall. Every film in which they appear is a treat.Huston lets each actor go to the extremes of his or her character's personality, thereby letting the tension build in the ambiguity of the situation. Is the Falcon story true? Spade chuckles over it. O'Shaughnessy wants him to get it for her. Can she be trusted? How far will Guttman go to possess it? And what of Miles Archer and Thursby? Who killed them? And how does Spade feel about his partner being killed? He is, after all, having an affair with Miles' wife (Gladys George) though he doesn't seem too interested in her now.All the performances are wonderful, including Lee Patrick as Sam's secretary. In this version, she's very capable and helpful, and while she doesn't seem to be romantically involved with Sam, she's fond of him.If you want to see what makes a classic, take a look at the two earlier versions of this film and then watch this one. Then you'll see for sure, as Shakespeare says and Spade paraphrases, "the stuff that dreams are made on."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film Noir, ever!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I can remember, I have heard how great this movie is. I understand it now.Humphry Bogart is the quintessential Film Noir detective. He is what all actors should strive to be: always in control, smooth and confidant. Mary Astor shows her talent with her brilliant portrayal of Brigid O'Shaughnessy. She goes from innocent victim to cold blooded killer effortlessly.And what can a person say about Peter Lorre except he is a legend for a reason. He is one of those people who can make you care about the character even if he is not exactly a good guy. I haven't said anything about the plot, which is stunning. I will only say that it concerns a mysterious idol called the Maltese Falcon. Saying much more would give too much away and that would be a disservice to anyone who has yet to discover this gem. Don't fall into the trap of thinking it's a dated movie. It isn't. Even though it was a contemporary piece at the time, it has aged gracefully and can now be considered a period piece in my book.A must see for any serious movie buff!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Having been lost and missing for almost five hundreds years since it was grabbed by a bunch of pirates on the high seas the Matlese Falcon, a black coded statue made of solid gold and encrusted with finest of jewels, had finally been tracked down in Hong Kong by the Fat Man. That enormous, in both body and mind, and well read and cultured Kasper Gutman, Sidney Greenstreet. It's there in the British Crown Colony where the Fat Man had a falling out with two of his gang members Brigid O'Shaughnessy, Mary Astor, and her boyfriend Thursby who checked out with the bird to what they thought was the safety of San Francisco.With The Fat Man and his boys sweet smelling Joel Cairo, Peter Lorre, and Wilmer "Two Gun" Cook, Elisha Cook Jr, bearing down on her and Thursby Brigid desperately go to SF private dick Sam Sapde, Humphrey Bogart, for help. Using the fake name Mrs. Wonderly Brigid claims that she's in the city looking for her kid sister Croinne who's being abused by her, Brigid's partner in crime, associate Thursby.Spade's partner PI Miles Archer, Jerome Cowan, at first takes the case. Later that evening checking on Thursby in his hotel Archer ends up getting shot and killed by an unknown gunman. It also turns out that Thursby is also murdered leaving Spade in a real tight spot by, besides Brigid, being the only person alive who knows or is about to know about what the connection is between the two murdered men: The Maltese FalconSpade is now in trouble with not only the Fat Man Mob but the police who think that he murdered both Archer and Thursby. Spade's secret affair with Archer's wife Iva, Gladys George, didn't help either giving him a motive to murder his partner. The movie then has Spade being confronted by the Fat Man's two buffoonish hit-men Cairo &amp; Cook, the comical C&amp;C boys. Tough guy Spade has no trouble at all making monkeys of them by alway beating the two doofuses to the punch and taking their pieces, guns, away from them without even breaking a sweat.There's a big break in the case of the missing bird that suddenly comes out to the surface. It's when the captain of the boat La Poloma Capt. Jacobi. John Huston,that brought the Fat Man and his gang to the states from Hong Kong is badly wounded in an assassination attempt after his boat was mysteriously set on fire in San Francisco Harbor. Jacobi escaping with both his life and the black bird makes it to Spades place with it just before he collapses and passes away. Spade putting the bird away with his trusted secretary Effie, Lee Patrick, now has all the marbles that the Fat Man is looking for. He then decides to play hard ball with him knowing full well that he has implicated himself in three murders, his partner Archer Thursby &amp; Capt Jocobi, in doing so.Big and long winded final at Spades apartment with Sam Spade and the Fat Man and his boys and girl, Brigid, trying to figure just whom to set up as the pasty for the three murderers in the Maltese Falcon affair. It's then decided that the wimpy and tough-talking "Two Gun" Cook is the lucky guy to pin it on. The big surprise comes later when Effie brings the bird back to her boss Sam Spade and the Fat Man as it in fact turns out to be a fake. The big surprise causes Fat Man Gutman to completely loses it, mumbling unintelligently to himself, as he and both Cairo &amp; Cook check out of the apartment empty handed as they plan to check out of the country as well. It seems that the person whom the Fat Man bought the bird from, a former czarist general named Kemidov, tricked him back in Hong Kong by slipping the Fat Man a phony lead, not golden, bird and then taking off with the real one :The Maltese Falcon! Spade calls the cops who quickly apprehend Fat Man Gutman and his gang. It's then that he confronts Brigid who, unlike the Fat Man and his boys, foolishly stayed behind thus exposing herself as the real mastermind behind this whole squalid affair as well as being the one who blasted away Sapde's partner Archer. Grabbed by the police who raid the apartment a mind-numbed and almost comatose Brigid is lead away to the police station by the officers in the building elevator with Spade instead taking the stairs. It seems that Sam Spade had very deep guilt feelings about his dead partner Miles Archer and the way he betrayed him by having an affair with his old lady Iva behind his back. Feeling in some way that he's as responsible for Archer's murder as much as Brigid was is what I feel lead to Spade's decision in taking the stairs and not the elevator down to the building lobby together with Brigid and the police. This conscious, or subconscious, decision on Spade's part will very well get him in his guilty mind to the same place, the hot spot where the sun don't shine, that Brigid is ultimately headed for but it, in Sam Spades case, would take just a little bit longer for him to get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My pick for #1 American film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why? (1) Within the constraints of the Production Code of 1934, it is the most faithful literary adaptation produced in Golden Age Hollywood. (For those of you who prefer the 1931 Warner's version because it includes the sexual and gay material, REMEMBER that Huston could not OVERTLY include this in 1941, because of the PCA. The Code forced artists to become MORE creative, not less.) (2) It was the great John Huston's first film as a director; and it's arguably his best (and that's saying a lot). (3) It was then unheard of for a major Hollywood studio let the same man write AND direct the same film, and take credit for it on-screen. Prior to Huston, independents like Charles Chaplin were the only filmmakers who regularly did this. (4) Much to Jack Warner's horror, Huston shot the film IN SEQUENCE, so the actors could actually build their parts, like stage actors. (5) Acting in sequence, Bogart becomes more intense--in his superbly controlled fashion--up until the final moment. The last scene, when he delivers his big speech to Mary Astor, is the best screen acting you'll ever see, and it crackles with enough electricity to light San Francisco itself. (6) The entire cast is perfect: from the leads, to Sydney Greenstreet in his film debut, down to Ward Bond, playing Tom Polhaus EXACTLY as written by Dashiell Hammett. (Prefer the 1931 version? Ricardo Cortez was a good supporting and B-actor, but a real one-noter. Come on, folks. He wasn't fit to shine Bogie's shoes.)

ROBINSON, JAMES CAGNEY and HUMPHREY BOGART. --Scott Allen Nollen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best screen adaptation of the best novel written by one of, if not the, greatest mystery writer in America. Dashiell Hammett, along with writers like James M. Cain and Raymond Chandler, dragged mystery novels from the 19th Century English drawing rooms of Agatha Christie to the dirty back streets and alleys of urban America and replaced the genteel amateur sleuths of Christie and Conan Doyle with tough working Joes who were equally at home using their brains and their fists. Humphrey Bogart plays Sam Spade, a Frisco gumshoe whose tough-guy patter and attitude mask a keen mind adept at unraveling the densest of mysteries and brother has he got a case here. It starts with the cold-blooded murder of his partner and continues from there, dragging in a cast of characters who're all after the fabled Maltese Falcon and are perfectly willing to double-cross each other to get their hands on it. With a cast consisting of Sidney Greenstreet, Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook Jr, director Huston married great acting with great dialogue and produced the archetype of all detective movies, fast-paced, violent and sexy. But after all that gushing, I do have to say that Warner Brothers should be ashamed of releasing one of their universally-acknowledged classics in such a horribly decayed print. It's got hairlines, splices, bad grain, and what looks like a gigantic magic marker scribble during one scene. This will have to do until Criterion gets their hands on it.</fullReview>

About very cliche in the Detective/PI/Noir film is in 'Falcon', but this was where it either started or was perfected. I enjoyed watching the interplay amongst the characters-all such archetypes now-Lorre, Greenstreet, Astor, Bogie, Cook, etc. Sometimes the dialogue was so fast you needed to rewind to catch it, and sometimes the switchbacks in the characters' alliances, IDs and so forth gets confusing. But who cares? They explain everything by the finale, and yes it does make sense. (I enjoyed seeing guys like William Hopper, Murray Alper and the Stenographer in bit parts too-always good to find character actors of the era in classics like Falcon)I also enjoyed Lee Patrick's perf. as the secretary, quite the tough 'Oomph gal' indeed.SPOILERYou could also see Astor's role in the shooting of Archer a mile away, that old cliche about 'the victim only getting nailed by someone they trust' holds true here as well.**** of course.

		<fullReview>I wish film were so pure these days. This is a simple (on the surface) murder case which when looked at, has multiple layers of deceit and deception. The "bird" itself carries a curse, but where is the bird--is there really a bird? Those who hunt for it form a tenuous bond, devoting their very existences to the search. Bogart stumbles into the case, the lonely, baggage carrying private eye--intrepid to the bitter end. A man not to be bought. Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, multidimensional bad guys--Mary Astor--cool--confident--certain her charms will out. Everyone knows what happens. Comic relief comes in the form of Elisha Cook, the gunsel, overconfident and violent, and in way over his head. This is no longer a movie to me. It's a series of memorable lines, facial expressions and reactions, tension, and tears. Is Sam Spade the friend of the police or an adversary? Do they resent his skills or just him. Does he have a shady past? Miles, his partner, is a fool to Spade, but he is his partner and that is enough. He must play this straight so he can sleep at night. The whole thing is pure atmosphere. Shades of gray. The film noir. Quick feints and moves of a fighter. This is one of those pieces of film heritage which will never grow old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must confess that I'm not a huge Humphrey Bogart fan before or after I saw this film but I enjoyed "The Maltese Falcon" because it was a great mystery film. I also enjoyed it because it was a classic film.Now that I have seen it, I must say it has lived up to my expectations that it being a wonderful film. I enjoyed the film for what it was and will definately watch the film again given the right opportunity but Bogart was unimpressive at winning me over as a favorite.Bogart was not quite the actor I thought he was. Even though I wasn't a huge Bogart fan, I hoped this film can convince me otherwise, but i was wrong.The other cast members like Mary Astor, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet stole the show for me. I cared about them more than I did about Bogart.I give "The Maltese Falcon" a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The entire movie revolves around the complexity of Sam Spade. He is cynical, but extremely intelligent. He demonstrates nerves of steel. Our efforts to figure out whether he is a "good guy" or a "bad guy" cause us to watch the movie again and again carefully. He thinks his partner is a fool, but is driven to find his killer, adhering to a code of conduct. He knows when to sever dangerous relationships. His excellent rapport with Sgt. Polhaus leaves one to wonder who's side he's on. The setting in his office when Cairo visits is excellent. The fact that this is Huston's directorial debut and Greenstreet's acting debut is amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I can tell you a thousand tales of the men and women who have hunted this evil bird."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Casablanca" may have the most quoted lines in film history, but "The Maltese Falcon", pound for pound, or I should say scene for scene, has the snappiest banter and greatest one liners of any film I've ever viewed. Most of them come from private detective Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart), and the tighter the fix, the more clever they are. My personal favorite is "How'd I kill him, I forget?", when Polhaus and Dundy (Ward Bond and Barton MacLane) interrogate Spade about the death of his partner. In fact, if you're not paying attention, a lot will sail completely over your head, so it's best to watch the film distraction free and with a scorecard to keep track of the players.The cast is a colorful lot, populated by both good guys and bad guys (and gals). Mary Astor turns up early, and with more than one identity before Spade pins her down as one Brigid O'Shaughnessy. She's on the trail of a fortune disguised as a pawn shop rarity, a black enameled bird rumored to be the fabled Maltese Falcon. Hot on her heels are Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet), in league with a sinister Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), and a hot headed gunsel named Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.). Each is a dangerous character, but Spade sizes them up appropriately. Of Wilmer - "The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter." Have you ever heard a better description of a crook too big for his britches? Understated though her role may be, Spade's assistant and gal Friday is a sheer delight; Effie Perrine (Lee Patrick) appears to have been around the block a few times, and could be a worthy gumshoe herself. Note how she describes Iva Archer's belongings on the night her husband died, with an eye for detail and a sense of mystery. Sam knows he has an able assistant there, makes you wonder why he hasn't made a move on her himself, though he'd already compromised himself with his partner's wife.That's why it comes as somewhat of a surprise at film's end when Bogie's character comes through it all lily white, willing to throw Brigid over in the name of fair play and standing up for one's murdered partner - "Don't be too sure I'm as crooked as I'm supposed to be". He'd already served up all the suspects to Polhaus in as neat a bundle as the real one, the black statuette, which turns out to have been a stand in for the real thing. It's still out there somewhere, casting it's lure for another gang like Gutman and company. Wondering aloud what the "dingus" sitting on Spade's table is, his reply to the detectives sums up what the film's three murders can only hint at - "The, uh, stuff that dreams are made of".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's very good but Bogart did several better films AND it was nearly a duplicate of the 1931 version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked THE MALTESE FALCON and think it's a very good example of Warner Brothers Film Noir. However, for me, I can't see why this is among the very highest rated Bogart films on IMDb. Of course CASABLANCA is rated highest (this is no surprise), but I actually preferred a few of Bogart's less famous films over THE MALTESE FALCON (such as THE CAINE MUTINY). Instead of discussing all that has already been stated in many other reviews, I'll explain the one failing I noticed in this otherwise exceptional film. Despite the film being Noir, it had a surprisingly small amount of action and towards the end, it is way too talky as they explained the plot--sort of like they were filling in the missing pieces--most of which seemed like guesswork on Sam Spade's part. I really think the script could have been tightened up in this regard. Still, with exceptional supporting actors, a great cynical performance by Bogie AND the best last ten minutes you'll find in almost any film, it still is an exceptional film--well worth seeing.Also, I recently saw the 1931 MALTESE FALCON starring Ricardo Cortez. While Cortez was not as exciting in the lead as Bogart, the film was in many places word-for-word the same film. Dudley Diggs' version of the Fat Man was also essentially copied by Sidney Greenstreet a decade later.By the way, I have never seen an explanation for this, but I noticed one odd thing about the film. When Sidney Greenstreet is slashing at the statue and yelling, the voice does not appear to be his but was dubbed by another actor. I've seen the film several times and last time I even reviewed this scene and it just doesn't sound like him (actually, it sounds a little like Claude Rains). I assume it was inserted sloppily later but am surprised others didn't point this out as well. If you can help explain this, drop me a line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Top notch acting from Bogart, Lorre and Greenstreet propel the film forward through a mazy script that only makes sense if you pay attention to the onrush of exposition in the last 20 minutes. Houston directs well and the pace never lets up; a new location means a bad guy hiding behind a door, or a someone with a fatal bullet wound stumbling in the entrance behind you. Bogart gets to say all the best lines (though Greenstreet is given some awful stuff to spout at times, far too much of that "I like a man who..."). Mary Astor is a letdown as the femme fatal - very wooden, and completely lacking in smoulder. The continuity, even for 1941, is neglected badly - eyelines and postures are often out-of-kilter on the match cut. The Maltese Falcon is certainly worth watching, but it is not the classic many make it out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this as a teen about 20 years ago, I was really surprised and disappointed by the ending. I never thought much of it after. I expected that objects appearing in, and talked about in movies to carry it's meaning. But with a couple decades educated in real-world cynicism, sexual politics, and movies themselves I appreciate it more. Also knowing that the storyline is a all just a ruse, frees a viewer up to enjoy the trip. If you're confused, forget the bird, everyone is working to get their claws on a totem that signifies loot. 'Murder my Sweet' is more convoluted than this.Watching Mary Astor transform from a phony modest lady to someone who kicks Peter Lorie and loses her shoe (over just 40 minutes), is pretty funny. Spade's quick mind that can transform actual scenario A into phony scenario B is fun to watch. Bogart calling Astor out is great stuff. He has some hysterical lines notable for their harsh cynicism. Bogart is an amoral guy with crummy values, predating the anti-hero but in the end he decides on a moral but painful selling out of Astor. It's pretty startling.Greenstreet has a habit of repeating phrases and sentences to an annoying degree ("My, but you are a character!" - 7x, "...as if you were my own son." - 2x)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first and greatest of John Huston setting forth the film noir we know and love...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Spade(Humphry Bogart) is a private investigator who gets caught up with others who are obsessed with "the Maltese falcon" after his partner is killed after taking a case. The cast also includes Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet.As said in my summary, this is the first film directed by John Huston and is considered by many to be the first sign of the film-noir era. It was said that Humphry Bogart was not their first choice as Sam Spade but I can't see anyone else playing the role like he did. Once again, just as in Casablanca, Bogart's acting supplemented for the rest of the cast's acting. Although we do see good performances from Greenstreet and Lorre(Who also starred in Casablanca with Bogart), Mary Astor gave a poor performance as Brigid O'Shaughnessy, which hurt the chemistry between Bogart and her. What people tend to forget about this movie is that it was made in 1941 and I found it very good for the types of movies that came out during that time period, but the movie is slightly overrated when compared to others from then on to the fifties. Overall, the movie was a stellar movie with a few flaws but yet still very entertaining.I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Maltese Falcon is made out of PEOPLE ... PEOPLE ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a caper of sorts, a classic "who-done-it" which forces the audience to listen for clues and make their own judgment upon a vast array of cinematic icons. There is the first time introduction to the cultish detective Sam Spade, an early view of Chiklis' Vic Makey from "The Shield". There is the dame, Brigid O'Shaughnessy, who is the quintessential wild-card of the group, holding nothing but betting all, she sparks where there should be a flame. Peter Lorre's classic Joel Cairo leaves plenty for parody for the next several decades, while Sidney Greenstreet plays the cliché British crime lord willing to believe he is the smartest in the bunch. So we have a beginning ? Huston inventing a formula that will be copies, used, abused, and overplayed throughout Hollywood for the rest of days ? so ? why doesn't this original feel original? With our players in place, Hammett's voice spoken with ease, and Huston behind the wheel ? this should have felt like a country drive with tension building at the right parts, the take arriving sooner than expected, and Spade proving himself the victor unconditionally. Yet, this wasn't the track "The Maltese Falcon" took. Instead, we begin with a jumbled jigsaw puzzle of facts, relics, and the unknown that makes you feel that you have 5000 pieces and only an hour to complete. Huston begins our story with grace, giving us early indication of our characters and brute honesty that seemed unexplored for the time, but just as we believe we understand the overall plot, he throws in more, on top of more, on top of more to thicken the plot, when in fact he is fully pulling us away from the illustrious "Falcon". This movie is about a bird. It is a rare statuette that promises wealth and power to whoever holds it. It is this bird that scatters our characters all over the place, but ultimately takes them nowhere. Without giving any overbearing plot points away, Spade early on looses his partner uncaringly. Spade, a womanizer with his partner's wife, seems to care less about the death and is literally scraping his name away from the window the next day. I understood Spade to be a loner, a troubled detective whose brains foiled his heart, but this seemed a bit too cold for a character that we were to care about. Huston gives us nothing with Spade ? any history that is begun is immediately dropped as a new plot devise is introduced. Bogart lisps his way through the performance, proving that he is just as cold as the criminals, but never quite connects with the audience. Huston will not give us the bird, so instead he detracts our focus away from the statue to Spade, which again, doesn't have enough to build on.My point is that our characters give us nothing. They may be enjoyable to view on screen, but they are as bland and thin as the paper I write this on. Over the years, they have been unjustly transformed into iconic characters, but I needed to know more about Spade ? what made him tick and a bit more detail on his slight idiosyncrasies. While I may have enjoyed watching Lorre's portrayal of Cairo, his usefulness became obsolete by the end. These characters were there, but why? This is a question the inexperienced Huston forgot to include, but Hammett does in detail throughout his book. This is a talking caper, one that doesn't use fancy car chases or large shoot-outs to make their connections, but instead it uses words to guide our characters from A to B. With this said, the words were in place to tell a great story ? but Huston could not get his characters to give varied emotions to give us characters. How could "The Thin Man" successfully do this, and entertainingly make me laugh, while as the time moved I cared less and less about this falcon that was supposed to carry this film? Huston just seemed to be missing a big element that should have connected our characters to this bird ? we needed something to keep our motives in motion.Finally, without giving anything dynamic away, the ending was pitiful and unexciting. Finally, we have exactly what we need, the chess pieces are ready to be victorious, but then nothing happens. Huston builds tension, but provides no conclusion. Instead of being an "Indiana Jones" our heroines become sputterer's of life lessons. One doesn't need a lesson, we need a conclusion. The final image of the bird in the light sent shivers down my spine because of the time devoted to this slap-happy mystery. There was no mystery, only a warning about greed.Overall, I must credit this film for being an original. Sam Spade's likeness has been used in nearly every detective film both symbolically and overtly. But, just because an icon rests here ? it doesn't mean that the film itself is worthy of praise. Hammett's words were not voiced properly in this film, and the dedication towards nothing was outstanding. This was a film about a statue of a bird, but instead we spend more time talking about it than actually finding the bird. Our characters are paper thin, and by the end we care nothing for whomever ends up with it ? either good or bad. It was as if Huston had taken all the pieces of a puzzle, bunched them together, randomly hammered them together, and then provided us with a sloppy finished product. I wanted to like this film ? it is a dark classic that is honestly overplayed ? but I cared nothing for what was happening. Thirty minutes in I was bored. What would Spade think of that? The verbose ending ruined my image of Spade ? how about you? Grade: *** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film noir, this movie encompasses everything about the movement. The overly masculine outlaw hero, a convoluted plot and of course a femme fatale. Despite not having much patience for older films, the black and white nature and slow camera movements didn't bother me that much but the major bad thing i found was that Bogart has the most unrealistic voice and line deliverance imaginable. But i suppose that's because he was in so many silent films he had no idea how to actually talk until the 40s. The plot is quite engaging despite spade's (bogart's) incredibly annoying partner in crime (or detective work) but at least he's killed off early on. The characters are pretty stock to be honest especially Gutman or Cairo, and you might as well have had a sign pointed towards them saying 'bad guys'.All in all, worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I was prepped by countless 4/4 or 10/10 reviews to see a masterpiece. What I saw was basically meh. Not much action, not much mystery, not much motivation, not much plot. I mean, the story is so straightforward, if you can't figure out who did what by the time you've met three main characters (there are only five), then you are probably living in the 1940's and have never seen a detective movie.The love story was scotch-taped on, and completely unconvincing: "I just met you" "I am interested by you" "You are the love of my life". Sorry, doesn't work, doesn't really even make sense. And the ending? Pathetic, lengthy, and pointless, as process of elimination (again, there are only five characters, and when the police question Spade about the murder, the obvious red herring immediately narrows the field even further) makes the whodunit part not only predictable, but inevitable.The whole movie boils down to people relating tales of what they have done, but not actually doing anything. It's not much more complex than if the characters were to be filmed reading the original novel word for word. Sorry, I love the genre, I love Bogart, but this one was so simplistic as to verge on childish, and I have no idea what everyone was watching who praise this movie so highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessential Well Written Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:See back here movies were based on these things called books. They had really small print without big pictures of people wearing capes. One of the first things about this classic is the level of the writing and the dialog. It has more twists and turns than a freeway off ramp but they are all believable. The first showing I dare anyone to tell me they knew what a giant murderess Astor was. The part was so well written we actually feel sorry for her right up to the moment it is revealed she killed Miles. How she lured him with her body and then blasted him. Greenstreet is his usual suave, well acted villain; you never know whether it is safe to accept that drink from him. Like Across The Pacific, I wouldn't take a drink from that Bogie: we all yell at the screen. I love Lorre's line,"That's the second time you put your hands on me and I don't like it any better this time." Lorre just oozes corruption and sleazes his way through the movie. I consider it the best written movie from the 40s. This is the movie Network wanted to be. See, there is a difference between well written, cerebral twists and over literary bookish contrived nonsense. This never becomes too clever for its own good. Network got lost in its own literary world never to return. This movie starts well and moves with a purpose. Lorre steals the movie; with a nod to the very young Noir actor Elisha Cook as poor Wilmer. Bogie beats on him and he ends up being the designated patsy. The ensemble Huston put together coupled with the writing is what made this the eternal classic it is. When you make it to the very end of a movie, and nobody in a big room knows who did what to whom: that is good writing. I always love when people insult this movie by comparing it to Chinatown. Please, that is just being ambiguous and withholding information from the audience to give the illusion of great writing. The Maltese Falcon has a straightforward script that you can follow it is not deliberately vague or hides key info you needed to figure things all out. If you want to see the best detective movie of the entire decade of the 1940s, featuring the best cast ever assembled, this is your movie. Huston gets a much better reading out of Astor than in Across The Pacific where she has some very shaky scenes. Lorre really came into his own with this movie. I cannot recommend it highly enough. A Great Gem From The Literary Generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless film-noir?The Maltese Falcon is a prototype of perfect cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Small Spoilers included) Making his debut at the age of 35 with an absolute milestone, John Huston's career began pretty spectacular. The novel already was adapted once in 1931, but Huston's version catapulted that one straight into oblivion. Believe it?this film is as close to perfection as one can get. An unfriendly attack towards human greed, filled with intrigues, unfaithful characters and constant sarcasm. Humphrey Bogart is uniquely cast as the dry private detective who gets caught in a web of money, betrayal, theft and even murder. Pivot object in the whole story is a very valuable statue of a black bird. Several parties are after this treasure and they're all prepared to go very far for it. Bogart is the only man you can imagine playing Sam Spade? He gives an almost natural arrogance to his character and his consciousness isn't exactly ?clean' either? He seems to have no emotions (when his partner gets shot?or when he has to make a choice between his love and his credibility as a detective) and he isn't exactly sensible with women, neither (`When you're slapped?you'll take and like it'). The Maltese Falcon breathes an atmosphere that is purely film-noir and the screenplay ? by John Huston himself ? is extremely compelling and it requires a certain level of intelligence. The dry humor is terrifically oppressed and you have the idea you never really get to know any of the characters, which is great! Besides Bogart, the Maltese Falcon can also count on the solid performances by Peter Lorre (with the most creative haircut in his entire career) and Sydney Greenstreet, who also made his debut in this film. All three appeared on the screen together again a year after this, in the equally brilliant `Casablanca'. The wonderfully beautiful Mary Astor plays Bogart's love interest Brigid O'Shaughnessy and completes the perfect cast. If you want to become a cinema expert, you can't afford to miss this one. Essential viewing for anyone who ever showed the least bit of interest in cinema.</fullReview>

For a film to be called a classic, it should still be relevant to audiences today? I really wonder if the people who rate it so highly have actually sat down and endured the whole painful experience.

God help those who deceive themselves into thinking a movie is good because it was made before they were born. The movie involves a detective who goes around insulting women (and yet getting their attention) and hitting people twice his size. One'd think the writer must have been suffering from a massive inferiority complex. The plot is terrible and many events may insult the intelligence of a six year old (eg. the way the hero "outwits" the cops when they visit his place when he has that meeting with the female and that french guy). And I should confess.. I fell asleep around halfway and never did get to watch the remaining part. Nor do I ever want to watch it, considering what a ho-hum of a movie this is! 1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BORING, HORRIBLE, AND Extremely Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright this is a pretty old movie and I thought what the heck it got good reviews on IMDb so it must be good. WRONG. This movie is absolutely pathetic no story line random killings and it all comes together with an unexplained ending that only if your mental you would get. I practically fell asleep and I was going to turn it off but I thought it must get better it must well you know what? It does not. So do not waste your time watching this horrible overrated failure of a movie. Humprey Bougart must have been high and all of you when you voted this on the top 250. And I don't know why they call it the Maltese falcon because it has nothing to do with a bird</fullReview>
