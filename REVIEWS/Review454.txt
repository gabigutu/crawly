		<shortDescription>nothing prepares me for this masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read a review about this movie and am aware what business it made in Korea, but nothing (I mean NOTHING) prepares me for this great work. With the exception of, perhaps, SE7EN, serial-killer movie has never been this good. The story (about real-life killings of 10 women in Korea during the 1986-1991) is compelling enough, but the actors (Song Kang-ho cuts you deep even when he's silent, and his big-city partner offers emotional jolts at the end), the director (effectively plays some scenes in docu-style approach), the cinematography (a shadow creeps out in the paddy field will give you, well, creeps. big one.), and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses.One scene that impresses me most is the crime-scene midnight chase between a suspect, 2 local detectives, and a big-city detective (who doesn't know his local partners are there watching him). Humorously intense, or intensely humorous, whichever serves you well.The only regret is I saw this one on DVD, while I believe a movie this big (in many senses) deserves to be seen in theaters. Korean movies rarely touch Indonesian theaters.**** out of ****Try to listen the song SAD LETTER in this movie and tell me it's not haunting you. A magnum opus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a good movie.What a great work of casting. Perhaps a little bit long, but the most part the movie is enjoyable and there's no perfection without mistakes. I think i haven't ever seen before a Korean movie and if there are much of them like this one i shall become Korean movie fan. The tempo, the thrill, the development of characters, everything it has been well worked.The direction is good yet without emphatic resources, there are just two moments with a little much use of slow motion but it doesn't arrive to be an abuse of it.If you can see it don't loose your time with Hollywood sad-bad thrillers bet for this Korean present.9/10 cause perfection doesn't exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best crime/detective film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My "one line summary" might be too subjective (well it's just an opinion after all), but that's what kind of thought came to my mind after seeing this film. It just sucked me in and didn't let away until the ending credits appeared. I'm really not a fan of this genre which is popular in various "detective" TV series but this film was something exceptional. A perfectly made detective film based on a real shocking murder case in S.Korea in 80's. This is a must see Korean film for everybody and this must be a real pearl for those who love detective stories because perhaps it's the best detective film ever...I give it a 10/10 this film is worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great serial killer drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of those people who tend to think that South Korean movies are perhaps a bit too slow-paced for my taste. Memories of Murder isn't a fast-paced film, by any means, but this time the slow pace made this movie about an investigation of serial killings so much better than 95% of its American counterparts.Essentially, Memories of Murder is a drama first with thriller and comedy elements (yes, in the first hour or so the movie is actually quite funny). Kang-ho Song and Sang-kyung Kim are brilliant as the two cops who have drastically different views on how to solve a crime. The character development is fascinating and believable thanks to a great script.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Slow Development of a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the best crime thriller I've seen since "Insomnia," and contains the most haunting climax of any serial killer flick since "Seven." But like most films reaching for greatness, this is most admirable for its striking details.The filmmakers here craft a taut, careful, and delicately strung together motion picture that relishes in its amazing development of mood, place, and character.First, the mood: Haunting cinematography (rain falling on a small village at night, shadows darting across a thick field of grass, figures lurking in the woods, a masterfully choreographed hot pursuit scene on foot), a poignant music score (aided by the creepy use of a Korean pop song that accompanies each murder), and no-nonsense direction (peppered with fabulous doses of comic relief--how Shakespearan!) keep the film more and more intriguing at each turn and fascinating to watch.Second, the place: South Korea, circa the late 1980's, and apparently under some sort of militia rule. This is inspired by the true story of Korea's first publicized (and still unsolved) serial killer case. This unique time and place serves as a wonderful respite from the typical American big-city setting of so many other films of this ilk.Finally, the character development: The small details revealing the haunted souls of the detectives on the case is nothing short of brilliant. Witness the tiny executions of minutae: The cloth one rogue cop wraps around his boot so as not to leave scars when he kick-boxes suspects into submission, the harried chief of police checking his own blood pressure while trying to keep his off-the-cuff detectives in line or fighting to keep headline-starved reporters at bay, the young female officer desperately trying to showcase her abilities in crime solving between serving the chauvinistic detectives cups of fresh coffee, the outsider detective from Seoul's insistence that documents never lie (and the brutal irony at the climax that challenges his entire sense of being), and the main village detective's scathing speech on the difference between American FBI agents and Koren policemen. The beauty is in the details, and this film, like all the great ones, revels in their uncovering.One flaw is that some might find the film a bit long in the tooth, but this is not to be missed for fans of serial killer thrillers and police procedural movies. For the Korean filmmakers, and the amazing cast...this is their master stroke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece that you cannot miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beginning in the fall of 1986 and continuing for the next four years South Korea was haunted by the nation's first recorded serial killer. Preying upon women in a remote rural community the killer was both vicious and meticulous, strangling his victims with their own undergarments and leaving nothing of any use to the police investigating the crimes. The killer was never caught.I do not envy any director trying to make a true crime film, particularly not one so high profile and so recent that the crimes still live on in the public consciousness. Stray too far in one direction and you devolve into saccharine sentimentality, go the other direction and you risk crass exploitation. Director Bong Joon-Ho avoided both of these traps by charting an altogether different route: he has made a film that is not about the killer or the crimes or the victims but one that is purely about the police officers charged with the case and the devastating emotional toll it took on their lives. In charting his unusual route Bong has created a bleak masterpiece, one that took home a stack of film awards in its native land but which has been largely neglected on these shores until now.The film begins with the first body discovered, a woman strangled with her own stockings, raped, tightly bound, and hidden in a drainage culvert. The detective in charge of the case is Park Du-Man (Song Kang-Ho) and it is immediately clear that he is out of his depth, that the entire local police force, in fact, are out of their depth. The crime scene is chaos, crowded by reporters and locals trampling over potentially vital evidence. Park himself is not what you'd call a systematic investigator, scoffing at the scientific approach and trusting in his supposedly unerring eye at picking out criminals just by looking at them. He relies on swagger and bravado and the brute force of his uneducated assisting officer Jo Yong-Gu.Serving as a foil to Park and Jo is Seo Tae-Yun (Kim Sang-Kyung) a detective from Seoul who has volunteered to assist with the investigation. Seo is the polar opposite of Park - methodical and rational - and it takes mere moments for the two to clash, clashes that lead to the two of them overlooking some key pieces of evidence.As the film progresses and the body count continues to rise you can feel a sense of desperation slowly settle over the department. Under educated, under manned and woefully under equipped the local force is simply not up to the task. As the realisation that they will not find the evidence they so badly need begins to set in Park and Jo resort to planting evidence to bring in suspects Park picks out with his 'keen eye', suspects they then set out to extract coached confessions from. The process inevitably leads to public humiliation. Soon even Seo begins to lose his faith in reason and just as things bottom out they finally catch a break and settle on a prime suspect, one who truly appears likely to be their man. But can they make it stick? What sets Memories of Murder apart from the crowd are the rich performances from its leads and the sure hand of Bong Joon-Ho. Bong knows exactly what he wants to do with this film and he steers the ship with a firm hand. He has a keen eye for imagery but he consistently avoids the cheap resolve, the quick hit, in favour of a slowly building mood and the film is all the stronger because of it. Song and Kim are both stellar in their roles, giving their characters much needed depth. You can feel their frustration and helplessness continually growing and when the final crushing blow is delivered you can feel their utter despair at being abandoned by a system that they have given their lives to. Bong isn't just asking how this could happen, how someone could be as evil as this killer, but how could a government allow this to happen? How could the police not be given the tools and manpower they so obviously needed to protect the people? The DVD release has been given the standard Palm treatment. The transfer is strong and presented in anamorphic widescreen. The film is presented with both the original Korean language track in 2.0 stereo and an English dub in both 2.0 and 5.1. The English subtitles are solid, clearly translated and easy to read. The disc also includes a reel of cast and crew interviews discussing their characters and the creation of the film as well as an extensive reel of deleted scenes.Memories of Murder is a minor masterpiece, a film that moved Bong immediately onto Korea's A-list of directing talent. It is richly detailed, beautifully performed and disturbing in precisely the way that people need to be disturbed in from time to time. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After two women are found dead in a rural community, a detective arrives from the big city to help out. Things quickly mushroom with the discovery of more bodies, more suspects and no end in sight.Whether you like police films or not you should see this movie about the real hunt for Korea's first known serial killer simply because its a great movie. This is a movie that alters your expectations and changes your view of things. Its impossible to guess whats going to happen simply because the twists and turns are so unexpected. At times this is a funny funny movie, especially if you like shows like Law and Order or CSI since what we take for granted in those shows is stood on its head. At other times this is a very taut thriller and you become as desperate as the police in needing to put an end to the madness.On top of all of this is a picture of Korea in 1986, a place with political unrest and civil defense drills that for me at least makes it seem like something out of the 1950's.This is brilliant brilliant film-making.I've given the film an 8 out of 10, even though it probably deserves to be higher, simply because some 12 hours after seeing the film, I'm still pondering what I thought of it, how good is it? At least an 8. I'm sure a second and third and fourth viewings will change my mind.Yea its that good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have long since heard of the excellence of this korean movie on koreanfilm.org, but it was only after reading the review in detail and realizing that the score was written by Taro Ishiwaro ( a well known Japanese musician who also wrote scores for Shohei Imamura and Japanese TV serials, including The Inanimate World ), and that the DOP was Kim Hyung-gu (who also shot Musa, One Fine Spring Day and Chen Kaige's Together) that it stumped on me I was indeed missing a masterpiece.And a masterpiece it is, one deeply haunting and disturbing asian crime thriller. The mood invoked during the last few minutes of the film is something you would probably never forget.Watch this film not only for its cinematic brilliance, but also because of the mezmerising score written by Taro Ishiwaro, track no 29 on the OST the favourite on my list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is based on the true series homicide happened in the country of Korea from 1986 to 1990.Salinui chueok is similar to Seven but focuses more on the back ground of Korea at that time and explains why the police couldn't catch the murder. The murder is very careful and cruel. The cops are dying to catch the murder but the military government uses the police force to cease the protest. The cops, also uses violence to the suspects to get the false confession rather than using a scientificinvestigation.After the film, I felt sympathy for the victims and was furious at the murder who hasn't got caught, yet. This is the director's intention to make the audience look back the sad past of Korea.Excellent directing, acting, cinematography. The best Korea film lately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking in Dangerous Rain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since a synopsis would be redundant here, I'll confine myself to praise alone.Each positive comment that precedes this is accurate. I watched this movie yesterday. I couldn't take my eyes off it. Everything taking place on screen was riveting, from the simple act of walking down a dark lonely road in the rain, to a wild chase by three desperate detectives. This movie held me in thrall.As a new viewer of Asian movies, I try to analyze the reason I tend not to be interested in western works any longer. I finally came to the conclusion that it has to do with the accessibility of the players. They seem to be people first, actors by choice, and stars, by the public making them so.In Memories of Murder, I saw this human factor almost too painfully. By the end of the story, I was in tears. Even now, the mood prevails. It's been so long since these crimes took place, and I don't know absolutely that they remain unsolved, but I think it's the case, and I think about that, and how frustrating it still must be to those who worked on the case.The actors have become the people in my mind, and the horrible sense of defeat that becomes palpable eventually, is heartbreaking. When one relates to the inroads made on the health; mental and physical; of the detectives, who are ultimately portrayed as tireless and completely dedicated to the case, you realize that you've watched something that is historic. You have seen the probable truth.The way this movie draws you into it, so that you are walking through dangerous rain, with a warning shout in your throat, points to the brilliance of the director and the players.It is difficult to say, "I love this movie", just as it is hard to say, I love Silence of the Lambs, because love is a peculiar word to use for such fare.But yes, I love it for the fact that during it, I was in a small village in South Korea in a terrible era of sirens blaring, military dictatorship, and the hopeless pursuit of a serial killer. I landed back here in this time and place with a thud, only after turning off the DVD player, and going to the kitchen for a glass of water. While I was caught there mentally---I felt the desperation, and I felt the defeat and the sorrow of the detectives, who were essentially decent enough human beings when all was said and done.There are not many movies that can time-travel you into their present. This will do it.I most seriously recommend that you view the interviews with the director and the stars (all of them are stars of a special kind in my mind) in order to dispel some of the hold the story will have on you.These are incredibly interesting people, and it's a sheer joy to see them smiling and peaceful. They're intelligent, educated and articulate. The younger members of the cast, the less seasoned, are so beautiful in their desire to do it right.They definitely did it right. They were wonderful, and they thanked the interviewer. How lovely that was to see.I watched the movie using the English subtitles rather than the English dubbing because I wanted the authenticity. The subtitles were very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Memories Of Murder is based on a true story of a south-Korean little village in which someone begins to murder young women. The Police can't catch the killer so an agent comes from Seoul to give a hand in the investigation. Soon he'll find that local police's methods are rather brutal, and that they're most interested on finding a scapegoat, someone to blame in order to ease the in tranquility of the population, than on catching the real killer (according to the real facts, they never catched the author of those crimes).The script is solid as a rock, and it's been filmed in a realistic style. trying to show the facts as they happened. Maybe they should've made a shorter movie, and cut some sequences out (the scenes of the interrogations to the three different suspects are a little bit reiterative), and the ending seems a little forced to me. Anyway, Memories Of Murder is much more effective and serious than the most of nowadays' Hollywood detective films.My rate: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gritty Murder Mystery with Political and Social Overtones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Memories of Murder (Salinui chueok)" is an involving, cross-cultural take on the "L.A. Confidential" noir genre of a murder mystery with a political filter, layered with elements that gritty British TV detectives have mastered, from "Prime Suspect" on.While co-writer/director Joon-ho Bong uses the conventions of the contrasting buddy cop movie, sometimes simplistically for comic effect, he has more social commentary on his mind than a captivating investigation into a serial killer and avoids the usual titillating gore fest.Set specifically in 1986, the film visually captures the changes in industrializing, modernizing and politically restive South Korea, where new, dark, noisy factories were sprouting up in the middle of agricultural areas. From the opening shot that could be out of "Witness," we see a peasant bring what looks like a city sophisticated cop to a crime scene.But that's just the start of the conflicting comparisons. We've seen enough "CSI"s to sympathize with him immediately as he hopelessly tries to secure the crime scene for clues despite a Keystone Cops-incompetent forensics and investigative team who keep sliding into the irrigation ditch. But he starts to seem a bit of a buffoon to us as he gives more credence to gossipy tips from his girlfriend than clues from the scene and he manufactures "evidence." Our sympathies are curdled even more as we see him conduct an old-fashioned coercive interrogation of a developmentally disabled suspect -- and he's the good cop. Even without knowing anything about Korean law, it certainly looks like they are compromising the investigation, as his thug partner, who is nowhere as complex as Russell Crowe's Bud White, gets as out of control as a cartoonish "Lethal Weapon" cop, and that cop never grows and develops in the story beyond being a brutality enforcer so becomes a pathetic comic figure. Their complicit boss just seems ineffectual as he's clearly over his head with this kind of murder investigation.But through the background TV broadcasts of demonstrations and civil defense alerts and drills, we gather that their interrogation procedures were more developed through oppressing political dissidents and forcing confessions than professional criminal detective work. Ironically, they ultimately can't get the resources they need in this difficult case because of these politically-drummed up time-consumers, especially for manpower and sophisticated forensic tools that they have to beg from the FBI.The film changes tone and settles down into an intellectual thriller as a classic big city detective is sent from Seoul, and we have some of the interchanges we've seen in "In the Heat of the Night" and in "Insomnia," as the first cop now seems even more of a simpleton in his standard operating procedures of relying on his knowledge of the locals and instincts about human nature (though even a fellow officer teases him about whether he can tell apart a rapist and victim's brother), while the city guy is looking and listening for clues and real evidence, like a Korean "Dalziel and Pascoe." But the tension is ramped up as the killer keeps killing ? and the film starts showing us the murders as they are about to happen just as the cops are getting hints about his modus operandi and even after the police are on alert. Their frustration at not being able to stop him is grippingly conveyed by the lead actors, as each starts to abandon their usual procedures out of mounting frustration, and by the editing.A droll side bar is that the macho team is given a key clue by a policewoman who they otherwise relegate to getting them refreshments. Their macho attitudes also keep them from learning vital clues from the marginalized men they pick up as suspects.The coda in contemporary Korea is effective, reinforcing a sense of societal complicity is letting such murders happen and go on, though I was curious what happened to the city cop as well as the local guy. I had no idea until I read the IMDb message board that this was a based on a real case, so I appreciate even more that a cheap ending wasn't tacked on.The cinematography and editing are terrific throughout, with many of the scenes in the dark and rain. Particularly dramatic are harrowing scenes along railroad tracks and a tunnel that are reminiscent of stark imagery from Mervyn LeRoy's "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang." It is frustrating for English subtitle readers that not more of the Korean on the screen, such as newspaper headlines or heard, such as the TV broadcasts and pop tunes, isn't translated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen a lot of good films this year, I picked this up after watching Thirst and wanting to see more of Song Kang Ho, remembering him being great in the Host. However, I was blown away by the fact that I never found this film earlier and while Song is excellent in it, the film and nearly everything about it is flawless in execution. The story about a detective in a small countryside town who finds a serial killer yet it's the incompetencies of the police force in general and human error which leads more and more murders. As the murders continue they find themselves powerless to use whatever clues they have to find the murderer. I'll leave it at that in terms of plot as it the film beautifully pulls you in until it's frustratingly simple conclusion. The cinematography is outstanding with a haunting score worthy of the film's amazing direction. I simply cannot find the words to describe how great this film is. I rarely watch films twice and never watched a film again without getting bored. On repeated viewings, you begin to appreciate the little scenes the director has put in and i didn't pick up one of the running gags until the third time though, they add little to the plot but are enjoyable and fascinating as the director chooses to move at his own pace. While not perfect, the quality of the film brings the smallest niggles to light and while there are only a few, this film does not get the recognition it deserves in the west, yet at the same time, it's like a little secret that is appreciated by those who are lucky enough to find it. As with any murder and mystery, you'll be looking for clues, even on multiple viewings but at best you'll be grasping at straws and jumping to conclusions until the frustratingly simple ending</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shaman's Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joon-ho Bong directs "Memories of Murder". A police procedural, the film's first act flows along conventional lines. Here a murder takes place and detective Park Doo-Man is assigned to the case. He's a hotshot cop, hardworking and determined, who thinks he can spot a criminal simply by "looking into their eyes". Joon-ho Bong, however, repeatedly questions Park's abilities. Early in the film, for example, Park's commander points at two men at the far side of a room and asks Park to pick out the criminal. Park looks deeply into each man's eyes, but before he gives his answer, the director cuts to black. We assume that Park has picked the right guy.But 20 minutes into the film, and our faith in Park begins to crumble. Indeed, he begins to come across as a bit of an idiot. He's deeply superstitious, relies on fortune tellers, believes in hunches, and is highly insecure.At this point the film introduces another detective. His name is Sae Yoon, and he's been assigned to help Park on his case. The film's second act is thus a repetition of the first act, Sae Yoon re-enacting all the scenes that we just witnessed Park do. The way Park handles the film's first crime scene is contrasted with how Sae Yoon handles the film's second crime scene. The way Park handles an interrogation is contrasted with how Sae Yoon handles an interrogation. In seeing how a methodical, clever and genuinely skilled detective like Sae Yoon handles his job, the audience is forced to reconsider their views of Park. Maybe Park wasn't a hotshot cop after all. The juxtaposition between the way the two men handle the film's first two murders forces us to re-evaluate our perceptions.This notion of reassessing what our eyes see, is constant throughout the film. A mentally ill kid seems like a likely suspect, but is actually not. A local pervert seems like the killer, but is actually a caring husband. An effeminate loner may be the rapist, but DNA samples prove otherwise. Detective Sae Yoon, himself a "by the books" cop, eventually becomes a violent, loose cannon, determined to throw away rules and regulations based on a hunch, whilst Park, the very cop who consults shamans and witch doctors and stages false confessions, becomes the film's voice of law-abiding righteousness.And so it is the way the film's characters are constantly in a state of moral flux that makes "Memories of Murder" so exciting. The audience is constantly asked to "look the characters in the eyes" and reassess what they're seeing.But what makes the film great is its ending. If surface perceptions are inadequate, then how can we truly understand another human being? If personal emotions get in the way of objective truth, how can we ever trust our own acuity? And so because the criminal is never identified or caught, suddenly everyone is guilty. There can be no closure because everyone, police included, is implicated. Watch how the director contrasts the film's first shot (the innocence of a child's face) with the film's final shot (the retired face of detective Frank staring down the camera and directly at the audience). Frank's catch phrase, "look into my eyes", now takes on a whole new level of meaning. He's a cop again, and everyone including we the audience are now under suspicion. And so while most serial killer films end with closure, or in the case of the recent "Zodiac", with the comfortable knowledge that our killer is now old and largely impotent, "Memories of Murder" leaves us on a note of profound paranoia. We're left uncomfortable, disturbed, and everyone now seems a potential suspect. 8.5/10 ? Though it isn't brave enough to stray far from genre conventions, this is a stylish, engrossing film. Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are only a handful of serial killer films that actually work, and with the Korean-based "Memories of Murder," it's evident that director Joon-ho Bong has done his homework.Successful examples include "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs," a pair of films that expose their audience to grisly and suspenseful sights, but all the while creating vivid characters and memorable stories. Other films like "Fallen" and "The Bone Collector" do not. What makes "Memories" as unforgettable and dynamic as say "M," is that the actors of this film are realistic, the story is believable, and the climax is original. You feel the apprehension of the characters, you struggle to understand the killer's motives, and you grimace at the way his victims are taken. Getting under your skin is what serial killer films are all about, and this is no exception.In South Korea in 1986, a naked woman is found bound and gagged in a drainage ditch in a field, and a pair of detectives and a special agent from Seoul has been assigned to find the murderer/rapist. Their efforts are numerous in trying to track down the killer, not taking anything for granted; they even attempt to find clues through the help of a fortune teller, and by even giving merit to the possibility that the killer may shave his pubic hair. Their crime scenes are routinely disturbed by locales, key pieces of evidence are run over by tractors, their forensic team is always a no-show, and their only help at solving the crime thus far is a handicapped boy, who may or may not be the killer. Yet with the boy in custody, and the murders continuing, a serial killer is indeed on the loose.The film has numerous touches of comedy that arguably helps the film numb down its depressing nature; many of these comedic touches involve one of the detective's constantly jump-kicking witnesses and suspects. The detective so habitually beats any and all suspects that he made a custom "bootie," as to assure that his kicks won't leave any scratches. The way the film handles the humor is quite ingenious though, simultaneously showing the downfall and wrongs of police justice, the fallibility of investigative methods, and how a homicide system works without the prevalence of DNA tests. The musical score is terrific and adds tension to every scene, the camera work is top-notch and South Korea's fields and forests remain a visually scenic and eerily set landscape. The acting is genuine by everyone involved, especially from Kang-ho Song, the lead detective who sees the wrongs of the system but can only stand by and watch. The director does a fantastic job creating the mood, and like all atmospheric thrillers, the film is almost consistently covered with rain-shadow. His uncanny ability to create suspense when nothing is visibly threatening also earns the director much praise, and he makes the viewer see what the killer sees, with expert detail. As the murderer lurks behind trees, hides behind field stocks, and picks his prey, so do you and it works wonderfully. Based on the first recorded serial killer in Korean history, "Memories of Murder" is a film not easily forgotten. With memorable visuals, a haunting score, and quite hilariously brutal police work, the film adds realism to a very mature subject matter and succeeds brilliantly. The film was released in 2004 in limited release, and most video stores do not carry it. You can get it off Netflix or any online store that sells dvds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, moody, eccentric murder movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recent Korean (and other international) films have surpassed Hollywood films in many ways except in the department of special effects. Special effects and big names is the main reason Hollywood still rules. However, for sheer originality and creativity, look away from Los Angeles towards Seoul.This grisly, dark, eccentric film shows why. "Salinui chueok" is a quirky, moody film that starts off not quite serious, almost comic. Well, not surprising, since the two naive, rural cops don't deal with much crime in the countryside in a militia-ruled Korea (set in the mid- 1980s). They find themselves in a case they can't handle: they have to deal with a serial murder that gathers press coverage and scrutiny. As the murders grow, detective Park has to compete with the smarter detective Seo from the big city (Seoul) and he learns solving crimes isn't just about intimidating suspects. The city and rural cops have to cooperate increasingly to try to capture the murderer. But the teaser, as all unsolved murders remains. The witnesses are unable to help, confessions are worthless, and the killer runs free. The film evolves into a serious masterpiece as Park matures throughout the movie from using police brutality to dealing with the press and proper evidence. As the end the film shows a more mature Park with a family maybe moving on...but not quite, he is still haunted by memories of a murder.Acting and cinematography are outstanding. It's a nice cultural peek into a rural Korea with unadorned eateries, schools with outhouses and broken-down police cars. The quirky fascinating characters (the half-crazy detective Cho or the simpleton Kwang-ho) add to the fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two weeks ago I happened to watch David Fincher's "Zodiac", then (thanks to IMDb) I found out about "Salinui chueok". I got the DVD of the movie instantly and saw it the very next day I saw "Zodiac" and the outcome? I have then decided that no other crime/detective movie can be as goo as this South Korean masterpiece. It is power packed Two and half hour movie with equal amounts of action and emotion.Set in the times of mid 80's, the period in which the military rule imposed strict rules on the civilians, a serial killer raped women and killed them. The movie follows the investigation sequences of the village policeman with the help of the police officer from Seoul. The story deepens as it goes ahead, revealing a whole lot of sub plots, each one telling the complexity of team work and human nature. The last scenes of the movie can set your tear glands to work.The last scene of the movie needs a special mention in which Inspector Park comes to the scene of crime after a long time and a girl approaches him and asks him what he is looking for. And she then tell that a man had been there at that place earlier before (suggestively the Murderer). Inspector Park asks the kid how he looked like and the girl replies, "He looked Normal" saying that she goes away and Inspector Park looks at the camera indicating that the killer might be one of the audience watching the movie. This scene by far is the best one I have ever seen on celluloid so far. Kudos to the director Bong Joon Ho for making a crime master piece.Note: Please do not watch this movie if you do not have respect towards cinema made in other languages and also towards other countries culture and also this movie is not for people who always want a villain in the end!. Saying that I conclude saying, one of the best two and a half hours you can ever spend your life is watching this movie!Cheers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is difficult to know how best to describe the merits of this gripping yarn. The story is very well done; funny and horrifying, like life itself. the direction, action, lighting, acting, sound; all superb. The characters are entirely believable and engaging. While the movie deals with adult themes in an adult way, it is not in the least distasteful, even when for instance one hapless suspect is apprehended masturbating at a crime scene. The one sex scene is borderline hilarious and true to life. Funniest sequence of all is when the lead detective is looking in the sauna for the hairless suspect. And when he told the sauna staff to look out for the hairless one "They just smirked at me!" The various interrogation scenes are very well done. The conflict among the detectives is very convincing. The economy of storytelling is such that the viewer cannot afford to miss a single minute, unlike typical Hollywood pap where you could practically go and take a bath or a a shower, come back and you won't have missed a thing. A great, fascinating commentary on Korea at that time also.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This definitely is one of my favorite Korean films. On the surface "Memories of Murder" might appear as a simple cop-genre film. Yet underneath this costume lies an honest depiction of South Korea during the military dictatorship in the 80's. The lead actor Song Kang-ho's performance is outstanding as ever under the direction of Bong Joon Ho (The Host). The style and tone of the film constantly alludes and reminds the audience of the Japanese director Immamura Showei(Unagi, Vengeance is Mine), while the narrative structure seems too plotted according to the film's genre predecessors. For instance serial killer who gets stimulated by color red and rain while good/bad cop buddies come together in an expected fashion. However, I give 9/10 for its subtext rather than the film's outer appearance. Strongly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary and memorable serial-murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A crime-thriller movie has never been this better I think. 'Memories of Murder' offers some elements that some kind of crime movies don't have. First hour of this movie moves quite slowly, many investigations and jokes in it which is enjoyable to see. It shows how real-life detective investigates, makes suspect confess and sometimes cheats the evidence if it's necessary. And last an hour of this movie is so tense and brilliant, especially near ending of it. Bong Joon Ho shows his genius idea by adapted an unsolved true story into a terrifying and memorable film, also combining with some jokes that makes 'Memories of Murder' not boring to watch. What makes it different from other detective movies are some unclear evidence doesn't always lead it to the killer, perhaps it's just an accidental or coincidence. For me, 'Memories of Murder' is one of the best crime movie ever created and the one that could be remembered for a long time.</fullReview>

I do not understand the Korean language, but the subtitles helped me a great deal. But what made understanding the movie easy was the acting and direction, which was fabulous. Especially towards the end of the film the viewer just have the same emotions of the police detectives and understands their emotions as well as the suspect. Normally in Hollywood films, the hero would be the detective. So he might be shown as a very cool as a cucumber sort of guy. But here we can feel their desperation. This is not a fast paced lots of action kind of film, but after watching the entire film, I must say I was touched by it and Mr. Bong Joon-ho, I am a fan of yours.</fullReview>

But then this cop from the big city shows up (the murders are happening way out in the countryside), and we start to see a really interesting interaction among the cops (the city cop, two country cops, and their supervisor).If you like watching police try to solve a tough puzzle -- and people keep on being murdered, so the stakes are high -- this is an excellent film. I was a little surprised at how long it was, but the story kept shifting and I didn't feel bored. In fact, I was a little sorry when it ended.</fullReview>

There's nothing wrong with most of the serial killer thrillers, that follow the rule book, of how to make a movie like that.Back to this Korean thriller, that shows us how cops are dealing with a killer on the loose. The behaviour of the cops (the sort of "good" guys) is strange to say the least. Their methods to interrogate people is at least unorthodox! And that's things you have to keep in mind before you watch the movie.

		<shortDescription>Powerful and haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Memories of Murder is the best film I've seen from Korea so far. Inevitably marketed as a cop thriller, this story of the botched investigation into South Korea's first serial killer is much more of a character-driven drama. As the bodies mount up, the local cops are joined by a city cop, setting the scene for a clash between brute force ? Kang-ho Song's local tortures suspects and plants evidence because that's the way things have always been done ? and intellect ? Sang-kyum Kim believes that documents never lie and relies more on tracing patterns. To a degree, the narrative betrays a similar tension, with chases and beatings alternating with throwaway scenes highlighting the sheer incompetence of the investigation (the local police haven't bothered to read the forensic reports and they even try to frame the only witness, while they're unable to prevent more killings because the manpower they need is diverted to suppressing pro-democracy rallies). But it's not that simple: no sooner has one approach been finally been comprehensively disproved than the other is found equally lacking, and as no progress is made the detectives turn on each other and then themselves. It takes a while hitting its stride, but when it does it delivers some powerful blows, and the look of hopeless impotence on Kang-ho Song's face that ends the picture is the most haunting image I've seen on film in years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Memories of Murder is set in a town/village in S Korea, and is based on the real events of a serial murderer, where a pair of detectives are working with (and even in conflict with) a detective brought from the capital Seoul to assist.The face of the serial murderer is unknown, and his executions of his kills are practically perfect leaving practically no trail leading to him. His victims, all females, are all brutally attacked, and one of the main emphasis of the movie plays strongly on the detectives condition and the impact that this is all having on them, as the strain and stress of not being able to crack the case weighs down on them.The murder hunt is very intriguing, but this is not your usual Saturday night detective program. If anything, this film is original with stunning camera work and scenery complemented by some great acting by all the characters. Storyline is not overbearing, and overall IMO it seems to walk the line well between acceptable and unacceptable with respect to violence and horror.This is another excellent film from the wonderful Korean stable. Not one many will have heard of, but if you get a chance I would definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eh, South Corean cinema... What cinematic art coming out of this backyard, small country. Recently I have seen several Corean films and I admired them all: the vengeance trilogy, Tae-Guk, Castaway on the Moon, and this one. All highly recommended. What shocked me most about this one is the ending, unlike anything u could expect from a Hollywood blockbuster. True, Se7en had an unexpected, bitter-sweet, emotional ending, not a happy one for sure, but this one is impossible for Hollywood, because here it all ends so true to life and reality, almost leaves u hanging there. The film is not only a brilliant crime drama, it also is a study of the changing South Corea and how rural life looked there 20 years ago. It also makes fun at the Asian kick-culture of violence and trying to solve problems this way, embodied by the detectives' third side-kick (oh the pun:)) and his fate. It also shows a piece of rural life that contains misery, loneliness, deviations. All washed in a sepia, gray-brownish colors of the Corean countryside. I think South Corean people can be proud of their film industry.</fullReview>

Hollywood should learn from these guys. Memories of a Murder is based on a true story, of a serial killer who was never found in South Korea in the 80's. Think of it as an Asian Zodiac. Everything about this film resonates to an incredible level: magnificent script, beautiful music, flawless acting; this film is the biggest surprise I have seen in a long while, and one of the best thriller/detective movies ever made.I really don't know what else to say about this magnificent piece of cinema, other that you have to see it. The cinematography by Hyeong-gyu Kim is magnificent, I mean, people with a higher budget over in Hollywood can't produce intense shots like the ones done in this film. Tar Iwashiro scores one of the most beautiful and sad compositions I have ever heard. What is so amazing about the script, is that it balances everything. Humor, drama, and suspense are all delivered equally, neither one overshadows the other. And this is from the same Director who made The Host. Pure genius. Adios Hollywood, hello Korea.

		<fullReview>Memories Of Murder, is a highly entertaining well grafted and nigh on perfectly designed piece of cinema about the real life killings of local village girls during the 1980s in South Korea. Memories sets out to make a serious film and not trivialise these events, which it does in a very simple manner coupled with exceptional cinematography and highly idiosyncratic characters whose introductions never over shadow the films events.Memories Of Murder has its own agenda on commentating on these events, making it quite clear that the social situation created in Korea at the time meant the government was "too busy suppressing its own citizens to put resources into a proper investigation". And it is that which is the overriding theme throughout. There is a sense when you watch this film that the operation was completely botched. Not only did the police forces lack the necessary forces to cope with such a killer, but also that the police were more concerned with finding a 'scapegoat', as is seen in the interrogation sequences. They adopted a 'any face will do' motif, and they lost not only valuable time, but face with the public.Memories is marked by a trio of outstanding performances by Song Kang Ho, Kim Sang Kyung and Park Hae-Il who each bring something unique to this creation. Their rivalry and own internal issues mean they clash with each other and must look deep within themselves for answers while yet never distracting from the film. Kang-Ho Song provides the most intriguing of all the three detectives. At the start of the film we see he has no actual intent in catching the killer and a forced confession is enough for him to sleep easy at night, as long as he thinks he's right. However he has a gift for being able to deduce whether people are telling the truth or not by looking into their eyes. The legitimacy of this 'gift' however is questioned throughout the course of the films duration, even by his own family, which is well done in keeping the audience hooked as we want to believe in him but don't know if we should. Detective Seo Tae-Yoon (played by Sang-kyung Kim) is the enforcer of the trio, a high flying, heavy boot wearing, hot headed time bomb. His deep seated anger issues and a a somewhat noticeable lack of refined sensibilities in policing enquiries hamper a man who in the end wishes to do good and we can still sympathise if not empathise. Roe-ha Kim as Detective Cho Yong-koo is the most gripping of the three as his transformation throughout the film as he delves deeper into the depraved mind of a sadistic serial killer, begins to haunt him more than it does the other two. Having been sent in from Soeul he is charged with responsibility of finding this man and the toll it takes on him as a human being is remarkable. There are obviously more issues to discuss about how good this film is but the acting speaks for itself and is truly the driving force of this film, and 'will' keep you watching.Memories is a wonderful film, which is by no means perfect, but its fusion of serial killer thriller will drama and black humour gives this all too familiar genre a refreshing new twist, if Zodiac were any good this is the type of film it would be like, and is more often than not provocative. It's nail biting tension provides the audience with moral qualms throughout, questions over our honour, our integrity and our principles. The notion of What Is Justice? rings out loud and inevitably there are only answers to be found within yourself. While some may find the ending forced, I found it pleasant within the context of the film as it served its purpose to highlight the damage done to our three protagonists. Memories is a must watch film if you are a fan of Korean cinema or the genre, but more importantly, this is a really good film that anyone interested in film (from anywhere) should view and enjoy. This is one you 'will' remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on an actual series of murders in South Korea between the years 1986 and 1991, Bong Joon-ho's Memories of Murder is a well performed, thought-provoking film about the investigation into Korea's first serial killings. The film, which combines bleak reality with dark comedy, is less about the actual crimes than about the emotional toll it took on the police officers investigating the case.The film opens in 1986 when South Korea was still under the control of a repressive military dictatorship. A woman's body is found in Gyunggi province in a drainage pipe in a rural area outside of Seoul, raped and strangled by her own stockings. The crime scene is chaotic. Reporters and spectators mill about and a tractor rides over the area destroying footprints and other potential evidence. Local police officers Park Doo-man (Song Kang-ho) and his aggressive partner, Cho Yong-ku (Kim Roe-ha) are in charge of the investigation but are joined later by a volunteer from Seoul, detective Seo Tae-yoon (Kim Sang-kyung).The police, however, are preoccupied with protest demonstrations against the government, and do not put the necessary manpower and resources into a proper investigation. A rivalry soon develops between the intuitive Park and the cerebral Seo. Park claims that he can detect a killer by simply looking into a suspect's eyes. Seo is more rational and scientific but both overlook crucial evidence and both do not hesitate to brutalize suspects. Although they force confessions from Baek Kwang-ho (Park No-shik), a retarded man, and a man who masturbates at the crime scene, they know that the confessions will not stand up in court. Showing signs of desperation, they torture an eyewitness to the murders to the point where he tries to escape and is run over by a passing train.Eventually the detectives locate a suspect who admits that he requested a song heard on the radio each night a murder has been committed, but not a shred of evidence is ever found. After they beat him, he tells the police, "People know you torture innocent people.... You'll never victimize me." Memories of Murder presents a powerfully haunting picture of a society so inured to violence and repression that a serial killer is a minor annoyance. As more strangled women are found, a sense of sadness and frustration begins to settle on the investigation and it becomes obvious that the police force is not prepared either by education or methodology to achieve results until the society it operates in can be purged of its authoritarian past.</fullReview>

Fragments of videotaped stage-performance shows him with very different affect-- and you realize the obsessive, haunted conclusion of the film indicates its open-case presence in South Korea's collective awareness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Echo many of the excellent reviews here - I didn't realise how much the film was a subtle criticism of the 80s dictatorship, though one murder takes place precisely because too many police have been sent to halt disturbances so that there aren't enough to protect the town hit by a series of sex killings. The first half-hour to hour is blackly comic, slightly farcical (forensic evidence destroyed by incompetence), but, for me, the film's greatness is when its tone changes - and the borders between the two leading detectives, Park, &amp;, Suh, become blurred until Suh breaks down. The downbeat ending lingers in the mind, and its realistic portrayal of a desperate police investigation is head and shoulders above most Hollywood sensational crime pics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really need to see another serial killer movie but I'm inevitably drawn to look. Most are stupid, clichd, and incredibly disappointing -- the obvious exceptions are the two classics: "Silence of the Lambs" and "Seven".The performances are superb.

The cinematography and editing are as good as anything you'll see.This is a first rate investigation that has plenty of twists and turns, red herrings, drama, suspense, and humor. But what sets this apart from most is its focus on the detectives -- their foibles, weaknesses, faults, and humanity.SPOILER ALERT: The key difference between this and most serial killer movies is that the killer is never found. But this movie is ultimately not about finding a killer. It is about the effect the investigation has on the detectives -- something we almost never see.A superb film.

What set this movie apart and makes it a gem is the perfect psychological exploration of the characters and the astonishing poor means they have at disposal to reach the solution of the case, the distorted and terrible way to get information and confessions, the portrait of the distant and impotent countryside victim of its poverty and too far from political interest and from the eye of the media and the politicians who only seek scapegoats and not the real assassin because it's easier and at low cost, given that only poor farmers are involved and accused of the murders.A mind opening movie, very well directed and totally enticing till the last minute.

		<shortDescription>Arguably the greatest crime thriller ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crime thriller genre is something that is particularly difficult to pull off. Most films of the genre end up being simple predictable and unoriginal. Even a lot of the films that are supposed to be great in the genre just end up being dull and forgettable. Luckily there are exceptions, films that break the clichs and tropes of the genre. One of these rare exceptions is Jong Boon-Ho's Memories of Murder.Bong Joon-Ho is a Korean director, though while being popular in his home-country of Korea, and while never receiving any main-stream attention or praise here in the west it still has a massive cult following. Memories of Murder though not his first film was the first to get him noticed. The film is based on a string of murders in the small town of Hwaesong. The serial killer ends up being more that the small town detective, Park Doo- man, (played by Korean actor, Kang-ho Sang famous for his roles in Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance, and The Host) can handle. So detective Seo Tae-yoon (played by Sang-kyung Kim) from Seoul is brought out to help the local police to catch the killer. And very clearly he was needed, the local police are very clumsy when handling evidence, and often resorts to beating confessions out of people they think are guilty. Needless to say Seo and Park clash. They end up spending more time fighting with each other than they do looking for the murderer. This clash never feels forced, like it does in some movies. This is because the characters are well written and well acted, not cartoonish one dimensional clichs. But as more and more bodies pop up the detectives quickly become desperate, resulting in am intense heart-stopping third act.Bong Joon-Ho crafted arguably the best cat and mouse serial killer film ever. But how did he do this? Well there was no one thing he did that made it so very great instead it was a large amount of different things that came together to make it a masterpiece. I already mentioned how the characters were written and performed. But another that he does that most American directors don't dare try is have happy comedic moments in the film. This is so very effective because by juxtaposing the comedic scenes with the darker ones make each stronger and more memorable. Few directors true to do this, because there's a fine line between making the film tonally stronger, or just tonally confusing your audience. Another thing that Bong Joon-Ho uses to make Memories of Murder fantastic is world building. First the film is nearly entirely shot on cloudy days, (a tactic the David Fincher would later use in several of his films.) and throughout the film their is a constant state of "panic," for example in one scene when Seo goes to a school, the school children are conducting some sort of drill for an emergency situation. Or in another when sirens are blasting in the streets and someone says over the speakers that it is just a test. Bong Joon-Ho is also a master of directing the audience he knows exactly where to put are focus, and how to move the focus to be sure to keep us interested. Bong Joon-Ho's direction actually matches the story structure, how the detectives constantly shift form suspect to suspect desperately trying to find the killer. And not to mention the films strongest part: the ending. I'm not going to spoil it, but nothing in the world will prepare you for it. And I think it's safe to say that it will cause your jaw to drop, and you won't be able to get it out of your head for days.I said it at the begging of the review, but I'll repeat it. Bong Joon-Ho has never received any mainstream success or recognition, (at least in the west.) but nevertheless his influence is undeniably. Quentin Tarantino named Memories of Murder as one of his 20 favorite films since 1992. And Memories of Murder was definitely the main inspiration of David Fincher's Zodiac. There are to many similarities between the two to deny that, not to mention that Zodiac came out only 4 years after Memories of Murder was first released. But even though major publications and websites have not given Bong Joon-Ho any mainstream success, he has developed a loyal cult following, and rightly so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serial Killer at Large, Korean Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is a interesting film with a deliberate pace that starts slow, then, builds to a surprising ending.There have been several murders of pretty girls in a small country town. The two local detectives, quickly grab up a mentally challenged kid from the village. It was known that the lad liked the one victim.The two detectives administer some rather forceful third degree to the lad. They then get the lad to record a scripted confession. The case is solved and the two are local heroes.That is, till, a detective sent from Seoul arrives. This detective goes over everything and realizes the boy is not guilty. The boy is released and the local cops are less than amused with the new cop on the block.The new guy quickly shows his stuff though by going over the evidence and finding more victims. The local boys again grab up the first suspect for some country justice. Of course they are a bit too quick off the mark and this man is also innocent. The pace picks up steam as more women are added to the victim list. A woman cop helps out by pointing out all the murders happen on rainy nights, and when a certain song on the radio is played that same night.The net is thrown wider and a girl who survived an attack is located. Off her somewhat cloudy description, a new suspect is rounded up. This time the locals do not resort to the "in your face" interview tactics. They do not want anything that could foul up the court case. The man though does not break, and is set free. The police do however have people tail the suspect.There is a mix-up with the assignments and the tail is lost. Another dead girl is the result. On this victim there is a small bit of DNA evidence not ruined by the rain. This is sent off to the States for the FBI to examine.The evidence comes back as inconclusive. The Seoul detective knows they have the right man no matter what the evidence says. Now he goes off the dead end, he intends to kill the suspect. Does he? Not saying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since I wrote a movie review, but so blown away was I by this masterpiece of moody suspense that I had to pen down something. I have seen only two Korean movies in my life so far and both have been among my favorites ? this one and Oldboy. If that's not a sign to watch a few more of Korean cinema, I don't know what is.At its heart, the story is based on a real life incident in the 1980's in a small province in South Korea. A couple of women are found murdered - their corpses mutilated and their faces gagged with their underwear. It's a brutal crimes, the kinds of which has probably not been witnessed before in this sleepy town and the bumbling local detectives prove themselves hardly adept at apprehending the perpetrator. Crimes scenes are muddied over, evidence mishandles and suspects brought in on a whim to be tortured or otherwise brutally interrogated by the two cops put in charge. A third detective, who comes from Seoul, is assigned to help them and his evident disdain for the local cops' methods and his reasoning of this being in fact the work of a serial killer puts him initially on the wrong foot. However, when a third murder in similarly creepy circumstances is uncovered, the serial killer theory appears validated.That may seem like another cop movie on serial killers and their hunt, but it is anything but. The story is taken as merely a canvas to paint a wide tapestry of human emotion and character which focuses more on the internal demons which haunts each of these characters. The cinematography and music perfectly captures this mood ? slow burning, understated, grime tinted and devastatingly effective. This is not a neatly wrapped up ready to order thriller. This is a movie where the cinematic techniques and writing are at their most superlative. The ending can be considered open ended, unsettling and maybe unsatisfying for some, but bear in mind ? this was based on a true story, and this was never meant to be just about the case. A more popular movie which it brings to mind is David Fincher's underrated but very good movie, Zodiac, in terms of its similarities of theme and approach, but I would say this is still miles ahead of that little gem. This is brilliance painted on the canvas of our movie screen. One of the rare 10's I'm giving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will love it if you liked "Se7en". Lots of details but in an interesting and exciting way. You would start to think and investigate with the detectives during the movie, also the viewer will model and build-up stereotypes about the mystery and about the characters. However, during the script, the characters develop and the director deliver that brilliantly, you'll gradually change your mind of them and start to like some and dislike some. The ending is alluring, absolutely unpredictable and fascinating. Here the director also successes in achieving his goals in tempting the viewer.The viewer may notice the continual scenes and gestures on the situation in Korea back then in 1980s.Critics may say the movie contains obvious insurmountable odds, but with these, there will be not such a great movie.8/10 : Not 10 because personally, I believe it could be made better, moreover I was not satisfied by the end of the film. During the last minutes, I expected much more than the story gives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A normal notion that we have, when we watch any murder mystery is that the killer ought to be unveiled at the end of the film. But, this film completely shatters this very notion. This film is fascinating enough to keep the viewers at the edge of the seats till the very end of the movie. This film starts with a murder of a girl. The police comes to investigate the case. In the beginning the police just wants to frame a ill witted guy, by making him confess that he had committed the crime. The police is not much bothered about it. I never knew about the enactment of the crime that the culprit has to do in some countries. It was really funny to see that the mentally disabled guy was doing the enactment, while his father comes and say that why he is doing this when he knew that he didn't kill that girl.One more main character is the detective Seo Tae-Yoon, who is mistaken as a rapist by Park Doo-Man and beats him. Detective Seo Tae-Yoon doesn't quite understand the working culture of the local police. In the beginning, there is a slight tiff between the two main characters- Park Doo-Man and Seo Tae-Yoon . But, as time passes they do get along.This movie is funny. But, the Park Doo-Man along with Seo Tae-Yoon finds out some patterns in the murder, but all ends up in futility. In the end, the desperation of not finding out the killer is seen and terrifically portrayed by the detective. I particularly like what Park Doo-Man says the the killer always goes back to the scene just to confirm that he left nothing behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memories of Memories of Murder - What great cinema is all about!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the tradition of commercial Korean and Japanese murder themed films, I was bracing myself for another gory-blood-gut spill mayhem. I was so, so wrong. This film continues to haunt me. I have so many memories of the 'Memories of Murder'. Where do I begin? Certainly with the masterful direction of Joon-ho Bong. Rarely have I come across a film, which is in so much masterful control and savage restrain in the hands of a writer- director. It reminded me of a glorious operatic piece, orchestrated to such heightened emotional involvement and aesthetic fulfillment.It is delightfully non-Hollywood! The film functions and operates at many levels, with a larger backdrop in the national and provincial political realities of the mid-eighties South Korea. You will also encounter truly precise casting for all the characters in the film - I cannot help but laud the work of the casting director. The characters come to convincing life and such actor-character merger is indeed a rarity.The film takes itself seriously and at the same time laughs at itself, and passingly also laughs at Hollywood and the USA. Mixing layers of humour with dead serious murderous matters is such a difficult thing to achieve, and Joon-ho Bong does it with a flourish which speaks of volumes of extra-ordinary talent. Internationally, master story-teller Joon-ho Bong should be more known in the film industry than the current "Joon-ho who?" puzzlement. There are so many over-rated Hollywood trash directors. Its a shame.On a philosophical plane, in the 'Memories of Murder', the journey and the quest is distinctly more central and vital than the destination. The eyes are supposed to be the windows to our soul - and if I have committed a murder, my eyes will not lie.You will have memories of the 'Memories of Murder' for a long long time. Go and view it to see what great cinema is all about!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gripping Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first Korean movie I have seen and this is my first review in IMDb. This movie is based on true story that happened during 1986 in Korea about an unsolved murder. The movie starts off slowly and builds up as it progresses. The haunting music, the location, cinematography and finally the cast just keep you riveted to your seat till the end credits roll. The two lead characters, one a local detective who is just not intelligent enough and the other person who comes from Seoul are just magnificent and carry the movie. There are also some heart wrenching moments when one of the witnesses is crushed by a train and a rouge cop who uses his leg during investigation and then have to have his leg amputated. The lead up to the climax is just cinema at its best.Not to be missed if you are a thriller movie buff. This is how movies should be made. A first rate thriller/mystery movie.

		<shortDescription>Authentic and gripping originality from South Korea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most interesting thrillers I have seen in quite a while. The acting is quite good ans especially authentic, the story of the murderer is gripping, the conditions at the time when the movie takes place are different, unusual and mostly based on intuition and courageous ideas so that this movie is easily distinguishable from other ones of the same kind. This is a psycho thriller that takes a look a the souls and feelings of its different characters and doesn't need any technical forensic analysis as it is a quite mature old school movie. This charm is underlined by some very brutal scenes and a lot of dark humour. One could easily describe this movie as an Asian film noir. You also learn a lot about Korea and about Asian culture in this unique movie as this is mostly based on true events. The ending of the movie might surely not please to some people but it is once again unusual and different from the mostly boring Hollywood stuff nowadays.The movie is highly entertaining as new possibilities and surprises arise throughout the whole story and create a complex and mysterious story. Maybe the characters are doing some mistakes in the movie (they don't realize that they have an important eyewitness until the end of the movie, they don't follow the hints of that disturbed witness and they are way too brutal with the different suspects) but this imperfect behaviour is somewhat the charm of those characters and the movie. The only reason why I didn't give the highest rating is that the movie was not always as suspenseful as I expected. This movie has a slow development and prefers to show us the conditions and the personalities of the movie rather than the fear of the victims and the pitiless brutality of the murderer and I think that a little mixture of both could have helped to not only create a very good movie but a true gripping masterpiece. Nevertheless, this is only a small detail and the movie is truly entertaining and original and wants to be authentic rather than being weird or shocking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serial Killer Story Becomes Effective Acting Backdrop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Korean movie whose reputation preceded it before I sought it out. I had already seen two Bong Joon-ho movies ("The Host" and "Barking Dogs Never Bite") so in my readings, I had learned that his masterpiece is actually this "Memories of Murder." "Memories..." is about a small very rural town which was terrorized by a serial killer who victimized young women on rainy days in the 1980s South Korea.The local police detective of that town (played by Song Kang-ho, whom I saw before in "The Host" and "The Show Must Go On") employed very backward simplistic reasoning in his investigation and violent interrogation techniques on his hapless suspects. The case also attracts a detective from Seoul (played by Kim Sang-kyung) who offers his help in the investigation.But since their logic and approach are polar opposites, the two detectives are constantly at odds with each other. The local detective would especially want to one-up his big city counterpart. This conflict became the source of hilarious black comedy, as well as very effectively tense dramatic moments. I felt this flawed cooperation between these two characters is the heart of the movie, while the serial killer mystery was merely a backdrop.My description here of the film is very broad. There are many gems of character development scattered throughout the film that are very noteworthy as well. The director very frankly captured the atmosphere of the time, with those creepy scenes while the women were stalked, the feeling of sheer helplessness by the police as a whole, as well as how the case affected each cop personally. The ending is quite abrupt and unexpected, but I read afterward that that was how it actually happened in real life (yes, this movie was inspired by a real case!).This is a highly recommended movie in my opinion. Warning on some gory scenes of corpses for those who are queasy. I definitely would like to watch more Korean movies after this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just everything from the corrupt cops to the subtleties of the acting was top class believable stuff. I loved how corruption was shown not to work but yet at the same time you understood why cops get frustrated with the job. It would be interesting to know if the songs on the radio evidence was actually true because it seemed very credible as evidence for the factory workers guilt. This is unfortunately the reality of policing when often they don't catch the guy and it is frustrating and not at all satisfying for them or the viewers. I still remember The Pledge by Sean Penn. That left me more dissatisfied than this film and i suppose it was because this smart university trained cop was pushed to this frustrating point where violence was his only release. The conclusion was understanding how difficult it is and also why morally crime doesn't pay. The violent cop lost his foot, the one for kicking suspects. lol</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in 1986, "Memories of Murder" chronicles the first serial killer case in South Korean history. The victims are all beautiful young women whose bodies have been found raped and strangled in local fields and ditches. The initial agents who have been put on the case are two incompetent bunglers - one a dropout from college, the other a dropout from high school - who seem to have gleaned the majority of their investigative techniques from cheesy TV crime dramas. Enter Seo Tae-yoon, a forensic investigator from Seoul, who wrests control from the locals and brings some big-city know-how to the case.Given the grim subject matter at hand, it's amazing just how funny so much of this movie turns out to be. Blessed with a sly sardonic humor and a willingness to make fun of its characters even while evincing a great deal of affection for them, "Memories of Murder" plays less like a conventional cop movie and more like a regional comedy filled with rich insights into the subtle truths of human nature. The relationship between Seo, the investigator from Seoul, and Park Doo-man, the more rational of the two local officers, is intriguing and complex, as we watch them bicker and brawl and engage in petty power struggles, while slowly coming to realize that each has something of value to teach the other if only they can set aside their egos long enough to listen. Saddled with even-then antiquated technologies, Seo and Park are forced to rely on good old investigative footwork and informed intuition to try and solve the case.There are strong performances by one and all, and a fine sense of atmosphere in the setting. Those looking for a neatly tied-up resolution to the case may find themselves disappointed at movie's end. But the rich rewards of setting and character should be compensation enough.</fullReview>

Local cops got help from a detective who came from the big city to solve the crime. The story is usual and this is not something new.

		<shortDescription>A brilliant crime/thriller movie indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie definitely caught me off guard. I had this movie lying around the house for a month and I finally managed to watch it. Man I wish I had seen this movie earlier.The plot is nothing special. Set in a rural area a killer kidnaps, rapes and then kills girls. The local police are having a tough time catching him so a detective from the city is assigned to the area to help them investigate the crime. You would think that this is a straight forward action packed crime thriller of a movie however this is far from it.I particularly like the fact that this film actually engages the audience with it's character development. For example, at the start of the movie we are introduced to a local cop Park Doo-Man (Kang-ho Song) who is portrayed almost as a street-wise smooth talking cop who use brutality to get what he wants. This image of him stays the same throughout the film until near the end. Whereas the detective from the city Seo Tae-Yoon played brilliantly by Sang-Kyung Kim is the opposite of Park Doo-Man. He prefers to do things with rationality, fair judgement and the usage of scientific methods rather than basing decisions on instincts and irrational thoughts which Park Doo-Man is best at doing. As the film progresses, the murderer continues to kill and the detectives are left with useless clues which lead them to another.And this is where the character development aspect of the movie really shines. After wandering around fruitlessly they become exhausted. Seo Tae Yoon who, originally was opposed to Park Doo-Man's brutal and vicious interrogation methods goes and says 'we just need to beat a confession out of him'. As an audience we can feel the detective's exhaustion and frustration and it just makes you eagerly wanting to know who the killer is.The whole setting itself, in a rural area adds to the tension and suspense. Technology is scarce, and in a period where protests and riots are occurring, you can't help but think that these detectives are on their own in this case. They have to use old methods to get what they want. The change in weather also adds to the suspense. When it is raining it creates a sense of feeling that the killer is about to strike which he inevitably does.The ending itself is what will tick most people off but not in a bad way. It certainly got to me but I should've known since it is based on a true story. I won't spoil it there for you however it should be obvious to you at the start of the movie.Overall this is Korean cinema at it's best. This film has some great comedy moments blend with great drama, tension and suspense. There are some disturbing scenes however that shouldn't put most viewers off. The whole film is shot beautifully with some scenes being gritty and others being peaceful. Its one of the best crime thriller I've seen in my life. I would certainly say its up there with Insomnia and Se7en. I wish to see more of these kind of movies in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not hyperbole to claim that Korean cinema is the finest in the world, of course there may be hundreds of turkeys that are never seen in the West, but those films that do make it to our screens are almost always excellent. 'Memories of Murder' is no exception, a gripping mix of detection, character study and black humour. Based on a true story it involves the incompetent and under-resourced investigation of a serial murder spree in a rural Korean village. The script and acting are very good, the two mismatched Inspectors are both changed by their ordeal and the differences between them become blurred towards the end. No doubt the inevitable Hollywood remake is not too far away, what a depressing thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to check some discussion on Oldboy when many people were suggesting this movie is good. In fact its a lie, this is a masterpiece. I actually felt the local cop approach to being more comical, only after realizing it was a metaphor of the Korean Dictators who used similar approach to keep control of the people. The story based on a series of deaths at Gyunggi, in South Korea and the police department's individual handling the case. The initial supposedly random death becomes a thrilling game between the serial killer and the cops. The clues which they use to identify the misfortune involved in finding the result of each of the case is what really the core ideology of this masterpiece. The actors are uniformly brilliant , be it the chief investigator from the town, his mental sidekick, the inspector from Seoul and the chief. The various suspects add more mystery to the case than reveal it. The methods used for identifying the culprit are innovative and refreshing. I love the sound track, the classic ending and on the whole this special movie. If you love thrillers and don't have a problem reading subtitles then I can promise you will not be disappointed. For making a masterpiece this one gets 10/10.</fullReview>

I found "Memories of Murder" to be as unlike "Seven" in style and form as "Star Wars" and "Alphaville" are different sci-fi films.Anyone should enjoy this movie because it is as well made as any film you have seen that you thought was great. Story, acting and filmcraft all are first rate and come together to show what life was like in South Korea in the mid 80's and weaves the story of of a small group of policemen and policewomen around and through that daily life. The portrayal of the cops is honest and brutal. They are as flawed as any of us are and do things they shouldn't. Their own frustration with the system is apparent as they take it out on suspects and each other. The Korea of the 80's is also fascinating as students riot and the whole population practices Civil Defense drills.The murders are dealt with almost entirely from the cops POV; that is, we see the aftermath and search for clues and evidence. There is plenty of frustration there as the cops we get to know can't get enough uniformed police to control crowds of gawkers and stop people destroying evidence by stepping on it as the murders continue.See this movie if you like detective stories, or murder mysteries or if you like true event dramatizations.But the main reason to see is it's just an all around good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insidious and, finally, gripping.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first fifteen minutes or so seem kind of slapdash, with over-emphatic acting, undistinguished photography, and exposition that seems to be going nowhere. But if you make it over that bar, you'll find a police procedural with a good deal of personality and a more subtle story than you might have expected.It could easily have been a typical Hollywood serial murder movie. Maybe it still will be. It will star Brad Depp and Julia Theron and will sport a ten-billion dollar budget. Here, in its original form, we have a small-scale story of an unsolved case of serial murders in a small Korean town.Detective Park, a beefy guy with a big chin who is not too bright, investigates a murder. His partner is Detective Cho, even less bright and more impulsive. Soon another corpse turns up and Detective Seo arrives from Seoul, the big city. While the two rural cops are beating the bushes (and some suspects) looking for a solution, Seo intuits that a third murder has been committed, and he's right. The girls were all young, beautiful, wearing red clothes on a rainy night, and the killings were preceded by requests for a rare pop song at a radio station. I know. It all sounds a little familiar and maybe Dennis Hopper should turn up as the crazed murderer.There are quite a few comic scenes in the first half of the film as the cops bang their heads against the wall and follow false leads. They all go out to dinner with the dour Chief of Police. The intense Chief unexpectedly gets so drunk his head falls on the dinner table, but he wakes up when two of the others begin scuffling with one another. Then he vomits and brightens, claiming he's had an inspiration regarding the case. The drunken Detective Cho explains the difference between the Korean police and the American FBI in terms of geography. The FBI has to use brains because the country is so big that they must sit in one place and figure things out, whereas South Korea is the size of Cho's member and can be covered by detectives on foot in no time. Cho doesn't use the word "member". There's at least as much obscenity in this film as there will be in the Hollywood remake.By this time, I suspect, you'll be grabbed by the story and it gets more serious. And, I have to say, it's curious to see the law exercised in the Republic of Korea. A public announcement tells us that the president is about to make a visit and we expect bands, speeches, and cheers. What we see instead is a tank growling through the crowded streets and protesters throwing firecrackers and stones at it. The cops beat hell out of whomever they want. If a suspect is confessing on tape to a crime he knows nothing about, the cops don't mind giving him hints. "Yes -- I strangled her! I strangled her with -- with -- (a cop cups a pair of imaginary breasts) -- with her BRASSIERE!" They hang an obviously psychotic suspect by his heels and hold him for four days without charging him. On the other hand, only once does a gun appear in a cop's hand, and then in a context that defines it clearly as disapproved of.Things, unanticipated things, happen the way they do in real life. Detective Cho is taken off the case for police brutality, gets drunk, starts a brawl over some bul-kogi, and a bystander interferes by whacking him in the calf with a wooden board, but the board happens to have a rusty nail in it, and Cho winds up with tetanus. Seo, the big-city cop, falls asleep on a stakeout, an important suspect slips away, and another murder takes place.By the end of the movie, the corpses that have provided the occasions for smiles, have become the dead bodies of girls we've gotten to know a little about and it's no longer an occasion for amusement. A suspect is finally identified who looks like the real thing. A young man who operates a computer, handsome almost to the point of femininity, but the FBI's DNA analysis yields ambiguous results. I don't think I'll spoil the ending that, in its own quiet way, is memorable.Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

The film present you with a lot of gags together with several deep moments of sharing the pain of the victims.

		<fullReview>In 1986, in the province of Gyunggi, in South Korea, a second young and beautiful woman is found dead, raped and tied and gagged with her underwear. Detective Park Doo-Man (Kang-ho Song) and Detective Cho Yong-koo (Roe-ha Kim), two brutal and stupid local detectives without any technique, investigate the murder using brutality and torturing the suspects, without any practical result. The Detective Seo Tae-Yoon (Sang-kyung Kim) from Seul comes to the country to help the investigations and is convinced that a serial-killer is killing the women. When a third woman is found dead in the same "modus-operandi", the detectives find leads of the assassin."Salinui chueok" is a very realistic movie based on a true story. The performances are stunning, showing the flaws of a Third World police department in a country under dictatorship, without respect to the human rights, using torture to force the confession and without skilled agents and resources. Unfortunately the identity of the killer is not disclosed and the unsolved investigation gives a sensation that the films has not finished. I am really impressed with the excellent quality of South Korea cinema, with the movies that have been released in Brazil in the last years. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Memrias de um Assassino" ("Memories of an Assassin")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memories of Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Minor spoilers below) The first thing I noticed in Bong Joon- ho's newest film is the blocking and cinematography. Every dialogue scene is essentially blocked and shot perfectly, cutting only when necessary and keeping all of the relevant information clear in every shot. Beyond that, however, lies characters that are all far from perfect, but always believable and absorbing.Memories of Murder is essentially a crime thriller/drama with comedic elements and a bit of social commentary. But do not go into this expecting it to be a comedy thriller, because as the characters get more and more serious about the case, so does the film. In fact, the comedic elements essentially stop after the first hour or so.The first time the two main characters meet, there is immediately a conflict between them. Basically the conflict between them is each of their methods for finding the killer; one of them tries to brute force a confession from a possible suspect and will investigate simply based on word of mouth, while the other sticks to the documents and the facts. This killer basically starts out as means for competition between the two of them, each one trying to find the killer through their own methods. But as they become more and more absorbed with the case, they don't necessarily become friends, but both of them start working towards a common goal, both of them using each other's methods.But this film is more than just a 2 way character study. It is also a commentary on what cops are allowed to get away with because of their power. 2 of the cops in this film are incredibly violent and short tempered, and not very smart. The characters pretty much get away with torturing innocent people (and almost killing one), trying to put an innocent man in jail, and inciting one extremely violent bar fight. While it may not be as bad as the criminal they are chasing, those are things most people would go to prison for if they were not cops. We put a lot of our trust in the police, but what we don't realize is that sometimes the people they give the power to, may not be the ones that deserve it.But hands down, the greatest part of this film is the overwhelming amount of tension it builds. This movie starts chugging along after the first murder (which occurs in the first few minutes) and gains momentum for the rest of the film, building to one of the most intense climaxes I have ever seen. As the characters become obsessed with the case, so do you. Every suspect is thoroughly examined not only by the characters, but by the viewer. Every possibility, every clue, building to one of the most immersive and captivating films I have ever seen.I will not spoil the end in this review, but I will say it was basically the perfect way to cap this film off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A total knockout film. A piece of art which has everything one goes to cinema for. From funny to hilarious and then dramatic, emotional, sad and finally shocked. It's a movie without any ending and the one that attaches a hook to you brain and won't let it go. From the publicity posters to the editing, writing and acting this movie is a thoughtful work. At times it would seem like reading an old novel and at times it would seem like watching a nemesis film. There are many flavors which work because of the terrific acting jobs everyone has done. Every character is a perfect fit. Both of the lead cops are opposite to each other and then the shift in their personality to take each other's place. The suspense is very strongly kept through out the movie and there is a ground breaking background score to lift it to new heights. The chase seen from the woods into the village and then the factory site is very thrilling. Another scene involving the train accident is also placed right. There would not be any department or field this movie could be less then great at. Kang-ho Song, is the best thing in the movie. His portrayal of an aggressive cop is top notch. He brings all the humor and then the intensity in the movie. Sang-kyung Kim, also gave wonderful performance. A cop with less known background which is civilized and honest to his job and then loses his control over the event. A movie which will be on your favorite lift forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beginning of this movie and the ending are highlights. in the beginning, the child's innocence and the ruthless of the murder contrast and shock.the scenario is warm, with the sun shining, contrast to the cold scene later. then a woman was found killed, the other two women who were killed in the same way were found.Thanks to the foreign senior police, no one was blamed mistakenly by the local polices, one was utilitarian, the other one is violent and ignorant.There is not much description of the procedure of solution to the case, but the movie did highlight the hero , including his wisdom, his upright, his insistent, his kind and his responsibility. The movie also showed the irresponsibility of some policies that just want to close the case and play in dirty to condemn innocent people.Women were killed one by one, while there was still these policies to deal with this case, with no other policies responding to the request of support or may due to the limitation of the number of the policies. In the final scene, the hero's anger reflect people's anger that the murderer murdered many women and he may murder more while we can't do anything due to subjective or objective facts.The case wasn't close in the end ,while we can infer that the two polices may keep investigating if there is some trace of the murderer, because of their responsibility to be a policy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and fear-inducing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a quiet sense of hysteria present throughout Joon-ho Bong's Memories of Murder. Though on the surface the movie plays as a detective with many comedic elements, its true core consists mostly of deep despair and paranoia. It is a testament to the director's skill that these two sides are joined together so well without it resulting in a disjointed mess.Memories of Murder portrays a case of a serial rapist in a small town on the outskirts of the Korean countryside. Three detectives with very different methods of investigation are put together to search for the killer. It becomes quickly clear that this isn't a usual case and the complexity of the case puts the detectives way over their head. You get the sense that these are effective investigators in their own right, but they are way outmatched for the situation they are put up against.Part of the effectiveness of the film is that it actually conveys the overwhelming fear that slowly seeps into the persons facing the unknown evil. The horrific acts committed are all the more scary because they are happening in a town with seemingly nice people. Everyone in the town seems to know each other by name. This makes the killer seem like somewhat of an alien presence, a ghost hiding behind a human face. As the girl describes the presumed killer in the end, his appearance was that of just an "ordinary" guy. The most scary thing is that he isn't a hideous deformed creature driven to these disturbing acts, but that this person could ostensibly be hiding in each other person that you know, with no way to determine which one in particular.Because there seems to be no rhyme and reason to what is happening the movie makes for a very scary experience. I have to admit I am not an avid watched of foreign films, but at the same time I found this movie to be thrilling to watch. It is not a light experience (it will likely leave you drained at the end) but very worth seeing. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Serial Killer Movie Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest serial killer movies of all time! Bong's style and storyline are unmatched in this mystery-thriller! Its powerful to see the police struggling during military control in the midst of a dire situation. The most effective aspect of the movie has to be the fact they the killings continue to grow as the movie goes on, and the identity of the killer remains hidden. That being said, the tension is high and the police must act quickly with limited resources, so its not so much the killer is super human, but that the police are just as human. The movie stays basic, it doesn't involve elaborate SWAT teams, over the top shoot outs, crazy car chase scenes, but instead it stays grounded and unfolds simple clues to pinpoint the killers identity. This is one of the greatest movies of all time, a must see!Full Review at: http://www.simplefilmreviews.com/2014/05/memories-of-murder-2003.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had just recently lived in South Korea (from 2011 to 2013), yet I had never heard of this fantastic film until early this year. Memories of Murder is a wonderfully well-made film with a haunting and simplistically beautiful score, as well as excellent performances from the actors of the film - especially that of Song Kang-ho, an actor of whom I've had to learn the name of to properly recommend this film to friends.I have only heard of one other film by this director Bong Joon-ho and that is "Snowpiercer", a film that was widely advertised in the last few weeks I lived in Korea, yet I also gave that film a miss thinking that it wouldn't be anything special. I have not yet seen Snowpiercer, so I still have to check that out.The cinematography of Memories is absolutely stupendous and shatteringly graceful in it's artistic clarity. The writing of the film - the adaptation of the true events to the big screen - was also handled very well. Everything about this film is quite wonderful and I advise those who like Korean cinema not to give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern day masterpiece done by a modern day master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Korean cinema at the moment is at the pinnacle of both commercial and critical success. The country is blessed with the acting talents from the likes of Min-sik Choi, Kang Ho-Song and Byung-Hun Lee along with visionary directors such as Chan-Wook Park, Kim Jee-Won and Bong Joon-Ho. Just as "Oldboy" is arguably categorized as Park's masterpiece, "Memories of Murder" is the film which established Bong Joon-Ho as being a visionary on his own right.The film, as the title suggests, is based on a murder being investigated by two detectives; Park Doo-Man (Kang Ho Song) and Cho Yong-Koo (Ro-ha Kim). Due to the publicity that the killings are getting in their area, Seoul decides to send Detective Seo Tae-Yoon who will help the current detectives with their case. This film, however, is not your conventional detective drama. This is an exercise on "Who-Dunnit" films which even the master Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of. The heart of the story, unlike the films from it's genre, is not in in it's mystery, but in it's exploration of the protagonists and the motives and reasons which drove hem through the case. Throughout the film we will also explore into the nationalistic and social environments that these characters had to come through to stay focused on the task that mattered the most; solving this case.The film is a little more than 150 minutes in length and is engrossing for that whole period. This is hard to find in mystery films but it achieved this not only through the master story-telling of Bong Joon-Ho, but due to the absolute mesmerizing performances given by Kang Ho-Song, Sang-Kyung Kim and Roe-ha Kim. The three detectives complemented each other with sublime chemistry but the star of the show was Kang-Ho Song. Song is established as one of the most accomplished actors to come out of Korea and this film, along with J.S.A., helped him to establish a reputation which is as strong today as it was then. The film is the only time when the characters were not defined by the story or vice-versa, but they perfectly complemented each other due to the skill that both the film-maker and the actors had in both their trades. Bong Joon-Ho is not as stylish as Park Chan-Wook is or as outrageous in his art as Kim-Jee Won is, but his vision helped give birth to another kind of film-maker from Korea who focused on simplicity a lot more than his counterparts to bring forth a complicated vision. This film was one of the first ones to promote this vision and to this day it stands as a film which defines this extremely different visionary who emerged out of this small but culturally rich nation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keeps challenging the viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One might expect that biggest challenge with a Korean film would be the subtitles. You'd be wrong. Though I have seen films from all over the globe in the original cut, with subtitles, Korean films are, and have always been, in a class by themselves. Part of this is because of the technical perfection. I have never before encountered a country where even the second-string directors (not the case with this film!) are so lacking in error, so crisp in technical perfection. But understanding that fact only sets you up for the larger puzzle. Korean films are never about what they seem to be about. Yes, I know that is a broad statement and may get me in hot water with any reader who strides over 100 earlier reviews to get to my late entry. But that is the truth. This film, a blockbuster hit in its native land, is a good example. Over two hours long -- feels like 90 minutes -- it seems to be a police procedural about a serial killer in the boondocks. Except the killer (spoiler) is never found. Except much of the film is more focused on the ineptitude, lack of equipment, jocularity, and cruelty of the cops. It is almost as though the director is challenging you to decide which is more interesting -- capturing the killer, or become gobsmacked by what passes for police work? This is not CSI Korea. This is more like Keystone Cops Korea. Yet, whatever choice you make, the film remains as compelling and yet puzzling as ever. This reviewer, having seen several dozen Korean films, each of equally astonishing quality, believes that the split between North and South has created like a void in the very DNA of Korea and its people. The pain of this void is so great that even when a story seems to be about something else entirely, the real story is the disconnect between two halves of the same whole, and the sorrow it brings. This is a superb film, whatever you think it means, and highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Recreation of A Real Life Unsolved Case.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a true story that occurred in a South Korean town from 1986 to 1991 during which 10 women were found gagged, raped &amp; murdered by a serial killer, Memories of Murder is an extremely well-crafted, ingeniously narrated &amp; intelligently paced mystery thriller about this very case file which not only qualifies as a defining example of its genre but is great enough to rank amongst the greatest films to come out from the South Korean film industry.The story of Memories of Murder begins in 1986 with the discovery of the first victim's dead body &amp; concerns the investigation carried out by two detectives with very different working methods. The local one always ends up torturing innocent suspects into confession while the other one's research goes much deeper. Most of the story covers these two contrasting characters clashing with each other while trying to work together towards the same objective.Directed by Bong Joon-ho, who is notable for fusing elements of various genres into one tightly structured &amp; greatly detailed story which is then often pierced with dark humour, Memories of Murder is his sophomore effort &amp; of all the films he's made to date, this one is certainly the most balanced. The screenplay puts great emphasis on its two lead characters &amp; their frequently conflicting opinions, and captures the real-life incident wonderfully as well.Cinematography exhibits an arresting visual beauty which contrasts with the very gruesome subject the film deals with. Editing cleverly lines up the different segments in a single file, resulting in a smooth, self-explanatory narration. And the background score has its moments as well. Further elevating the picture are quality performances from its talented cast &amp; although it ranges from composed to crazy, everyone chips in nicely in their given roles, especially Song Kang-ho, his right hand man &amp; Kim Sang-kyung.On an overall scale, Memories of Murder is an expertly handled cinema that puts on screen the most infamous case in the modern history of South Korea with admirable honesty &amp; manages to creep its viewers out more than once but despite its bleak tone, it never turns into a gloomy experience &amp; is an emotional roller-coaster ride for there are moments of unmistakable hilarity which comes from the idiosyncratic characters who are present in this picture in abundance. Inarguably one of Asian cinema's finest, Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus comes strongly recommended.</fullReview>

The plot is constructed so that is spite of hard crimes and police violence, there are lots of dumb-and-dumber type giggling moments related to local policemen's comprehension and handling of events, intensified by a fresh look from the outsider - a cop from Seoul, the capital; all those characters are splendidly deliberated and performed. However, the events are not running smoothly and tensions are not always up high: the length could have been shorter and the ending was not up to my expectations either (true, the story is based on true events, but in films as such the viewers would expect the disclosure of a wrongdoer at least, if not more). Memories of Murder is a nice above-average film, but not among the best Korean films I have seen; as for that period, e.g. Shiri and Silmido are more interesting.</fullReview>

The screenplay is so good that you feel yourself to be a part of the lives of those detectives going about their jobs. How the failure in unraveling the whole mystery grows slowly on them, how the pressure piles up and the the transformations that each of them go through as movie progresses. Even out-of-focus characters are connected so well to the main story that it feels as if the story would not be complete without them.I don't want any part of the story to be given away, so I will keep it down to this. But in the end, I couldn't help but wonder: if this is based on a true story and if the killer is still at large, what must be going through his mind when he watches this movie?</fullReview>

The movie is a great example of how in real life the killer may never get caught. One thing that leaves you wondering is why a serial killer(the third one who came very close of being a suspect) would give his real address when requesting a song during the killing? Some thing does not add up here so you keep wondering who really was the killer.But the most interesting aspect of the movie is how realistic the movie really is.

It's a terrific look at the frustrations of police, when they don't have the evidence necessary to stop a killer in a small town.The movie is top notch, very well made, and Korea should be very proud of their film community.The array of characters are interesting and plausible. Great casting and acting in all roles.It's a completely believable yet complex plot. There was only one point where it felt formulaic and typical, but they pulled me back in immediately, and I forgave them for that one "Oh, come on, now you're getting ridiculous," moment.The contrast between the local cop and the city cop, and the changes they both go through - excellent! The irony in the arcs these characters go through is rich.The ending is strong, especially the very last thing said. Provocative. This is a film that makes you think about many things for a long time after watching it.Very well done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie with some great acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie after recommendation from my friend. I like the mystery/suspense genre of movies, if anyone has seen the 'The Pledge' by Sean Penn where the main lead was played by legend Jack Nicholson then somewhere you will find the both story meets at some point in the movie. The actors are superb. The movie is all about the serial killer who kills womens on rainy day and whenever there is song 'Sad Letter'is played on radio. But nobody has clue who is the killer, the movie is bit over stretched,but the good thing is that the suspense remained through out. The detective from Seol joins the investigation and he is the one who actually do progress to find some facts which make this movie interesting to watch. But killer is too smart for them and the chase begins for nailing him.The problem about these kind of movies are that more and more short lived characters are introduced just to divert the curious viewer's interest to somebody else who actually has not killed anyone, but all evidence are found against him. Movie is superb and it retain the tension behind the complex characters and the relationship the detectives shared their anger,jealousy and competition are clear and understood well.The ending is also satisfying and it made sense because the case which is not solved ever in Korea is not manipulated into some strange ending.So friends what are you waiting for go and watch this movie and enjoy the suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atypical Thriller Succeeds on Story, Character, Not Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a brief comment on Bong Joon-Ho's "Memories of Murder": I typically avoid gory or violent films. Unless it's done in a funny way or it's a legitimate, useful device for storytelling, I see no reason to expose one's self to revolting images. For a film about multiple murders, "Memories" has minimal gore (around 5 brief scenes in a 2-hour film). Bong managed to create a really absorbing character-driven portrayal of a murder investigation, focusing on the investigators rather than the culprit. Nor does it even attempt to analyze the culprit's motives, an annoying pitfall which most similar films can't resist (but which "Silence of Lambs" does so well). It's a pretty straightforward ride along with Detective Park and his fellow small town underdogs, anti-heroes who sometimes employ questionable tactics out of sheer desperation or just because they don't know any better. Even Detective Seo, the big shot from Seoul, isn't the suave city guy, a prototype Bong relishes in squashing right upon Seo's introduction. Thrillers usually are slick, well-made products from the Hollywood factor and slick this isn't. "Memories" is engaging because of its clumsiness, rough-around-the edges small town quality, and even situational humor?things you don't expect from thrillers, much less one based on dead serious real life situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stay away from the film if you want to be entertained. Watch it if you want something better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film I would consider an art piece. There are few films that I consider legitimate works of art and this is one of them. The entire film felt like an expression of conscience rather than the usual film that creates falsified emotions and hogwash character development. This film was trying to express the confusion and frustration that a person feels when they border on unknown territory. The fact that this was based on a true story creates an atmosphere where the audience should stop questioning the plot, and start examining the human condition. Start to analyze what the film is trying to represent with the idea of being without fulfillment. The visceral frustration that comes out when you just don't have any answers.The cinematography is fairly standard, but it can be gorgeous at times. The characters are well developed. The acting is fine. All of the standard film criteria is met, but this film transcends the standard because of how thoroughly, and originally it examines the frustration of the unknown. I will definitely watch this again.9.7/10!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadder and better than Zodiac, really haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>basically, Memories of Murder is a haunting masterpiece of crime thriller. For Americans, it would be interpreted as the Korean version of Zodiac, despite the fact that it's released 4 years earlier than Zodiac.The movie is not the nearly half-documentary narration adopted by Zodiac. It's more alike a serious drama but had the touch of reality. And, reality is the topic it tried to deal with. Using this style, the director was able to pull off some fantastic moments that might have already earned the reputation of classics. For instance, every scene with the retarded boy was ingenious, sadistic and sad to watch. The relationship between the victim and the public, the police who tried to solve it, and the suspect had been clearly illustrated by the camera. Their underlying psychologies shined, as the public and the victim just wanted to grab a piece of meat to blame, and the police had the obligation to satisfy such a desire. But for the suspects, they were really caught up in the middle of this misery. That's why each of them was nearly beaten to death. The slow-mo long shot of the retarded boy trying to escape the police and the medias was already a classic.Like Zodiac, Memories of Murder is an exploration of societal changing. Or more precisely, societal tragedy. The murder cases themselves are societal tragedies already. But, the director told the story in the perspective of cops, therefore each time those uneducated countryside cops missed some important threads, the audience will sigh for them. Since all the cases took place in the countryside, it's not emphasized much by the metropolitan polices for Seoul. Therefore, the cops assigned to solve the case were also countryside cops with limited knowledge and technologies. At last, they never caught the killer because their incompetence...... This is a remind that, crimes had been evolving much faster than detectives, and to solve a murder case is far more difficult than to commit it. Such situation could happen anywhere because by trying to solve a mystery, one can become another sub-problem of the mystery.I was mocking the cops about their incompetence, that they never continued to follow those valuable threads and evidences. Once they catch a new suspect, they fell into some kind of self-filling logic, "Since I caught him, he's the murderer." Later, the retarded boy proved to be more valuable witness than they knew, but their ignorance of psychology and mental patient did them no good...... But when the movie ends, I reflected on it, and decided to write this commentary in a fair way.8/10 haunting and deep story, but could be too disturbing for ladies and children. Recommended to 20+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Koren great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if it's just me, but Korea seems to continue to impress me with some of the releases coming out of that country. I just saw OLDBOY last week, and now Memories of Murder. This film was a lot better than I had hoped for. It's better than any recent Hollywood film I can think of, and one of the better detective/crime films I've seen in a while. I guess going in **SPOILER** I wasn't aware that is was based on a true story. I was upstairs during the opening credits, so I missed that little introduction line that stated that.I thought the end was powerful in that it left me hanging, and upon finding out it was based on a true story it hit even harder. I find most movies try to follow the "cookie cutter" approach... This obviously missed that lesson as it doesn't offer the typical Hollywood "oohh, he did it" type ending. LOLI'm really glad I saw this film. If you get a chance to see it, pick it up.It's worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excepting Snowpiercer, this filmmaker has a distinct style. He surveys watchers and watching by creating and weaving layers. So far as I know, this is his masterwork. This filmmaker sees differently. He sees people seeing, weaves stories around this to keep us engaged, then simply shows watching.The story here is superficially a murder investigation. A serial murderer preys on girls in a small city that seems to be dependent on a quarry. Rain is involved, and the apparent trigger of a requested popular song on the local radio station.A pair of local detectives work the case, aided by their police chief boss and a more seasoned detective from Seoul. They speculate, beat suspects and fail to solve the mystery by the end of the movie. The interpersonal dynamics among these men matter, but I won't write about that here. They are simply an excuse to twist a police procedural into a related set of cinematic essays about seeing and believing.Our primary watcher is the senior detective on the case. There are two others with radically different ways of reacting. We have girls, a psychic, the detective's girlfriend, a mentally challenged witness, film crews, lingering townspeople? We have the murderer of course, who we glimpse hiding in the scrub, watching. And there are more than one suspect. Some of these move from watcher to being watched. The shifting fabric gives us a story.The novelty here is that we as watchers don't particularly notice that this is very experimental narrative, exploring what you see and what you remember. It seems like a regular murder mystery, until the end when it becomes clear the murderer is not revealed.</fullReview>

The movie made them out to be incompetent, corrupt and laughable.There was use of tension, humour, grime, love, hate, dirt - all pulling you in to the story. But something was lacking - and for me it was the portrayal of the police. They ended up seeming like keystone cops and I couldn't relate to them or take any of their posing-for-the-camera seriously.The part of the movie that stayed with me was the use of young girls in several roles and how that expressed (a loss of) innocence.From the reviews I had hoped for more from this movie.

		<fullReview>Koreans are indeed amazing. I have seen some thirty Korean movies and yet to find a disappointing stuff. You can blindly rely on the hype and ratings of a successful movie and the chances of you admiring is 100%. I can officially claim that there is not a better thriller than this movie. This one is the best that I have ever seen. People accustomed of seeing a happy ending to all tragic stories might feel disappointed with this movie, but for me that was even better. You are left to think, analyze and scratch your head at the end, but by no means the ending could have been better. I was completely on the edge of my seat for the whole movie. I also showed the movie to some of my friends and suddenly everyone opened their eyes for Korean filmmaking , craving for more movies. Besides thrill, this movie also takes you to the deep emotional rides by portraying the mental pressure on cops dealing with criminal cases.The protagonist is one the best actors around ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0814280/ ). The way he has portrayed his role of a " not so good " cop is amazing. Watch movies such as Host, Thirst, Secret Reunion, J.S.A to enjoy Kang-ho-Song's performance. Not a single scene of this movie is out of context and useless. Worth watching once and many more times.. If I could find nothing better than this, then for me; this is 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just simply the best serial killer movie ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't have the theatrics of The Silence of the Lambs, or the eerie quality of Se7en. But what this film has is a concoction of humour, satire, suspense and characterisation that places it a league above those two great films. This film isn't your average serial killer drama, it has no Noirish quality, and the look is one of beauty and nostalgia. What I think it is, is more of a social commentary and a documentation of a real life event and South Korean politics in the 1980's. The film is highly original, the cinematography has deservedly been highly praised, the acting is top notch (and I wouldn't expect any less from Korean veterans like Song Kang-ho), but what really propels this film into movie masterpiece is the quality of the characters involved. Every character evolves with the story; these are very real three dimensional characters that offer no "police thriller" stereotype. Miami Vice these cops are not.South Korean cinema has been consistently one of the world's best this decade and with visionary filmmakers like Park Chan Wook and Bong Joon-ho. This is one of the best films of the past decade, and it's easy to see why Quentin Tarantino agrees with that sentiment. I couldn't recommend this film highly enough. It's breathtaking.</fullReview>

Also don't miss a Tale of Two sisters, A very good movie about guilt.Interesting enough the message doesn't interfere with the content, so this is a very suspenseful film, you can't take your eyes of it. Also Cat of nine Tails is one of the least inspired serial killers movies I've have ever seen, although I like director Dario Argento (less and less with the passing of time).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to point any fingers, or to suggest that a filmmaker like David Fincher would crib from another director, but if ZODIAC harks back to any other movie in the history of motion pictures, it's this one. The suspenseful stories unfold in likewise fashion; the trio of sleuths charged with finding and capturing the killer(s) in each movie go about their task(s) in three more or less individual ways; and the overall feel (not to mention the lack of resolution) is the same. There are, of course, cultural and philosophical differences between the two films, but there seem to me to be far more similarities than dissimilarities here. Had I seen this one before seeing ZODIAC, these similarities most definitely would've leapt out at me. Or you. If you found ZODIAC absorbing (or disturbing, or both), you'll find MEMORIES OF MURDER just as chilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a gripping, sad, dark-coming-but-dramatic superior serial killer flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bong Joon-Ho is a director that I knew a little about back in 2006 when I saw his wildly entertaining monster movie the Host. I had only seen that one film from him, but kept him in mind as someone good in the Korean film world (that is someone not Chanwook Park or Kim Ki-Duk). With this film, Memories of Murder, he's more than that now. As one goes through this tight murder mystery, based more on character and on the frustration of a clear pattern of a killer who makes it just a little too hard for the detectives to track down, you forget about the world around you or the time and just focus in on this story, of the grim line that delineates how to find a serial killer. Maybe it's because Joon-Ho knew that he was making a movie about the first ever serial killer in South Korea that he had to make it this way, about clash between inexperience and professionalism and right and wrong that's demonstrated here.It's not an action movie, but a character study, as non-conventional in its outcome or in its style as something like Fincher's films Se7en and Zodiac (for the former there's even so much as a specific shot and scene that is lovingly ripped-off, and the latter, well, just see the results of the case to know what I mean). It's the story of a series of rape/murders in a rural area of South Korea during a time of military dictatorship (watch out those 'citizen' alarms!), where women are being murdered and all in a pattern: wearing a red item of clothing, when it's raining, and when a specific and *sad* song is requested and played on the radio. While the local detectives Park Doo-Man and Cho Yong-koo try and shake down a confession out of a couple of suspects, one obviously mentally retarded, a seemingly hot-shot cop out of Seoul, Seo Tae-Yoon, comes in to help with the investigation and practically takes it over since he is, frankly, best at the job. This is not without some protest from the other detectives, of course, who feel threatened by their means of (nasty) interrogation to get a confession.One of the things that marks this as a departure from a lot of familiar serial killer mystery movies in America is the nature of the characters and how they relate to each other. Take the interrogation scenes early on: would you see in a typical movie an interrogation of a suspect where the suspect starts to go along with the detectives' premise just to get the hell out of the room? It's all about the details in the way the scenes are played out, how specifically and different Song and Kim play their roles, even as they're in the same profession and wanting the same end goal.Bong Joon-Ho also gives actors in small parts some fantastic scenes, such as the actor playing the mentally challenged man, or even the woman who somehow escaped the murderer's grasp but didn't see his face. And we get a real sense of these characters as having real conflicts and lives outside of this- sometimes with humor like Park's attempt to find a "hairless man" suspect at a sauna, or with some dark and violent ways like detective Cho who meets a nasty fate after a bar fight. Barely anyone is just two-dimensional, and even the main suspect-killer in the second half plays his blank-faced part perfectly.The characters all work, and the scenario is played out in a superior style (or if nothing else than with efficiency and a clear eye for details in the case arising naturally and without unnecessary melodrama), and on top of this the film looks gorgeous. Joon-Ho and his DP shoot and shoot away, getting some fantastic shots in these fields of the 'Boondocks' where the detectives find the bodies, or in the rain, or in a short burst in slow-motion that is just the right touch. A similar approach to artistry could be found in the Host, where an attention to light and dark and how to paint black and night scenes don't mare anything with the story itself. Particularly haunting is how he films the glimpses of the killer's-scenes-at-work, or in that masterful climax at the railroad tracks at the tunnel. By the end of the film, we don't know for sure if it's all entirely the truth and the whole truth (based on a true case), but it attains a hyper-reality that one can't shake off once it ends. It's a chilling tale that needs to be told, about the dire straits of breaking ground and not everything falling in to place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is based on a true story that occurred in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province over the course of six years (1986 - 1991). 10 women were raped and murdered and over 3,000 suspects were interrogated. They've never found a killer so that's why we can't realize who the killer is in the movie. When girl said: "he just looks normal" means that anyone "normal" could be the killer. The detectives face could show his disappointment because everyone in Hwaseong is actually normal. Probably it was someone who never had criminal history. If they had any chance to match those sperm evidence with every man in Hwaseong aged 20-50, they could probably find him. Unfortunately case statute of limitations expired 10 years ago</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As many said before, this movie is good enough. But One scene ruined it all in one moment. In last 20 minutes of the movie (in scene where train ran Looney boy off) Looney was asked again by cops about murder scene he saw. Looney says to them, that he actually saw everything in details. Furthermore, he knew this Murderer in person! He also claimed, that this person (murderer) had thrown him once in the fire, which made burns on Looney's body. But why, in the name of divinity, cops didn't ask him WHO IS THIS PERSON? At least cops could ask his father about that fact after train accident (i believe, boy could tell everything about this burns to his father for sure). Hell no, "brilliant" detectives wrecked up the case for a long years. And instead of asking questions, decided to beat up suspect in the end because of hysterical emotions. P.S. It was in translated voice-over version, but subtitles also showed the same. Maybe, it's inaccurate translation, but i don't know Korean language to prove it right (or prove it wrong). If anyone does - it'd be awesome to reveal this fact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is October 1986. Before we dive head first into the muted grey setting of the politically unrest and military sanctioned South Korea, we first discover a body in a field. A field so tinted that it gleams golden, and it seems to be the very last place you would discover the scene of a murder. But we don't start with the body. A television police procedural series might slowly zoom out from an extreme close-up of a mangled corpse, or as always, track two detectives as they arrive, one filling each other in on the details and thus keying in the audience. Here, we are immediately aware that this sort of crime is not commonplace, unlike an American setting that would be familiar with it. Members of the sorely lacking forensics crew are late, and incompetently present themselves as they fall over in the slippery embankment (from the rain, a common motif). An unbroken shot tracks our main character, Detective Park, as he struggles all over to keep reporters at bay, restore order and prevent key evidence from being destroyed by a unsuspecting tractor. He too is clearly out of his element. The film is now gray and depressing, and suddenly Park isn't as passionate and determined, but his flaws shine through. He and his impulsive partner Cho both subscribe to the mantra of 'flying jump kicks first, questions later', and when a female detective whose only role is seemingly to serve the males coffee attempts to chime in with a key insight, he laughs misogynistically and goes back to his ridiculous theory involving pubic hair (later, in a rare moment of humour, he investigates while at the sauna). He and Cho are determined to pin the murders on anyone, and here they differ from the more rational and analytical eye of the renegade from the big city, Seo. But the remarkable thing is that Bong Joon-ho veers away from the ridiculous, and plays these moments straight. The same frantic percussive score is used for both serial killer and the three detectives as they chase down a mysterious masturbator in the woods, and this signifies importance. The drums come to a climatic halt as Park spots a tiny vital clue in slow motion, and we are so sure that this is the killer. Only after days of unnecessarily cruel interrogation are we tipped off this is more a sign of desperation than anything with the murders happening.The same thing occurs with the mentally handicapped Kwang-ho who seems a perfect scapegoat. He launches into a monologue that seems strangely knowledgeable for one so innocent, and everyone is entranced, but again the trail hits a dead end with a dose of common sense. A spade is introduced, and we think a confession is about to be brutally beaten out of him, but we cut and it is even worse; he is digging his own grave. Seo lies in the background, blurry in the shallow focus, clearly disapproving of these methods. Later, as Park and Cho bumbled around with superstitious nonsense, he stumbles upon the same setting, trying to gleam some insight, but the chase if of course fruitless for both parties. Bong Joon-ho makes the entire case frightening. Torrential rain is the recurring weather condition, and a haunting song that cues in another murder. Here we first become obsessed with the case as Seo does. We view girls in red from within the trees, obscured from view, and the ominous POV of the serial killer stalks the wet dirt path, but we have first seen this shot from Seo as they run the operation hoping to bait the killer. The only terrifying glimpse of the killer occurs right before a stunning reveal of the huge factory, smoking and groaning in the rain as a victim swivels around. The drums build up frantically and suddenly, the camera is shaky and then a split second of terror, before we cut to black - an extremely well done and fear inducing scene. Later they visit the prime suspect at yep, the factory, and although Seo does not know it, Bong Joon-ho has subtly linked the two scene together, and hope that we make the same link. Earlier, Seo as the sensible detective believes steadfastly in hard evidence, as it cannot lie, but after stalking and obsessing, he now cannot come to terms with the hard truth of the DNA results. In a reversal, Park is the one who has to wrestle the gun away from him.But altogether, it is Park we start and end with. The golden idyllic fields are visited again, but here he is no longer a hotshot cop, who believes he can figure out who is guilty just by looking into their eyes with his shaman instincts. He visits that grate again, perhaps for the nostalgic value of it all, perhaps all these years still yearning for the one that got away. He mirrors his earlier action, peeking down again, but this time the camera does not produce instant gratification - it zooms out slowly, agonisingly, as if it were about the unveil a stunning plot twist or an revolutionary moment of realisation. Maybe that is what Park is looking for down there. A normal looking guy has also committed the same nostalgic action recently; there is absolutely nothing to go on in this girl's testimony (a sentiment comparable to Fargo, or Zodiac). So close and yet so far out of reach, he stares us deep right in the eyes - a futile plea, an accusatory glance. The statute of limitations for the real life case that this film is based on has long run out, but there is no doubt that it still haunts and lingers in the minds of those involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Analysis of Time and Perspective in Memories of Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mystery genre certainly had its heyday during the era of film-noir, but never really returned as the mainstream juggernaut it once was. Mystery as a whole seems to now mostly be confined to tales associated with murder, with just a few directors breaking that trend. But there's always been enough interest in the genre to keep it alive.We will begin by looking at how time is utilized. The ticking clock is a typical narrative device used in many films, so that the goals set by the characters are given reason to be solved within a certain time-frame. Memories of Murder is no exceptions to this trope.We know that the killer will strike again through the information gathered throughout the film, the time frame for our characters is set; when it next rains, someone will die. This may not be a finite point in time but it is an inevitability. We know it's going to rain again and so now we have suspense. There is a threat that could strike at any point; the characters need to act quickly before he does. The characters need to find an answer before too much time passes.Memories of murder opens with warm imagery and a sense of humble simplicity however once the killings start they bring with it a great cloud that constantly looms over the town for the majority of the film. Time moves on yet the cloud lingers and removes any tenderness the image possessed. Only at the very end of the film do we return to the same location but the subtle difference between the past and the present shows that the damage has already been done. Time has destroyed the town and things will not return to how they once were. As we see, the balance of the world is upset upon the arrival of the killer and again being nothing more than products of the world they inhabit, they to become unhinged. The shift causes people to change mentally and even manifests itself into the characters changing physically. Both films have their characters of their world so deeply rooted within it, that the aspect of time lets the audience see the overall perspective of the background characters. But let's address the key characters. How are their stories told?Memories of Murder create a large boundary between the audience and its narrative. By treating its viewers as voyeurs and not participants, we don't see things solely from the perspectives of the people investigating the crimes. We see the murders take place, but we gain information that no one but the killer could have known.This altering of frames of reference continues as we see flashbacks from a victim of the killer as well as a POV from the killer himself. Portions of the story are told from a multitude of different characters but the film's overall perspective can be completely summed up in the final shot of the movie. Detective Park looks directly at the audience. Breaking all notions that this story is his. The final shot shows that when we were looking at what we thought was our main character's perspective, the film switches, and now the character is looking at our perspective. He wants to know what's our perception of this. Imagine that the real killer was watching this film; some of these scenes are only from his perspective. They are his Memories.This story becomes much more interesting when it's watched with the thought that the film knows an audience is watching. And if the killer is part of the audience a lot more of the movie makes sense. Because audience perception in the film is an essential ingredient to the narrative. There's not a conclusion to the film. There's an ending, but its not necessarily the ending we want. And so the film deal with what we believe is the truth and what we want to believe is the truth. We see many of the characters wanting the investigation to end so they make their own truths. But fundamentally what really matters is whether or not we believe the truth. The final shot of Memory stares at us, asking us about our beliefs. But several characters staring directly into the lens is used throughout the film to get the audience thinking. How important is it that we know the truth?And so the film asks us to do one thing; to look into the eyes of people. Do our perceptions matter? Do we believe it's him? Or do we just want to believe it 's him, because the thought of not knowing is too painful.Much of this can be explained through the philosophy of Perspectivism. Coined by Friedrich Nietzsche is the notion that all ideas are taken from different perspectives and the truth can only be found through the collection of all perspectives. That philosophy is the heart of these stories. We gained a multitude of views, from the average person, the killer, and the people looking for answers. And this serves the only perspective that matters; ours.Perspective is an overlooked idea when it comes to filmmaking, and in the mystery genre audience perception is vital. Especially in stories that deal with ambiguity. Perspectivism can best be seen in Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon. We watch a single story from the points of view of different people. And what it boils down to, is that the audience perspective is created from knowing each of the individual perspectives. By the end the only thing that truly matters is what we think. Story is all about perspective, so perhaps if your story needs focus, just imagine you need to tell it to one person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly grounded for a Korean film, yet still crazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Memories of Murder is based on the case of the first serial killer in South Korean history. Said murders took place in a town of Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province and attracted attention from the capital as well as from international sources. The movie naturally takes some liberties with the events in order to keep the story flowing, as it should, but it still means that it's a thriller with real weight behind it.The movie has garnered a lot of praise for its acting. Song Kang-ho playing the role of Park Doo-man, the local detective in charge of the investigations, won numerous awards for his performance, while I personally also really liked the performance by Kim Sang-kyung, playing the role of an investigator sent from Seoul to lend his expertise to the local police, who have never dealt with a case of such magnitude.The cinematography, directing and camera work have also gathered wide praise, and for a reason. The colours are vibrant and lush, the score it utilized with care, the camera angles are inventive and it's just a very nice film to follow visually.What keeps me from enjoying this film more is the fact that it's so stereotypically Korean. And don't get me wrong, I like Korean films and Korean style of filmmaking. But every other Korean film I've seen has been completely over the top and outlandish, with crazy stunts, characters and story lines. Normally that's the strength in those films, but imagine if that kind of style was utilized in a thriller based on a real life serial killer case. The movie lost me the first time a cop jump kicked a criminal. Granted, it's the most grounded Korean film I've ever seen, but I still felt detached from the story because I couldn't take it seriously.But, I can easily see how some might consider that an upside. So, let us simply say that while Memories of Murder might not be for every single thriller fan, it's still more than proficient enough for everyone to at least own it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Memories of Murder is, hands-down, the best murder mystery I've ever seen. Not just the best Korean murder mystery; it's the best, anywhere. It is also the best Korean film I know of too though, imho. ( It beats Oldboy by a small margin ) I wasn't born in 2001 either; I've been watching movies, critically, for 35yrs. Naturally it still depends on your perspective &amp; taste, whether you're accustomed to watching foreign films / different cultures, and subtitles, but the cinematography (although transparent), acting, score, editing, screenplay and directing are all flawless beauty. The inclusion of historical Korean references ( protests, air raids ) are a welcome bonus for anyone interested in Asia or the Koreas, and characters that are neither 100% good nor 100% bad, is also a welcome break from American movies. Just about every character is extremely charming.You should know, however, that this is not 'Maltese Falcon', or 'Clue'; it's not a great murder mystery in the Agatha Christie / Sherlock Holmes "who-dunnit" sense. If you want a movie where you try to guess who the murderer is, this is not for you. This is a fantastic movie of personalities and intrigue, that happens to take place in the context of a murder-mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting is phenomenal in this. Song Kang-ho and Kim Roe-ha play the goofy dumb cops really well and their whole demeanour reminds me more of the Mafia than detectives. Though their intentions may be good, the fact that they try and force confessions show that they don't really care much for justice and are rather more focused on the need to have someone to blame for the crimes. Kim Sang-kyung did a phenomenal job as well, and though he plays the stoic, 'masculine' cop, his expressions in the second half of the film transcends the screen.The directing and editing too are very powerful and greatly influenced the impact of the film. Bong Joon-ho does a great job with levels, atmosphere and close-ups/wide shots. His vision and direction is amazing. In addition with the great editing (music, cuts) and the mise-en-scene (and make-up of victims), this film makes for one hella creepy watch. We all know the impact that the right music choice has on a film, and especially for thriller/horror films, music is crucial to that suspense and 'jolt' moment. In this film though the music played a part by making it very reminiscent and sorrowful, like remembering a bad memory.Though it is an impressive film, it is not without it's flaws. There are a few events that are not fully explained or some scenes that are a bit confusing. Also, they never did find the killer, and there is a very high chance that he watched this and is very likely still alive now...Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

Acting was very solid by all involved, music, cinematography, script are first rate. It's superbly paced movie, at running time 2 h 8 min this movie barely drags and is captivating from start till finish. This is not a typical "who dunnit" type of mystery, and if you are hoping for a one, you might be a bit disappointed by the ending, which in my opinion is great.Overall, all in all "Salinui chueok" is not to be missed by anyone who likes solid mystery dramas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this the other night, and although I'm only 12 years behind, was one of the best films I've seen recently. Briefly summing up, is like a Korean 'zodiac' but seriously way betterThe movie is pieced together with the perfect amounts of seriousness and comedy that make any BJH movie great, keeps the movie interesting and creates contrast for the darker murder sequences. There were also plenty of twists that kept me guessing who did the deed and had such an unexpected ending it was actually refreshing and left me gobsmacked.Not sure of the rewatchability of this due to knowing whats going to happen I think (personally) would detract, but there is enough charm and detail to still have an enjoyable rewatch none the less. Definitely a memorable film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memories is Memorable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Memories of Murder is such a taut, effective thriller it's a shame you have to read subtitles to gauge just how good a movie it is. The movie seems so American from afar. It's got serial killers and comic detectives and sex crimes and night chases and squabbling partners. But literally in the first sequence it establishes its uniqueness and the understated eye of its director, Joon-ho Bong, successfully managing to convert popular American plots into vehicles for caustic Korean critique.A police procedural plagued by melancholy, Memories of Murder fictionalizes a real-life incident in Korean society. It follows Korea's first serial killer case that took place in 1986 and resulted in the brutal murders and rapes of ten women. The movie begins with the body of a young girl who is tied up, raped and brutally strangled to death, being discovered in the sewers. Inspector Park Doo-man (Song Kang-ho), the local police officer in charge of the homicide, is at his wits end as he tries hard to preserve the crime scene. The murder scene however, turns into a free-for-all for the entire town and our local sloppy cop is barely able to gather any useful evidence. As soon as a second body surfaces, the nature of the crime vastly reminiscent of the first, help is sent from Seoul in the form of the sharper homicide investigator Seo Tae-yoon (Kin Sang-kyung). Over the next 2 hours, we watch as the detectives learn from each other and change under the pressures of the chase with one common goal ? to bring the culprit to book. To say anything more about the storyline however, would be unfair to those who are yet to witness the brilliance of this Korean stroke of genius.Each character is brilliantly realized and all the primary and supporting characters pitch in perfectly rounded performances. Bong's masterpiece almost single-handedly resuscitates the moribund serial killer genre. Throughout the film, he fills his compositions with elements that sum up the incongruity, the sheer messiness, of life at its most banal, even in the middle of a murder investigation. Even as the body count continues to grow, Bong never allows the film to lose sight of the fact that all that withered flesh was once human.Yet even as the movie edges towards resolution, one can feel the director's reluctance to provide easy epiphanies, smug outcomes or tame answers. He's more interested in capturing a society deeply affected by the predicament of a murder investigation. What surfaces is quite extraordinary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My rating: 8</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not intend to write about this movie, but because I like variety, I changed my decision. So, in the meantime, we make slight deviation to see what happens in South Korean cinema, which shows us a simple story of an ordinary serial killer in an ordinary village. So true story that proves to be a true story.Evil, black, dragging innocent people, investigating murders towards itself and terrorizing the entire community for years. Slowly and methodically makes its steps, leaving the most important traces - those to itself. We can say that the film presents serious lives of the detectives who give everything they love to catch the killer. Tells about the world we live in - the public world in which any gift to possess recognition of good and bad people we have, have no chance to conclusively say who is good and who is bad. Privacy creates new limits, inaudible to everyone else. It is drama when there is no light at the end of the tunnel. The finale is the most interesting because it blurs the created image crashing it to the infinite mass of ordinary people we meet everywhere. At first as a joke, without special effects, the end catches us by the hand and leads us in our future days, which will experience knowing one truth that we saw only by its traces.I recommend only to the curious and patient ones.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story jumps right into the focus without any wasted second for the opening. The pace goes nicely with a normal speed. The mood is well kept with the mystery just keeps eluding the main characters. It's a great job done in directing the scenes. The drama side gets to feel very intimidating to see, even the smaller laughs inserted as a color feels very funny. I saw Snowpiercer before I saw this, and now my appreciation towards Bong Joon-ho grows even more. He can get the exciting part out of even the normally ordinary scene. Song Kang-ho did a very great job, doing his signature smirk almost all the time, making this kind of character his specialization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie takes many familiar tropes of crime movies and then turns them on their head. Normal dumb/jock detective turns out to be deep and insightful in the ongoing investigation. Stranger comes to town in the form of a big-city detective, looks to be the savior of the situation, but can't get it done. The initial suspect was actually a witness to the murder! and then gets hit by a train before he can identify the killer! Then, finally a break in the case! But it turns out that the main suspect didn't do it! This movie would never get made in the US or if it did they would have to re-write the ending. Americans hate when a criminal goes free. But I was pleasantly surprised that the movie did not go that way. Great watch!</fullReview>

The plot is based on true events about the first known serial murders, which took place between 1986 and 1991 in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province and we follow the effort of two detectives that try to solve the crimes. The sceneries and places are good,the atmosphere thrilling and the direction amazing.Although it seems like a "who dun it" or a "cat-mouse hunt" genre it has more to offer than the mystery.The suspense will drag you along with the actors and you will live this yourself.This movie rightfully deserves all of the stars!10/10 by me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As is common with many Asian movies, we Europeans (Americans even more) find them a bit weird. All the crazy fighting scenes and unusual characters met with a rather odd sense of humour. This movie is no different. But that doesn't change the fact that it is an amazing piece of cinematography.The plot is based on a true story, a series of murders that happened between 1986 and 1991 in South Korea and the three detectives investigating the case. The movie is powerful from the very first scene and you soon realise this will be one of those "beautiful" movies that stay with you for awhile. The music is spectacular,the scenery is warm, the characters grow on you, but on the same note, the movie stays on firm ground, giving you a sense of seriousness and realism. The 2 different poles, so rarely combined in movies in a right way, are done superbly in Memories of murder, thus making this film seriously good.Worth watching, but with an open mind. This is not a Hollywood movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any film chosen by Quentin Tarantino in his list of top films is a cause of celebration for the film's director as the metteur en sc?ne would get the feeling of being accepted by a wider audience.However,by being a complete family entertainer,Bong Joon-Ho's film "Memories of Murder" outsmarts any move to include his film to any list.It is not so often that you see comedy, suspense and thriller in the same film.Bong Joon Ho achieves this feat with his wry sense of humor which is able to convince viewers to mock some of life's incongruities.His talent at revealing black humor comes in a hilarious scene which features a chief detective for whom nice shoes are as good as Nike shoes.It is often believed that the bad portrayal of women in South Korean films is heavily resented outside of South Korea too.However, positive portrayal of feminine characters in this film reveals itself as a redeeming quality.If one were to single out the most important element of this film, then it would emerge that the endless frustration faced by police forces when the crooked criminal positions himself a step ahead of detectives would take the large piece of cake.The film features nice performances by its leading men Song Kang-ho and Kim Sang-kyung.Film critic Lalit Rao watched this film at South Korean Embassy Cultural Centre,New Delhi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>all time best korean film, no doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Memories of Murder is, for me, the best korean film ever. I cannot find any more thrilling, meaningful than this yet.If you know about Korean history a bit, then it would be better to understand this film. The director put a number of symbols in it. The most problematic and criticized issue here is not about who is a real murderer, but about the abused powers which made lots of victims in that time.The director of Memories of Murder described every single scene and character with so much care and meanings. I could see his efforts to show all dark sides of Korean society in the 80's. He truly has extraordinary insight on Korean society and history.Korean in the 80's was very chaotic. Govertmental authority was wrongly used for every second. It was the time Korea was dictated by the notorious dictators who had military origins.. A number of people were killed during that time because they protested against the despotic government. (This is usually considered as a big metaphor for consecutive homicides which happened in the movie.) Also, it was the time that cops(helped the government to stop protests) abused innocent people in order to get fabricated confession from them. This is easily found in the movie. These are not the only problems of that time. Journalism distorted truth and made the society more disorderly. All rotten parts of the society made conflicts, mental illness, and murders.The movie itself contains the Korean history very well. How could it be more clear? Memories of Murder is based on the real case. But the director gets ahead.. He catches all the complicated and delicate social problems in the case of serial murder. So brilliant.'Memories of Murder'- it is a past tense. However, at the end of the film, the audiences would figure out that the murder is still present progressive. The movie doesn't mention clearly about the real killer. Therefore it is so confusing who is the reason of murders. Policemen? Politicians? Journalism? or Park Hyeon-gyu? Who do you think the real killer is? Memories of Murder has been more than a movie in Korea. It was one of a culture phenomenon. The characters and what they said in the film hit Korea hugely. When it was released, "Hyangsook was pretty" was the most popularly used sentence. In every term, Memories of Murder is surely a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two rural detectives, their chief &amp; a well-educated Seoul detective search for a serial killer who specifically chooses certain victims when it rains, using their own undergarments to bound and strangle them while he rapes their tied up bodies. We watch as the rural detectives, who often use rough tactics to secure their admittance of guilt from those they question, try to find the killer and how the effected the city detective is when attempts to catch him often fail. We see their dogged, weary pursuit of suspects and the exhaustive, emotional let-down when each is ruled out by one way or another. When a possible suspect emerges, and seems the ideal candidate fitting the profile of the rapist who nearly murdered one living victim(..and also requested a specific song only on the nights the murders took place, not to mention the fact that he started working at a factory right before the murders), they believe that their misery might finally end as they await a DNA semen report from America possibly pinpointing him as the murderer. But, is this suspect the murderer, and better yet, can the rural detectives keep from exploding in anger when they interrogate the suspect? It'll all come to a head when the city detective looses his suspect after falling asleep on his watch and yet another young woman is horribly butchered in a much more heinous manner during one of the town's common blackouts..the detective will take his suspect to an isolated location claiming him guilty even though the American lab results may say otherwise.Powerful, haunting, gut-wrenching, &amp; heartbreaking..we see how these men fail at their methods despite giving their heart and souls to the case day after day. Developed obsessions with possibly suspects even have the detectives at each others' throats. The film is quite absorbing as we see how each detective loses a bit of their humanity as they cripple at the leads that fail them or at an eyewitness who perishes accidentally during a horrible train accident. The Korean leads all bring much to their roles..during the film each character is fleshed out and exposed of their flaws at trying desperately to catch a killer against many odds such as unavailable forensic techniques or civilians trampling over crime scenes. Beautifully crafted by director Joon-ho Bong who adds many humorous bits sprinkled throughout so that the achingly tragic story will not be such a burden to sit through. Bong respects the victims by not dwelling on the murdered bodies too long.</fullReview>

This film is based on a true story however it is not a biopic or a study on character, it's a harrowing depiction of a certain period in Korea, interestingly enough memories of murder tends to focus on human conflict rather than the atrocities that inevitably occur several times. The catalyst of these crimes was astoundingly never caught most likely because S. Korea's detectives were of minor intelligence and their methods of investigation were undeniably brutal and confronting. An exceptional film in all aspects and once again South Korea raises the bar for virtuosic film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Memories of Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always taken a liking for serial-killer crime thrillers such as Se7en or the more recent Zodiac, because the cat-and-mouse game between the killer and the cops never seem to tire out, at least for me, and especially so if they're based on real life incidents which add a sense of realism in the stories that are told. It can be wavered off as implausible, because there were real victims who fell under the cunning of the killer.Korean crime thrillers have so far been a mixed bag though, even if those like Voice of a Murderer were based on unsolved true incidents, because in the hands of less able directors, it's always easy to lapse into laziness in making the film, applying quite standard narrative types involving chronology, and what happens next, or over dramatizing elements of the story just to amplify emotions of pity and anger, or worse yet, become a bland whack-fest, hyping on gruesomeness and gore as spectacle. And here's where director Bong Joon-ho, who went on to make the superb The Host, excelled, in sailing with an even keel in the presentation of Memories of Murder, making it extremely memorable, and went beyond your standard crime thriller fare by deftly gelling together all elements in the movie, into one keenly felt film.Memories of Murder recounts possibly South Korea's first serial killer, who went on a spree between 1986 and 1991 with 10 women brutally raped and murdered, and sparked off an intense investigations which involved some 1.8 million cops and 3000 suspects, as the prologue would have us believe. Song Kang-ho stars as Detective Park Doo-man, a small town cop with little experience in investigations of such nature, and it's slowly revealed too that the police of those days possess very rudimentary skills and equipment to handle crime of such nature, coupled with the complexity of having to deal with curious villagers and onlookers who contaminate each crime scene.In comes Detective Seo Tae-yoon (Kim Sang-kyung) from Seoul who volunteered for this assignment, and you have your big city versus small town rivalry, as the two of them can't see eye to eye in various matters, especially when it boiled down to extracting confessions of convenience from prime suspects, in order to wrap up the case and call it a day, dished out from in your face beatings by Park's sidekick Kim Roe-ha (Cho Yong Koo). Under a social and historical backdrop of martial law, we see how questionable methods get employed, and how sloppy investigations can get, at times relying on questionable and unorthodox methods involving torture.It is this constant interplay of opposites that keep the viewing engaged throughout, especially with the incessant challenging of individual cop's beliefs and investigative philosophies, which at times can dwell on black humour, such as the profiling of hairless men. All the lead cops in the movie no doubt will grow and come out of this experience changed, such as how small time cop gets forced to open his mind and widen his horizon, and how the constant frustration at being hit with red herring after red herring, of being so close but yet so bloody far, just adds on to the complexity of the case that this is not your simple criminal, but a cold and calculated serial one.There are a couple of elements that I particularly enjoyed in the film, such as how opposites almost always bring about a clash, be it of values or methods employed, in particular how Detectives Park and Seo come to blows, one a believer of his own sixth sense ability, while the other a follower of paper and documentation. Director Bong also crafted an element of comparison between the macho cops and a rather soft prime suspect, one you would probably not have put on your radar, who just appears, and I couldn't help but to draw comparisons with David Fincher's famous Se7en and Zodiac, which were made before and after this one, where it is fairly clear of certain similarities between this film and Se7en with its incessant rainy setup, while Zodiac shares the same frustration with this one in the cops' inability and impotence of not being able to crack the case in front of them, resulting in an increase in body count. Nothing beats having to know the MO, but being powerless to do something about it.Best of all, Bong Joon-ho knows how to craft a thriller with action at the right moments, and they need no be big-bang types, but sequences which were highly effective in bringing out adrenaline. He did that for this film, and for The Host, and without a doubt I begin to feel that he understands the material at hand in order to craft them for the pleasure of an audience sitting through it. I still have one more of his earlier movies on DVD format yet to be watched, and I hope to pop that into the player once I savor this masterpiece once more. Highly recommended, and it sits in my mental list of great serial killer crime films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Memories of Murder" is a crime movie which is based on true events that happened in 1986 in South Korea. There we watch a series of murders and in each of them the victims are beautiful women and always the police find them raped, tied and gagged with her underwear. In the investigations of the police two local detectives are in charge who are a bit stupid because they investigate their suspects with brutal way and without any kind of technique and of course they can not find the serial killer. When a new detective comes everything change because after the third victim of the serial killer they start to find some interesting information of him and they continue more careful their investigation.I really liked this movie because it is based on a true events that happened in the past and as a result because of the plot which I found very interesting. I also liked this movie because of the interpretation of Sang-kyung Kim who played as Detective Seo Tae-Yoon and he was simply outstanding on it. Some other interpretations that I liked in this movie were the interpretations of Kang-ho Song who played as Detective Park Doo-Man and Sang-kyung Kim who played as Detective Seo Tae-Yoon.Finally I have to say that "Memories of Murder" is a great movie to watch and before you judge it because of the language and because it is not in English I have to tell you that the plot and the storyline it will cover you just fine. I strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gallows humor elevates serial murder mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1986 in South Korea. Women's bodies are being found tied up. Detective Park Doo-Man is the local cop tasked to find the killer. He's a bumpkin and a brute with a slightly better sense than his other co-workers. The local force proves to be inept at such a big case. The locals coach a weak minded idiot to confess. Detective Seo Tae-yoon comes from Seoul to assist them. He suspects a missing girl is the third murder victim and they find her in the field.This is a funny serial killer police procedural. It's a rare thing to have both the gritty brutality and the comedic aspects. Park's foolishness is funny at time but also very dark. It helps to break up the usual the grotesque serial killer movie. The mystery goes slowly sometimes as Park bungle him way interrogating one wrong suspect after another. It would be helpful to tighten up the over 2 hours running time to speed up some of the slower spots. However this is still a fascinating mix of dark humor and grotesque violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had this movie in my stock for quite a long time and i have just finished watching it.Have to say the best murder mystery i have ever seen. It was oldboy which made me believe that korean movies can be as good as the movies being made in any part of world.Now i just want to thank it.I have never had such an amazing experience before.Only seven comes a bit close.The movie starts of with couple of dead bodies found one after another.You see park as an immature detective dealing with the case in first 20 minutes or so.Then enters detective seo from the city of seoul to assist him.Park doesn't like seo first and then story moves on from the tension in between them to the frustration of not being able to solve the case.The movie will suck you into the investigation.You can feel the frustration the helplessness of the detectives.The condition of Korea didn't help them a bit either.Some scenes like the chasing scene on the stroke of the hour and the climax are so brilliantly done that they will literally sweep you away.Joon-ho bong's direction is impeccable.All of the actors specially the 2 main leads kang-ho song &amp; sang-kyung kim are brilliant.A must watch.How does a murderer look like?Can you see into someone's eyes and tell if he is a murderer?No you can't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I have seen in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching this movie and I am simply amazed. Superb acting by all cast members, brilliant script and first class directing put this movie at the head of the class.The director is a genius. He is the fellow who made one of, if not the best, monster movie out there, The Host. And he does not disappoint here. I won't give any of the plot away because I think this is one of those movies where the less you know about it, the better. I will say this much, the story is beautiful. And beautifully told. It is so skillfully told as it unfolded I became so involved with the characters, the mystery and suspense that I completely forgot I was reading subtitles. Yes, the acting is that good.The quality of Asian cinema has grown leaps and bounds in the last ten years alone. This movie proves it. If Hollywood doesn't get a clue fast, they will simply be outclassed and will have to sit back and watch their box office returns get smaller and smaller each year.As it is right now, most of the regular movie goers I know prefer to venture to other parts of the globe when choosing which movies to see in theatres. Most of us will just watch a bootleg of a Hollywood film as opposed to taking a chance on paying to see it because the quality sucks with such regularity these days.However, I will be out spending my movie dollars on foreign films and Asian ones in particular. Hollywood can remake all the Asian films they want. I will be out seeing the originals!I saw this movie online for free with compromised visual quality and it still blows away every Hollywood movie I have seen in a theatre over the past few years. And I do not exaggerate. I will be purchasing this movie for myself and two friends for sure. Hopefully it is available here in the U.S. I cannot wait to own it! Easy 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a true story about some murders in rural South Korea.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Memory of Murder was in Korean with English subtitles. It was a drama with some black comedic moments. It was essentially about some murders in the rural countryside of South Korea. Two local detectives try to find the killer and are not above using torture to get a confession. However, they fail to get the right guy and a detective from Seoul is called in to help.The details of the investigation and the hunt for the suspect are laid open. The two local detectives provide the comic relief in a dark way sort of like the humour in War of the Roses. As the killings continue the calm Seoul detective begins to get frustrated and acts more like the local detectives. The ending is ambiguous and leaves things unresolved but that's more a reflection of life where loose threads are not always tied up.There is a dark mood that permeates the film through the use of dark colour schemes and a lot of night time shots. The music can be a little heavy at times. Pounding into us what we're supposed to feel rather than gently tugging on our emotions.Overall, I give this film an 8 out of 10. However, I'm a little biased since my heritage is Korean. Although, I don't understand the language, I know when it's being spoken and there was a familiarity with it. I could identify with the characters since we're both Korean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is jerking off a crime?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director Joon-ho Bong (The Host) presents a fascinating film of police work Korean-style. Except, that it looks familiar to some of the police work that we see here in America - planted evidence, beating the suspect who was only brought in on rumor, death threats, and leading questions during a so-called confession. Death Row is filled with people convicted using these methods.Kang-ho Song (The Host, Secret Sunshine) is excellent as the cop who is just interested in closing a serial-killer case as fast as possible using these methods. Fortunately, a detective (Sang-kyung Kim) comes from the big city and sits quietly examining evidence and doing research to put the police on the right track.It is really funny watching the local cops staking out bathhouses looking for hairless men and consulting Shamans, while the real police work is being done sifting through garbage. But, the investigation takes it toll and we get a Seven twist.Great chases, hilarious moments throughout, and a good ending to a slow, thoughtful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Memories of Murder is based on the true story of South Korea's first known serial murders. Against the backdrop of the military dictatorship in 1986,the local detectives Detective Park Doo-Man(Kang-ho Song)and Detective Cho Yong-koo(Roe-ha Kim)investigate a murder case which is totally "alien" to them. To solve the murder case in which the killer rapes and gags the women with their underwear, they just brutally beat up every suspect in their ham-fisted way so Detective Seo Tae-yoon (Sang-kyung Kim)who seems more like a professional who knows what he is doing is sent from Seoul to assist them in the case. He easily realizes that this is not a typical easy local case but he has to convince his two other partners that they are actually dealing with a serial killer. No matter how much he feels up to the task, it won't be easy for him to convince his partners with the lack of all the accouterments of modern technology.The evidence is improperly collected, the misused forensics leads only to a morass of inconclusive evidence, and a serial killing is not something that the local detectives are used to. Though it sounds predictable,clichd and corny at some points,Memories of Murder really gives the you the spirits.You just put yourself in those detectives' shoes...Those detectives who are torn apart between anger and helplessness of someone who can't just solve one problem which looks so easy but which is actually so evasive.It touches you indeed.Somehow Detective Seo's snapping with fury at the end of the movie because of the inconclusive DNA report and the increasing number of the murders reminded me of Eom Joong-ho,(in The Chaser)former police officer turned pimp who is running for the life of one of his girls at one last attempt.</fullReview>

There are some senseless dialogs (sometimes this happens in Asian movies) that displace you from the storyline. I understand that it's from a real story (i hate this kind of movies, because they must forcedly follow the events of the original story) but they could have done better anyway.

		<shortDescription>Good but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing unanimous rave reviews about the highest grossing Korean movie thus far (domestically I think) I had my hopes unrealistically high. The narrative was pretty good but I found the characters too much like caricatures and the events loosely based on reality were too overdone. This may be coming from my bias against buddy cop movies - I've seen way too many of them and really dislike them in most cases. Anyway, you have the local cops that beat up suspects just to get a confession and have a difficult time listening to the reason of the analytical big city detective. The one local cop that was so prone to violence seemed to lack the dimension of being much more than "the bad cop" or the sidekick. Meanwhile, the "good" local cop was pretty likable but his stubbornness not to follow the leads but to rather look for baldies or waste time torturing the suspects was a bit amusing but frustrating. The competition and jealousy and fighting with the city cop got old I thought and I felt the film focused too much on this "this is my turf" aspect of their relationship like rush hour or something. The city cop's change in his tactics also felt rushed and the tunnel scene near the end was just overtly melodramatic.I had the same problem with Taegukgi, another Korean blockbuster in that both of them dealt with a great setting, had some real thrilling scenes and were filmed superbly but just had tacked on overtly melodramatic and "wow what a crazy coincidence" type unrealistic situations to be taken seriously. Especially considering that this is based on real events. An example is that the girl that lead to the bathroom lead and who the city cop put the band-aid on ended up a victim, or that the guy gets hit by a train before they can get truthful info out of him, and other examples that may be nitpicky.Also I guessed that the scar guy was a witness and that the girl's lead was the best one waay earlier than the detectives did, I thought the first point was a little obvious early on. I really must fault a movie that makes me guess key parts before the detective does, I don't wanna feel that smart in a who-dun-it, I wanna be completely baffled! I'm not asking for some insane "that character is a figment of your imagination" twist (even if those are fun!) but just for enough subtlety to keep me questioning, not yelling at the detectives what's going on like "He's speaking in the third person!!! GAH!!!" Also I'm not sure whether it was designed but I laughed at the the beatings way more than I ought to have- I didn't feel seriously outraged until the guy hit the girl in the bar, the rest of the beatings seemed like playful big brother beatings or something.Anyway, I felt the movie was effective in the story-telling but it's the only highly touted Korean movie I've seen in which I took nothing away from. Sure it had characters who were split morally but I took away just about as much as this as I would a CSI episode (which I don't like anymore) The cinematography was really good yeah but the other great Korean movies I've seen have made me think and genuinely feel so much more (Save the Green Planet, Oldboy!, 3-Iron, Samaria, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and A Tale of Two Sisters are all top-25 movies for me) For this I was just like "awww gross, peaches?" and "that damn psycho bastard". The only moment I really felt and went "WOW" was when the killer was whistling in the field before tackling his victim- that and scenes similar to that warrant the acclaim. But otherwise this is just, to me, like a good mainstream Korea movie. I give this a 6.5 maybe 7ish on a good day - good use of the story, but thats all this movie is to me - a story with good thrills, the gross out factor and an efficient use of formula-inspired twists to entertain.</fullReview>

Let it be Korean, Japanese, Chinese - what ever (I hope I haven't offended anyone - it's just my aesthetic recognition, not geopolitical). Every time the same question crosses my mind - What the f*** is wrong with this movie? It's not that those movies are bad. No. They're just slightly... wrong. I mean the way the plot revolves, the characters are formed, the music is chosen. It's a little... wrong. And I think I know why.Differences. Little differences. Between western and Asian cultures. Not in habits, or beliefs. I mean the slightly different ways of actually SEEING, CAPTURING the world, the life, everything. Accents put in different places. Those differences result in odd (in western criteria) choices made by Asian storytellers - directors. When You see movie of Asian director who works in Hollywood, you experience those differences less. But when he is a "local star" (like Joon-ho Bong), a local vision would be presented by him, for you resulting in few little internal short circuits.So I THINK "Memories of Murder" is a good movie. For Koreans. For me though, it's only not bad.</fullReview>

I love dark comedy but it just doesn't come off that way. Most of the cops are complete buffoons. I kept expecting the one in the middle to crack the heads of the other two together a la Moe. One minute they are running around like Jackie Chan and Chris Rock in "Rush Hour" the next minute they are immersed in a gruesome autopsy. The story is based on real events. I hope that the writer took liberties with his portrayals of the police. If this is accurate it's very sad. I am left with no respect for the Korean police and disgusted by their methods.

		<shortDescription>Flawed story in an otherwise well produced movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Beauty in the eyes of the beholder' in the case of 'Memories of Murder' would explain reviewers giving this movie high-and-higher amount of stars. But folks, consider the story; shouldn't a flawed plot affect your ratings? Main example: The female police officer, listens to the key listener-request show at home on her radio and deduces that the same song has been played prior to each of the murders. But since the post card containing the request is posted earlier than the murders, how could the murderer be certain it would be raining on the precise day he murders? I'll continue. The story 'tells' us that the serial killer is fastidious to the point of obsessiveness in leaving clues (though some evidence is destroyed by sloppy crime scene protection). So then why would the killer write his name and address on the post card sent to the radio station? The viewer knows later on, of course, that this is because a red herring has been introduced: the person ultimately detained and tortured is not the killer! Which means that the 'smart' good cop is suddenly not so deductive an observer since he misses this. Now of course this red herring could serve to show how rotten these cops are and how the good cop is now turning into a bad cop. But if this is the plot's intent, then why in fact did song-being-played-on-each- rainy-day mean anything other than to fake the audience out? And why, for goodness sake, didn't the accused man, seriously and strenuously and believably protest his innocence from the beginning. Five or six women had been killed by this time and he knew, for he told the cops, that everyone in town knew the police were torturers. (A side bar: with no confession made public, the townspeople would still be traumatized by the potential of a serial killer loose amongst them. Under these circumstances, would two women, not together, walk into a darkening, scary and isolated woods? Classic class b horror stuff here as when a woman, alone in a house, walks down into a darkened basement!) Finally, for this particular plot problem, we get the payoff, or a payoff, at the end. The good cop turns bad and wants to kill the handcuffed man even though he has conclusive proof that the semen found on a victim wasn't his. Bad cop becomes reformed and good cop becomes corrupted. But what about the serial killer? The search for him was dropped like a hot potato and we the viewers are supposed to forget that a murderer is still out there because the film maker has made his point about good and bad cops. I also have to mention the unfortunate and unbelievable ending of this film, something that should have been left on the editor's floor. 15-or so years later the former bad cop, now a salesman, stops at the scene of the first murder. While there he meets a young school girl and when he tells her, in vague terms, that he once had some connection to the spot they're standing at, and asks her if she thinks this is 'weird', she tells him that earlier that same day another man also told her that he 'did something' there. The word 'weird' is used again and boy do I agree. Think of it folks, on the same day, thousands of days later, both the serial killer and one of the investigating cops revisit the scene of the first murder! 8 or 10 stars for 'Memories of Murder'? I think not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Egrigiously Bad South Korean Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll follow the lead of a fellow IMDb user who reviewed this film negatively and merely list my biggest grievances with this South Korean thriller and add a conclusion at the end. This is not meant to list everything I found bad about this film but to give some rough outline about my thoughts on it.1) The detectives and sergeants involved in the case all commit numerous unforgivable and frankly unlawful acts outside and inside the job and suffer almost zero consequences, to the point that even with the knowledge that some extremely corrupt things do happen in the world you wonder if the setting is in fact supposed to mimic that real world or some fantasy land.The two bumbling in-house detectives torture and coerce suspects into confessing for the crime without the sergeant, some sort of internal affairs or anyone in the department interfering until way, way too late. And even when someone does interfere it's not because they recognize it's morally and lawfully reprehensible, it's because they found a new lead and therefore have no use for the suspect anymore. More puzzling is that the suspects don't sue or try to acquire some sort of reparations.One of the in-house detectives plants evidence and the detective brought in from Seoul to assist them seemingly does nothing about it.The other in-house detective assaults pedestrians and trashes a local restaurant while off-duty because of pressure involved in the case and seemingly the next day he's back on the job with no punishment incurred.2) The detectives and sergeants involved are way, way, way, WAY too incompetent to still be involved with a supposedly high-profile case after the second murder, let alone until the end of the movie. Again, is this a fantasy land?Suspects are released and given seemingly no further attention based on the word of a detective and evidence that are at best circumstantial and inconclusive. (Like seriously, they let their best suspect go because his hands were rough and a live victim described a rape from some years ago whose likeness is similar to the the case and she said the perpetrator had soft hands.) Crime scenes are mishandled very badly.The detectives follow a "lead" about the killer supposedly requesting a particular song in the same day the rape + murders are committed and yet don't think to ask the radio station for cooperation.On that note, why did the detectives think the song being requested is a promising lead in the first place? The detective from Seoul is ultimately revealed to be an emotionally-imbalanced wreck who takes cases too personally.3) Terrible deus ex machina, glaring inconsistencies and just outright unrealistic situations. A police officer finds the connection with a song being played on the same days of the murders based on absolutely zero narrative or logical precedence. She was never shown to be involved with the direct investigation of the case before that, never shown to be investigating the radio station in connection with the case, and the detectives were never interested in the radio station in the first place.The killer supposedly targets beautiful females wearing red and yet towards the end of the movie 2 victims are killed who weren't wearing red, one during a day that wasn't raining. With that how come the detectives were still persistent on the song + rainy day connection, even one of them going so far as attempting to kill the suspect who was found to be requesting the songs? What was the point of the peaches lodged in the victim's vagina? Why the bloody hell is the law essentially nonexistent in a police procedural film? There are no lawyers, search permits, or trials. With the evidence they had the detectives had no cause to detain any of the suspects for as long as they did and at one point they just stroll right into a residence and extract evidence just like that. In conclusion, like other critically-acclaimed South Korean thrillers (The Chaser, I Saw the Devil, etc.) this film has offensively bad writing that distracts from its solid acting, cinematography and premise. You will especially be offended if you've seen smarter and better crafted thrillers as this film is undoubtedly an affront to the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has everyone else on IMDb gone mad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if I just watched the same movie as everyone else here because I just finished watching this pile of drivel and can not fathom how it is possible we all watched the same movie. Why the high praise? This movie has holes in the script the size of water melons and I'm going to have to vent them because it will save me writing a review.1) Why didn't the cops just ask the retarded guy in the first place whether he actually witnessed the murder? 2) Why did one of the cops feel the need to fly kick a suspect at every opportunity? What if the suspect is innocent? 3) Why did every male cop in this movie talk to each other in a condescending manner and thus heighten the sense of confusion rather than using sound logic and communication to get across their opinions? 4) Why didn't they just flag the song on the radio and tell the station to contact the police the next time they air the song or receive postcards requesting the song?5) So by the end of this movie the killer supposedly looked very 'ordinary', by that the little girl means...? 6) Why does the director want us to sympathise with a cop who gets his leg amputated by the camera homing in on his discarded combat boots with the shower cap on, to prevent scratches mind you, which might I add was used in order for said cop to kick the living daylights out of 2 innocent suspects in this movie. May I add that this cop's leg was also injured as a result of a brawl whereby cop had to be forcedly hit in the leg to stop him from kicking three kinds of daylight out of an innocent farm girl.7) How is it that 24hour surveillance of a possible serial killer, a serial killer might I add whose every crime has been printed on the daily newspapers, how is it that 24 hour surveillance can be jeopardise by one cop taking a 5 minute nap? 8)Would you really trust a policeman who says his true skill in understanding a criminal is by looking deeply into their eyes? No? Well neither did I, and to boot it turns out he was wrong on every occasion in this movie and possibly by the end had let the killer go as a result of this strange method of interrogation so Er, why is that concept even in the movie?9) Peaches, for real? 10) For such a high profile murder case which supposedly has tons of press following the case, we are made to believe that Korea's finest are what amounts to an overweight drunken lout and his hot tempered side kick, and a nothing Seoul cop whose moment of glory is in finding a connection between all the victims wearing red and being killed on rainy days. Is that all you got? I'm sorry if I come across as someone who is slightly out of touch with whats great in modern cinema but I have to say this movie was poor and had no redeeming features what so ever; cinematography? bah, soundtrack? I can't even remember it, mood? It only disappointed itself, acting? I've seen similar acting in Jackie Chan movies.4/10 people, let's keep things in perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A complete mess. Overlong, boring and offering no resolution, this film is more than bad; it's an embarrassment. That it's been so highly praised internationally is the kind of "affirmative action" pandering that occasionally strikes film festivals; it's success at home just confirms Koreans flock to bad movies too.The major responsibility of a director is to present a movie that is of a piece, that is, it is unified as a story in tone, time and place, and offers a believable and interesting plot. This movie is all over the place tonally: it has moments of madcap wannabe Jackie Chan-style buffoonery with Three Stooges-level relationships among the leads, offers serious policier pretensions for most its second half. As for running time: the whole thing is incredibly long, all the more so for a film that offers no real suspense, no threat to its protagonists and clues that come out of nowhere, like the female officer's sudden, out-of-the-blue discovery that a certain song is played whenever the murderer strikes. (And we're asked to believe that these cops are dimwitted enough to think that the murderer himself may have requested the song with a postcard that gives his accurate name and address!)It doesn't matter that the movie is built on a true case. So what? You don't go and make a movie about an unsolved crime unless it offers some other insight other than the banal idea that the serial killer-rapist could be anyone (which of course isn't true; we're not all killers). After slogging through an interminable running time, to then be offered no resolution (even after a meaningless flash-forward to ten or so years later) is an anticlimax of the worst kind. An absolute piece of total pretension with bungling characters and lousy story-telling (e.g., the retarded suspect obviously has been an eyewitness to a killing but the cops realize this two hours after you will), this movie may sour you for other, good Korean films. Don't let that happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little disappointed with this film, because it had been so highly rated in here! Although it was set in the 1980's and science wasn't what it is today, there were still some things I was surprised they didn't follow up on...particularly the line from the suspect with the burned face, "He threw me in the fire when I was young." That could have been a great lead for them. I did think some of the film was funny and odd, like our main detective sitting under a tree with an IV hanging from the tree branch above him. It was good, and maybe I am spoiled by American detective type films, but I still give it 5 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This highly acclaimed film by debut director Bong Joon-ho won best new director award at the San Sebastian Film Festival and was a box office smash in Korea. It follows the story of rural detective, Park's, (Kang-ho Song) unprofessional response to the true story of Korea's first serial killings which took place in 1986. These murders were complicated and pre-meditated, taking place on rainy nights after a particular song had played on the radio, and involving the fetishistic binding and gagging of the female, red clothed, victims. The local police response is to plant evidence, beat suspects for a confession, and consult a Shaman. Luckily an educated detective, Seo, (Sang-kyung Kim) is sent in from Seoul, who believes in scientific methods and logically analysing evidence. This sets up much of the films tension due to the friction between the two leading detectives individual approaches, which come down to the battle between instinct and science. The film is certainly well constructed with strong performances from the entire cast, but it is ultimately unfulfilling. It is aimed firmly at the Korean audience, which may mean that the cultural differences form a barrier between the characters and some Western viewers. Whatever the reason the film remains un-engaging due to the difficulties in emoting with the protagonists. The film also covers old ground, with themes that have been covered a thousand times before in more original ways. Instead of looking like a film set in 1986, it gives the impression that it was made in that year. In typical buddy movie fashion the two detectives begin to learn from each other, and about the nature of their profession. The philosopher Nietzsche states that those who do battle with monsters must take care that they do not thereby become a monster, which is relevant here as Seo begins to throw off his logical methods in favour of beating the suspect he feels is guilty. Meanwhile Park relies less on instinct and leans more towards the logical and analytical approaches. This coupling of opposites had the opportunity to be interesting viewing. However, perhaps the films biggest downfall is also the one aspect that gives it any originality. This is based on a true story, a story in which the killer was not found. This means that the story can only be told from the point of view of the police, leaving the audience in the same frustrating position as the detectives. In thrillers of this type it is customary to have a non restrictive narrative, so that the audience can see what the killer is plotting even if the identity is never revealed. It then becomes a series of moves and counter moves, a puzzle to be solved, rather than a frustrating journey of banging your head against a wall, in which no questions are answered. There are touches of humour that lighten the heavy mood, but it is perhaps the scenes that are not supposed to be funny, such as some of the violent assaults by the detectives, that become the most comedic due to their slapstick tendencies. Another well trodden theme is that it is the ordinary person that commits the most extraordinary acts of violence. Park is sure that the killer must be a pubic hair shaving psychopath rather than, as the audience will have already guessed, an average person. Parks realisation of this is handled competently in the films haunting closing scene. Twenty years after the murders Park has changed careers and is now a salesman that happens to pass by the first crime scene of the murders. Whilst he is there a young school girl comments that another man had been their recently and spoke of how he had done something at that location long ago and wanted to remember it. When Park presses for a description she replies "ordinary", which is the moment of enlightenment for this character, who then stares, not at the camera lens, but into the audience, where the killer may well be sitting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Korean films are coarse and over-realistic. This film is not an exception either. This is not the best Korean film by any means. This is only a well-made crime drama... not a penny less not a penny more.I watched a Korean sci-fi thriller comic movie (unfortunately can't remember its English title) earlier this year. It was the best sci-fi thriller ever.</fullReview>
