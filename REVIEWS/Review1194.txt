		<shortDescription>Fierce, bold, and beautiful - "The Last of the Mohicans"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last of the Mohicans" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of 1992. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures of everyone involved.This movie has a bit of everything, including action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and does all but completely discard James Fenimore Cooper's source material, which some have dubbed as being racist and totally unfair in its portrait of Native Americans.The story (and what a story) is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters - Cora and Alice Munro (Madeleine Stowe and Jodhi May respectively) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children.This is by far Mann's best film yet (it ranks #15 on my all-time favorite movies list) and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious.This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy, complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during this hectic time period.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Last Of The Mohicans This is turning out to be one of my most favourite romantic epics of all time. I know most people do not see this as romantic as it is a classic battle movie. As a matter of fact, seeing the trailer and the posters left me with the impression that this is indeed a war movie, what with the battle scenes and all; something along the lines of `Braveheart'. But upon seeing the movie, I was awed by the unexpected change in genre. The movie is a masterpiece, and all the actors and actresses certainly do amazing jobs. Daniel Day Lewis is simply amazing as Hawkeye. Though I usually try to read some of the more interesting books based on which movies are made, I haven't read the book in this case. But I sincerely doubt whether the book can be as good. Plus, I am told that the movie and the book have little in common. Madeline Stowe is stunning as Cora Munro, and Jodhi May was certainly impressive as the frail dependent younger sister. Nathaniel, or ?Hawkeye', is the adopted son of Chingachgook, played by Russell Means, whose real and lone son Uncas contributes to the team's claim of being the last of the Mohican clan. The British recruitment of Militia from its colonies during a time of war against France brings about a certain unrest. And it is further deepened by the character of Magua, who is a Huron warrior bent on a personal vendetta against British Colonel Munro, and his family. Magua is bent on the utter destruction of Colonel Munro and his two daughters, hence ?wiping his seed from the earth'. Chingachgook and his two sons become entwined in between all this. To top that, Nathaniel falls in love with Cora and their love story takes the show from there. It is sensually and emotionally stimulating, and we as the audience feels engulfed in the mastery. The love story I liked better was the one played in the background, an story that is absent, yet strongly felt throughout the movie. I am referring to the love story between Eric Schweig's character, Uncas and Alice Munro, played by Jodhi May. It is the subtleness and the overtone-nature of the love that builds in us a sense of involvement. To the best of my memory, they never spoke a word to each other, but the passion is strongly felt. And the climax really takes us to another level of appreciation. Wes Studi is probably the fiercest villain I have seen on screen. His mere presence builds an acute level of intimidation. The character portrayal is flawless, and the casting done is excellent. I do not believe that anybody?, anybody at all, could have replaced Wes in this movie. The fierceness, the anger, the viciousness, the? the everything required to build up the character? He has done all that. Probably his best performance yet. The music is sort of unconventional. Usually, the pace of the music is in sync with the pace of the action on screen. But in this case, the same slow music floods the scenes whether the pace on-screen is fast or slow. If I had heard somebody else say that, I certainly would have thought that it would not be effective. But amazingly, this unconventional approach works. And how! The music is probably the most addictive feature about the movie. After the first time I saw it, the music lingered in my mind for a month. All my waking moments, my mind was echoing that brilliant piece of work. I am a very very huge fan of Hans Zimmer, but I doubt if even he could have done a better job. I have seen the movie eight times to date. And I will definitely see it again. The climactic scene is so moving that I have lost count how many times I've seen that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Adventure Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of those movies I didn't expect that much when I first saw it so I was pleasantly surprised. Since then, it has skyrocketed to nearly the top on my list of all-time favorite films. I can't think of too many other adventure films that are better. Just a great, great movie.It boasts an interesting story filled with intense characters, beautiful scenery, a fantastic score, good action and a nice romance. So....there is a lot to like about this Michael Mann-directed film.The action scenes are quite realistic, and border on being almost too prevalent, to be fair. However, even if it may be a little too intense or frequent, the action is always interesting and varied, from all-out assaults to individual battles.The story takes place in Eastern New York State but, in reality, was filmed in beautiful Smokey Mountain areas in Asheville, N.C. This movie looks spectacular and with an epic, sweeping soundtrack is quite a feast for the eyes and ears.The eye candy includes a handsome leading couple: Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeline Stowe. Wes Studi is mesmerizing as the "bad guy." If you liked him in "Geronimo: An American Legend," you'll like his work here.If you are fairly young and only know Michael Mann through his crime movies like "Heat" or "Collateral," please check this earlier film out. It could be Mann's best, which is saying a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will make you forget that wimpy TV Hawkeye.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Policier specialist Michael Mann steps way off his usual beaten path with this adaptation of that hoary old James Fenimore Cooper tale of frontiersmen, Indians, Redcoats and the French -- the latter back when they knew how to fight.Chameleonic actor Daniel Day Lewis is totally convincing as Hawkeye, tracker, warrior, and adopted white son of Chingagchook, last of the Mohicans tribe. Along with adoptive brother, Uncas, the three are swept into the French and Indian war of 1757, treading lightly between the antagonists: French and Hurons on one side, British and colonials on the other, each faction potentially treacherous and deadly.Mann doesn't waste time on exposition or character development; he just hurls us into the fast-paced, brutal action and the effect is like snagging the tail of a galloping racehorse and trying to hang on to the finish line. Madeline Stowe and Jodhi May, as sisters of the British major Munro, provide love interest for Hawkeye and Uncas, respectively. Steven Waddington is another Redcoat officer infatuated with Stowe, and he too shines as a 'bad guy' who's more complex than he at first seems. But the movie's almost stolen by Wes Studi as Magua, a Huron warrior who's allied himself with the French solely as a means to avenge himself on the white man. He's as mesmerizing and lethal as a cobra.Technical qualities are exemplary, with special mention to the magnificent scenery of old-growth forestlands and mountains in North Carolina, and a superb score by Trevor Jones, with an assist by Randy Edelman.Mann might not be the first guy you'd think of to stage an 18th-century period action/adventure/romance. But after seeing what he does here, no one can fail to be impressed by his range and bravura. This is a must-own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked masterpiece bucked trends of the time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It used to baffle me why this film hasn't been held in greater esteem. I was blown away by this film when I first saw it, and knew quite a few people who snuck back to the theater several times for more. The beautiful and harsh scenery, dreamlike photography, sudden explosions of bloody violence, and raging, over-the-top passion amid a collapsing world create a pure emotional rush. This is melodrama at its best, which means that it can really stir your emotions if you let it.After reading a recent review of Ron Howard's "The Missing" by Steve Sailer (Washington Times) I think I know why "Last of the Mohicans" was overlooked. No matter how good this film was, it bucked the dominant trend in pop-culture perceptions of Native Americans at the time - a trend, according to Sailer, that might be reversing. Here's a historical breakdown of trends in similar films:1. 1950-1970 - Native Americans are one-dimensional, easily killed, comic-book villians. No religious elements appear. There are only a few exceptions to this rule (e.g. John Ford's "The Searchers").2. 1970s - Native American violence becomes brutal and real - but we also get rising sensitivity to Native Anericans without much sappy-ness. To quote Sailer:"'The Missing' resembles 'Ulzana's Raid,' the 1972 Burt Lancaster film that was one of several brutal but realistic films (such as 1970's 'A Man Called Horse') made during a brief period of balance in the depiction of Native Americans, falling between the earlier era's anti-Indian prejudice and the present day's happy-clappy New Age nonsense."In other words, if "Last of the Mohicans" had been released in 1970 it might have been hailed as "progressive."3. 1980s and 1990s - Religious/spiritual interpretations of Native Americans become dominant but are just as comic-book as the old 1950s violence. Native Americans are cute New Age "Dances With Wolves" icons that sit around and act wise. "Native American" becames an always-good point of reference in the Culture Wars. Classic example from South Park: an old hippie screams in front of a new Starbuck's"...how many Native Americans did you slaughter to make that coffee shop?"Michael Mann's "The Last of the Mohicans" (1992) clearly ran counter to the 1990s trend - it was trashed by critics at the time but I've always felt it was a much better film than it is given credit for, even a classic. But it bucks the New Age image of Native Americans so popular in 1992. For example, the old chief at the end uses his spiritual authority to make a brutal, violent decision for death so that justice is served. The Native American father Chingagchook kills the revenge and power-mad Magua without pity. And as for Magua's own behavior...nobody on either side is asking "...can't we all just get along?"In other words, Mann picked the exact wrong time to make this film. In the 1970s it might have been properly recognized, but by 1992 it was out of step with the touchy-feely image of Native Americans. Coupled with its obvious melodrama and action-film hype, the film became too much of a "guilty pleasure" to win praise (but don't let that stop you now).Movies are changing again, and that might be a good reason to go out and rent "Last of the Mohicans." According to Sailer, "the dark side of Native American spiritualism" is now being seen in "Missing". Like "Mohicans", Howard's new film loses the New Age stuff for a dreamlike action/horror state. The scenes below have their obvious parallels in "Mohicans":Blanchett finds her boyfriend's charred corpse strung up over a campfire where the Indians slowly roasted him to death. Later, when a photographer snaps the Apache leader's picture, the shaman gets his soul back by tearing out the man's heart.The other problem with "Mohicans" was that it is too "manly." There's a very strong female lead, but the men are also real, lusty, nasty men. By including this brand of passion, "Mohicans" conflicted directly with the "girl power" pop culture trend of the mid-1990s. Admitting you liked the film made you anti-woman as well as anti Native American.In this light, consider Sailer's comments on "Missing" - they apply equally to "Mohicans:""Still, I have to admire Howard for ignoring the bogus and condescending fantasies about American Indian culture rampant in our society today. Native Americans have suffered enough without having the memory of their warriors emasculated by self-absorbed eco-feminists into sappy symbols. Geronimo was a cruel man, but he was every inch a man."We may be on the edge of a revival of films which are capable of mixing Native Americans, violence, and romance in a good way. If so, the underappreciated "Last of the Mohicans" is a place to start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Restoration of Dignity to Native Americans, Long Overdue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Fenimore Cooper's trusty old nineteenth century novel 'The Last of the Mohicans' has provided a surprisingly sound springboard for a film that tries and succeeds in restoring a profound respect for the Native Americans. Yes, it is a story about the Indians and their culture desecrated by the arrival of European entrepreneurs and colonists all relating to Hawkeye/Nathaniel Poe (Daniel Day-Lewis), who as a child was taken by the Mohawk tribe and raised by wise Chingachgook (Russell Means) with the graceful skills and philosophy of the Native Americans. And it is through his eyes that we are brought into the universe through the eyes of the Indians.The story is well known and needn't be elaborated once again. Suffice it say that Hawkeye becomes the scout who leads British family Munro including Colonel (Maurice Roëves) and his daughters Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May) into upstate New York and along the way find altercations with the French and with the Huron Indians, especially one Magua (Wes Studi) whose loathing for Munro's devastation of his village drives him to vengeance against the entire Munro family. Hawkeye and his ally Uncas (Eric Schweig) protect their lieges while steadfastly holding to the honor of their heritage. And of course during the harrowing events Hawkeye and Cora fall in love and Hawkeye takes great risks against his own life to ultimately defend Cora and her family.Yes, there are many battle scenes, great reenactment of the scenery of the novel, and villains in all camps that provide the stormy progress of the novel. But it is in the quiet moments where Chingachgook speaks about the Great Spirit, the sanctity of nature, and his waiting to join the Great Council in the sky as the last of the Mohicans that the film's power is best communicated. The acting is very fine and the cinematography is splendid. This is a film worth seeing, one whose 117 minutes fly by leaving the viewer with a renewed respect for Native American philosophy.

		<shortDescription>Action, Romance, and Intrigue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last of the Mohicans is a timeless tale of the 18th century frontier and the virtue and tragedy that results when the uniquely different cultures of the French, English, Native Americans, and colonists collide. Based on James Fenimore Cooper's literary genius, The Last of the Mohicans transports the viewer back to a time of America's youth in a brilliant, mesmerizing fashion.The story centers on an eclectic band of travelers, thrust together by fate and their attempt to escape danger and reach the besieged British fort, William-Henry. Deep within the western forests of colonial New York, Hawkeye, the white, adopted son and brother of the Mohicans, tries desperately to avoid an ever-increasing war. He is forced to act when, along with his Mohican father and brother, he encounters two endangered sisters trying to reach their father, a British colonel in command at the fort. Hawkeye, the rustic tracker, and Cora, the refined, eldest daughter, are naturally drawn together (much to the dismay of Major Heyward, an intriguing character who also vies for Cora's affections). Tensions and passions arise between the characters as a whirlwind of conflict and violence rages around them. In the end, each character must face heart-wrenching decisions that will affect their very lives, and the lives of those around them.I especially love the way that the film depicts the perspectives of each of the groups involved. Whether the group is competing for military superiority or simple existence in their homeland, the viewer is given a true sense of their mindset in the midst of a great conflict. It is difficult to say one side or the other is completely to blame for the events that take place. Even the story's main antagonist, Magua (wonderfully portrayed by Wes Studi, Dances with Wolves) draws in a fair amount of empathy.The Last of the Mohicans is a marvelous, visual adventure that thoroughly reveals the horrors of warfare, the wildness of a chaste frontier, and the fated and ill-fated romances of the characters involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure cinematic excitement...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year is 1757... The principal occupants of the region are Native Americans and a great diversity of wild life... It is the third year of the war between French and British, for the possession of the continent, somewhere on the frontier west of the Hudson River... The Mohicans are allied with the British while their old enemies the Hurons side with the French... There, three men roam the forest making their living as frontier trappers and scouts... The first is Hawkeye, a superb frontiersman raised by the Mohawk, who can reload and fire a flintlock at full run; the second is his adopted father Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans, and the third, his brother Uncas, 'a warrior swift and straight as an arrow shot in the sun.'This trio seems have nothing to do with the early Colonial wars, until they come upon the vengeful Magwa and his Huron war party as they attempt to slaughter the Munro sisters, Cora and Alice, heading with a small regiment of redcoats to meet up with their father, Colonel Munro, at Fort William Henry...Eventually, the compassionate Mohican family comes to the rescue with a spectacular style of fighting... The film takes full advantage of their graphic capabilities with incredibly fast and fluid fighting action and mind-blowing attack moves... Shortly thereafter, two love stories take place... The three men lead the survivors to the English fort besieged by French forces and their Huron allies... The siege is a grand affair of roaring nighttime cannon and mortar attacks...Michael Mann's historical romance film gives a realistic picture of the frontier life, and a vivid impression of the horrors of warfare in the wilderness at the time where the combatants often had time for one shot before being overpowered and reduced to hand-to-hand fierce combat... The movie is filled with scenes of incredible, brutal violence... It's warfare at a primal level... Academy Award Winner Daniel Day Lewis also known as "The long rifle" is splendid as Hawkeye, the legendary warrior who encourages the Colonial militia to desert... He agrees to surrender in exchange for the life of two sisters and one British officer... He vows romantically to Cora that he will find her no matter how long it takes, no matter how far...Madeleine Stowe manages to find in Cora's fiery character a balance between sensitivity and strength... War and tragedy swirl around her as she struggles to protect her man... Cora's attraction grows for the soft-spoken warrior, who shows marked differences when compared to Major Heyward...Jodhi May is the blonde Alice, Cora's younger timid sister... By that long shot of her innocent face - a portrait of extreme torment and despair - we are all aware of her sufferings... We sense more pain than she can cope with... May has almost no lines, but her eyes, brimming with tears, are saying everything... No matter how much she wants to remain standing, she was retreating further and further from the ugly face of Magua... Her heart was crying out in anger... We all know that she will do anything than surrender... Her breakdown turns the scene into a willpower for revenge..Russell Means is powerful as the Mohican elder Chingachgook... His running battle along that majestic ridge is some of the finest film-making we've seen in terms of action and intensity... There is no dialog in these moments but the scene leaves us certainly breathless.. Wes Studi is Magua, the infamous Huron Indian who always speaks of himself in the third person... He is fluent in English, French, and Huron... Magua is a strong, vibrant villain consumed with hatred... Magua plots the massacre of the retreating troops, their women and children... Eric Schweig is Hawkeye's gentle and valiant brother Uncas... His quiet tenderness for Alice adds emotional weight to what could be passionate and unique... He asserts his mythic stature in a battle on a mountain top with Magua, not only to determine the winner in a struggle between good and evil, but also to decide the destiny of a race...Steven Waddington is the last survivor of a troop of English soldiers caught by France's Indian allies... He is a jealous and snobbish officer who wants the radiant Cora at any price... Heyward brings some realistic touches of duality, showing his courage with one life-saving act...Maurice Roëves seems impotent as Munroe... His blindness to the realities of "honor" brings destruction... Patrice Chéreau is the French General Montcalm who gives Magua the go ahead to attack Munro's retreating army... He begs Munrow not to sign the death warrant of so many, and promises safe passage for the English so long as they return to England and fight no more on the continent...The real inspiration of 'The Last of the Mohicans' is the extraordinary action sequences, the intensity of its music, and the exotic romanticism of such 1930's adventures as 'Charge of the Light Brigade', 'Gunga Din', and 'The Lives of a Bengal Lancer', where unshaken heroes never hesitate in the face of savage adversaries...Michael Mann's camera exploits the beauty of the North Carolina mysterious Smoky Mountains, its verdant forests, and its white-water rapids and waterfalls... The opening shot of the fog misting through the Smokies are enough to take your breath away...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate early Western romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, for reasons that are not completely obvious to me, struck a chord. It was in part the amazing location shots, partly the characters, partly the music and the action sequences. As for the (relatively) under-developed romance between the hero and heroine - all I can say is that the line that Hawkeye delivers when Cora Munro challenges this rough colonial who has the temerity to gaze upon her (a colonel's daughter) and says (essentially): 'Who are you looking at?' Hawkeye answers: 'You, Ma'am. I'm looking at you.' Priceless.Interestingly, archeologists have recently excavated the site of Fort William Henry and discovered many interesting things, none of which contradict the events described by Fenimore Cooper. The attack on the defeated column in the woods also appears to be historically accurate.This film, though imperfect, ranks with me as one of the best action movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most amazing element of this film at IMDb.com is the overwhelming international location from viewer comment response, which means on a human level, this film really hits home, and Michael Mann was obviously swinging for the fences. It is the second widely acclaimed film released--not counting musicals, of course--where the score is as important as the actors, cinematic photography, characters or the story (2001: A Space Odyssey is the first). Set in the West of its historical time period (Hawkeye's isolationist view was that his dad, his bro and he were heading to "kan-tucky" to escape the encroaching modern civilization since you couldn't get any bare bones farther west than that in the human knowledge of the day), this is the first real chase story in literature and Mann makes it so on screen, it starts with them running and finishes with them running; everyone is pursuing something, and few reach their destination without death and violence interrupting their personal chase. The photography belongs in a museum, the music is a symphonic magnet, the acting and sparsely spoken words fit like little pieces of a jigsaw puzzle to create an immaculately magnificent picture. This is right up there with Kubrich's Barry Lyndon as the best film ever photographed for popular release. A solid -10- Must See ...if you watch this, Dances With Wolves, then The Unforgiven and The Wild Bunch, you will have seen a staggering panoramic view of western genre that covers the entire period. As a trivial sidelight, Russell Means(as Chingachkook), who is a true American Indian, and was at the last battle with FBI and government agents at Wounded Knee, once was hired in Ohio during the Bicentennial Celebration, along with Native American buddies of his, to play Indians greeting the Mayflower crew as they landed. As the ship drew close they shot arrows at the landing party and refused to let them ashore (now THAT'S a true revolutionary with the courage and the intelligence to make a point with some great humor--although the folks that hired him in Cleveland weren't laughing much then) so its only appropriate that the moving and eloquent closing speech along the North Carolina skyline at sunset is his.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the period piece of this movie as I'm a big fan of our history. The facts were accurate for the most part except for one glaring scene. When Montcalm approaches Magua, after Fort Henry falls, he is obviously playing to his sympathies about the British not keeping to their terms of the surrender. Montcalm, knowing of Magua's lust for revenge, knows that he will then attack the defeated inhabitants as they leave the fort.That scene is sheer poetic license, as the facts bear out that Montcalm had assurances from the Indian chiefs after that battle that they would refrain from attacking the departing party in exchange for all the forts plunder. In fact, it was Montcalm who finally put a stop to the actual massacre once he was informed of it. No, I'm not French, but all books and letters, show Montcalm as a man of highest honor and a champion against greed and corruption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The whole world's on fire, isn't it?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My all time favorite film. Still gives me chills. It's easily one of the most amazing films I've ever seen and it also features perhaps one of the greatest soundtracks ever. They way, the music hits the scenes is just absolutely astonishing.In essence, The Last of the Mohicans is an epic adventure/romance set against the panorama of a frontier wilderness ravaged by the French and Indian War.Director Michael Mann brilliantly captures the essence of the era ( 1750's)-the hand-to hand battles, the scalping's, the harsh life in the wilderness, etc. But, I especially love the way that the film depicts the perspectives of each of the groups and the people involved. Whether they are competing for military superiority, referring to the French General Montcalm ( Patrice Chéreau ) and the British Colonel Munro (Maurice Roëves) or the simple existence of peoples in their homeland, the viewer is given a true sense of their mindset in the midst of a great conflict.Even the story's main antagonist, Magua (wonderfully portrayed by Wes Studi) draws us in.The always amazing Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Hawkeye, rugged frontiersman and adopted son of the Mohicans. Day-Lewis, with flowing mane and heaving pecs, makes a virile but sensitive hero for the screen and Madeline Stowe is Cora Munro, aristocratic daughter of the proud British Colonel Munro. Stowe manages to find in Cora a fiery balance between sensitivity and strength. One can't help but feel fascinated and/ or captivated by her dark eyes and flowing dark hair.Generally, the film tells the story of Hawkeye and Cora Munro, two people who meet across cultural and class barriers, and are presented serious new challenges.But the film has so more. For example, the contrasts between the two brothers ( Hawkeye and Uncas) and the two sisters ( Cora and Alice). Hawkeye being the more daring and outspoken from the start. He dares to approach the dark haired Cora when he was drawn to her, where as Uncas (Eric Schweig) never openly reveals his attraction to Alice ( Jodhi May). Besides, those short simple looks and glances.But then again, do we really need lines? No. Both Schweig and May have very few lines, but it is their eyes, that are saying everything... Case in point, that sequence in the cave, where Uncas pulls Alice back from the falls and holds her.All in all, I have to honestly say that the last 40 or 50 minutes or so of this movie, are just completely off the hook. I'd wager it might start along the lines of hearing that huge Huron war party cry as the British Army retreats from Ft. William Henry. This leads to Hawkeye vow to rescue Cora no matter what in the scene that takes place behind the waterfall. This is a scene that has been copied and mimicked by many others ( notably Tom Cruise in M1-2) but the way Day-Lewis delivers the line "You stay alive, no matter what occurs! I will find you. No matter how long it takes, no matter how far, I will find you" simply makes you believe him.Another amazing sequence would be when our heroes are running up the hill to save Cora, Alice, and the British Maj. Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) after they've been captured. For whatever, reason the Directors Expanded DVD emits the haunting Clannad song, "I Will Find You". Why this isn't heard during the scene is beyond me.I've watched this film way too many times now, but easily it is the last 15 minutes that are the most powerful and emotionally devastating. For instance, just watch the way the sequence of music starts with Duncan shouting "take her and get out", you know that something serious is going to happen and Duncan is doomed......Or the scene of Uncas's and then Alice's shocking deaths. I've always viewed the later scene as the first time Alice takes control of her own destiny and chooses not to be a victim. She finally snaps out of her shock-induced haze and takes action. Her choice of suicide is made from a place of strength.But it is also the more quiet of moments that simply resonate. For instance, when Chingachgook ( Russell Means) speaks about being the Last of his tribe.A film that truly resonates. No matter the age or the mood.</fullReview>

Day-Lewis gives a powerful performance whose only fault is that he has done better. Copper's sprawling story comes to life with powerful action scenes and emotional close-ups.

		<shortDescription>Uninvolving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cooper novel about the French and Indian War in colonial America becomes a screen spectacle. It seems to have all the elements for a great film (based on a classic novel, grand adventure, majestic setting, heroic characters), but the whole is lesser than the parts, as this adaptation is lacking in narrative flow. The story is uninvolving and the characters are uninteresting. The violence is gratuitous and repulsive, including an overdone finale. Day-Lewis (suppressing his British accent) and Stowe (sporting a British accent) make an attractive couple, but the dialog is so inept that the romance comes across as shallow. The score is beautiful but is overused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of only a very few films that I cannot stop watching once I start. As others have stated, the music, the scenery totally engage you from the beginning. The love story was not in the original Cooper story but in this case, certainly improves it.Recently, my husband and myself and two other couples, all strangers to each other, at a dinner while on vacation in Hawaii started talking about films. I mentioned that the review we were seeing, South Pacific, that the story in the musical did not stand the test of time. However, the Godfather does and The Last of the Mohicans is one movie I cannot tear myself away from. All the others stated that they felt the same and all of us own the DVD and the CD.It is amazing to me that this film was deemed not Oscar worthy, but what other films made in 1992 can you remember?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a must see, and despite what some people say about the directing style being 'offensive', I couldn't disagree more. First of all, I truly appreciated the more balanced portrayal of the native American tribes. Previous films often displayed the tribes as bumbling savages with no moral sense and the 'white man' always taking the moral high ground. Michael Mann showed the equal amount of savagery that men from all walks of life are capable of and the universal lack of compassion often abundant in times of war.The directing style is rich and Mann knows how to affect the audience's mood with his use of perspectives. The acting and music was superb. My only issue with the whole film was the limited shots of Uncas, whom I thought was just as interesting a character as Hawkeye!9 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I saw the movie and got excited by the beautiful backdrop scenery. Then I found out that the two main historical events depicted, the siege and fall of Fort William Henry and the subsequent massacre, actually happened. So I saw the movie again. Then I read the book. Then I read a good book about the French and Indian War.This is an instance where the movie deviates from the book and is the better for it. Then I'm pleased with the fact that history wasn't tampered with, at least not too much. Historians aren't sure how the Fort William Henry massacre was triggered or how complete it was; it IS documented that the massacre actually happened. I find no historical record of Colonel Munro conducting any campaign of lodge-burning against the Huron; but then again it IS documented that Munro did not have any daughters. Those characters are in the book as well as the movie. Cooper invented them himself. The idea of Huron war parties raiding on the frontier doesn't pop up in the book or the historical record, but it's perfectly plausible; the native Americans fought that way all through the Coloinal period. The savagery of Native American warfare is depicted fairly accurately; all accounts I have confirm that. The concept of taking captives is depicted accurately too, for the reasons described.Being of the bent that I am, I find the dual love stories involving (1) the Cora Munro-Hawkeye-Major Heywood triangle and (2) the Uncas-Alice Munro relationship all well and good; they were done well enough. I was more fascinated by the historical backdrop and the very nice North Carolina scenery, which is supposed to mimic the Adirondacks, where the story is set. For those with time on their hands and money to spend, both Fort William Henry and Fort Carillon (better known as Fort Ticonderog) exist; they have been fully restored and are now historical museums. I visited Fort Ticonderoga when I was 12 years old, and found it fascinating. Now that I've seen this movie I want to go out that way again, start at Fort William and Henry and work my way North to Crown Point, learning all I can on the way.What I really recommend is to see the movie once, enjoying the scenery and the love stories, as well as the action. Then read "The French and Indian War: Deciding the Fate of North America" by Walter R. Borneman. Then see the movie again, from a different perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe I have waited so long to watch this move... granted it was made two years after I was born, but regardless I wish I had seen it long ago! I don't think there are enough adjectives to describe this movie or the effect it has had on me. Incredible. Soul-stirring. Heart-rendering. Amazingly hopeful. Gloriously Sad. It has two of the greatest love stories ever seen on screen- both yearning, smoldering and heart wrenching, and yet so different and subtle- I won't say more. The battle scenes are violent and brutal, but not gratuitously; realism is no issue here- you are transported to another world, and the actors have clearly thrown themselves into it as well. The period is meticulously and perfectly recreated in incredible detail. The scenery is almost as engaging as the action itself; and the score is so perfectly descriptive of the stunning visuals that your spirit actually soars with it. Sorry to be so corny but nothing else justifies it. The final 25 minutes are, in my opinion, the greatest 25 minutes ever filmed. Without spoiling it, let me just forewarn- get the tissues. I have watched this movie 6 times in the past 48 hours. Don't wait, get hooked now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An astonishingly realised and beautifully crafted modern epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans is often overlooked when lists of great movies are compiled but this is a film of such astonishing beauty and raw energy that it deserves to be reassessed. From the opening frame to the closing shots this modern epic satisfies on every level, resonating with heart and scale, drama and action. It is a film of haunting beauty and profound feeling with a pace that is unequalled in the genre. It positively oozes charisma.The cast disappear into their roles, and for a period film that is now over 15 years old there isn't the slightest hint of it dating. There is nothing superfluous here but nothing is left wanting either. This is a credit to the skill of the entire crew. Everything works - the locations, sets, costumes, editing, sound, music, tone, writing, direction, performances, everything. Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe generate chemistry with rich but scant material, while the other main players give such refined performances that the viewer is simply swept along. And this film is sweeping in every sense. Whatever the accuracy in comparison with the original text, this film becomes a text in its own right and is so delicately crafted and magnificently edited that the final scenes play with virtually no dialogue, and powerfully so. This has a lot to do with the stunning score - the last ten minutes demonstrating all aspects of cinema operating on the highest level - as it reinforces the primal beat and rhythm of the piece while still maintaining a colonial heart and hauntingly epic sweep.The Last of the Mohicans is a thrilling, fierce adventure tempered with attention to historical detail, heightened yet not melodramatic emotion and a sympathetic yet seethingly tense depiction of the time. An adventure epic with a lot of soul and heart. It's time for Mann to return to the epic genre and demonstrate once again what he can do as evidenced by this overlooked classic. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

It is a bit graphic, what with Colonel Munro's death, but the acting is superb, the locations are beautiful, and the music is absolutely amazing. This is the kind of movie that can change my mood for days because of it's 'real' qualities. It's not a perfect little fairy tale where everyone lives happily ever after. In fact, not everyone lives! Granted, I was a little upset about Uncas' death, since he was my favorite character, but it's still a marvelous piece of film-making. Magua, the antagonist, is someone that is extremely fun to hate. Hawkeye, Uncas, and Chingachgook all maintain qualities of good people, as well as having traits that contribute to their realistic personalities. Many of these characters are dynamic and not all of them change in a way that I would view as 'good'. The characters have the qualities of real people, which adds to this movie's depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-indulgent and underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I missed my supper, spent two hours travelling in hot weather, and paid good money to see this film on the big screen; and I was disappointed at the result, to put it mildly. If I'd seen it on TV, I'd have written it off as a bad recommendation, but as it was I found myself resenting the waste of an entire evening on a film that both confused me and failed to hold my interest -- quite an achievement for an epic as bloody as this.The film left me emotionally unengaged apart from the last fifteen minutes or so, when it finally seemed to zoom in on the individual characters rather than getting lost in misty landscapes, massacre after massacre after slaughter, and poor oppressed Americans under the heel of faithless, cowardly Brits. (And then, I'm afraid, it lost me again in its final scene, a weepy New Age set-piece that seems to ignore the vast number of previous deaths in the film.) I thought I knew the story, but didn't recognise many scenes here until the final sequence; due to a paucity of dialogue I was often left at a loss as to what exactly was happening or had just taken place. The siege of the fort is a case in point -- until the Mohicans arrive and disclose that the confused inside-and-out montage we have just been shown represents French forces sapping parallels towards the English-held fort to bring the walls under direct fire, I honestly had very little idea of what I was watching... and if I hadn't happened to enjoy an extensive working knowledge of 18th-century siege warfare, I wonder how much wiser I'd have been after this explanation! Language-wise, there doesn't seem to be a great deal of rationale in the intermittent use of subtitles. Characters still adopt the cinematic custom of speaking English with heavy foreign accents even at moments when this is clearly inappropriate save for purposes of audience comprehension, e.g. Montcalm conversing with his allies in his own camp, Chingachgook's mourning speech for his people. Then at other moments we suddenly get launched into the ultra-realism of, for example, a three-way debate in English, French and Huron, with Duncan Heyward displaying hitherto unsuspected skills at UN-level simultaneous translation -- and it all comes across as a bit gratuitous.Romance doesn't seem to be the director's strong suit. The affair between Cora Munro and Hawkeye (referred to, confusingly, throughout as "Nathaniel" without any real elucidation) created for the purposes of the film is less than convincing, but the supposed love between Uncas and Alice is not so much subtle as non-existent: for all intents and purposes it's simply not there. How anyone who doesn't already know the story is supposed to interpret the sudden outburst of meaningful looks in the last scene, I'm not sure.To be honest, "Last of the Mohicans" is the sort of modern motion picture that reminds me why I prefer the older variety: bloody, sickening, short on dialogue and character (your average silent film does a far better job of conveying events clearly without words), long on scenery, and a sight keener on giving the impression of being 'meaningful' than on actually telling a story. The Mel-Gibson-style political anachronisms grate, too.Maybe I'd do better to stick to the films of an era in whose conventions I feel more at home -- I'll keep an eye out for the 1930s version! Meanwhile, despite some lush landscapes, I really can't recommend this to anyone who shares my tastes: it's amazing that any film with this much action can come across as tedious, but somehow it managed it...</fullReview>

Native Americans are portrayed here interestingly as both the ruthless savage and noble harmonious types. Shallow characters are wrapped around an improbable story entailing a thoroughly unconvincing love story, with some god-awful dialogue thrown in ("You must live! Whatever happens, I'll find you!"). The movie is interesting if you're a fan of the genre, but does not stand out as an exceptional piece of movie-making or storytelling.

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I genuinely mean that when I say that Last of the Mohicans is spellbinding and that there is a lot to admire from it.Firstly, Michael Mann's direction is brilliant. Mann is a more than competent director seen with the likes of Manhunter and Heat, and while everything you expect in a Michael Mann film is here(not a bad thing, quite the contrary) it is all done in a professional way.The story is a sprawling one, but again that is not a bad thing in itself. Because while it is sprawling in nature, it is also a compelling story lifted by its sweeping action sequences(notably the climax), the love story that is kept in the background but remains prominent and emphatic characters.The pace helps too, as while the film clocks in at just under two hours, Last of the Mohicans flies by with no scene feeling too rushed. I also appreciated that the quieter and more subtler moments, as seen with Russell Means' character, didn't drag.That's not all. The cinematography is splendid and the settings are stunning that gives the film its epic, sweeping feel. Trevor Jones' score is outstanding, and probably his best since The Dark Crystal.Last of the Mohicans has fine acting. Daniel Day-Lewis is a commanding lead, and Madeline Stowe is both alluring and convincing, likewise with Jodhi May. Russell Means is suitably composed, wise and well-meaning, but for me Wes Studi's marvellous and quite malevolent performance is the standout.All in all, a spellbinding film. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless classic 10/10 WARNING(This review contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thorougly enjoyed this film and it is most certainly my favorite. It is extremely well directed by Michael Mann and there is not one actress or actor in the film that, in my opinion, did not perform extremely well. The location of the settings were well chosen and extremely beautiful and the soundtrack was a haunting melody better than any other I have ever heard in a film. I enjoyed this even more than Braveheart (And I am not biased against Braveheart because I see it is a story, and not as anti-english propaganda like some). This film is a timeless classic filled with gut-wrenching action, a wonderful romance and on-the-edge battle scenes.I particularly admired the performance of Jodhi May (who was only 16 at the time of filming) as Alice Munro. Her perfomance was quite amazing, especially towards the end in the way that she said nothing, but the facial expressions were so real that one could just about believe that it was real and not just a story! This scene was the best of one of the best films I have ever seen and I have remembered it ever since. The music was an amazing haunting, celtic type during this scene and it fits perfectly when the beautiful Alice Munro falls to her death next to her lover. This has left me thinking about the character and her motives for doing this for some time and this entire film sticks in one's mind as a very good film should do. The perfomance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Cora was also gripping and excellent and Madeliene Stowe as Cora is one of the most beautiful actresses. My only gripe for Cora was that her English accent was a little now-you-see-it now-you-don't.I would give this film 11 out of 10 if it was possible. Read the book too- Although the film is quite different, James Fennimore Copper's classic is also a brilliant piece of work and I hope he would have been proud of this so excellent film. If films like Braveheart and Gladiator are you types of film, then watch this. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film has it all! EXCELLENT!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romance, action and hope. Emotion without sentiment. Love interest without explicit sex scenes. An excellent film and one of my absolute favorites. I had read all of James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking series as a kid and had seen the '36 version with Randolph Scott. But, this film got me from the git-go. I suppose reading those books, seeing that old film (it was old when I saw it as a kid, having been made and released a year before I was born) and reading everything else about Red Indians-- now appropriately called Native Americans-- I could get my hands on contributed to my becoming an anthropologist. But, in spite of Mark Twain's scathing critiques of the Leatherstocking series (I don't think Twain liked JF Cooper's face), they were exciting to me as a kid. And, this film was exciting to me as an adult. The story here only conforms to the skeleton of the original but the presentation is convincing and authentic. The performances of the Native American actors, the delightful Wes Studi, Russell Means, Eric Sweig and Dennis Banks are wonderful. Small parts are also seen with character actors Pete Postelthwaite and Colm Meany and the rival Duncan Heyward is given a pompous twist by Brit Actor, Steven Waddington. The Munro girls with Madeleine Stowe and Jodhi May are likewise delightful, with Stowe inserting a bit of early feminism into her role. May's fawn-like big eyes suggesting a delicate vulnerability lends itself well. The romantic interest with the handsome young Uncas is not as well developed as it was in the '36 version, but that's not a failing. All in all, this film has become one of my all time favorites. I've seen it at least 6 times and plan to see it at least that many times more-- this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning war picture with amazing performances from all of the hundreds of actors involved, The Last of the Mohicans is a near flawless presentation of war-life in the 1700s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last of the Mohicans is an epic portrayal of the conflicting interests of the French, the British, and the Native Americans in colonial America. The French and the Native Americans are allies, but the film throws in some completely unexpected and surprisingly effective plot twists toward the end, something that is relatively uncommon in period films. Mixed in with the adventurous atmosphere of war is a powerful romance that develops between Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe), who play two characters very unlikely to fall in love. Hawkeye was adopted by the Mohicans as an infant, and was raised by them for his entire life since then. Cora is the daughter of a British Colonel, and their romance is strikingly effective, and made even better by the settings. I think that the romance is especially notable here because usually, and especially in action or adventure films, whenever there is a significant romantic subplot, it usually seems to have been thrown in relatively clumsily and with the obvious objective of making the film appeal to a larger audience. However, in The Last of the Mohicans, the romance is so well developed and so well acted that this is clearly not the case. Every part of the story in this film, including the romantic subplot, fit together flawlessly, resulting in a top-notch historical action drama.Even better than the incredible performances and the fascinating story is the breathtaking cinematography and on-location settings. The film is literally packed full of amazing shots of the endless and stunningly beautiful colonial American countryside. This is one of the ways that the film is able to flawlessly bring the 1700s back to life with incredible reality. The film is beautifully shot by director Michael Mann, whose films seem to be getting better and better. Another thing that was done noticeably well in this film was the editing, particularly in the fast-paced and excellently executed battle scenes, which were brutal but rightfully so. I've always thought that the only excuse for excessive violence is if it's true, and this is the kind of thing that went on when this country was founded. The notable thing here is not how much violence there was, but how spectacular the presentation of history is, and in such a convincingly realistic way. (spoilers) The Last of the Mohicans is a look at a certain point in history as one point in a huge timeline. This is the revelation that makes the ending to the film one of the best endings in any film in years. The closing line, `Once, we were here,' is an acquiescent observation that no matter how hard they fight, the Mohicans will be gone someday, as will be the frontier itself, and a different people will someday inhabit the land. Such is the way that the world goes, things change, nothing lasts forever, but there are some who are willing to accept that and be proud of whatever mark they have made. THIS is how great films are made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dramatic, intense historical adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, in my opinion, began a long run of intense, violent, and passionate historical action-dramas throughout the 90s. Braveheart, Rob Roy, Gladiator, and The Patriot all followed in its footsteps.This is the ageless tale of a brutal struggle in an unforgiving and, to Europeans, unfamiliar land. There are clearly two sides in this struggle, but neither one has truly likable characters. The endearing players here are forced to choose sides in the struggle, much as was the case in the America of the 18th century. They clearly have no great loyalty to their chosen side, and the main struggles here are without a doubt personal.I felt the acting here was excellent, with superb performances all around. I especially liked how a particularly arrogant and unlikable character, a British officer, in the end completely redeems himself with an unmitigated selfless act of great personal sacrifice.This was at the time unlike any movie I had seen before. It was fast paced with intense combat, passionate romance, and a compelling and exciting story. Even the many character interactions had a particular intensity to them even when the physical action had ceased.This will perhaps always remain one of my favorite films, and I cannot think of a single flaw, though there most certainly must be a few. Some have commented on the accuracy of the transfer from book to film. I cannot comment directly on this, as I have not read the book. But I can say that there is not a film in existence that will appeal to every fan of the book, nor is it realistic to assume that a literary work can ever be completely and accurately represented on the screen.It is therefore with an unbiased and honest heart that I give my highest regards to "Last of the Mohicans."</fullReview>

Unlike so many modern films, violence is used sparingly and with a purpose other than just to shock people. it brings out the harsh reality of the times, without having bloody scenes taking over the film.

		<fullReview>There is so may things about this film that will blow you away. The first thing you will notice is how wonderfully this film is shot, every single scene could be a painting, its so brilliant. The set pieces and costumes are mind-blowing in every detail. Several scenes could be considered classics but none compares to the love scene at the Fort Henry between Cora and Hawkeye. They are 2 very intense actors that made me forget i was watching a movie and they made me believe in the magic.The waterfall scene is one of the finest scenes I have ever witnessed, Hawkeye is standing with Cora and haunting violins resonate as he tells Cora to stay alive, that no matter what those nasty Hurons do he will come back for her. A scene of Cora and Hawk locked together while the waterfall rages beyond them is so beautiful.For villains you just want to see get ripped to pieces, actor Wes Studi brings to life the war Chief Magua, not many villains can hold a candle to this guys psychosis, he literally cuts a guys heart out and its as casual to him as ordering Chinese food.For action genre fans, the final mountain-ledge showdown will bring a tear to your eye as Magua and his braves break out the tomahawks and have a chop-a-thon with Hawkeye and his guys.Every actor in this film is a joy to watch but pay close attention to Jodi May who plays Cora's sister Alice. Her subtle performance as the woman who cannot cope and would rather make the ultimate sacrifice then be a slave to Magua, it is the performance of the movie.Bottom line, this film might be the best film ever made, sad it does not get the recognition it should, Mann's best film by far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But how wrong was i! I now consider this movie to be in my top 20 of all time. Maybe it was because i was 12 or 13 at the time and i never really understood it ( terminator and friday the 13th were more my style back then). The thing i like about this film is that it tells a more realistic tale of love and war then the likes of the patriot. There are no winners or heroes in the end just the destruction of innocent lives. Unlike the patriot and braveheart where we get this try hard "us against the world" mentality and "we're the underdogs and the battlers fighting against oppression" Last of the mohicans is about the plight of three totally different civilisations ( english, french and the natives) and their battles for the continent of America. One aspect of the movie i didn't like was the acting of Day Lewis. His heroic antics were a bit hard to put up with and very unrealistic given the situation, how many times did he show up just in time to avert disaster. That kind of acting belongs in the Mel Gibson inspired movies of braveheart and the patriot. His anti-British attitude is also very irritating. Best performances were from Stowe, May (although she didn't say much her acting towards the end of the movie is as good as you will see anywhere) and without a doubt Wes Studi as the brutal Magua was the best of them. I'm suprised this movie didn't recieve any major awards, there weren't many better than this one in 1992. I give it 8.5 out of ten.</fullReview>

Also, this movie has one of the most fast paced, heartbreaking, and just plain great endings in movie history. If you haven't seen this, you should go out right now and get it. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A novel view of Native Americans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has a lousy track record in its' portrait of Native Americans. The Last of the Mohicans is a refreshing change from the normal view of drunken savages, clownish buffoons, and the "noble red man". In this movie, the Native Americans are on an even footing with the white man. A good example is when they visit the settlers home and are treated as equals, without a trace of fear or condescension. Of course, the white man was still the minority in 18th century America.In most cases, they are portrayed as having better common sense and superior fighting ability. European soldiers just weren't trained for guerrilla warfare, as accurately depicted in this movie.Excellent setting, pace, and cinematography. Russell Means is very convincing as Chingachkook, and the weapon he carries is the most wicked I've ever seen in a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the few movies whose soundtrack gives you chills, whose ending makes you wonder, if anything remote was wrong with it? , every time you see it you never get bored. I just don't understand why it is so under rated.When non-realistic and hypothetical movies can be in the top 250 than why not such a great flick?!Madeleine Stowe,Daniel Day-Lewis,Russell Means they were all amazing. The action sequels, the war portrayal, the atmosphere shown and the amazing locations they were all perfect. I loved how each group's philosophy and interests where portrayed. I wont go into the story details because it might not the right highlighting it in text. You should see it yourself.Well, for me it is one of the best love stories I have ever seen.I would recommend everyone to see the movie one time and I can bet they would be captivated by it.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have firstly watched this movie in 1992 while ten more times have followed since. The same feelings appears every time. This is a film that combines, a perfect mix of adventure, action, drama and romance, equally balanced and I assure you, it will crab you from the early beginning and drive you to the end to a very beautiful journey of mixed feelings. The indescribably, unbelievably exquisite music is I may say the "salt and spices" of the Last of the Mohicans, being not just an escort to the film but truly manages to lift it into something unique. The astonishing slow motion scenes, a silent action amalgamate, full of love, pain, courage, desperation and revenge towards the end, will make you feel like holding a tomahawk, a carbine and... I stop here, see the movie! Michael Mann surely did a great joband I hope he will be able to create such a masterpiece again in the future. Danny -as always- at his best. I really believe that this film wouldn't be what it is today if Danny (as usual) wasn't a part of it. Stowe (playing Cora) delivers a fine performance of elegance, beauty and passion altogether. Even supporting cast like Eric Schweig (Uncas-son) or Russell Means (Chingachgook-father) seems to be carefully selected as they all seem to give their best, look and act real while they help to the development of their characters.This part (The character-development, which I never really understood why ONLY this should be every time the element that defines a good and a bad movies, but anyway...) is sufficiently deep in my personal opinion. Afterall I don't think that you will spend not even a second during and MAINLY after the movie to even think if this is correct or not, or if this scene would be appropriate and etc... Damn, I now realize how difficult is to express your own feelings about a masterpiece that you loved and make others who haven't seen it yet, to run, rent/buy and watch it! But this is what a perfect movie (for me at least!) should probably make you feel. Finally, I really can't understand why it's not on the top 250, as on the same moment you can see there movies like Ratatouille, Hot Fuzz, American Gangster and etc. With respect to these good movies, I just can't accept the absence of Last of the Mohican -at least- in the top 250 of all time. OK, maybe I'm not so inter-subjective, but I suggest those who haven't watched it until now, see it and then vote and put it where it belongs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most underrated movies of all time. I consider myself somewhat of a film-buff and this continues to be in my top-ten. The costumes, the music, the acting is wonderful and you have to give mad props to DDL for his portrayal of Hawkeye. Wes Studi is also great in it as the bloodthirsty Huron warrior Magua. I cannot understand why it did not win or be nominated for more awards. Its current rating of 7.6 is hilarious. 7.6 would tell me this movie is barely above average and I have seen plenty of average to above-average movies in my lifetime and this ain't one of them. I highly recommend it to adventure/romantic epic lovers, however if you do not like watching intense violence and some gore than maybe it's not your movie. POWERFUL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last of the Mohicans was one of the most surprising films I have seen in a long time, The reason for it being such a surprise is because it has never gotten the credit in which it deserves. Michael Mann the director, definately went through each and every step of the film and knew exactly what he wanted and he did this to perfection. Not only is the cinemetography absolutly amazing and quite possible one of the ten best looking films of all time, but the soundtrack and music backing up the pictures are absolutly amazing. I found myself getting into the music and in fact have gone to sleep many times to the soundtrack. On top of all of the wonderful music and scenary, the story and entertainment level of this movie is amazing. I love this movie and recomend it to any one who loves watching nearly perfect films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little is More on the Romance side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Last of the Mohicans' is a beautifully done film. The scenery is lovely, the music beautiful, and the actors well cast. Most of the script was very well written as well. There are a few cliche parts to it, but since the rest of the film is so good, you tend to let them go.The thing I liked most about this film? The romantic undertones between Uncas and Alice. It felt deeper and truer than the Hawkeye and Cora thing. There's something amazing and real about a romance as gentle and untouched as the one between Uncas and Alice. Wonderfully done. I really wish it had ended differently though. Tragedy is beautiful, but happiness is better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can one say about this "The Last of the Mohicans"? Only thing... Highly underestimated! I would rank it right amidst its rivals as Braveheart, Gladiator and the Patriot and I might even dare say, that some could perceive it to be fastly superiou to those other historical epics, due to the more credible story. Now you ask, what it is that makes this movie so great. I will tell you.For starters it has absolutely one of the best soundtracks ever, no doubt about it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, while experiencing the sense of drama and romance. All at once! And this is realized through the music only. In combination with the scenes all of your synapses are on overload. One minor point is, that the movie contains almost no other sound scores and one must settle for the soundtrack in mostly every scene.Next up is the scenery. Michael Mann KNOWS what a good setting for a movie is. But even more does he KNOW how to get it over to your tv screen. Every camerashot couldn't have been taken better and entices you completely.And that brings me to the action. The Last of the Mohicans portrays some of the best personal combat, comparable to a martial artists film, with actors seemingly to be as highly skilled as Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. And this might not be to everyones liking, but the movie often shows very realistic gory details, like broken bones showing through skin and weapons penetrating a body.Now I have reached the last reason for the greatness of this film and why it belongs amongst Gladiator and its kind. The viewer receives a massive dose of the entire scala of emotional triggers: romance, intrigue, action, drama and adventure. And above that, the story stays credible. Something Braveheart and consorts passed by. Because the main lead is of flesh and blood and isn't made into a superhuman hero that can defeat anything on his path it keep it's credibility!Though I would like to stop now, I need to deal with one final point. The acting/actors. Don't get me wrong the acting was of high class, only the two lead characters, who were to convert the main love story to my screen, Daniel Day Lewis as Hawkeye and Madeleine Stowe as Cora Munro, were disappointing. To me neither of them could bring the story to life, because they just weren't convincing in their part and couldn't reach me. Fortunately, Wes Studi made up for a great deal of Daniel's doing as his best performance EVER as Magua, Daniel's counterpart. The other main characters were just as good as Studi. I liked them so much I just have to name them: Jodhi May as Alice Munro, Steven Waddington as Heyward, Eric Schweig as Uncas and Russell Means as Chingachgook! I would have loved for all of them to have twice as much screen time as they did, at the cost of the two leads! But hey you can't have everything.Well I guess this is why it deserves to be amongst the other great epics. The music, the scenery, the action, the versatility and the acting are all of superb quality. You must be a fool not to watch this movie. And when you do, be sure to do so on a tv as large as possible and a superb soundsystem to bring out the full greatness of this classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cut above the other historical epics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> The Last of the Mohicans is by no means your mainstream box office smash. But released in a year of disappointing films, Alien 3, Far and Away, Patriot Games and Lethal Weapon 3 to name but four, it remains one of the most intellectually stimulating flicks of the early nineties. And if that sounds a little highbrow for you, then there is the added bonus that Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe are bursting with more sexual chemistry than a Viagra factory. James Fenimore Cooper's most famous novel has received at least 10 film and TV interpretations over the years but none have been as brutal and unforgettable as Michael Mann's blockbuster. Day-Lewis stars as the legendary frontiersman Hawkeye who rescues, and falls in love with a British officer's daughter during the Anglo-French war.  With some beautiful landscapes, meticulous period detail and a breathtaking score by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman, this is one of the most watchable adventures of the Nineties.  Stowe co-stars as Hawkeye's love interest, Cora Munroe, and delivers a near-perfect English accent amid the exploding cannons and gunfire. If you only catch a minute, make sure it's the scene where DDL assures his love interest that surrendering to the enemy may be the best chance of them being reunited in the long run. "No, you submit, do you hear? You be strong, you survive... You stay alive, no matter what occurs! I will find you. No matter how long it takes, no matter how far, I will find you."  If the hairs don't rise on the back of your neck, somebody check your pulse as you may be dead. In case you didn't know it, Mann is one of America's most acclaimed directors with movies such as Heat, The Insider and Manhunter doing little to dent his reputation. It took quite a while to secure the talents of his leading man for this movie but the determination paid off dividends.  Day-Lewis, as with all of his movie roles, went to extraordinary lengths to achieve a degree of credibility. He spends much of the film running around so had to be in tip top condition for the arduous shoot. He also became adept with knives and guns to give the illusion of a trapper who can more than take care of himself in the wild. So, a cracking tale well told then. However, as with The Fugitive a year later, there is the annoying cliche of our hero jumping into waterfall hundreds of feet from the plunge pool - and surviving. Divers in Acapulco may manage such a stunt but both Day Lewis and Harrison Ford stretch credibility to breaking point when they try it. The movie was released with a modest certificate, yet contains such gut-wrenching scenes of brutality that it's a wonder it didn't buck an 18 rating. But this being violence of the more literate kind, it was little wonder the British Board of Film Censors let much of the bloodshed go through untouched by the editor's scissors. If it does prove too graphic for you then feel free to turn the brightness down but leave the glorious soundtrack on. It remains a treat for the ears; rousing, lyrical and beats the Titanic score into a cocked hat: Little wonder TV companies have been using it for the last nine years while plugging historic dramas. Aside from the leads, Russell Means, Wes Studi, Maurice Roeves and Eric Schweig also give fine performances while Jodhi May is unforgettably haunting as Alice, the screen sister of Stowe. A drop-dead gorgeous film which is not for the squeamish but just oozes the sort of class most film-makers would die to recreate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three trappers protect a British Colonel's daughters in the midst of the French and Indian War.I must not have been paying attention or something while watching this film. I love Daniel Day-Lewis, and I think Michael Mann is certainly an above average director (if not top tier, at least within reach of it). But I really just found this film to be rather boring and without much to hold my interest.I also love historical films, and while I understand this is a fictional story, I appreciated the attempt to show the motivations of the British and British-Americans. I feel like the film needed more of that to really drive the context home.And I should be interested by Mohicans, since the last of the Mohicans (their descendants) live within an hour of me in Shawano, Wisconsin.

		<fullReview>This is my very favorite film! As much as I like Gladiator and Troy, they always seem so distant. Perhaps this being closer to our time and fought on our turf, just before we set off on our own as a nation - it speaks more to me. Only Mel Gibson and The Patriot come close to the excellence in cinema that tells of this time. Like a lot of guys, I am easily won over by big, epic, sweeping, romantic stories of war and heroism - I enjoy them immensely. This is the one I enjoy the most. I think in part it's because all of the tribes at war here, are presented in a favorable light. The French and the British, Mohawk and Huron, the settlers and colonists - you like all of them! There are bad guys too, but it's the Noble men that stand out. And there are noble men and the showing of honor throughout. I'm sure Mr. Cooper's great telling of a good story has a lot to do with it - the writers always do. But it's the movie we're talking about.It might just be my imagination, but it seems that Michael Mann always does something with the lighting. I think it goes all the way back to his Miami Vice days. It seems to affect the intimacy, or the way we view the people. But I could be wrong. His two best films are this one and Heat. With the greatest shootout anywhere being the one in Heat. Daniel Day Lewis wore the part of Hawkeye as though it had been tailor made. What an excellent performance. But then he's famous for the study he puts into his characters. There are some seemingly smart strong people in every group presented here, no one tribe has all the virtue. In that sense, they are equals - a rarity in storytelling and movie making. So much of history is crowded with the master and servant relationship that also ends up in much of our literature. And there is always an element of truth to that, but it's not the whole truth. Don't forget, it's the winners who always write the history. Seldom does a conquerer speak well of a vanquished foe. The character of Chingachgook, the older Mohawk and former chief, has got the coolest weapon in the form of a Mohawk throwing axe. It's so big it looks like a rifle when it's slung over his back, but it's not. This is not at all a Western, which occupies a unique time period in our history between the end of the Civil War and the early 1900's. One hundred years before there was ever a west to have cowboys in - there was the Frontier and frontiersmen. A completely different time, place and people - not related to the cowboy. This is their say, let them have it.It all takes place during the time that the British and French are fighting for control over the fur trade in the north all the way up into Canada, and the sugar trade all the way down south into the Caribbean. Sometimes wars are about the land, but many times they're about the money coming from the resources. This is one of those times, and the heat of the battle over this money is the French and Indian War - at least on land. Which covers the period of our story. You never hear that in movies or novels, but that is the history of it. When left to themselves, Cain will always kill Abel - over something. I leave it on that note as it ties in perfectly with the sense of remorse and longing we're left with from the story. But you'll have to watch this most excellent movie for yourself to see what any of that means. I don't think you'll be disappointed. It is a rich tale, a grand sweeping romantic action adventure epic, a satisfying movie, and a most beautiful one at that.</fullReview>

The book was a snore in high school "required reading", but made a fantastic film this time around. Infinitely better than earlier versions especially the pretty poor T.V. show of the 50's-60's! Certainly one of the best films and performances that leads Day-Lewis and Stowe have done to date. Their characters come from completely different worlds, yet they are convincingly drawn to one another and the sexual tension that develops is heady.Kudos to the director for keeping up the pace. Sometimes this kind of film will have an erratic mood or pace that spoils the feel of the drama.Lastly, Eric Schweig as Uncas is one of the sexiest men I've ever seen.</fullReview>

So much goes on from beginning to ending that it fills your heart with excitement, making you feel like if your heart is going to explode. My hat goes off to Daniel Day Lewis, whom's acting deserved every award possibly ever presented. Daniel Day Lewis was born to play this role. He is "perfect" in every aspect of the word. He's extremely handsome, ambitious, intelligent, talented, and did I say "gorgeous"!! As mentioned before, no other actor would have filled Nataniel Poe's shoes the way DDL did. As for Eric Schweig and Russell Means, they also did an excellent job playing Uncas and Chingachgook. The talents expressed by this actors and the rest of cast were beyond sensational. Congratulations to Daniel Day Lewis, Eric Schweig, Russell Means, Madeleine Stowe, Wes Studi, on a job well done. It's a shame that a second part was never made, maybe it's for the best since this movie ended up being a masterpiece. I applaud Michael Mann for making this movie. Although this movie was released over 14 years ago, it still captures my interest as if i'm watching it for the first time again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies that are centered around war often bring blood thirsty men to the box office craving carnage and amputations of all kinds. Well the blood thirsty man will get this when they watch this amazing picture, I know because I happen to be one of those blood thirsty savages, but there is another element that makes this movie so darn good. The romance seen between Hawkeye and Miss Munroe contains enough passion to ignite the forest where their love blooms a blaze. The romance seen in this movie is not the kind that women crave, and men make gagging sounds to, but it is the kind that makes women swoon and guys say, "This Hawkeye character, he's the man." This is clearly shown when viewers see Hawkeye vow to rescue Miss Munroe no matter what in the scene that takes place behind the waterfall. This movie deserves a much higher overall rating because it satisfies the male thirst for carnage, and the female thirst for love and romance, but at the same time men that watch this movie see that romance is not always as cheesy as it seems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a huge fan of this film since I first watched it when I was a child. Considering that it's been 11-12 years since it was released, it's remarkable that it above all stands out to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. I received the soundtrack as a gift for my 15th birthday and I had a much loved tape that I'd recorded off the TV that I wore down with watching it, and I am now the proud owner of the DVD (not the director's cut, I might add). To say the least, The Last of the Mohicans is my favorite movie and with good reason.So what can I say about it? Plenty. The movie is beautifully constructed. Gorgeous scenery, colorful and vibrant characters, a well-written storyline and plot, beautiful and very fitting musical score all come together to create this remarkable film and make me fall in love with it every time I sit down to watch it. I think my friends are a little amazed at my continuing admiration for the film, but they can, at least, understand my point of view and agree that it's very well done.Daniel Day-Lewis is a fantastic actor and played the part of Hawkeye fantastically and was for the longest time an ideal historical hero for me; Madeleine Stowe gave credibility to the heroine with her brilliant acting skills and carried her character through from a well-bred lady to a strong and independant woman not afraid to defend herself; Chingachgook, Uncas and Magua was played out wonderfully - and even Major Heyward who we all detest until he redeems himself - were all also wonderful characters. Interaction between them was fantastic, and the climax of the waterfall scene was by far my favorite, with a stunning performance from the actors portraying Uncas and Alice. Again, there's that wonderful music, cinematography and scenery. I attempted, on numerous occasions, to sit down and read the book, but I found it long-winded, boring, and extremely difficult to believe that it could have been the basis for such a wonderful movie. I always tell people that the book is usually better than the movie, but in this case, those words ring hollow as this film has proved to break that mold very nicely.But that's only understandable because I can find no other film that hits the mark when it comes to overall brilliance. Kudos to all involved with the creation of this film. With today's flashy and computer generated films with thumping soundtracks dancing across the big screen, I still call this film my favorite of all time.</fullReview>

I am amazed at Mann's ability to draw out such emotion with action, music, cinematography while few words are spoken.Stowe's scenes alone with D.D. Lewis were memorable - especially her 'soul stirring' lines.The guns sounded real, the actors were not acting, the settings and cinematography were riveting, and the celtic score constantly pulled you in.Jodhi May's and Steve Waddington's final scenes still makes me cry after having seen them twenty times. Wes Studi's sincere and unfaltering hatred, coupled with Russell Mean's innocence and lack of polish, made these characters seem not only real but plausible.The four-way three-language 'hearing' in the Huron village, at first difficult to follow, is so cleverly written, played and emotionally charged it stands out as a one-of-a-kind scene in cinema history.Owning the DVD, I have shown this to various family members and friends.

		<fullReview>I could go on about this movie forever, so I'll try to keep it simple.This is a fantastic movie.Now, purists will complain about the historical accuracy, because they are more concerned with history than the making of a good movie. So ignore them. :) For the most part, the history is accurate. And the things that were given up for the sake of good filmmaking and plot, you wouldn't even notice.Above all else, this is a BEAUTIFUL film. My brother commented once that 70% of the movie was the scenery. It's just breathtaking. The colors and the mist, and the cliffs... accompanied by an also breathtaking soundtrack, it's just beautiful. This has been the only movie that I've ever seen, where ever time I hear the soundtrack, I want to see the movie again, right that moment. By the end of the movie, a simple violin tune is enough to evoke some pretty strong emotions from you. It's incredible. (I also recommend the soundtrack, btw.)Daniel Day-Lewis conquered his British accent pretty damn well, to adopt his english indian one. And his eyes just dance throughout the whole thing. And besides a few mildly funny instances where his long hair whaps him in the face while he's running... he really does a great job. Madeline Stowe is a beautiful woman, and made a great Cora. What happens to her, her sister, and her family... 'heartwrenching' wouldn't do it justice. It makes you hold your breath.I'm going on and on... but yes. A beautiful film, rightly in the top 100 greatest movies ever made. I gave it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great film - I first saw 'The Last of the Mohicans' a few months ago and have watched it a countless number of times since: I never get tired of it! Beautifully shot and brilliantly acted, it's a definite must-see.Set against the stunning backdrop of the Smoky Mountains in North Carolina, it's a tale of war, revenge and transcendent love. Reportedly it's nothing like the book (I started it but didn't get anywhere) but I doubt that really matters! Fantastically directed by Michael Mann, the supporting cast is great: Wes Studi is suitably terrifying as Magua and Jodhi May as Alice almost steals the show in one of the film's most haunting images in the final scenes.Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe are the improbably drop-dead gorgeous romantic leads; the chemistry between them is electrifying. Day-Lewis is competent and convincing as Nathaniel/Hawkeye, but it's Stowe, as Cora, that you've really got to look out for. She's an incredibly talented yet under-rated actress and her performance here is great; at once vulnerable and threatened yet courageous and independent, there are few other actresses who could steal thunder from a scantily-clad Daniel Day-Lewis....It's impossible not to comment on the score here: I've never seen a film which shares such an equal partnership with the soundtrack. The music will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end! Without the soundtrack, the film would only be half of what it is now, but you can't appreciate the full power and beauty of the music without having seen the film!The Last of the Mohicans far out-shines both Braveheart (sorry Mel) and Dances with Wolves (which, let's face it, was a tad on the long side), two films which seem largely to have eclipsed it, for some unknown reason. A fantastic film, especially for born romantics; not for the squeamish - the battle scenes are horrific - but you'd be mad to miss it, and anyone who fails to cry at the end must have a heart of stone! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie ranks as in my opinion is one of the top 5 historical drama/epics ever made. This movie was filmed near the North Carolina/Tennessee border and I am from Tennessee and I remeber when the movie crews were filming this, because I wanted to go watch them film this movie, but the local authorities and the film producers had that area off limits to the public. I have never read the book "Last of the Mohicans" so if this movie differs from the book-I wouldn't know. I also remeber watcing an old Black and White version of this in my 8th grade class when I was a Kid growing up(seems like another lifetime ago now). ..Okay,I've strayed from the subject matter just a bit. However this 1992 version is splended in every way. I was completely taken by how beautiful the Appalatchain Mountian sceenery is in this film(because I live about 70 mile away from where this movie was filmed, I sometimes take it for granted that I live in the most beautiful part of the United State)This film captured the essence and beauty of this area(its suppossed to be upstate New York in the film). this movie has a powerful gripping story. Awesome costumes, A Superb music score, great Specail Effects. great battle scenes,good solid action scenes, and to top it off this film is well acted by a Great Cast. This movie has something in it for everyone. When the credits began to roll up the screen at the end of this film , I was saddened by the fact that it was over, I wanted this film to just keep going-I wanted more. I believe you are going to love this film. I give it 5 out of 5 stars - A perfect film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stirring adventure with pitch perfect performances across the board. Mann's direction is masterful in grabbing you from the first moments and keeping you involved until the moving final scene. Many components go into making a film entertaining but one of the most important here is the music. It is fantastic at giving the picture a sweeping feeling of the period. Probably one of the best, most organically fitting film scores ever. How it was overlooked at awards time is a mystery.The details of the period are well thought out and even though I'm sure it was a gritter existence than portrayed an effort is made to give the viewer a feeling of the rigors of frontier life. All this would be for naught if you didn't care about the characters and that is where the film truly excels. Eric Schweig and Jodhi May make something memorable out of the secondary parts of Uncas and Alice. Wes Studi is a throughly deplorable Magua, Steven Waddington makes Duncan more than the officious martinet he so easily could have been and Russell Means is compelling as Chingachgook. The real power of the piece however rests in the central love story between Nathaniel and Cora, DDL and Stowe elevate that to something special. While Daniel Day-Lewis is a brilliant actor he is not always a romantic one but paired with Madeleine Stowe they share that lightening in a bottle thing called great chemistry. Whenever they share the screen it crackles with the spark between them and as with all great screen couples like Tracy &amp; Hepburn or Myrna Loy &amp; William Powell their mere presence makes an already superior film better.Action packed, occasionally very violent, and beautifully photographed with everyone working at the highest level this is a great consistently involving film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulsating; harrowing and quite stupendous adventure film, with a pleasing eye on character and narrative in what is a thoroughly involving experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans will begin with an establishing shot of a patch of dense jungle shot through a wide angle lens so as to capture both the beauty and magnitude of it all. The camera lingers over the canopy layer of some pretty intense foliage, gently moving from right to left, encapsulating a good stretch of forestry and providing us with an angle informing us precisely where the following 120-odd minutes of pure, adrenaline fuelled action will take place. We cut to a shot deeper within, a man sprinting his way through with a number of others of his own ilk as they chase down an animal that they're hunting. The man is the lead the film will come to revolve around; a man who dominates this locale we're provided with intimidating initial shots of as he negotiates the fallen trees and wins his prize. Our lead is additionally a crack shot with his musket, a nimble specimen whom appears to be able to tackle all that nature and the world throws at him; someone whom, when it comes to the killing of the said animal, pauses to say a few brief words of prayer so as to acknowledge they have just killed a living beast but observe it's all for the sake of being at one with nature anyway.When the time comes for this man to escort a certain important someone across the fiery, hostile terrains of the front line of the French and Indian War of 1754 to 1763; the systematic avoiding of warring sides, raging natives to the land and everything else, we feel that he's more than up to the task. Mann's film is a gripping adventure running on adrenaline; self discovery and a nicely observed romance story, barely ever pausing to catch its breath and not afraid to shy away from some of the more brutal realities of the warfare of the respective era. It is Daniel Day Lewis playing the role of lead Nathaniel Poe, nicknamed Hawkeye, a humble enough local based in the north east of where Canada now meets the United States whom crash lands into a scenario of intense industrial warfare having survived this long on somewhat ancient, more traditionalist, methods of living.The aforementioned person Poe and his accomplices are charged with transporting for the early part is the daughter of a top British Colonel out on the front-line, a certain Edmund Munro (Roëves) who's in the midst of fighting the French at a secluded fort. The daughter is Madeleine Stowe's Cora Munro, the reoccurring element to a love triangle but much more than precisely that; a mere MacGuffin or a pretty face. She observes the worldly wilderness she's presently occupying as quite serene, even beautiful; her somewhat air-headed and bubbled demeanour suggesting a lack of exposure to what is truly unfolding within this place and much like the opening shots of the film, the cutting from something serene and easy on the eye into the object itself plus the revealing of the brutal manner in which this world functions coming to resemble how far along it is Cora goes in her own discovering of the nature of the land she's actually in. She is liked by a British major named Heyward (Waddington), a man whom is additionally on the trek with Poe and a handful of British soldiers charged with protecting her; but it is a connection that is not returned, thus paving the way for Day-Lewis' native whose clothing, characteristics and methods twinned with his rugged, handsome looks to win out over Heyward's physical traits of binary opposition. Poe himself even identifies his character as being "a breed apart" to that of the prim, sophisticated Cora, and their gradual romance amidst Heyward's admiration is well unfolded.Where Poe is perhaps the closest we have to a lead in a film which balances many person's tales from varying sides without really taking a definitive side with Wes Studi's Magua, a native to the lands, the closest to a stone-wall villain out to thwart those we predominantly cover. Magua is a ruthless and brutally effective machine-like character; clinical in combat and intelligent in his reasoning with allies. Mann paints dimensions to the man that keeps him from being the faceless, anonymous antagonistic force in the form of a savage out for blood and nothing more. The catalyst for his actions arrive in the form of the British doing what they did to his people, specifically to his family; his enemy effectively the British's imperialistic nature and a force we're meant to keep on a back burner of actually siding with. The scenes he shares with a French general with whom he is aligned due to said events carry a sense of purpose and meaningfulness, they outline his ideas and how he'll go about garnering his revenge thus rounding the character to an effective level. We feel a lesser film wouldn't go out of its way to include such scenes, and perhaps might've preferred a more anonymous, less complimentary portrait.Ultimately, the film works because of Mann's brilliant handling of a bunch of sub-plots and the relations characters have with one another plus the scenarios around them; the action made so much more involving and dramatic because of the manner in which Mann brings us to care so dearly for the people involved. Mann's refusing to shy away from the sort of violence on show gives off a heightened sense of danger or immediacy ? as the film progresses, we fear similar fates of such extremities may happen to those we've come to quite like. The Last of the Mohicans is a quite gripping adventure film, the glue of which is Day-Lewis' composed and humanistic character whose homeland is in great strife and whose tale is told rather wonderfully in this impressive film.</fullReview>

Madeline Stowe is particularly forceful and appealing as Cora, and Wes Studi is terrifying as the hate-filled Magua. The location shooting, the theme of the New World casting off Old World repressive institutions and beliefs, the action sequences--work with the elements to make this picture shine.But why wasn't this musical score even nominated for an Academy Award? Not only is it beautiful in its own right, but it is a perfect overlay for both the high adventure and high romance shown on the screen, and the movie would be severely diminished with an average score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1757, On the shores of the Hudson river. Three years ago that French and British struggling in land American. British Commanders recruit local people, native and farmers settled in these lands, to form a militia capable of facing the army Franco-Indian about by the south. "Hawkeye" "Eye of hawk" (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a target adopted by the Indians Mohican's living next to his father (Russell Means) and his brother "Uncas((Eric Schweig). After rescue from an ambush ferrets to "Cora Munro" (Madeleine Stowe) and his little sister "Alice" (Jodhi May), daughters of a British officer, the three decide accompany to English fort "William Henry", that is being stalked by french and ferrets. There they are forced to sit next to a group of British who have just arrived in the colonies.In the period of time that there are between "The fortress cursed", "Hunter" and "The last of the Mohicans". Michael Mann gives a leap in quality that comes to the master's degree in the direction. In this film is goose barnacle throughout a manual as should make an epic of adventures music. Has action without finishing in the overstatement, there are romanticism without falling into the pretentiousness, brings values without becoming pamphlet and has a soundtrack that can frame perfectly the action, adjusting the items at any time.We have to pay attention to the last 20 minutes of the film, where without words are presents us with an outcome demolisher by its crude oil romanticism and its poetic violence. To see the eyes of the players feel all your pain, his love, and their courage. This film shows which will be the style of Michael Mann, landscape, silences and looks and a desire clearly detailed without Romanticisms exaggerated. The last of the Mohican's belongs to this small number of films modern who maintain a flavor age recognizable in each of its parts. Adventures that show real settings; a clothing retailer in the extreme, with a history entertaining and reliable. Furthermore, if we add to the work one of the best sound tracks of the 1992, a sound of "Oscar" and some precise and explanatory dialogs, because we have a great movie. The gap to three years before opening in the cinema Kevin Costner in his presentation humanist of the Indians in "Dances with Wolves", the continues significantly here Michael Mann:. Iroquois, ferrets, Ottawas, Mohican's, tomahawks... tribes forgotten except in the history books, because accustomed to seeing stories only with Cheyenne, apaches, feet blacks and of course, our dear Sioux.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Envisioned, and Nicely Told... a Few Awkward Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Mann's take on J. F. Cooper's famous novel stick to the original story and characters very nicely, and brings together a great cast for some great performances. Daniel Day Lewis, Russel Means and Madeleine Stowe get the leads, but I have to mention the stand-out performance from Wes Studi (as Magua) - stunning! The story takes place during the "French and Indian War" and centers around the ill-fated British Fort William Henry. It is about a young white man (Day-Lewis) who has been adopted into the Mohican tribe and is a member of the last Mohican family (headed by Means). Hawkeye, his father and brother, side with the English almost accidentally, and Lewis falls for a spirited daughter of the fort's pompous and authoritarian commander. The story is loaded with action, subtle and more powerful dialog, minor plot twists, and a penetrating analysis of cultural dissonance and conflict.The love story, at times, is over-dramatized and allowed to distract from the story, but this minor problem is overlooked in this fine film.The film features beautiful landscapes (many of which I recognize from hiking the Adirondacks), a strikingly interesting-looking and nicely talented cast, and a refreshingly Native American cast playing Native Americans. The cinematography is delicious, and aside from the minor directorial/editing issue mentioned above, this is one of the better directed versions of The Last of the Mohicans. Recommended.</fullReview>

Regardless of which side they are on, they protect and defend their women and families, they have moral strength, they are patriots fighting for right, and they are downright sexy to boot! The spectacular location and haunting musical score further enhance this wonderful glimpse into U.S. history. Daniel Day-Lewis (Nathaniel, "Hawkeye") and Madeline Stowe (Cora Munro), both perfectly cast, exude chemistry in a scene which is, in my opinion, one of the most erotic love scenes in all of cinema. Wes Studi as Magua gives a stunning performance; definitely Academy Award caliber. Russel Means(Chingachgook), Eric Schweig (a very handsome Uncas)and Jodhi May (Alice)all perform with understated elegance. A beautifully made, perfectly acted and directed film!

		<shortDescription>This movie is so much better than what I first expected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first reaction when I heard that this movie was more or less a combination of a western with a costume drama: Please allow me to run away while screaming as loud as I can. I just couldn't think of any other combination that is worse, but as always I tried to keep an open mind towards it and I was willing to give it a try. After reading some reviews on this website and seeing that it got a very nice rating of 7.5/10, I was convinced that this movie might actually be different. And it was, no doubt about that...As the battle for colonial America goes on between the English and the French, both helped by various Indian war parties, the British troops enlist the help of local colonial and native American militia men. But these men are reluctant to leave their homes undefended and three of them, who all belong to a dying tribe called the Mohicans, refuse to enter the militia. Two of these men are original tribesman, the third one is a white man who was adopted by the Mohicans as a kid. When the three are on their way to Kentucky, they see how a small regiment of British soldiers, including the two daughters of an English Colonel, are attacked by an Indian war party on their way to a fort. The three men save them and lead the survivors to their destination. In the meantime, encouraged by the events and the presence of the three 'wild' men, the two women start to change from (for that time period) typical, obedient and silent women into independent and strong women with a will of their own...Now that I've seen this movie I can only come to the conclusion that I'm happy that I didn't follow my first opinion. This movie certainly isn't as bad as I feared it would be. This is without any doubt a very fine movie and there are many reasons for that. One of the reasons is the very nice story. It not only gives a good idea of how the colonial wars were fought at that time, but it also breaks some typical boundaries. Instead of showing the woman as silent, helpless and obedient toys for the obviously heroic men, this movie changes all that. The women get an important and strong role in the story and I really appreciated that. Also the fact that the Indians weren't automatically seen as one big bunch of blood thirsty, wild and crazy men, driving on the back of a horse without a saddle, over the vast Western prairie and shooting with bow and arrow, was a relief. But not only the story was more than OK, so was the direction and the acting. With a director like Michael Mann, you can't expect any less than a great movie of course. With movies like "Heat", "The Insider", "Collateral"... he has more than once proved that he knows what he is doing. But what is a good director without a good cast to work with? Absolutely nothing. With people like Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Eric Schweig,... he had a cast that was a very nice mix of well-known and not so famous actors and they all did a very good job. Together with the story, they made this movie and its characters come to live. These people didn't feel like they were made out of cardboard, they felt genuine and that's something that you don't always get in a movie.Overall this is a very good movie with some very nice acting, good direction, a fine story and last but not least some very beautiful music. For some that may not be important, but for me it is. I prefer to hear no music at all, rather than an annoying tune in the background. The music needs to be good and has to support the movie and that's exactly what it does in this film. I must say that I liked everything about this movie and that's why I believe that it doesn't deserve a rating lower than 7.5/10. Even an 8/10 isn't exaggerated in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible, Magnificent, Reverent, Beautiful, Tear-Inducing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Michael Mann's "Last of the Mohicans" is an incredible cinematic experience. I don't often go to the theater and I even rarer see films multiple times (at the theater, that is), but when "Last of the Mohicans" was released in 1992 I saw it twice. I then got my hands on the VHS as soon as I could.I recently watched the VHS again and was incredibly moved! The original VHS is, incidentally, the theatrical release of the film. I was reminded of all the numerous elements that make "Last of the Mohicans" the definitive reason why people make and watch motion pictures in the first place. I was so moved, in fact, that I was compelled to buy the "Director's Expanded Edition," which many fans criticize, mainly due to the omission of the Clannad song ("I Will Find You") and a smattering of supposedly hip lines by Nathaniel.I'll compare the theatrical release to the director's cut at the end of this review. Allow me to first point out the numerous highlights of the film: -- The casting is perfect: Daniel Day-Lewis as Nathaniel, Madeleine Stowe as Cora Munro, Wes Studi as Magua -- heck, everyone's fabulous. -- The score by Randy Edelman is one of the greatest in motion picture history. It's as good or better than any you can think of, including "Conan the Barbarian," "Where Eagles Dare," "The Last Valley," "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," etc.-- The plot is simple and the film runs less than two hours, but there's a definite epic scope to the picture. More than that, the ambiance of the film is equal parts historic, realistic, pure, brutal, beautiful and reverent.-- This film contains one of the greatest non-soap operatic love stories in motion picture history. During the "Look of Love" sequence Nathaniel stops and turns to gaze at Cora. Cora looks up and asks, "What are you looking at, Sir?" Nathaniel simply responds, "I'm looking at you, Miss." Cora finally looks back at him; first hesitatingly, then fully, then finally with a knowing smile. They just look at each other and Nathaniel returns the smile, turns and departs. Without a word, we KNOW that Nathaniel and Cora are in profound awe and love of each other. Later, when they finally passionately embrace it's potent and moving. This simple scene blows away any overt love-making scene you can think of. -- The primal Magua is a great villain, compelled to hatred, bitterness and revenge for numerous understandable reasons.-- Magua's two pow-wow interludes with the French general (Patrice Chereau) are imaginative, surreal and powerful.-- The French and Indian War skirmishes and Fort battles are realistic, compelling and brutal.-- Cora's sister Alice (Jodhi May) is only 15 years old and the fierceness of the frontier is simply too overwhelming for her. She almost commits suicide but Uncas (Eric Schweig) saves her.-- After Nathaniel and his Indian stepfather and stepbrother barely escape the clutches of Magua by jumping from a waterfall there's an unexpected and powerful interlude featuring the magnificent Clannad song "I Will Find You." Unfortunately this song was inexplicably cut from the director's edition. Apparently Mann felt it was anachronistic; it's not, it perfectly fits the feel and era of the picture.-- Although Major Heyward comes off as a ultra pro-British dork, he ultimately proves his bravery and noble character.-- One of the most memorable scenes is Alice's ultimate response to the prospect of living the rest of her life as Magua's slave-squaw. I cannot describe how magnificent and moving this episode is! -- The picture was filmed in glorious Chimney Rock Park in Western North Carolina. One reviewer fittingly called the film an "Eastern." -- The entire 15-20 minute climax, which includes Chingachgook's final fight with Magua, is compelling, imaginative and flawless. Chingachgook is played by Russell Means, by the way.COMPARING THE THEATRICAL CUT TO THE DIRECTOR'S CUT: I feel Michael Mann's cut is superior to the theatrical cut of the film. He only adds about 3-4 minutes of extra footage and it all works, with the possible exception of Chingachgook's near cringe-inducing final rant at the climax. Mann cut every one of Nathaniel's silly "hip" statements, which was a good decision in my opinion (not that they were THAT bad, but they simply weren't very realistic; fun maybe, but not realistic). As already noted, Mann's biggest mistake was to cut out the perfectly-fitting Clannad song. In the new cut that sequence just plays out in an unimpressive, bland manner. All I can say is that I'm glad I have the VHS because I can still play the Clannad song-sequence when I get to that particular scene (of course, the theatrical release has been released on DVD as well).Anyway, don't listen to these people who rail against the director's cut mainly because of the omission of the Clannad song. They're right that Mann should never have cut the song but, other than that, his new cut is actually superior to the original (although I admit that I'd rather have the original cut WITH the Clannad song than the new cut WITHOUT it).BOTTOM LINE: "The Last of the Mohicans" is simply one of the greatest films ever made. Sometimes I'm guilty of being over-generous in my film ratings, but not with this one.GRADE: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this 1992 version of "The Last of the Mohicans", Day-Lewis plays a long-haired version of the Deerslayer--a white man raised by Mohican tribesmen. He and his adopted father and brother are reluctantly pulled into the battle between the Brits and French during the French-Indian War (also called the Seven Years War). This is because the Brits have no idea what they were doing in the war and so it's up to these three men to save the day...or at least rescue a couple women from certain death.It is interesting to note that when the film began, it did NOT say it was based on the original James Fenimore Cooper story but on the 1936 version of "The Last of the Mohicans" (which starred Randolph Scott). Much as I hate to admit it, the original story is very difficult reading and the decision to 'spice it up' by changing the story around (such as killing off folks who survived in the original story) worked well--making for an exciting story. It also helped that the film was made on location in the Blueridge Mountains of North Carolina--providing nice scenery you couldn't get in the more stagy (but exceptional) 1936 version. And, to top it off, the musical score was quite rousing and complimented the story well. All in all, a very well done and enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the first time I saw "The Last of the Mohicans", I was 7 and my parents had taken me to see it because I was obsessed with Indians at the time. When I first saw it I thought Daniel Day-Lewis was so cool, and I was wrapped up in the adventure of the film for weeks. I have recently re-watched the movie, and this time around Daniel Day-Lewis has gone from being really to cool to being really good looking but I still am thrilled by the action, only I am now drawn to the romance as well. This is in my opinion one of THE GREATEST movies ever made. So it dosen't exactly follow Coopers novel? 'Thank God', I say(have you ever read that thing?) The sacrifices made by Duncan and Alice are so stingingly tragic and the secenry(which I really appreciate because I live only miles from where it was filmed)is so breath-taking, and lovely and utterly romantic in and of it's self. The score is amazingly well suited to the themes of the movie and, for me, tugs at some deeply embeded chord in my soul. I am also a BIG Jodhi May(aka Alice)fan, and even though "The Last of the Mohicans" was her first big time movie(she has since been in BBC productions of"The Turn of the Screw" and "Aristocrasts" to name but a few), and she has a rather small, but very, very poignant and important part she is so tragic, and innocent in the portrayal of the doomed Alice(the scene on the cliff is the most tragic, odd, moment in the entire movie. It makes me cry every time). If you have not see this movie I urge you to! You will not regret it! Long live "THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS"!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read Cooper's original novel, I will freely admit, nor do I ever really see myself working up the interest to actually do so. But I absolutely love this version of "Last of the Mohicans". It was the first movie I ever saw in the widescreen format of video tapes and, after watching it again after about three years of not seeing it, everything I loved about it then still holds true.The film is no more anti-British than it is anti-Indian. Everybody gets a more or less fair shake. Granted, Day-Lewis and his adopted family (as well as the Munro sisters) get have more to like about them than some of the others, but even the "bad guys" are understandable. Think about it: Maghoa is, without a doubt, a bloodthirsty, hate-driven b*****d, yet considering all he's lost in his life thanks to the Yanquis (particularly Colonel Munro), can you blame him for wanting to take his revenge? I can't. Colonel Munro is a loving father who cares very deeply about his daughters and a commander who cares about his men. Still, the atrocities he's committed in the name of the Crown against Maghoa are disconcerting, to say the least. Horrible though his death is, can one truly say whether or not it is unjustified? I can't. Major Duncan Heyward is an arrogant snob of an English officer, looking down his nose at colonials and Indians alike. But he is no fop in combat, as his reaction to the George Road ambush proved, and, as he proved with his death, under that arrogant exterior is a very brave man. Can anyone say that he truly deserved his fate? I can't.The thing, to me, that makes this a great film is that, when all's said and done, nobody wins. NOBODY. Of all the eight major characters (Hawkeye, Chingachook, Uncas, Cora Munro, Alice Munro, Colonel Munro, Maghoa, Maj. Heyward), half of them are dead by film's end and everyone has lost at one person they very deeply care about. There's no overarcing evil responsible for these horrors, just human nature, culture clashs, and the insanity that is war. As America today is still very much a country of clashing cultures fighting for supremacy, therein lies the great tragedy of "Last of The Mohicans". 243 years later, we still haven't learned a thing...and we'd better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite Film Of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember vividly seeing this film for the first time when I was young (like,really young). The images and sounds resonate so powerfully in my head that I just have to watch it at least once a year.I like to see this film as a mini-epic, because it certainly has an epic sweep but not the running time to match. I read that the original version was three hours however the final result clocks in at just over a hundred minutes (without credits). Therefore, the film may appear choppy and the charatcers a bit thin.But I don't care. Yes it's very Hollywood but it's the best kind of Hollywood; so exciting and moving, so romantic and thrilling, with such an exhausting recreation of the time that pulls you into this world so well, the action staged with such precision by Michael Mann, the score so evocative and inspiring and Daniel-Day Lewis so charismatic in the lead. He really is the greatest actor of his generation, the fact he can play a man with cerebal palsy, a despicable oilman and the coolest motherf***king hero on the planet doesn't really begin to analyze his genius as a performer Most people consider TLOTM to be simply a terrific action movie, and I see it as such too but for some reason I rank it higher than all else. Maybe it's because of this; when you're young you see great films, and then you see great films you want to make, or wish you had made. The Last Of The Mohicans is one such film. If in my life time I had the chance to have directed any film sequence in history, I would choose the final ten minutes of this film, which is the greatest action climax I've ever seen and no other film has come close to matching this climatic gun-fight-on-the-run for sheer exhilaration and emotional power.A masterpiece in any language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a movie looks very beautiful but that's about it, 'The Mission' comes to mind. Sometimes a movie looks and sounds great and it is already enough to like the movie and for me 'The Last of the Mohicans' is one of those movies. Fortunately there is so much more.The story is set in 1757 in a time where France and Britain are fighting over America. Three people do not want to join that war. Chingachgook (Russell Means), an Indian of the Mohican tribe, his son Uncas (Eric Schweig) and his white adopted son Nathaniel Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis). They do end up in that war because they help a British major named Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) who is escorting the two daughters of Col. Edmund Munro (Maurice Roëves). They were attacked by the Huron tribe and their leader Magua (Wes Studi) hates Munro and therefore his daughters as well. The daughters are named Alice (Jodhi May) and Cora (Madeleine Stowe). The three decide to escort the major and the daughters and once they have arrived at the fort where Munro is they are not allowed to leave.How the story develops is not for me to say, but you can understand there must be a love story between Hawkeye and Cora and that things must be settled with Magua. The story is interesting and actually pretty good, mainly because the clichés are made interested. A love story, the character the major is, a sacrifice, it is all there but done in a great way.Back to the beauty. The locations are great and beautiful and they are on the screen almost the entire movie. The cinematography is splendid. Another very good thing is the costumes and everything that comes with that. It is not only what we see but also what we hear. It won the Oscar for Best Sound and not without a reason. We also hear the music and it is one of the most beautiful scores I know. The song "I Will Find You", performed by Clannad, is beautiful as well.Daniel-Day Lewis is, as always, very good and probably the perfect actor for Hawkeye. Even better is Madeleine Stowe, who owns every scene she is in. Them together is what we want to see and that is what we get, and they make sure it is the way we want it. Lewis, Stowe, Wes Studi as the evil Magua and the others do a great job. Directed by Michael Mann, who made good movies like 'Manhunter' before this and great movies like 'Heat' and 'The Insider' after this, this is a great movie that I enjoy every time I see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i didn't hate this one. i just couldn't adapt to the story. it didn't really grab me. Michael Mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this. i'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. some projects he's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant. my favourite Daniel Day Lewis films are There Will Be Blood and Gangs Of New York.there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score, it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. thats about all i liked in it though. this film has a high vote as well which is a bit random. i can see that a fair few people will like this but not enough to make the overall rating 7.8.i would give this film a miss if i was you but there is a lot of high votes for this so i guess you should watch it and make your own views on what you think. i didn't really like it............. 4/10.............j.d Seaton</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Best Films of All Time - A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many thousands of films, and there are only 7 that I have rated a 10. This film is at the top of my list - I consider it to be the best film of all that I've seen. This film is a masterpiece. I have seen it about 30 times and will probably watch it another 50. It is so deeply moving and stirring, I can not describe it. It is above review, and words will only fail it.It is an incredible, epic, passionate romantic love story. Not an "action adventure" as IMDb calls it.It is very painful to watch this film, because of the deep sense of longing to be that man in the story who gets to be with this woman and survives this extreme experience of being so intensely alive. This is a film that must be seen. Descriptions are pointless. Every aspect is a masterpiece. The acting, the casting, the music, everything. The fact that this is rated a 7.3 on IMDb as of when I write this is absolutely disturbing proof that most people are utterly oblivious and bereft of any sense of art or beauty. One thing I must say is that while Daniel Day Lewis and Wes Studi were both incredible, it was Madeleine Stowe who made this film. I just can't describe her. I came on here considering writing a review for "The Revenant" (2015), and just started thinking of how many orders of magnitude better the Last of the Mohicans was. So I came here to write this instead. A "10" is not "excellent" to me (IMDB says 10 is "excellent"). To me, 10 means masterpiece. Only about 1 in 1,000 films is a masterpiece. This is one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivid sense of time &amp; place.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book makes a pretty dry read, but Last of the Mohicans is a good yarn.From history books, we all know how the French &amp; English warred for colonial control in North America; we might even remember that certain native tribes allied themselves with the warring powers. But how many of us remember it was the Mohawks who fought on the side of the British &amp; the Hurons who allied themselves with the French? This rich-textured film brings it all alive in a way we probably won't forget. When we hear Hawk-eye talk about wintering in "the Kain-tak-kee" &amp; realize this is a time before such artificial political constructs as states even existed in the New World, we can suddenly grasp the boundless sense of freedom held dear by woods folk who cared nothing for borders or politics.The film also brings out the quandary of "colonial militias", ordinary men whose protracted absence meant leaving their families undefended on the ragged frontiers of a war-torn land. Add to this the factionalism &amp; rivalries of the native tribes in their uncertain alliances with "les Fransayz" or "les Yengiz". Contrast the inflexible authoritarianism of the British (presumably the French as well) with the natives' political system, governed by loose alliances &amp; by the moral suasion of local wise men known as sachems, &amp; one begins to get a real sense of the humanity behind the dry history we all learned in school.We see the absolutism of colonial commanders who renege on promises to allow their militiamen to leave when their homesteads came under threat &amp; we gain insight into the cutthroat machinations so often masked by the flowery language of formal agreements. When Colonel Munro surrenders his fort to the besieging French forces under the deceptively gracious General Montcalm, Montcalm hints to his Huron allies that while his honor requires him to allow the British to leave unmolested, he really would prefer not to risk having to fight these same soldiers again some other time &amp; place. Understanding full well what the general has just given them license to do, the Hurons fall on &amp; massacre the helpless troops &amp; civilians whose hubristic leader traded the dubious security of the fort for the grave dangers of a forced march through hostile territory.Daniel Day Lewis performs well in the lead role as Hawk-eye &amp; real-life First Nations activist Russell Means puts in a nicely understated performance as the quietly stalwart Chingachgook. (I've heard he also exerted considerable influence behind the scenes to assure the accuracy of the historical setting &amp; interpretation.) For me though, the fierce intensity of Wes Studi's portrayal of Magua, the vengeful villain of the piece, outshines them all. You hate him for his cruelty, but when you learn his back-story, you can hardly wonder at his thirst for vengeance. This superb piece of acting &amp; the vivid sense of time &amp; place make this film one of the best-ever historical dramas brought to screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Must watch from DD Lewis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last of the Mohicans" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of its time. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures with everyone being involved. This movie has a bit of action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and it appears that he has researched well into the James Fenimore Cooper's book on which the movie is based. The story is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters ? Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice Munro (Jodhi May) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children. This is by far Mann's best film yet and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious. This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy; complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during that hectic time period. MY RATING: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last of the Mohicans is for me an epic movie, the best adventure film ever made. Its a masterpiece in all: Great cast, great battles, great photography but the best of this movie is the masterful soundtrack, its truly the best soundtrack of any film ever and is unforgettable. The opening scene is epic. I love the movies, which their opening scenes has great music. Daniel Day-Lewis do a memorable performance, its impressive how he act, he has good vocabulary and his quotes are awesome. Michael Mann does a great job mixing romance and action. The most important thing about this movie is the final scene that is considered for me an epic and powerful scene, I can't describe what I feel when I hear the soundtrack at this scene, its simply epic. This movie was the first great job that Mann did, but Heat is his best movie. The movie won an academy award for best sound, but it didn't get the academy award for best soundtrack and is truly not fair, its unforgiven. An all-time classic that I watch three times each year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Michael Mann Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in old colonial America this movie manages to distil what is best in movies into a masterful mix of drama, romance and action blended into a spiritual and beautifully filmed setting of a violent war merging old and new.I remember seeing this when younger but did not fully appreciate it like I do today.Daniel Day Lewis plays a white man brought up in an American Indian family and portrays one of the strongest male leads in recent times. The as ever lovely Madelaine Stowe brings beauty and a brooding presence to the drama and both a perfectly matched against each other and they are totally believable when the inevitable attraction occurs. It is true old fashioned presence that allows both actors convey such intensity in a look - without the need to display extreme facial expressions or dramatic movement.What is notable for me in the this movie is the utter perfection in the way it is shot and scripted. The dialogue in this film are for those somewhat old fashioned like myself who merely tolerate clichés but really appreciate a beautifully expressed script amid all the cannons and musket fire.In action films today, it seems the cost goes towards special effects rather than the right actors and writers. Michael Mann adds his touch to the intense and brooding screenplay - which we are reminded of in the later 'modern' masterpiece - Heat. It seems when you put Michael Mann with 2 strong characters and actors - Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat, Jamie Fox and Tom Cruise in Collateral, Al Pacino and Russell Crowe in the Insider - you have a Masterpiece in the making.Perhaps that 2nd special actor is really all that is missing from his other films to make them great. A generalisation I know - but after seeing this again - Michael Mann's first big feature - it is hard to imagine him doing any wrong.The only comment I could add is I felt like it should be longer. More epic. More of everything. If it led on, I would follow.If you haven't watched this - watch it. It is an timeless experience.If you have seen it - watch it again like I did. And see if you can see the broad and delicate brush strokes to this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last of the Mohicans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Last of the Mohicans", we travel back in time to the year of 1757, when the Europeans were still pestering the native Indian tribes of North America. As a result, we come face to face with a stunning &amp; emotional piece of epic cinematography. Combining elements of war action, drama, romance, &amp; tragedy, this film accomplishes its mission as far as I can see.With scenes of lush, green wilderness environments, log cabins, Native American weaponry, and clothing from the colonial era, I was easily taken in to the setting. The soundtrack is nothing short of remarkable also. Noticing how a lot of the Native Americans were able to come across guns and ammunition in order to go against the Europeans in battle brought a fresh sense of irony to the story. Anyhow, movies which demonstrate the ways people lived before electricity and cars and cities have always been intriguing to me.The most outstanding thing about this movie to me is the fact that the director chose to make a movie about such a bold and important topic in the first place. Being that in this day &amp; age, Native Americans are not often seen in their original state, "The Last of the Mohicans" is somewhat like a reference to this particular era in the development of the United States of America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional saga filled with heroism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last of Mohicans is a remarkable story of a man, whose destiny envelopes lives of many others, and stands out as a burning message thrown out onto the world. From the beginning to the end, the movie sings only the song of freedom. It depicts how every creature, every race is craving for freedom, and what happens if the freedom is prejudiced by some greedy men. But as every wise man on earth says, troubles are not forever, a brighter day shall come, and this movie gives this message too.Three mohawks are on their way to can-tuck-ee, in war-torn America. English and French fight each other for the land. A party of British soldiers and two daughters of a general area attacked by a group of natives in support of french, who kill almost all of the British. But these Mohawks, trace the natives and come out and kill them. They rescue the two girls, and an army officer and take them back safely to the fort where their father has been commissioned, and in the process there brews love between Hawk-eye and one of the general's daughter. The French are already bombing the fort and are sure to take over it in a few days. The remaining story captures the efforts of Hawk-eye and other mohawks to save the general's daughters and escape. Acting wise, Daniel Day-Lewis nails it. Brilliantly Inspirational Acting. Kudos. The movie never bores you, it is a very thrilling ride into the world of natives, and it shows that natives have a lot of great culture. The background score is really good, one of the best I have ever heard. I would recommend it to everyone on this planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have probably seen this movie 20 times; it stays on my personal top 10 list. I own a copy of the VHS and have seen later DVD or VHS release with the "restored" footge as deleted scenes/alternate ending editions.The DVD version I rented last night and eagerly brought home to view threw me for a loop. All the formerly "unseen footage" has been placed into the film, tha Clannad song that halps set the tone for the last act is gone from the score. It is the score that is most alarming to me in this edition. I own the original-issue CD (in addition to the VHS), have listened to it many times, so I enjoy the Jones/Edelman music. But not in this new release. The scoring throws the entire movie off balance for me. It is too loud, too omnipresent, and totally overbearing. I believe there was some controversy about the music during the making of the film and so maybe this is an attempt to appease someone about something - I don't know. It does not work. The other big disappointment for me is the insertion of what I think of as the "preachy" alternative ending. I admire Russell Means for his work with AIM and I know that the movie presents an opportunity to make a political statement. For me the beauty and power of the original edition is in its essential spareness. Watching these characters move is poetry because of the purity of their motivations and actions; that they have the skill to live their lives they way they can is a testament to their integrity. That for me is the most compelling statement that can be made in this venue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most underrated film of the 90's. And even if you say, well, it's a well known and well received film, it is still underrated. I can't put into words how utterly flawless and perfect this film is, especially the last half hour. There is a kinetic energy created through the imagery and music that I haven't seen since a Kubrick film. It is pure filmmaking at it's highest level. Some of the greatest films ever made are just as effective without dialogue, like a silent movie. And I can imagine that withouth any dialogue, and just through the actors faces and music, the film is still a masterpiece. I really don't think I can respect anyone's opinion who says they didn't like this film because either they're a retard, or their favorite film is Battlefied Earth. I just can't see hoe this film isn't on every top ten list, unless the person watching it is viewing it on a 2 inch screen. That's the other thing, this is one of those films that unless you're watching it on an 80" Mitsubishi with a Bose stero system thumping at full volume, don't bother watching it. The sound and video must be perfect to get the full emotional ride. And for those who thought The Patriot was an intelligent and moving film, get some good taste and watch The Last of the Mohicans to see how this type of film is done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cooper would be appalled at what they did with his Leatherstocking Tale's hero, Natty Bumpo. In all of the books about the character, he never looked at women romatically. He was too noble-minded and virtious and loved his chosen solo life as a plainsman and trapper to settle down with a girl. Also, only the bare bones of the plot of Last of the Mo makes it in to this movie. The rest is all concocted up by screenwriters. So...if you are watching this flick for school instead of reading the book - BEWARE! It is not a faithful adaptation.That being said, though, I must say that this is an entertaining movie. The Native Americans are portrayed realistically and the acting all around is good. The end is especially cool when the awesome music kicks in and the characters are all pursuing each other around the beautiful mountain scenery (filmed in North Carolina's Blue Ridge mountains). Compare this with Mel Gibson's The Patriot (set a few years after this) and I think you'll like this movie more.</fullReview>

Visually stunning, wonderfully paced, great acting and powerful performances all the way around, with a top-notch sound track. This movie deserved more recognition than it got. If I had to focus on one element that stood out the most it would be the staging of the battle scenes. The spectacular panorama as our heroes emerged upon the scene of the fort under siege is unparalleled in its beauty and atmosphere of authenticity. The brutality of some of the hand to hand combat is gut-wrenching, yet so beautifully filmed and choreographed that I found myself feeling both deeply moved and violated at the same time.There is real genius at work in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a superb film, wonderfully evocative of the colonial frontier. First the few quibbles: It seems that much of the plot came from Cooper's "The Pathfinder" rather than "The Last of the Mohicans". Also, as I recall, Natty Bumppo never showed the slightest romantic interest in Cora, or anyone else. He considered women an entanglement incompatible with his chosen lifestyle, i. e. a frontiersman. Also, I think no white woman would be attracted to an Indian then, no matter how good or heroic. I know it's the way of Hollywood to take interesting characters and invent new situations and adventures for them. Now, to what the film did especially well. Madeleine Stowe, beautiful as always, did a first-rate job here. Jodhi May favors her a bit, and thus is well-cast as her sister. The cinematography is breathtaking. One really "gets" the harshness of the frontier life, the sudden death from the forest, the smoke and confusion of colonial warfare. The portrayals of the Indians were more honest, I believe, than more politically correct films, such as "Dances With Wolves" where the sole focus was the nobility of the savages. Here you get a taste of the savagery, including scalping, mutilation of the dead, and the feeling that mercy is an unknown concept to Indians, the allied, as well as the enemy. Wes Studi should get particular credit for his portrayal of the Huron, Magua.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Daniel Day Lewis and Madeline Stowe star in an epic tale of love, friendship and war in the 18th century(I think). The lead bad guy is Street Fighter's Wes Studi. He does a marvelous job of keeping the audience terrified of him. The story was written almost perfectly. The direction was beautiful as was the acting.(especially Stowe and her younger sister). Its the type of film that people forget easily, but also the type of film that appeals to most audiences. Last Of The Mohicans is a superb film, that I highly recommend to all true film lovers. The soundtrack will raise hairs on your back. Rating=5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this in a theater when it was first released. I've been watching it at least annually ever since. I own both the VHS theatrical cut and the DVD director's cut. I've purchased both the soundtrack album and two Clannad albums, downloaded and read the original novel and the Mann script, reread the Classics Illustrated version, viewed the WWII era b/w film upon which Mann based his script, read the rest of Coopers Leatherstocking Tales, taken a course in longrifle building, taken up deer hunting, and read historical accounts of the frontier conflicts that form the backdrop to this magnificent film. I can tell you, it is the best version of the story. Unlike many adaptations, this one improves upon the original novel by a degree of magnitude. The elaborate bigotry is gone while preserving the constellation of cultures and races. The prudery vanishes but virtue remains. And the jarring silliness of some episodes from the novel is mercifully extinguished in favor of dry wit. And it improves upon every previous adaptation. Magically, much of the dialog and structure from the b/w version, is preserved but the delivery leaves no doubt that the British and French are at war, carelessly using Native and Colonial Americans as pawns - a subtext that was in expedient in the time of the b/w version. Some experts have criticized the film for historical inaccuracies, including details of the props and costumes, but the fact that the film stimulates interest enough to discover the inaccuracies seems to me to overturn that criticism. There is an internal confusion of place, apparently a half-carried out attempt to reconcile the historical location of the events in the colony of New York with the filming location in the state of North Carolina. Hawkeye states his intention to head west to Kantuckee. And for reasons I cannot explain the great Lenape sachem Tamenand becomes a Huron. The thrilling and memorable score should have won the Oscar, but was ineligible for nomination because of a confused parentage, I guess. The soundtrack album is not the same recording as in the film, and introduces a slightly irritating adagio quality missing in the purposeful score. The director's cut restores a somewhat obvious and therefore unnecessary prognostication to Chingachgook at the end, and edits down an exchange between Hawkeye and a recruiter that does a better job of establishing his character's wit in the theatrical release. Finally, the director's cut eliminates the "I Will Find You" Clannad song that accompanies the trailing/tracking scene in the theatrical release, though the end credits still acknowledge it. I place this film right up with Dr Zhivago in cinematographic power, Only a bobbing steadycam long shot of Fort William Henry under siege (was that supposed to be edited in as though from a canoe?) and a questionable green fill light during a nocturnal scene inside the fort mar the otherwise sumptuous camera-work. I acknowledge that it falls slightly short of Titannic in establishing sexual chemistry, but triumphs as a historical action film standing shoulder to shoulder with subsequent genre leaders like Gladiator and Master &amp; Commander, is less tedious than Braveheart or The Patriot, and avoids the juvenile testosterone orgy of 300. Lastly, it works on multiple intellectual levels. The characters can be viewed literally, acting on their personal motivations, but also function allegorically, representing the cultural forces motivating the nations contesting for control of the North American continent. And the camera-work supports this beautifully. Major Heyward, bearing the ambition of England, gazes at a small idealized portrait of Cora, the "heart" of Colonial America, as he crosses a perfectly symmetrical brick bridge representing the transplanted English civilization. Soon we see Cora framed in another symmetrical shot, surrounded by the abundant harvest of the fecund American soil. Heyward reveals his intention to transport this bounty, in the form of Cora, back to England, arrogantly assuming she could have no other plans for her future. Later, we see an alternate option in the form of Hawkeye, who has turned his back on his European heritage, intending to head west and live unbeholden to mother England. It doesn't really take Chingachgook's ending speech to see to what nationalistic future that path leads. And all of that is value-added by Mann to rather flat characters trapped in a wordy tangle by Cooper, who seemingly never recognized the substantive potential of his own novel. Beautiful, exciting, deep. What more could you ask for in a film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent historical romance despite dubious 1930s screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to find the right things to say about this complex Pandora's box of story, history, romance and film-making. There's so much that's good, great even; but it's counterbalanced by things that stick in the craw. There are so many reviews on these pages, this will probably never get read ? so I'm just going to talk about aspects of it that interest me. I could find no way to make it shorter, sorry! This sweeping epic is no less sprawling and fascinating than James Fennimore Cooper's original novel. I've seen comments on how racist and bigoted the book is: whilst there's some truth in this, I think it's almost equally true of aspects of this film. Crucial scenes ? especially the dramatic finale ? are drawn almost shot-for-shot from the far more racist and bigoted 1930 movie of the same name, and some scenes even appear to echo "The Birth of a Nation" by the incomparable, visionary, dangerous bigot DW Griffith, so much so that at times they make Fennimore Cooper's original seem enlightened (as indeed it was. It did not, for example, fail to give a voice to the many tribes of Indians involved in this period of history). So many decades on, I'd say it's now a moot point which was in fact the more racist period ? Cooper's prefiguring of modern-day "gone native" at a time when 'Indians' were in the process of being wiped off the face of the earth; or the KKK-addled America of the 1930s. Perhaps future generations will write us all off eventually. So be it: progress is made through revisionism, we hope.Daniel Day Lewis puts in a spectacular performance as Hawkeye, also known as La Longue Carabine (The Long Rifle) for his renowned skill as a hunter and marksman. Day Lewis is certainly the actor to bring this unusual character to life (although Hawkeye's decided idiosyncrasies and downright bigotry have definitely been shaded away, leaving a younger, meatier, handsomer and much more silent man ? in fact more like a silent film star). In many ways, while it is certainly visually sumptuous, the film reflects the prejudices and opinions of the 1930s, the date of the original screenplay this film is based on. It has the sensibility of a silent film. Music is relied on to perform the function of storytelling much as it did in the silent era. The prejudices are the same, too. The story alters from the original book right away in having Hawkeye fall for Cora: in the book Hawkeye is resolutely unromantic, and it is Uncas who has this misfortune: the racism of the book is that the author joins with the reader, as he supposes, in the assumption that such interracial love is, naturally, quite out of the question. But even the film doesn't address itself in the 'modern' way we'd perhaps like, by allowing Uncas to realise any actual romance with Cora's sister Alice. Here, as in the book, Uncas's is strictly an ideal love. Despite this, however, the film in general shows excellent and forward-thinking treatment of Indian, French, American and British characters as equally interesting.Russell Means is the veteran American Indian (his choice) activist who plays Chingachgook, Uncas's father, and Hawkeye's adoptive father. He plays his character with great dignity and skill (his decades of public life have prepared him well). An extensive and entertaining interview about his experiences on this film is somewhere on the internet. Hiring such an explosive and dominant personality was clever casting, but was always a big risk. Behind the scenes Means supported the Indian actors, striking against their housing conditions; criticised the unreasonably small size of the breech-clouts designed for the Indian cast to wear; pointed out that he believed the heavy oak weapon he carried in the film was in fact a misinterpretation of a nutcracker design. Wes Studi is amazing as the Huron Magua: a powerfully malign point of focus within the story. He can feel very proud of this performance ? that he in no way contributed to a simplistic and negative view of American Indians with his nuanced characterisation. Magua had a tribe, and motivation, and was given screen time ? and a multilingual voice ? to articulate it. This is a significant development from the vengeful (and tribeless) cinema Indian whose sole motivation appears to be revenge itself. Witness, perhaps, Studi's own part in "Dances with Wolves".Elsewhere too, the casting is excellent, for example Madeleine Stowe's spirited Pre-Raphaelite Cora and Steven Waddington's thankless role as stiff and unsuccessful suitor Major Hayward. I don't think I'll ever forget Jodhi May's Alice; wordlessly she manages to do a great deal and creates considerable pathos (another silent film star!). Her able counterpart is Eric Schweig as Uncas, the young warrior, who, with perhaps even fewer lines, contributes greatly to the authenticity, and the romantic drama, of the piece. (But for the real deal check out Schweig with veteran actor Graham Greene in "Skins", a film about real, modern Native Americans, made by a Native writer, cast and crew.) "The Last of the Mohicans" is an absolutely cracking epic historical romance, tackling a complex multi-subject storyline head-on with great intrepidity. Michael Mann deserves his reputation, and putting the pitfalls and debatable issues aside, I'd heartily recommended it for everyone. But take your history lessons from more trustworthy sources: you'll need to read the histories of all sorts of 'sides' to get the full picture of his extraordinarily turbulent time in America's history. 'Young' nation, my foot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film by Michael Mann that was beyond incredible to watch. I have liked this film for years and every time I watch it, it just captivates me on every scene. The actors were all great. Daniel Day-Lewis is a magnificent actor and this is the second film I have seen him in prior to Gangs of New York, but my favorite character in the movie was the old Indian chief who helped Hawkeye and his son. He was great. The music for the movie was amazing and to me it actually made the film. The composers did great on it and I give them high credit for it. Overall, this is an excellent Indian tale originally written by James Fenimore Cooper and directed by one of my favorite directors, Michael Mann who then led to the film, "Heat." I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say that hasn't already been said? Probably not much, but I feel like it's my duty to try, since this movie in my opinion, from beginning, to end, is one of the most dynamic, and beautiful things man, has ever had the initiative to produce.I think that nothing I've ever seen, aside from actual realism, has ever seemed as real as this movie.I don't want to take away from any of them, so I won't put my finger on any one in particular, so as for the Native Americans who acted in this movie, they were superb, right down to the speaking of their native tongue, (noting that some of the language of north eastern Native Americans has been lost over the years). Even the extras played their parts flawlessly.And the music, especially during the last scenes in the movie, on the cliffs, seemed to accent the viciousness, and to some extent the beauty of that which was taking place. If you're a fan of Native Americans, as I am, and you haven't seen this movie, you're doing yourself an injustice.Thanks for allowing me to express my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so this film is quite old in comparison to modern types of western genres, however, it still manages to keep the audiences attention drawn constantly. Michael Mann (director or other great film "Heat"), without a doubt has employed some of his greatest skills in directing this cinematic masterpiece! This film is quite a mix of different themes, the most obvious one being a western, although Mann beautifully weaves in the love interest between Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeline Stowe, without 'over doing it' like how so many other films these days tend to do. I'm not particularly one for watching drippy love stories, but this film hit it right on the mark. Not too much, just the right amount. Right now that's said...The locations are astounding, I'm not quite sure where all the filming locations are but it certainly caught my gaze the first time I saw it. The soundtrack is also incredibly good, especially the inspiring fiddle music playing all the while Daniel Day-Lewis chases after the bad Indians up the mountain. The battle scene at the British occupied fort is also another great piece of filming as it somehow leaves one feeling that they are present!There are just so many things that I could comment on it could take pages &amp; pages to provide an acceptable critique on how great this film is and the amazing feeling it leaves the audience with. Hopefully this brief critique I have produced will inspire others who have never seen the film to go out and watch it!!</fullReview>

The cinematography is breathtaking, the costumes and props are consistently realistic, and the great Trevor Jones score, with help from the Celtic group Clannad, is so moving it's an integral part of the experience (use good speakers, if at all possible). I don't buy soundtrack albums; I bought this one. I found the storytelling to be enthralling, especially given the fact that the story, although a classic, is really a bit of a lightweight, after all. If you've read Mark Twain's comments about James Fenimore Cooper and this book, never mind; this movie makes it all work. I was particularly impressed with Wes Studi as Magua.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historic romance, off the beaten track of the usual studio material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderfully romantic film The Last of the Mohicans uses a remote situation in history and a clash of cultures not often juxtaposed to concentrate on human ideals; love, honour, sacrifice and other issues seem naturally of consequence under the circumstance. At the centre of the film is not a romantic liaison. Rather it is the character of Day-Lewis' Hawkeye, an adoptive Mohican, caught in the uncomfortable cleft of being a settler but brought up and loyal to the culture and code of the Mohawk. His is a performance that is not matched by any other actor, removing him from the A-list to the Olympian list (the likes of Brando etc.) and prompting one critic to reminisce during the touting of Gangs of New York, 'this was the movie that proved that he could do anything'.The supporting cast up the game to try to meet the pace. Madeleine Stowe is well cast as Cora, the principled love interest to Hawkeye but (for all my entirely subjective admiration) does not seem quite as convincing as either Jodhi May (as her naive younger sister) or Maurice Roeves (as her father) manage. All other parts from Wes Studi's brutal Magua right through to extras are attended on. Most impressive however are the rugged North East backdrops and both the large and small scale attention to detail that puts this to best use. A rich and grown-up romance of epic sensibility. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must see film for romantics at heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first viewed this film I had no pre-warning as to what to expect which I prefer before viewing as I go into the film not anticipating or expecting anything. I can safely say that after the first viewing I felt exhausted! The cinematography, soundtrack, choice of actors and so much more left me stunned. O.K., historically perhaps there was a degree of poetic licence, however, for sheer entertainment value 'Last of the Mohicans'was poignant, tragic, humorous, violent and terribly romantic. I have watched and rewatched this film time and time again with the same amount of enthusiasm, in fact more each time I see it. Although Hawkeye - Long Carbine(Daniel Day Lewis) and Cora Munro (Madelaine Stowe) are obviously the main love-interest characters, I found the roles of Uncas (Fred Schweig) and Alice (Johdi May) actually more poignant and definitive for the story line. I find myself more and more stopping and rewinding to view their interaction in the film. The battle scenes from the first - Magua leading the Major and the Munro sisters to Fort William Henry - to the climatic cliff top scene are pure adrenalin and heart stoppingly realistic. Overall, this movie is well worth your time to view and view and view!!! Love it, each time I see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day-Lewis makes this love story worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I viewed "The Last of the Mohicans" I was amazed by the scenery and thought, "I'll bet this area has some great motorcycle roads." When I found out where it was actually filmed, in North Carolina, I realized I was there less than a year ago, on a motorcycle, and the roads indeed are great! Somehow I had previously understood that Day-Lewis' character, Hawkeye, was that last Mohican the title refers to. Instead, it is his adoptive father, who utters the line in the last scene, after his blood son died. Hawkeye had been orphaned as a small boy, and raised by the Mohicans. Wes Studi, a full-blooded Cherokee from Oklahoma, is simply great as the renegade warrior.some SPOILERS follow, read further only if you've seen the movie, OK??Set loosely upon historical times when the British and French were battling for control of the "new world", the core story involves the renegade warrior seeking revenge for the death years ago of his children, and the "White Hair" (British General) taking his wife as his own. At least three times he repeats, "I will kill the White Hair, and eat his heart, and kill his children so that his seed will be wiped away." Turns out that Hawkeye has fallen for the General's daughter, so at 1:15 into the film, after the British surrender their fort to the French, and are leaving, the renegade warrior and his men ambush them, the General is killed, and Hawkeye manages to escape with the two daughters.The rest of the movie is the chase and escape until the renegade warrior is killed, and Hawkeye gets the girl. Good movie, good action, Studi plays an absolutely detestable character. Day-Lewis once again shows that he can play any character, and do it better than probably anyone else could. The DVD has no extras, but the DTS surround sound is realistic and during one scene where they are all hiding in a cave under a waterfall, the sound surrounds you so that you feel you really are in that cave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overlooked Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I think back on the best films of the 1990's this one always seems to slip my mind. But then I'll see it again and be left wondering why this isn't more well regarded. It was relatively successful at the box office and well reviewed upon release but failed to gain attention at the end of the year awards season. This is probably Michael Mann's best film (although a valid argument could be made for his epic crime saga "Heat"), a talented director who later became president of the "running time be damned" club of obsessive pretentious film makers. It is an excellent adaptation of James Fennimore Cooper's classic tale of the French and Indian War. It's got everything you would want in a historical epic: beautiful cinematography of mountain vistas and valleys, a pulse-pounding and wonderful musical score, taut direction, romance, solid battle scenes, some great hand to hand combat sequences (I love the edge of the mountain climax), and riveting performances from the two leads (the always excellent Daniel Day Lewis and the ravishing Madeleine Stowe). This is a great film, but unfortunately may only be known to future generations as one of those films they air on TNT or TBS every so often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it strays significantly from James Fenimore Coopers novel, it is one of the great "histo-dramas" of the late twentieth century. Daniel Day Lewis' Natty Bumpo (based on Daniel Boone) brings the spirit of the long hunter to life extremely well. No movie will allow the full development of the characters as found in the original book. Remember, Natty Bumpo is based on Daniel Boone, and the exploits are an amalgam of events occurring during the French And Indian War. Boone's exploits took place during and after the Revolutionary War. Colonel Munro actually survived the attack on Fort William Henry. Magua is patterned on the famous Indian Pontiac. In the novel, Cora dies. Uncas is killed by Magua in error. I don't believe there can ever be a reconciliation of the differences. So let's enjoy the movie for what it is - a great French and Indian War tale of love, loyalty, hate, heroism, and sacrifice.Director Mann does an extraordinary job of bringing out the "darkness" of the era. It seems typical of his ability to create a moodiness to his films. For my taste, the movie could be lengthened, and really be made into a classic for all times.There have been earlier comments relating to the accuracy of the rifle which Hawkeye uses. He does not use a British Brown Bess smoothbore musket. His rifle, patterned on early Pennsylvania rifles, was very accurate. Killing shots at ranges beyond 100 yards were not rare for the expert rifleman. His shooting skills were demonstrated early on during the deer hunt. To get a real feeling for the period, try reading Montcalm and Wolfe, by Parkinson. It's a very accurate history of the time, and written only 50 years after Coopers novel.For pure entertainment and the feeling it gives for the period, I would rate it an "8".</fullReview>

It provides an excellent mixture of romance, wit, and action to cater to most movie fans. While the dialogue and plot enchants you, the cinematography has a magic all its own. I read the book when I was in the fifth grade because, thinking since I loved the movie so well, I would enjoy the book, too. Big disappointment. The book, which I realize was written over a century ago, lacks all of the movie's charm. Its truly boring. The movie takes the important aspects of the book, and melds them into an attractive, enthralling, exciting story. They also switched the names of the sisters around, too, but that doesn't paricularly matter. I would definitely recommend the movie to everyone, but the book...eh, not so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never got to see this unforgettable picture when it was released back in September/92. I've owned the Laser Disc of it for over three years,but never got around to watching it until last summer(99). One of my fellow co-workers told me that it was his favorite films of all time,so I invited him over to watch it with me. I can't believe that this much time has gone by without me ever watching it. This movie is amazing! I just finished ordering the soundtrack for it from Amazon.($13.99) They wanted $36.99 for it here in Canada! This is another one of those film's where the music adds so much more impact to it. I sometimes will put on the part near the end when they are running up the side of the mountain.That scene along with the music leading up to the final cliffside battle with actor Wes Studi is one of the best climatic scene's ever filmed! There are no words to describe the power of that part.Wes Studi was excellent in his part as Magua. I now have the DVD of it, but was a little disappointed that there were no extras with it. Not even the stinkin trailer! But the movie itself &amp; the sound &amp; picture quality far out weight that minor error. I hope director Michael Mann will release a collector's edition of it someday.This movie is worth that much... Thank-You Chris,for telling me to watch this classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about this film is that it captures James Fenimore Cooper's well-concealed message, that more than one lifestyle was being destroyed as distant monarchs squabbled over the vast reaches of North America; those of the Indian, and of the free frontiersman. Unfortunately, the most favourable aspects of both existences have been laid on with a trowel at the expense of other less noble but more human qualities. In particular, we never see drunken Indians (a distressing result of the contact between the white and red man). Also, Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) hardly ever breaks into authentic frontier jargon, nor does he ever refer even to his mortal foes among the Indians as "varmints" or "mingoes". (I am sure Cooper meant the last to be an insult in some Indian languages).That said, every individual character is brilliantly depicted, even with some touches added which were not part of the original book; Major Heyward for example is much more complex than Cooper's original "Open Hand", but thereby adds a lot to the plot.The film also introduces a sub-plot concerning the antipathy between british and american characters and this adds to the credibility.The action sequences faithfully depict all the incidents in the book, and are all breathtaking cliffhangers. The film is worth seeing for these, and the scenery alone.Finally, Wes Studi is the most authentic and most terrifying Magua ever depicted on screen, and he should perhaps have had an Oscar for this role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Mann is one of the most noteworthy filmmakers in Hollywood today. As usual (e.g., The Thief, Heat), Mann picks up great music and matches the cinematography to suit the soundtrack. When Daniel Day Lewis and Russell Means run, the camera appears to "run" with them in pace with the music. Lewis' acting has been hailed but I thought Means and Studi contributed as much or more as American Indians.I saw the movie a second time and I found the music, editing and photography were outstanding. Mann as a director was better in Heat, but the music and photography is better in this work of Mann. The story is so good that people often miss out on enjoying the wonderful filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Production of a Neglected Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I'm always hungry for a frontier epic. I think the theme of confronting the American (or Russian, as in "Dersu Uzala") wilderness for the first time can never be overtold.And just how do I define a "frontier" movie? Any story of people in a land before its settlement. In the case of America, before 1860 or, better yet, before 1776."Northwest Passage," "The Black Robe," and now "Last of the Mohicans" . . .Wonderful production values here - spectacular scenery, authentic props, convincing warfare - and, contrary to the impression given by other reviewers, the romance element doesn't overwhelm the other plot elements. Nor does one come away from this film not knowing that the French and Indian wars were NOT between the French and the Indians. (How's that for a triple negative?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film That Suffers Slightly From Hollywood Nationalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During The French Indian War Major Duncan Heyward is given the task of escorting Cora and Alice the two daughters of Colonal Munro to Fort William Henry . During there journey they are betrayed Magua but are saved from certain death by Hawkeye , an adopted Mohican warrior . Upon arriving at the fort they find it under siege by the French . Worse than that Hawkeye due to Major Heyward's jealousy finds himself guilty of sedition and faces a sentence of death When this movie was released in 1992 it seemed to stay at the top of the US box office for eternity and was my tip to absolutely dominate the Oscars the following year . As it turned it only picked up one nomination for sound which was an absolute travesty since both picture , costume design , original score and cinematography should have been automatic choices with Day Lewis and Studi being probables for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actors along with Michael Mann as director. Even today when watching it you're surprised that a beautiful and involving movie was ignored when the back slapping award ceremonies were dishing out awards . It remains a movie that shows Hollywood movie making at its best That said it does suffer slightly from Hollywood at its worst . Much of the blame might lie in the original source novel by James Fenimore Cooper but you can guarantee Hollywood will put the boot in to someone given half the chance and that is the slight vein of Anglophobia throughout the film . The British are foppish fools , untrustworthy and easily defeated by both Native Americans armed with nothing more than a tomahawk and the French . If Fenimore's novel was adapted by a French film company the British might have been portrayed more fairly . Looking on the bright side at least it's a million miles better than THE PATRIOT and umpteen other similar films I could name and LAST OF THE MOHICANS still remains a very impressive American film helped in no small part by a largely British cast</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death and honour are thought to be the same, but today I have learned that sometimes they are not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last of the Mohicans is directed by Michael Mann who also co-adapts the screenplay with Christopher Crowe from James Fenimore Cooper's novel of the same name. It stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Eric Schweig, Jodhi May, Steven Waddington and Wes Studi. Music is scored by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman and cinematography by Dante Spinotti.1757 during the French and Indian War, Hawkeye (Lewis), a white man who was adopted by the Mohicans, finds himself on a perilous journey to escort a couple of British sisters to their father's fort. This journey brings him, and his companions, into conflict with Magua (Studi), a sadistic Huron warrior seeking revenge on the girls' father.Inspired by the Randolph Scott film of the same name made in 1936, Michael Mann gives his all to create a stirring classical epic fit to sit in the company of the historical greats of old. Visually it's a treat of some magnitude, where aided by Spinotti, Mann frames his characters in the glorious vistas provided by the North Carolinas. For those with a bent for historical narratives, Mann's film also is not found wanting, in fact it's a cerebral delight. There's romantic strands that sit right in the colourful quilt, action expertly staged and handled by the talented director and the cast, led by a superbly athletic and serious Day-Lewis, are impressive and doing justice to the requisite characters written on the page, and the musical score enhances mood with swirling beauty coupling with primitive potency that wraps itself snugly around the story.Mann gets all the key ingredients right, but it's his ability to balance the human drama with the energised action that is most impressive. The film is also thankfully devoid of boorish filler, this is a troubled time in history, with much political activity and complex racial manoeuvres, but Mann doesn't need to fill the screen with political posturing and drawn out speeches. We know all we need to know about the period in question, but the story is kept intimate, the focus on a small group of people, of whose fate we most assuredly have interest in. While on the edges of the frame we know we are witnessing the death of an era, for better or worse on different sides of the coin. Also pays to note that Mann's well known penchant for the meticulous is evident as well, for he details the native characters with considerable care.It's not flawless, accents fluctuate, the odd fake look slips into the production design and the director does what many American directors do, they come dangerously close to caricaturing their British officers, but this is still great heroic escapism tinged with romanticism. Something for everyone who loves classical cinema in fact. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best historical adventures of the nineties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, Hollywood has always taken more interest in the Old West than in the Even Older East. The opening up of the eastern half of the North American continent during the eighteenth and early nineteenth century has inspired comparatively few films compared with the vast number about "how the West was won". Even the War of Independence has not been a particularly popular subject, despite its central role in American history, and "The Last of the Mohicans" is one of the few films about the French and Indian War. (Others include another version of the same story from 1936, which I have not seen, and "North-West Passage" from the 1950s).Although it is an "Eastern" (ostensibly set in upstate New York but actually filmed in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina) the film has a similar epic grandeur to many Westerns; Kevin Costner's "Dances with Wolves" from two years earlier seems to have been an influence. (Both films have fine orchestral scores).It is set in 1757, with the British and the French, together with their respective colonists and Indian allies, battling for control of North America. The main characters are Colonel Munro, a British officer, his two daughters Cora and Alice, the frontiersman Hawkeye, another officer Major Duncan Heyward, the Mohican Indian Chingachgook and his son Uncas, and the Huron Indian Magua. Although Hawkeye is a white man by birth, he was raised as an Indian and regards Chingachgook as his adopted father. The plot is a complex one, revolving around the war itself, the rivalry between Hawkeye and Major Heyward for Cora's affections and Magua's obsessive hatred for Munro and the British.The film makes a few changes to James Fenimore Cooper's novel. In the book Hawkeye's real name was Natty Bumppo; here he becomes, more plausibly, Nathaniel Poe. Magua remains the villain of the piece, but here his villainy is more motivated; in the novel he was simply a bad character, but here his obsession with revenge stems from the deaths of his children, killed by soldiers under Munro's command. In the original Heyward was in love with Alice rather than Cora, who (interestingly enough for a novel written in the first half of the nineteenth century) was of racially mixed origins, Munro's first wife having been a mulatto. Nothing is made of Cora's racial heritage in the film, and we can assume that she is supposed to be white. (Even in recent decades Hollywood can be squeamish about the subject of inter-racial marriage).In the 1980s Daniel Day-Lewis made his name in more intellectual British and Irish films such as "A Room with a View" and "My Left Foot". "The Last of the Mohicans" showed that he could also star as an action hero in a major Hollywood production. (It was his first film since "My Left Foot" three years earlier, the first in a number of lengthy breaks in his cinema career). He brought to his role as Hawkeye his own idiosyncratic version of the Method and his normal obsessive preparation. He allegedly learned to hunt, shoot and fish like an eighteenth-century trapper, spent weeks camping out in the wilds and insisted on remaining in character off the set, even carrying his rifle with him at all times. Day-Lewis' methods have won him a reputation for eccentricity, yet I have to say that they work; I have never seen him give a bad performance, and only rarely one that is anything less than excellent.Day-Lewis is not the only excellent thing about this movie. Some of the other actors are also very good, especially Wes Studi as the vindictive Magua. The orchestral score is stirring and the photography of the wooded mountain landscapes is strikingly beautiful. There is a particularly moving ending to the film. In all, this is one of the best historical adventures of the nineties. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of all time, sadly damaged by DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last of the Mohicans" is one of my favorite movies. It is an excellent portrayal of the early United States of America, done in a historically accurate style, not a stylized version of history like many modern movies use. While drawing us into that time period, it does not feel at all like a documentary. This is a great action movie, a great adventure movie, a great romance, a great movie in general. And above all, every frame is fantastically beautiful, as is every second of the soundtrack. Even if for some hard-to-imagine reason you are uninterested in the story, you will find it impossible to look away from the screen because it is just that visually engaging.So, all in all, one of my favorite movies ever, so without hesitating I bought the Enhanced Widescreen Director's Expanded Edition DVD. What a disappointment! All of my favorite Hawkeye one-liners were removed! No more "Someday I think you and I are going to have a serious disagreement." No more "Haven't you got anything better to do on the lake today, Major?". I guess looking back Michael Mann decided to strip off that likable part of Hawkeye's character. So then why did he leave in "Well we kind of face to the North and, real subtle-like, turn left"? One wonders. Maybe Mann wants Hawkeye to start out a little flippant but become more serious as he becomes more involved in the Munro's affairs. I liked it better when the smart-mouthed part of his character survived the war.The DVD also lacks the great Clannad song "I Will Find You", which was included in the original version when the Mohicans are tracking Magua and the captive Cora and Alice. Another disappointing loss, perhaps due to licensing issues or something. The music that replaced it is boring, stripping that scene of the emotion it carried in the original version. Another musical beef: the music for the final cliff-side chase sequence is not included on the "official motion picture soundtrack", at least not in the same arrangement as in the movie.The addition to Chingachgook's final speech is debatable. It's not as offensive as the other edits, but it seems tacked on. Chingachgook did fine before, he doesn't need to predict the 21st century status of the American Indian for us, we can figure that out for ourselves. It's also irritating that the movie no longer ends with the phrase "The last of the Mohicans". I can certainly see why this scene was left out of the original version, even if only for the fact that the lighting is inconsistent with the original ending. The sun sure did set fast! On another Chingachgook note, I hated the slow-motion effect at the end of his fight with Magua. This is The Last of the Mohicans, not Street Fighter. Another Director's Cut mistake.Frankly I didn't think any of the "expanded" scenes added anything to the film. In fact most of them I hardly noticed. Mostly extra shots of cannons firing and whatnot, which is not what this movie is about, and therefore not needed in larger quantities. I was much more disappointed by what was lost.Still, buying the DVD is worth it just for the last 20 minutes or so. Here Mann proves that dialogue is absolutely unnecessary for good storytelling. Nobody says anything of any consequence for this entire act, yet if you can watch that stretch of film and not feel some kind of emotional response, there's something wrong with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A master at work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't have to look very hard to recognize when someone is a master of his or her craft. Saying that, for example, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays were masters of their craft is not a risky venture and neither is an assertion that Shakespeare was a master playwright. But when it comes to directing motion pictures, that assertion is a bit harder to make. For one reason, it is fair to argue that, in the movie-making hierarchy, direction ranks at best, third in order of importance behind acting and writing. But when the actors and writers differ yet a catalog of movies is populated mostly by excellent examples of the medium, it goes without say that any common denominator should be looked at as a reason for the consistent excellence of the same. By that rationale, it can be said that Michael Mann is a master of his craft. His resume certainly indicates a preponderance for great directing. "Thief", "Heat", and "The Insider" are all excellent films; so is "The Last of the Mohicans" New Jerseyan James Fennimore Cooper's novel of the same name has been translated to the screen many times, with varying levels of success. The latest version on film is Mr. Mann's 1992 production starring Daniel Day Lewis, Madelaine Stowe, and Wes Studi. I guess it can be said that it is to my detriment that I have not seen most of the prior productions of this classic story. However, I don't believe that prior accomplishments and/or failures in telling this story have very much bearing on the merits of the most modern envisioning of the same. Mr. Mann's realization of his and Christopher Crowe's script is as successful a dramatization of elements in Cooper's story as can be expected from a two hour movie. In short, the plot is fine; it leaves little to be desired.The performances of the actors, on the other hand, leave nothing to be desired. Yes, the most visible of all the cast, Daniel Day Lewis comes across as over the top at times. The "stay alive" exchange behind the waterfall in the third act of the movie comes to mind as far as this goes. But this minor trifle may be mitigated by shortcomings in the writing; a couple of the other lines Lewis' Hawkeye has in the movie seem to reinforce that idea. Nitpicking aside, Lewis delivers a Hawkeye that is supremely confident, charismatic, and almost haughty in his righteousness. It is a performance akin in it's excellence to Lewis' Gerry Conlon, Danny Flynn, and Will Cutting. It is not the best performance of this movie which is enough of an endorsement of the quality of the whole cast. That honor has to go to Wes Studi. His Magua is so irrevocably evil that you can't help but root against the guy. His cold and disaffected predictions of what he will do to the "gray hair" are indications of a psychopathic nature. Yet, when you hear why Magua hates Munro, you begin to doubt your own feelings against him. Then the revelation during the Huron tribal council scene at the end of the film that revenge is not enough for Magua reinforces your first opinion of the guy.The other performances in the movie are quite good as well. Jodhi May's mousey Alice Munro serves as an excellent metaphor for what war can do to someone as she spends the vast majority of the movie in a state of perpetual shellshock. It's a performance that also serves to contrast superbly Madeleine Stowe's exceptional depiction of Cora Munro as a strong and fiercely willful woman of the frontier. Steven Waddington is good at portraying Major Heyward, a noble soul buried underneath a warrior blinded by duty. And Russell Means and Eric Schweig are very effective in their roles of Hawkeye's "Indian" father and brother.Another star not yet mentioned is one that doesn't appear on screen but works behind the cameras. That is Italian cinematographer Dante Spinotti. That this movie's visuals are gorgeous isn't a surprise given the locations where it was shot. What is a surprise is the stark contrast created by the juxtaposition of the beauty of nature and the ugliness of war. The exceptional and comparative visual quality of both in this movie is best exemplified by the ambush sequence in the forest after the surrender of Fort William Henry. It is here that the two are brought together splendidly almost like a real life realization of the "Yin Yang" symbol. Visuals on this level are no accident just as the fact that Mann has worked with Spnotti on a number of other films is no coincidence.Which brings this review full circle. All the individual elements of a movie can be excellent but if they're not brought together effectively, then the final product will be muddled. But Mann is a master of his craft. He brings in the right cinematographer. He consults on and writes the right script. He directs talented actors to say and do the right thing. Finally, he blends all the elements into an excellent example of how a movie can always serve, at the very least, the purpose of great escapism.8.5 stars of 10</fullReview>

I did see the movie by Ron Howard, The Missing, but found it boring in comparison. The Indians are portrayed with a dark twist but the reason they did what they did in the movie was for money, something unneeded previously in their culture, but certainly a trait of white people. I have visited the Cherokee many times and am always left with the same feeling, which I share, of: "Leave us alone, let us live our lives."

Buy a good video camera, head to Shenandoah or Blue Ridge mountain and I guaranty that you'll make some artistic videos of nature so is taking some good videos of national parks considered art? probably! But that's not enough to make a movie neither artistic nor entertaining. This film has severe production problems which gave audience feel of a TV movie rather than a cinematic work. Everything looked polished, both Indians and colonials were shaved, clean and dressed up. Indians were the worse speaking plain English with just some misplaced words! But that's not all. There was something seriously wrong with the screenplay. It was slow, boring and lacked almost any conflict. The Mohican was flirting with the British lady in broad daylight while the presumed suitor/fiancé was acting like a carrot. No emotion, no conflict and I doubt if it was even historically accurate. Acts were not notable also. Daniel Day Lewis delivered a flat performance, probably not his fault, there was nothing special about his character.

The battle scenes were filmed with admirable ability and the violence is never excessive. Madeleine Stowe is great in the role of Cora, the older sister, mature and courageous; and so is Jodhi May as Alice, the younger sister, subtle and inexperienced. Also the actors are very good: in particular Russell Means(Chingachgook) and Eric Schweig(Uncas), because they are Natives and play their characters with truthfulness. Perhaps you believe that's a war movie, but I don't see it that way! I think LOTM is above all a movie about romance. The love between Cora and Hawkeye, two characters that seems very refractory to love, is a passionate love. They have a good love story, but is the other love story that strike closer to my heart and mesmerize me: I'm talking about the love between Uncas and Alice?the best love story since Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet!</fullReview>

He knew exactly where to shoot the scenery for maximum authenticity, especially at the end, (SPOILER AHEAD) where Hawkeye, Uncas, and Chingachgook attempt to rescue Alice and fight Magua. I would definitely recommend this movie for history classes. The battle sequences were very realistic and the music put you in tune with the battles. It made you feel as if you were actually there fighting in those battles. This film deserves to go down as one of the best war movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematography is amazing in this movie. The shots are well-thought out and almost every scene has its own beauty, especially the waterfall scenes. This isn't enough to save it, but it's nice.The main problem is that there is no chemistry between Lewis and Stowe. Lewis seems so intent on creating an inner world for his character that he forgets there are other people around him. Stowe was OK, Studi was good, Steven Waddington was very good and may be the best thing about it. But all of the characters are flat and uninteresting.It's a good story, and I'm saddened to see it mangled by this attempt. It's as if the makers of this movie wanted us to know this was LITERATURE and must be taken SERIOUSLY, and therefore everything is BIG and DRAMATIC and STENTORIAN. There is precious little subtlety, which is odd for an adaptation of a classic novel. I always cringe when a good battle scene is placed in an inferior movie, because all the work that went into that scene to make it look so good could have been put into the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

My problem with "Last of the Mohicans" starts with the fact that director Michael Mann made it difficult to follow plot developments. I found myself guessing every 10 minutes about what had happened.Secondly, it wasn't clear until late in the movie that Hawkeye's Mohican companions were his step-father and step-brother. Since these characters weren't developed, one feels next to nothing when the step-brother is killed.Thirdly, the romance between Hawkeye and Cora seems to spring fully-grown from a five-minute conversation under the stars one night. When it was clear to me that the two were supposed to be in love, my reaction was, "Gee, that was fast."Fourthly, the director (and probably the writers, too) pretend that the smooth-bore muskets used at the time were as accurate as rifles. Hawkeye fires at moving targets and never misses. At one point he clearly takes a long range shot to put a man being tortured out of his misery. Even 50 years after the time the film is set muskets were next to useless beyond 100 yards. They also delivered a substantial kick when fired, and Hawkeye performs the impossible by firing two at once, from the hip, on the run. No way in hell that's possible.Lastly, I was surprised to find Daniel Day-Lewis' acting so wooden and unconvincing, considering his reputation. The best thing about this movie is the special effects, which is a compliment I seldom make. I think Mann accurately reproduced the sound and the amount of smoke that muskets produce in battle. And the scenes of the fort under siege were well done, particularly the shot from long range when the sights preceded the sounds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how a movie that came out in 1992 can withstand the passage of time and still be that good to watch. The special effects are prety basic (its he 90s be reasonable) but it still looks more realistic than any blockbuster movie you will see, and the reason for that is the superb acting from the basic characters to the secondary to the background actors and that goes to show directors Michael Manns vision and charisma.Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe have a special kind of on screen chemistry that goes to show the superb casting of this movie.But the acting asside the realism of this movies climate is unique and can very difficulty be created again today. Its truly a must watch that also withstands rewatches and rerewatches and so on.9/10 from me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the best film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will only write one review on IMDb and this is it. If you want to see a film that encompasses everything that is great about cinema then I recommend this movie as it is easily the greatest one of the 1000's of movies I have seen in my life. It delivers on every level and is the only movie I can say that has a perfect beginning, middle, ending, soundtrack, casting, setting, background, with perfect directing and acting. It has enough substance to its plot to make 3 or 4 movies just by the depth in story line alone, that's not taking into consideration the incredible acting, the beautifully crafted character development and the spectacular attention to historical detail portrayed throughout. There is no one star in this film, there are many. There is no one scene that defines it, the whole film is a work of beauty. Unlike a review that reads like a trailer, I won't go into specifics to try to pinpoint the highlights of the film or overly praise it achievements, since it is complete and perfect and such a movie will speak for itself once seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defines Epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an exceptional rendering of Cooper's old tale about the so-called French and Indian Wars, which in Europe was called the Seven Years War. There's the merest hint of it here but this provided the springboard for the Revolutionary War. England was at war with France and was nearly broke, in part from defending its colonies in America. England imposed taxes on the colonies to help pay its debt. The taxes included taxes on tea, and the colonials saw it as "taxation without representation." I guess we know where that led.Back to the movie. Wow -- what scale! The photography by Dante Spinotti is just short of magnificent. He gets it just right without revealing how much effort he puts into each shot. He's easy going too, the DP on two movies I worked in. Michael Mann is in directorial control. Together they have committed to celluloid a memorable shot of Fort William Henry under siege by the French. The first we see of the fort is nothing but what looks like a distant fireworks display on the Fourth of July -- behind the tree line, some vermilion flashes of light reflected from clouds of smoke and seconds later the barely discernible pops of cannon fire.I won't go on about the plot. It's complicated. And it's not unfamiliar: the man of nature saving the innocents who represent civilization. Shane was such a figure. So were Hondo and Tarzan.French and English exchange cannon fire and occupy fortified positions. They march through the dank forests in step, wrapped in bright red jackets and topped by peculiar decorative hats. The Huron Indians who have sided with the French have no such encumbrances. They're half naked, they know the terrain, and they have the advantages that all irregulars have, whether Lawrence of Arabia's Bedouin or those now fighting an asymmetric war in the Middle East.Daniel Day Lewis is credible in the role of the white child adopted by the Mohican Indians. Madeleine Stowe is stunning. The battle scenes are staged well and are particularly brutal. Wes Studi, as the bitter Huron Magwah, rips open the chest of a British officer and raises the still beating heart in his fist.And Studi gives an impressive performance. With his top knot and war paint and pebbled complexion, he's compellingly ugly. His character is a Huron and the Hurons spoke an Iroquoian language, entirely different from the Alqonquian of the Mohicans. But nobody seems comfortable speaking any Indian language, and for good reason. Mohican is already extinct and all of the Iroquoian languages are either extinct or severely endangered. There were no living speakers of either language to coach the actors, and both languages are hard to speak. Iroquoian has a series of consonants that can be written as "ktspyjam" -- as in "cat's pyjamas." Well, it looks like that was a little off topic. I don't know why I do that. I guess it's because the voices tell me to.Michael Mann deserves credit if for no other reason that his directorial style is classic. No glitz, no shaky cameras, no instantaneous editing. Well, not much quick editing anyway, and only a few purposeful shots in slow motion.The writers and the crew have taken what could have been -- and has been, in previous versions -- a stiff and uninvolving action tale, and turned it into rather more than that. It's a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film - one of America's greatest and most historically descriptive ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film after checking it out from a video store one Friday night, and I watched it 3 times straight! I have always regretted not seeing it in the theater, where it must have been overawing.It is amazing how many people around the world have seen and been awed by it as well ... and have had their understanding of the 1700s American frontier shaped by it. I have never read Cooper's book, and I doubt it would be up to this film version of it.The various passions it depicts - especially the love stories - are amplified by its grippingly intense, pulsating music.It does explain the basic, growing differences in attitudes and philosophies of British-American colonists and British military officers and politicians at that time.There are flaws - like historically inaccurate contact-exploding shells hitting Ft. William Henry - presumably for dramatic effect - but they can and should be forgiven.Madeleine Stowe's luminous intelligence and sensitivity/sexuality spotlight Cora's character. It should be noted that neither actor had to remove her/his clothes to make the love scene torrid.I prefer the original studio cut which includes 3 essential items: Hawkeye telling the Major he thinks they will someday have a serious disagreement, Hawkeye cockily asking the Major - pointing his pistol at H. from the other canoe - if he has nothing better to do on the lake today, and the Clannad lovesong impassioning the heroes' pursuit of Magua and his band with the captured girls and Major.However, the director's cut version I also have does include the Major's well-commanded action outside the fort's walls - a diversion from the courier starting off elsewhere - ordered by Col. Munro in the film. It also shows a bit more of the science of 1700s siegecraft and military engineering, which the studio cut should have had.Wes Studi's Magua is one of the great villains in film history, but even Magua is shown as human, albeit so deeply embittered. (Shocked at Alice's apparent intent to fall to her death, even he relents from killing her and wants her to live ... only to be rejected.)And Russell Means - whom I had not liked after the Wounded Knee Incident of 1973 - was a strong father figure worthy of respect.I cannot understand why anyone would down-rate this magnificent film.By the way, the sister of one of my great (great, x?) grandfathers, Susannah Willard Johnson, was captured for ransom along with her entire family by Indians allied to the French around this time. (Mercifully and miraculously they all survived, even her baby christened Captive, born and allowed to survive on the trail up north to Canada.) Her Narrative is an historically important piece of American literature.And I grew up in Rock Island Illinois, which was the site of Saukenauk, the capital village of the Sauk and Fox Indians, mentioned as rivals by Magua to the Sachem at the climax of the film. (Many years later, it was "the British Band" of Sauk War Chief Black Hawk that crossed back across the Mississippi from Ft. Madison to raid and campaign up through northern Illinois into Wisconsin: the Black Hawk War of 1832.) My ancestor, a pensioned British 1815 Napoleonic war veteran, survivor of the British Legion with Bolivar in Venezuela, and Scottish soldier of fortune, arrived in Rock Island in 1830 and is buried there.Lou Coatney</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still not the version I've been looking for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was introduced to James Fenimoore Cooper's novel through an abridged graphic version made for filmstrip projectors when I was a child, and I fell in love with it immediately. It was only much later that I found out that the original book is painfully overlong and convoluted. I always thought, however, that the story itself, stripped of the unnecessary fat, would make an excellent movie full of exciting characters and non-stop explosive action. Unfortunately, none of the cinematic versions produced so far have been able to deliver that.Michael Mann's take on The Last of the Mohicans (a considerable box-office and critical success at the time) is like a National Geographic special meant to cure insomnia. An elegiac lament with gorgeous widescreen vistas and lots of slow motion for forced emotional impact, backed by epic synthesizer music. Mann weeded out most of the action, humour and excitement, he mixed up the relationships and characterisations (why, oh, why?) and he basically eliminated the title character, Uncas, from his own story.The result is a movie that has an overwhelming sense of longing, but not much else. A pondering, romantic picture that, in itself, might be beautiful to look at, but is ultimately boring and would never inspire a kid to know all about American Indians and the colonial history of the United States. Of course, it all depends on what you prefer ? a plodding adult version or a breathtaking adventure movie that would finally do justice to a story that has captured so many kids' imagination around the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chivalry along the Mohawk Valley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of "The Last of the Mohicans" is unlikely to date all that much. Although made in the early 1990's, it is set in a time over 200 years before, and captures the era beautifully.I have always been fascinated by this period of history probably from seeing Spencer Tracy as Robert Rogers in "Northwest Passage" ? I have read that James Fennimore Cooper partly modelled the character of Hawkeye on Rogers.In some ways Cooper's book has similarities with Sir Walter Scott's "Ivanhoe", which was published a few years before; outsider hero, women in need of rescue and a ferocious adversary with an eye on the same woman, all set against epic sieges and battles. But Cooper set his story six centuries later during the French and Indian Wars in North America with plumed helmets, chainmail and swords replaced with Mohawk haircuts, breechclouts and tomahawks.Cecil B DeMille's "Unconquered" is the other big movie set during the period, but it looks pretty clunky when compared to this visual feast ? as do all the other versions of "The Last of the Mohicans".Michael Mann's film transports us to another era. It's comforting to know the filmmakers actually found enough wilderness to film in without encountering power towers, amenities blocks and 'Do Not Feed the Bears' signs.The cast is perfect: Daniel Day-Lewis makes a lean and athletic Hawkeye and Madeleine Stowe as Cora is a heroine you could believe the guys would go that extra yard to save. Wes Studi as Magua is suitably ferocious as just about everybody's enemy.Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman came up with a memorable, Celtic-flavoured score, which reflected the background of many of the settlers of the time. Celtic music was particularly popular around the 1990s, but I was fascinated to hear this soundtrack album played often by the young people in the office where I worked along with the usual alternative metal, industrial rock and g-funk.Although the film is obviously meticulously researched, the ear occasionally picks up on a too-modern piece of dialogue, but it's a minor point. The whole thing is such an intriguing, superbly crafted adventure that it just sweeps you along. It's hard to believe it's almost 25-years old. There really aren't too many films like it these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blending of Ethereal Imagination &amp; Down to Earth Tribal Warfare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Historical Action/Romance with a powerful visual palette and a stirring soundtrack make this Michael Mann Film one of His Best. Neither completely Historically Accurate or faithful to the Literary Source Material, the Director nevertheless more than makes up for it with rousing Action Scenes, Poetic (ironically) non-verbal scenes, and tight pacing and editing.It's a complete Entertainment awash in the Natural Environment that gives it Gravitas and is so breathtakingly exciting to watch that it encompasses the Viewer and makes clear its Time and Place.Some may say that it is Ultra-Slick and therefore lacks a certain unscrubbed patina better suited for the Story. But Mann chooses to make it something like a Modern Storybook rather than a Hefty Gritty Novel or a visitation to an Historical Event.The Cast is superb and engaging on both sides of the issues employed in this Adventure set in Early America. All the Participants, English, French, Native Americans, and Militia are shown in equal light and it makes for an even handed account of the wide-open environment.Overall, the Cast lead by Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe with support from Wes Studi as "Magua" are fine, but it is the Director's Film and He makes the locations come more than Alive and at times it is mesmerizing and surreal, befitting its ethereal ambiance of a Time long past, and blending it with Romantic Imagination and down to Earth Tribal Warfare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to know what life was really like in the colonial days and the start-up of what we now call The United States, well here it is. Anyone could come out here and settle but making it work was another matter. War, Indians, food, survival and no second chances made it a harsh but as real life as one could have. Earned not given. Outstanding performances by all the players too. Lots of different ranges on the emotions take place here and you go with them too. the music helps that along nicely as you journey with the main players and watch each get what providence and or destiny has in store for them. The ending will cause some strong reflection so pause and allow it do speak to your heart. Recommend quality snack and even a good meal while watching plus a tasty drink too. No cell phones or texting etc. Give in to the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeous masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Terrence Malick lyrically explored the relationship between settlers, natives and nature in The New World, Michael Mann crafted the emotionally gripping, beautifully feral The Last Of The Mohicans, which to me me is the best film version of Cooper's book. Daniel Day Lewis is a force of nature as Nathaniel Hawkeye, the white man raised by his adoptive Native father (Russell Means) and living in the wild. Madeleine Stowe is a dark haired candle of radiance and fierce spirit as the lovely Cora Munro, brought from the prim, lacy traditions of England out to the wild, uncompromising new land, with her impressionable, naive sister (Jodi May). Wes Studi gives the bitter hearted warrior Magua a steady grace and brutal resolve. The film is lovingly made, and although it drags a tiny bit in the middle with a lengthy battle sequence that although is beautifully done, could have been streamlined a bit. But it's all worth it for those last twenty minutes, man. Holyyy hell does this movie have an ending. When the final, white knuckle climax happens atop the scenic yet unforgiving Promentory Vista, hearts, bones and dreams are broken as all the characters collide in a tragic, inevitable confrontation that leaves fire in your heart and tears in tour eyes. I still cry every time at this sequence, it's that stirring and memorable. James Newton Howard provides a legendary, soul stirring musical score that swells for this end sequence and carries it to transcendent heights. Mann directs with a compassionate, objective eye, never designating anyone as the good or bad guy, but simply showing us human beings, fighting for survival, love and revenge in a land only just being discovered. A real classic and one of the best of the 90's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Satisfying Period Epic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last of The Mohicans is the type of movie that will stay in your memory after the credits have rolled. The primary aspect of the movie that I am infatuated with is the score. It is a perfect accompaniment for the flair and the exuberance that is shown by the characters on screen. I must confess that the sole reason why I saw this film was to see Daniel Day Lewis. He has given singularly mesmerizing performances in Lincoln, Gangs of New York and There Will Be Blood. Here, once again he is in the lead role as the member of a community which is rapidly diminishing due to the ongoing war between the French and the British troops to conquer America. As expected, he is solid and believable in his role.This movie is not a character based movie due to which no actors were in reckoning for any acting awards. However, the casting was wonderful and there is no weak link in this film. As this is a period drama, the vivacious and opulent sets manage to capture the essence of the era in which the movie is taking place.I would highly recommend this movie to all movie lovers due to the immensely satisfying conclusion that resolves the story in a fitting manner.</fullReview>

I remember seeing it once when I was young, but I just watched it again 20+ years later and it easily is in my top 50 movies all time.It's easy to get caught up in the hype of Daniel Day Lewis being one the greatest actors to ever step on screen, but this movie embodies so much more than that. Sure, he delivers a classic performance, but the human element, and connection between the natives and nature is superb. Though Dances with Wolves is another great movie in the same genre, Kevin Costner failed to make that distinct connection where Michael Mann. That connection stirred up a number of emotions throughout the film, a true sign of a film that links to the heart and mind.The scenery and cinematography is gorgeous, as you would expect it to be in a basically unsullied land at that point in history. The score/sound for the movie is unreal also, as illustrated by the academy award win. Must see, instant classic that I will show my kids and theirs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Last of the Mohicans" (1992) is a very solid movie on all accounts. It has very solid acting by everyone involved (although Madeleine Stowe British accent appears and reappears suddenly). Great score, great cinematography, sets, and overall production design is great - it really looks like and feels like 18th century. Directing is solid here and script adapted from a novel is engaging and involving.Overall, "The Last of the Mohicans" is a very good action movie and a period piece. Yes, basically it's an action movie with unusual settings and simple but great and not your typical plot. It's not very deep in historical accuracies or native American culture, but it at least digs into the surroundings deep enough to keep you entertained by also sometimes amazed. At the running time 1 h 50 min this movie never drags and is entertaining and involving from the first 15 min. till the very last end. Solid cinema.</fullReview>

But it's finally an all-together thing that makes it really great: sequences extremely violent are succeeded by narrative scenes, and the tension, the suspense builds itself part by part, little by little until the wonderful final and the full dramatic score. Yes there is some big twists from the original text from Cooper but the adaptation gives us more, in particular with the Magua character who is not just a villain but a man whose honor and past dictate the present conduct like...Munro his very same enemy.Let say that everything in this movie just tend to greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I watch this DVD I am blown away by the music which is soaring and majestic and so is the cinematography. The performances are powerful and convincing and yet have great subtlety. The brutality of the combat is gut wrenching and the tenderness of the love and caring is heartwarming. Even the simple scenes with the Cameron family are a delight in their casual ordinariness and at the same time the affection and respect between all those sitting quietly talking around the dinner table creates a simple pleasure. I find Daniel Day-Lewis' performance to be incredibly masterful, he is Hawkeye and many others including Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Eric Schweig, and Jodhi May gave wonderful portrayals. Steven Waddington's portrayal of the lying and underhanded Maj. Duncan Heyward was riveting and Wes Studi, as Magua, was brilliant as usual and chilling.I highly recommend this movie even though I find the brutality of the scenes of combat to be disturbing taken as a whole the movie is simply brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic and compelling classic that touched me in my first viewing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to read the book someday if I have the chance, although I did watch this movie on a channel in TV with my father and stepmother to see if it would not only thrill me, but actually touch me. A few minutes later, it did and I looked at the positive reviews on Rottentomatoes before I became shocked at the reception it had. I was like, "A 97%? WOW! No wonder so many people like it" and I apparently agreed with the audience who watched this movie when it first came out that it's one of the best ones out there next to Titanic, The Lord of the Rings, and Batman.The story is quite simple as an adaptation: About a dying tribe called the Mohicans in which only two are left as well as one adopted white man named Hawkeye. These three men refuse to enter the militia for Britain in 1757 for they want freedom. On their way to Kentucky, they intercept Indians attacking a small regiment of British including the two daughters of an British Colonel named Edmund Munroe and Cora and Alice, on their way to a fort. As the three men lead the survivors to the fort, the two love stories take place, but the French and Indian War continues.Like I said before, I haven't read the book yet, but the story in this movie, although sprawling, is a much more compelling one with some subtly and quiet moments and the love story between the two main characters is also compelling as well. The pacing moves under two hours and didn't manage to bore me at all. The scenery is breathtaking with beautiful mountains and rivers and the cinematography is magnificent. The strongest aspects goes to three more things aside from Michael Mann's solid direction.First, there's the acting and in terms of cinema, it's excellent here. Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent as the main role, Russell Means did great as Hawkeye's father, Maurice Roves did great as Colonel Edmund and Madeleine Stowe did great as the love interest for Hawkeye along with a malevolent performance from Wes Studi. Second, there's the action sequences and boy were they great. I liked every single part of them especially the ones with the Indians and the British troops, but the strongest aspect of the action is the climax with an emotional feel to it. And third, but not the least, is the music from Trevor Jones. It gives the movie a sweeping and epic feel and scope and is one of his best music scores in a film since The Dark Crystal.Overall, I do agree that it's one of the best movies ever made and even though I never read the book (which I will someday), this would always be recommended to every single movie lover out there like most movies are. Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent historical drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: Michael Mann Stars: Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Steven WaddingtonStory: British and French troops are battling in colonial America, with aid from various native American war parties. The British troops enlist the help of local militia men. A British Colonel gets three native trappers to protect his daughters. A romance begins between one of the colonel's daughters (Madeleine Stowe) and an independent man who was reared as a Mohican (Daniel Day-Lewis). This complicates things for a British officer (Steven Waddington). They all try to survive in the middle of the harsh war. My brother has been trying to convince me to watch The Last Of The Mohicans for quite a while, and last night I finally watched it. And I enjoyed it immensely. Daniel Day-Lewis is fantastic as the native Mohican named Hawkeye. And that's really to be expected, as Day-Lewis is an insanely talented actor. The other characters are very well acted also, in particular Steven Waddington as the young British officer. The action scenes are well choreographed, although quite violent, especially in one surprisingly gruesome part (watch the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about). The music is what it needs to be: beautiful in the soft, emotional parts; fast-paced in the action scenes; and often ethnic-style instruments are used, making a tribal sort-of sound that matches well with the native Indian theme and the beautiful, old landscapes. Scenery is a plus in the movie, with plenty of long panning shots of lovely green forests and pristine lakes. There is a medium amount of romance in the movie, although it only really extends to kissing and nothing overly explicit is shown.All in all, this is quite a fantastic movie. It's superb for anyone who enjoys well-made, fantastically acted historical dramas. I definitely wouldn't recommend reading the book though, as pretty much everyone I know has described it as virtually unreadable. Certainly worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun and dramatic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Manne shows off his dedication and ambition in this large scale period piece set in the midst of the French Indian war. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Hawkeye, a white Native American who, along with his father and brother, protect a British Colonel's daughters from the dangerous Native American tribe threatening their safety. It's an explosive, dramatic, and grandiose story of adventure. It's definitely an exciting film to watch.The Last of the Mohicans doesn't tell an exceptional story and it doesn't have immaculate characters, but there's a certain element to the film that makes it good. Very good actually. It likely has to do with the grand production value that the film boasts at every corner with it's detailed costumes and sets, large sweeping locations, and a collection of fine actors giving it their all. The film also has a fantastic score that combines with the beautiful cinematography to make a very dramatic experience. Albeit over dramatic at points, but a sincerely well made film nonetheless.Some of these bigger and more ambitious films often times go right past me and I don't really remember them down the line. It's mostly just a matter of personal taste, but I can't deny the quality of The Last of the Mohicans. Michael Mann shows a lot of dedication to filmmaking through this film, as it notoriously went well over budget and time, and Mann allegedly would do about 20 takes for each shot. He's absolutely a determined filmmaker, and I would say it pays off when you see the production value of a film like The Last of the Mohicans. Despite it being a little cheesy, fairly straightforward, and a little too basic for my taste, the quality of the film can't be overlooked, and this is certainly a fun and exciting film overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One night in August 1993, when I wandered from my home town Luwuk, on a east peninsula of Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, to Makassar city for study at Hasanuddin University, I watched this movie in a "second class" cinema in the city of Makassar. Nineteen years pass since then until today (June 2, 2012), in my view, the Last of the Mohicans is one of the best films ever made by humans. This is a film that successfully blend perfectly and wonderful variety of complex elements and contrast in human life, namely, hatred, revenge, infighting, romanticism, love, obedience, bomb, courage, skill, adventure and wild. The Film is a romantic film with high quality and perfect resolution. But especially this film also became very good because combined with the soundtrack that fits perfectly. This movie deserves a 10 (perfect).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When all else is falling apart?love lives on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title goes, this film epitomizes the beginning of the decimation of whole Indian nations down to insignificant numbers due to colonization, war, disease, and commerce ? all of which were cumulatively devastating to the Indians both physically and psychically. This is the overall background of the movie, and violence runs almost throughout, from the beginning hunt to the last few minutes. Despite the sad and violent backdrop, the story is uplifted by the tense developing romance of Hawkeye (Daniel Day Lewis) and Cora (Madeline Stowe), and both of them give a sterling performance as the role seems to fit them perfectly. The romance is all the more intense because it is between two people who are so differently oriented and socially placed and also because it is fused with intense adventure. The script and direction provide several insights into Native American culture, one of which is right at the beginning when Russell Means performs a prayer ceremony over the fallen deer. Neat and economic script with nothing superfluous, beautiful photography, unforgettable musical score, brilliant dialogs?in short, no wasted moments, makes it a movie that can be seen several times, worth having in your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, strongly acted but too short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Mann's first feature post Miami Vice is a slickly made, beautifully photographed, well acted but slightly detached, and marred by an ending that feels far too abrupt. This weakness is the same issue that plagued the otherwise excellent Thief. The film takes place in 1757 during the French and Indian War, and focuses on a father, son and adopted white son , all living as the last of the Mohican Indians. Russell Means, Eric Schweig and Daniel Day Lewis play these characters very well, as Day-Lewis's intensity and charisma really shines through and is the anchor for the movie. The main antagonist, Magua, a Huron Indian, is very well played by native American actor Wes Studi, who is always captivating in these roles (particularly his performances in Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves and Terrence Malick's The New World) and the central dynamic of vengeance playing out between different characters and different levels is well constructed and well played. The major shortcoming is that most of the characters backgrounds and motivations could have done with more development, which would have led the audience have a greater interest in the characters. For example, the arc before Jodhi May's and Eric Schweig's characters could have been genuinely affecting and touching if more time and been devoted to letting it develop. The same goes for Madeleine Stowe's Cora and Steve Waddington's Major Haywood characters. Wes Studi's and Day Lewis's characters background, while explained verbally, doesn't have the same background as having these properly part of the film's narrative. The ending feels too abrupt and I was wishing for the film to have a proper epilogue, which would have rounded off the characters journeys' more fully. Issues with the original cut of the film being 3 hours, and the final film being shorter, may have been a reason for this.Nevertheless despite these gripes to quality of the film is impressive. Mann has found some great locations and the direction is first rate, particularly of the action sequences. Dante Spinotti's BAFTA awarding winning photography is impressive, particularly when showcasing the natural locations. Regular Mann collaborator's Dov Hoenig and Arthur Schmidt's editing is solid. However, it is the sound-scape of the film that is really impressive. Despite problems in production, mainly down to aforementioned issues around the running time, the hybrid score, which is a mix of styles works very well. The sound work by Chris Jenkins, Doug Hemphill, Simon Kaye and Mark Smith is first rate and not surprisingly won an Academy Award. Chris Jenkins has contributed to a large variety of high profile films, and obtained is second Oscar on this film, after collecting his first for Out of Africa. While this was Doug Hemphill's first Oscar, he has subsequently contributed his talents on films such as Almost Famous, Master and Commander and Walk the Line. Simon Kaye was a veteran of the industry, having worked on Charge of the Life Brigade and What a Lovely War, and also had won already won an Oscar, for his work on Oliver Stone's Platoon. This was Mark Smith's first Oscar, but he has subsequently worked a wide variety of high profile films. Overall an impressive film, with a great central performance by Day Lewis, but the drive to reduce the film's running time to approximately 1 hour 40 minutes is what prevented a potential masterpiece from being released, and instead let to a well made and enjoyable film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I thought that it was a little weak for an R, but then again, it's a little strong for a PG-13. This is the type of movie that some have said necessitate a rating in between the two. However, the rating has little to with the overall quality of the movie, and don't let the rating drive you away. All in all, i would say that this movie is no more graphic than Dances With Wolves, so i wouldn't worry. Just sit back and watch the awesome story take place. I won't spoil it for anyone, because this is just to good of a story to waste on spoilers. Just watch it and find out! I have only one complaint, and that is that the first few scenes went a little fast and that (not saying who, what, when, where, why) you cannot fire two long-barrel muskets akimbo(two at once). Other than that, it was a great movie. Just watch it and find out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start out with, the acting was superb from Daniel Day-Lewis, Wes Studi, Russel Means, Eric Schweig and Madeline Stowe. The intensity of the Mohawks, the passion of the frontier settlers, the arrogance of the British soldiers. The time period shows how the daughters of the British General are not very wise to the world and just what truly happens.Costumes and the re-enactment was very realistic. War is hell, and this movie shows it from the scalping of the British soldiers to the cannon fight at Fort William Henry.This movie has a lot in common with the old Alfred Hitchcock films, in that the music is subtly infused when needed. The ending of the movie with the build up of the "Main Title" music during the race to retrieve the two daughters will keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very violent movie - not for the squeamish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story takes place at a time in which the English were at war with the French, when early settlers were colonising America. It does open with a peaceful and harmonious scene - while the rest of the movie is largely action with horrific elements present (depicting all too accurately what happens with peoples are at war with one another) - with a little romance thrown in.It is certainly not a family movie, nor one for small children - even some late teens may find the realistic violence too distasteful perhaps? It is a beautifully crafted movie, that perhaps follow the traditional Hollywood treatment too closely. Your heartstrings will get pulled certainly as you care about the characters in this story - as their situation goes from bad to worse.It is certainly a movie worth watching - in spite of the violence and gore - and is a clear reminder of how difficult it is when cultures and countries clash.</fullReview>

And it also has two Oscar worthy performances given by Daniel Day Louis and Maladine Stowe.This movie truly is one of the greatest action and adventure movies ever.Ranks right up there behind the Indiana Jones Franchise.If you love great action and adventure and also like a good love story,you can not go wrong with this movie.When I first saw it was on tape. I said this may be good.And after I saw it I loved it so much I ran and bought the DVD.It has become defiantly one of my all time favorites.If you love great action and adventure,touching romance,great storytelling,great characters,and wonderful acting or just a good movie stop searching and go rent or buy this now.Believe me you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colonial conflict has scenic grandeur and beautiful music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The French and Indian War, circa 1757, is the setting for this entertaining slice of American history, replete with bravery, sacrifice, romance and treachery. James Fenimore Cooper's novel, a difficult and ponderous work, flows on screen here with simplicity and great beauty, and is enhanced by fine direction, acting and a beautiful, sweeping music score. Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe headline a solid cast that brings to life this early American work that Cooper himself failed to do. The British, in dire straits for military support, enlist the colonial militia to fight the French and their Indian allies at the risk of leaving their families defenseless in the face of their dangerous foe. The battle scenes are violent, drawn-out affairs, especially the Fort William Henry debacle that commander Marquis de Montcalm couldn't prevent. A major underlying theme of the picture is a Huron's blood vengeance quest against a British colonel which sets in motion the ambushes and animosity that define the movie's narrative. Russell Means and Eric Schweig along with Day-Lewis are the story's heroes and essay the bravery, loyalty and courage of the noble red man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a perfect film, but still good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last of the Mohicans" had the potential to be a great film. It had a good, intense storyline and well-made action sequences. However, what brings the film down in quality is the overall slow pace. For a majority of the movie, it's difficult to stay interested and engaged. Also, the film lacks some character development as a whole. We really do not get to know most of the characters very well, even the main characters, which leaves us with less reason to stay interested. Nevertheless, I will say a few good things about this film. This film, in my opinion, gives Daniel Day-Lewis his finest on-screen moment, during the scene at the waterfall in which he tells his beloved "You stay alive! Whatever happens, I will find you." That is one of the most memorable movie moments I've ever seen, and had the film been more like this overall, it would have been an all-time masterpiece. Still recommended, but I cannot rate it too high.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last of the Mohicans reviewMichael Mann's "The Last of the Mohicans" Based on a novel by James Fenimore Cooper, the movie tells the tale of Hawkeye , a white man raised by a clan of Native Americans called the Mohicans. there's only 3 of them left: Hawkeye, his adopted father Chingachgook , and his adopted brother Uncas . The film is set in the untamed American frontier during the British-French Wars of early 18th century, with both sides fighting for control of the n discovered American continent. Native Indians and colonists have been forced to pick sides, but Hawkeye and others have refused to join in, believing that the war has nothing to do with them. Things change when Hawkeye crosses path with English beauty Cora Munro and her sister Alice , the women are being escorted by Major Duncan Heyward to their father at the frontlines. After saving the women and Heyward from a bloody ambush engineered by the vengeful Magua, Hawkeye agrees to escort them to an English fort.Despite its good points "the last of the Mohicans" is still a better Romance-Adventure picture than it is an action/War movie. But there are numerous scenes of military battles, mostly at the siege of the English fort. Cannon fire and exploding muskets light up the night-time scenes, making the film an experience to watch. The cinematography by Dante Spinotti is brilliant, and the film's many scenes in the woods of Colonial America are ripped with beauty that many other films can not capture. The acting is also superb, which is a very good thing because the screenplay by Mann and Christopher Crowe is sometimes too plain for its own good, with a lot of romantic language that's better left to, well, romance novels but doesn't destroy the film. Thankfully the movie has a fine cast that manages to sell even the plain dialogue. Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a solid performance as Hawkeye. Madeleine Stowe , convinces us of the blossoming romance between her Cora and Hawkeye. The fact is, without these actor and actress the dialogue and screenplay just would work and it takes talent of this calibre to pull it off.For the most part the film Michael Mann has got it superb, although he seems to have a little trouble with the more bloody battle scenes. More than one occasion the film has a cheap feel, as if whole chunks of screens were removed. And despite being an 18, the film is nearly bloodless. Another point of "the last of the Mohicans" that works is the natural soundtrack. There is a constant drumy tune that plays throughout much of the exciting forest scenes, including the movie's final battle on the side of mountain and really gets you going " go on kill him, run, run faster man" well it did me even though I have watched it many times I still do it. An under rated and forgotten classic, "The Last of the Mohicans" ,is epic, great to look at, and Madeleine Stowe is almost as lovely as the scenery. What else could you want for a Friday night movie at home with a beer.Michael Mann (director) / Michael Mann (screenplay) CAST: Daniel Day-Lewis ?. Hawkeye Madeleine Stowe ?.

This film has some faults, but they are minor and insignificant.This film is based of the book by James Fenimore Cooper. The film takes place during the French and Indian War. The film focuses on the Mohican tribe or I should say what's left of them. The story is about Hawkeye and how he saved the British from attack and his romantic side with the British General's daughter, Cora.The acting is very good. Daniel-Day Lewis did an excellent job. I also liked Madeleine Stowe and Steven Waddington.The music is exceptional. Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman certainly did a great job. There are many good, memorable themes.The scenery is great.

		<fullReview>I have seen thousands of movies.I have watched this wonderful movie many times. Of its many attributes, the two that stand out for me the most is the magnificent haunting music throughout and the strength of character shown by key actors. In life and at the movies, I am most moved by unstated integrity. By this I mean integrity and courage that appears as natural rather than conditioned by what someone thinks about and then does as the right thing to do. In this, I particularly thought that the lead role of Nathaniel, played by Daniel Day-Lewis was superb.The direction, casting and make-up were impressive and the photography near perfect. Though violence was depicted, it was never without reason. The hundreds of people involved in creating this movie classic deserve commendation. It will be enjoyed by people and go to their hearts for as long as films are watched.This film well deserved the Academy Award and the long list of other awards and accolades it received.

		<fullReview>Yes it doesn't win my award for the best movie I have ever seen but admittedly it would be in my top 15 favourites of all time. Apart from the dashing Day-Lewis and stirring soundtrack this is a well-executed epic, all be it slightly over-romantic. From a female perspective you have to see this movie if nothing else but to see Daniel Day-Lewis look utterly stunning and the romantic although slightly clichéd relationships within the plot which epitomise what women want everywhere. From a guy's perspective this movie has authentic fight scenes and well developed characters who are excellently acted by the likes of Wes Studi and Day-Lewis, who as ever applied his passion for method acting to the role and built a canoe, learned to track and skin animals, and how to use a 12-pound flintlock gun, which in true Mohican style never left his side (If he doesn't earn your respect for that alone then there is something wrong with you). This movie reminds me a lot of Braveheart, I think Braveheart is slightly better but if you like that movie without a doubt you'll like The Last Of The Mohicans. I loved this movie and there wasn't a moment when I wasn't entertained, some of the romance quickly evolves and if you've read the book it is definitely not faithful to the plot, which I believe enhances the film if anything. Other than those small almost irrelevant points, the movie achieves what it sets out to do, don't take it too seriously or you might find more criticisms than I did, but just enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say it took me a while to warm up to the movie and to get sucked in so-to-speak. It was mostly because I had high expectations; I really like Daniel Day-Lewis and Michael Mann is a pretty crafty director so I expected to be thrilled from the first shot.However, from the get go I was impressed with the cinematography, the costume and the soundtrack. Then after the first hour, like most Mann movies, it kept getting better and better. The tension rises and you find that you are sitting at the edge of your sit.I was thinking that it was actually quite an unusual and rather bold film coming from Hollywood. One of those unusual points was how the Indians and the fighting Europeans were portrayed. The Indians had left aside their customary arrows and had picked up guns and rifles. The Europeans were not your typical cowboys but soldiers who were fighting for land. And the intrigues went both ways.The film is not perfect and possibly not even one of Mann's best. Yet it shows a lot of early promise and talent, and the scenes are well executed and full of suspense. That is one thing that I love about movies, not being able to predict what will happen next. The Last of the Mohicans keeps you guessing until the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hawkeye/Nathaniel (Daniel Day Lewis) is a white man who was captured and raised by the Mohican Indians. But, do to tragic circumstances, only three Mohicans remain, Hawkeye's adopted father and brother, Uncas. The father sent Nathaniel to live with the colonial settlers for a spell, so he is fluent in the ways and languages of both worlds. One day, as the trio of men are out hunting, they happen across three people in big trouble. Cora (Madeleine Stowe), her younger sister, Alice and a British soldier are on route to Fort McHenry when they are attacked by other Indian tribes. The ladies are traveling to the fort because their father (Pete Postelthwaite) is the commander and they believe he has sent for them. However, a disgruntled Indian, Magua (Wes Studi), whose own family was destroyed by the commander in battle, is out to take his revenge and arranged the ambush. Hawkeye and his family, however, jump in and fight for the colonists, killing and driving off the attackers. The Mohicans escort the three Britishers to the fort, at great peril. But, once there, the fort is besieged and the war rages fiercely. What will become of the English settlers, especially Hawkeye and Cora, who have fallen hard for each other? This is a superb movie, with great actors and more, but its depiction of the violent French and Indian War is very real and very potent. Therefore, be forewarned that there are some stomach-turning scenes that do make the film unsuitable for children. Some Native American tribes were quite fierce and their weapons of choice were tomahawks. Enough said. The cast is terrific, with Day Lewis very great as Hawkeye, Stowe most beautiful as Cora, and Studi totally frightening as the vengeful Indian. Other cast members are wonderful, too. The scope of the film is grand, with the finest of cinematography, staging, costuming, direction and writing. As they say, they don't make them like this anymore but the movie clearly shows that they DO. If you want to experience an historical tale of great merit, this is one you should not miss. Just make certain you have someone's hand to hold when the rough scenes arrive again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Realism &amp; intensity, minus pandering. The passion that blazes up between Stowe &amp; Day-Lewis in the hours running up to the final assault is white-hot, as powerful as anything I can remember on film, all non-verbal and fully clothed. Stowe's voice, hoarse with feeling, and blazing features stand out in my memory, as do minute but detectable changes in Studi's face as things happen to and around Magua on the mountainside. The interview in the Huron town with the running 3-way translations was a dandy, and Duncan's final act of courage and abnegation, manly and moving, reclaiming his honor. They took good care of the details, always satisfying to see, uniforms and equipment, even the sound of shells in flight, and Pete brandishing his pistol pan-side up.The only misstep was the embarrassing gaucherie of the interview with Webb at Albany. How that business of "make love with their faces" got by the editors is a mystery.A little surprising, in the days of Brown Bess, to see a column route-marching down a forest road in hostile country without bayonets fixed. Wonder if senior British officers in the 18th were really so carefree. Not exactly Bobs Bahadur &amp; the hard-bitten, wide-faring Tommies of the 19th (or 20th, come to that).Terrific score. Went right out and looked up a tape, SR1.50 off a clearance-table at the Jubail souk, directly we turned off the VCR. Played it to transparency. Still find "The Gael" one of the toughest tunes to shake, once it gets going in my head. Wonderful.This one's in my top 10 best; for historicals, top 5. Right up there with Caton-Jones' Rob Roy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Blend of Movie Making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen a film mesh so well with many of the elements of movie making. Sound, Cinematography, acting, dialog, plot and especially the music. The music itself is it's own character. It adds so much emotion to the movie, especially at the end. Michael Mann did a great job of bringing James Fenimore Cooper's novel to the silver screen. (even though it is a remake, technically). Daniel Day-Lewis delivers his best, as he always does. All the actors played their part to it's fullest. Mann presents and eerie feeling of how brutal the fighting was during the French and Indian War. I would say it was an energetic, splendidly real and violent description on how the warfare was handled during that specific conflict on the northern American continent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This guy really knows how to make movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Aw man, this is gonna be another 3 hour Dances with Wolves nightmare," I thought, being quite literally dragged into the cinema to see this film. I had oodles of candy and a bucket of popcorn bigger than my head, and was preparing to BURY myself in it as the curtains drew back, and i was suddenly drawn in for the next two hours. I barely touched my popcorn as Trevor Jones' score swept across those breathtaking mountains, spired trees, before immersing us in 1757 new America, and sweeping into a story that is at once a drama, a romance, a war film and an historical period action adventure. In short, Michael Mann's masterpiece. This guy really knows how to make movies. I can't fault this film, I think it's perfect. Viewed on a superficial level it's an exciting adventure story, set against a backdrop of cathedral forests and a savage war for possession of an entire continent. Go deeper and it's a masterpiece of storytelling, a finely crafted motion picture (editing, sound design, costuming, production design - technically, it's brilliant. Dante Spinotti (has worked with Mann on Heat, and probably others I am not certain and don't want to guess here) captures the frontier wilderness like something straight out of a painting, a period novel or an epic poem. It's magical, beautiful, yet so simple and professionally done. The whole 2 hours of the film are beautiful to watch. Daniel Day Lewis is great, although I must admit this is only one of two films I've ever watched him in, the other being In the Name of the Father. Madeleine Stowe is beautiful in an almost indescribable way, and although several of her lines seem strangely forced and awkward she is also great in this. All the supporting cast are great...like I said, can't fault this film in any way. It's on my top ten ultimate must see best ever movie list (which is no lighthearted matter - it's been 15 years in the making!) The film is also a great little snapshot of the times. While not all that historically accurate when you look into it, it does keep certain historical events in context and doesn't take HUGE liberties with the historical truth. It's a fairly accurate portrayal of the warfare and weapons of the time. Also dramatic is the conflict when viewed in the larger context that, in less than two decades the "settlers" as they are referred to in this film would kick the Brits out anyway and establish the United States so the fighting depicted in this film was even more a pointless waste of life.Director's Cut vs Theatrical releaseIn my opinion there is no reason to watch the theatrical version anymore. Fair enough, it was the version that blew me away at the cinema, but Michael Mann has extended and built upon crucial scenes to a point that elevates it from action/romance/adventure film to pure masterpiece. Trevor Jones' score is fantastic, moving, a perfect example of how to score a film.Interesting point of note I watched this film on the same night as Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. Now, while the two movies are totally different, the reason I compare them is they both begin with indigenous people engaged in a hunt. Now, seeing the two scenes back to back the better film is startlingly obvious - it's Mohicans. The hunt scene is dramatic, tense, and even moving, complemented by a beautiful introduction to the score. Apocalypto's opening hunt, by contrast, was a flat, uninteresting start to a film, with no music, and focusing on very graphic aspects of the dead Tapir, whereas Mann, in Mohicans, chose to focus more on the characters who shot the deer, not the wound inflicted on the animal itself. My friend, a 25 yo female, walked out on Apocalypto after 4 1/2 minutes of that hunt scene. By contrast, she stayed for all of Mohicans and describes it as one of the best films she's ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was filmed in the Blue Ridge Mountains, not the Smokies. Chimney Rock is now becoming the newest state park in NC, after the private owners put the land on the market. Fort scenes were filmed at Lake James, which is near Morganton, NC.For those of us fortunate enough to travel to these areas before 1992 when the movie was released, it was interesting to watch the movie and identify all the spots. Incidentally, before the movie was filmed, many of the areas at Chimney Rock did not have fencing, so you could get really spectacular views of the area. Since the movie, and more since the State Park system has taken it over, there is more security fencing to keep visitors from getting too close to the edge of the trails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Mann In Spite of Himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With some very rare exceptions I don't enjoy Westerns, and I'm quite the nitpicker with historical epics. But when this is televised I literally stop what I'm doing, willing to suffer through even the "pan-and-scan" treatment and interminable commercial torture sessions.No, I don't own the "Director's Cut" DVD, and I feel users unnecessarily quibble over its differences from the theatrical release as well as James Fenimore Cooper's novel. Watch "both" films if you like (the theatrical release likely on VHS from your public library), its predecessor film version perhaps, then read Cooper's novel that you may have been forced to read in school, or others in the series by him featuring "Natty Bumppo," then for background some historical accounts or novels by Allan Eckert and Walter D. Edmonds. But if you watch only the film you just can't lose.For in spite of himself Mann makes everything work here, and I do mean everything. If it isn't his most topical film it's his best film, hands down. And even with legendary accounts of overproduction, if the end result shows me the director gives a serious hang about what I pay two bits to see on the big screen, I won't gripe about my passenger status.Recognize Daniel Day-Lewis plays America's first literary action hero, and I cannot picture that done by anyone else in any other way. Madeline Stowe and Jodhi May don't have to say a word to get the point across. Wes Studi is a portrait of unalloyed menace. And that all converges in the penultimate 15 or so minutes of the film, enhanced by the location, photography, editing, stunt work, Trevor Jones' positively hypnotic theme that includes of all things a Scottish reel, and no (repeat, NO) spoken lines.Perhaps the highest praise I can offer: If you don't think you'd like this sort of thing, you are guaranteed to have a change of heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with a couple of the posters on here, about the location. How many of you, have ever seen New York State??? It would have been nice, to see them have it look more like NY. Then again, like a poster said about different guns, I suppose it wouldn't matter, would it? The Appalachians are the foothills in my backyard. We are near Cooperstown. I would have liked to see the scenery more like New York. But it is a fantastic movie-I could watch it every day! However, I think Braveheart is better. I love them both. I think they definitely filmed it in NC, because of the weather, lol. It just rains too much here. I like a majority of the posts on here too, and think the sister should have had more parts in the movie.

		<fullReview>Loved the movie. But hasn't anyone else noticed--New Yorkers that is,,,that there are no mountain laurels up here? At least I think that is what they were. The pines? Sorry, but we don't have half of that flora portrayed in that movie. Those mountains, even I noticed, that it was probably filmed in North Carolina, which looks so much like New York State. I think it was the laurels that got me the most, and the mountains. While it's beautiful up here, we just don't have that scenery. I guess that's just a central NYer making her comments. Originally, I thought it was because the weather is so cloudy and rainy here. NOT because of how the so-called Adirondacks look. Mann, you should see my back yard! They just aren't the same. What was more original, the movie "Dirty Dancing" being filmed in that same part of North Carolina. Now that really looked like the Catskills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful atmospheric film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is all about the loss of innocence and the passing away of an older world under the influence of the growth of a global culture. I find the depiction of the war between the English and the French over the spoils of the wilderness of north America and its peoples, evokes strong emotions. The north Americans are by no means 'innocent' of the concepts of war, retribution and hate. But they were totally unprepared for the mechanised, industrial violence and betrayal that came with the Europeans to their land. And, of course, the Europeans, having used Indian against Indian in their struggles against each other, finally turned on the native peoples and wiped them out. Most have disappeared now, along with their forests, plains, animals and gods. So it may sound pretentious to say that a film like Last Of The Mohicans can 'represent' all of these events and emotions - but it does, and with its terrific musical score the pace never lags either. The way Hawkeye is shown as one of the very few Europeans who can comprehend the value of what north America was before the European invasion is very intelligent. He is wise but ultimately cannot affect the inevitable outcome of this monumental clash of cultures. Therein lies the immense sadness of the film and perhaps its uplifting side too, as even in the most tragic of circumstances it's shown that it's possible to find individual wisdom and heroism. When I first saw it I loved the story, the action, the score, the fine performances. You will too. Then see it again - give it a year or two to sink in first. You'll begin to see the many different levels at which it can be enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Only Way to Experience This Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Mann is synonymous with a steely, urban kind of cool, perhaps because of the enduring influence of films like Heat and the Insider, or the seminal Miami Vice show. On paper, it's strange to find him at the helm of a romantic period adventure film, especially an adaptation of Cooper's classic story, but that would be missing a key ingredient to Mann's success: he is a method director, first and foremost.Last of the Mohicans is a perfect blend of old and new. In many ways it hearkens back not just to its written origins, but past film adaptations, tales of simple heroism, which it makes relevant and immediate in powerful ways - not just the scale and heartbreaking photography, but especially Trevor Jones' now legendary score. In other ways, it is a very modern animal, layered and avoiding easy allegiances beyond its idealistic main character, and it's in these small details that one sees what makes Mohicans such a superior film.There is a love story, and whether through casting, performance or his subtle conducting, Mann makes it not just immediately appealing, but believable. Same goes for another understated love among secondary characters, and the pathos and pain of villain Magua (Wes Studi), a creature that could have been a cardboard cutout in lesser hands. The same reasoning applies throughout, and though he provides ample spectacle - particularly a spectacular, near-wordless 15-minute closing chase - Michael Mann never does so at the expense of believability or the story he is serving. You will find none of Braveheart's cartoony romance or the Patriot's excess.In making his method historical epic, Michael Mann also found the ideal partner in Daniel Day-Lewis, someone you would sadly no longer consider as a romantic lead, but who is simply astonishing here. With one single foray into the genre, the great performer gives us the definitive word on it, proving his quality by disappearing once more into a character who would be impossible to look away from, were it not for the excellence on display in every other department.This is an epic with such intimacy, power and heart as you have rarely, if ever, seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A subtle, dramatic masterpiece--opulent in simplicity (but only the VHS version)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The makers of this film understood that a picture really is worth a thousand words.Unlike most other movies, it does not rely as heavily upon dialogue, which gives it an unspoken power--a true presence. It gives the film an overall tone of openness, similar to the feeling one gets upon seeing a beautifully detailed, but uncluttered painting. The film's silence is its greatest strength, requiring precise performances on behalf of the actors and some excellent camera work. The result is a film that speaks to emotions on a much closer, more primitive level. With a less-talented cast, the film would have been corny or overly melodramatic. As is, it's breathtaking.My only complaint--the DVD version is the director's cut. No offense to Michael Mann, but it's terrible. As good as the movie is, is how bad the DVD is. Technically, the 'skips' are aesthetically offensive; there's even a disclaimer of sorts *inside* the packaging, which makes returning it a bit more challenging. The music has been literally gutted, and some of the best lines were chopped. The added scenes were okay, but understandably cut from the final release. They would have been much better served as extras on the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling if slightly inaccurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rollercoaster of a movie, one with everything you want in a good film. It is probably as close as you'll get to an accurate portrayal of the longhunter culture that existed in the eastern frontier from the 1740s to perhaps 1810, where frontiersmen like Nathaniel Bumppo got "off the boat" from Europe and, in a very brief time, learned to out-Indian the Indians. The film is gorgeous to look at, with incredible scenery and everything bathed in a rich, liquid light. The script is sophisticated and tight, and the movie pulls you along at a good clip. Boredom is not a problem. Sure there are inaccuracies here and there, and the truth of the 18th century frontier is a much better tale than any fiction you'll ever read about it, but all in all this is a grand effort, and one that will probably become a screen classic. The real star of the show, however, is Magwa, played by Cherokee actor Wes Studi. He gives an absolutely chilling performance as a man deeply harmed by the gruelling life of the frontier, who seeks to exact vengeance. Imagine yourself and your family in a tiny cabin in the middle of an old growth wilderness, in 1750, with Magwa and several other men like him trying to beat your door down to do God knows what (kill you quickly? torture you slowly? steal some sugar and tobacco and go away? take you captive and treat you like a brother? kidnap your children and leave you to wail with grief?) and you get some idea of what life must have been like for our forefathers. Last of the Mohicans makes the past come alive for 2 hours, which is all you can ask.</fullReview>

This is most definetely is the best film of 1992. Daniel Day Lewis does a really good job as a tough guy, Wes Studi does and excellent job as a malicious native american, and the rest of the cast is just as good too. I compare the cinematography to the Lord of the Rings's. It deserved what it did not get is a good way to put it. This should be on the top 250 right behind the Lord of the Rings. I have no idea why I do not own this movie yet. It has great costumes and makeup, and the sound puts you right in the battle (which is why it won a well deserved only oscar for the sound.) The Last of the Mohicans has some really good visual effects too (the battles between the French and the English.) This film is the visually the best film next to the Lord of the Rings.

It is a powerful and moving story. This is a movie with everything for everyone. For those who love battle scenes, this has great ones.

TV is ok, but to appreciate the truly remarkable cinematography (this from someone who didn't know what cinematography was before I saw this movie), one needs to view this in a theater.Lastly, buy the original score if you have any interest in instrumental music. The score helps make the movie and is very good to sit and listen to on a rainy day (tracks 6, 11 are great).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS never quite became the blockbuster it should have been. It is truely an exceptional piece of filmmaking in every way possible. Michael Mann did an admirable job bringing the famous (and oft-filmed) story to life in an adaptation that will be hard to top. Daniel Day-Lewis is a standout as Hawkeye, a white man raised by his adoptive father, Chingachgook, a Mohican. Russell Means plays Chingachgook, and Eric Schweig is Uncas, his Mohican son. Together, they are the last of the Mohican indian tribe. The beautiful Madeline Stowe is Cora Munroe, a woman who is traveling to see her father with her sister when they are attacked by indians, lead by the always-intense Wes Studi. Hawkeye and the others come to the rescue and agree to take them to her father, thus getting involved with the war between England and France, something they had been doing their best to avoid.Rounded out with excellent performances, the film is really a sight to behold, with breathtaking photography and simply excellent music by composers Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman, who did a fine job blending his music with Jones' after the former left due to creative differences with director Mann. The costume design and recreation of the era are outstanding, and the entire climax is a terrific, powerful sequence utilizing nothing but sight and music, and no dialogue whatsoever except for a tearfull exclamation of "No!" that always gives me a few goosebumps for some reason.My only complaint is Mann's "director's cut" DVD. While featuring a splended audio/visual transfer and an extended sequence involving the English getting a message from their fort by way of a courier, Mann took out several of Hawkeye's sly comments, trimmed some bits and pieces from the end of the climax that really had no reason to be deleted, and dropped Clannad's song "I Will Find You" from a scene in the middle of the film that was really nice. But other than that, Michael Mann has turned out a great film that is full of excellence in every category possible and should be considered a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is, as many have pointed out, beautiful. The scenes are luscious. I won't repeat what others have noted, and will just offer some other opinions that I've not read about.Many a reviewer and movie-goer have commented that the battle scenes are confusing. So did I. But I hope that the confusion resulted not from directorial lapses, but intent. The confusion only added to the horror of the violence, and showed that no war or battle is not fun, whoever the victor.Johdi May was simply radiant in her, and in my opinion the film's, climax. She was the most memorable character because of what she did in those last scenes.But then why did she have to die? A short while later, Magua was killed. Perhaps, that was the moment she was not restrained, but I also remember Hawkeye urging Cora to stay alive at the waterfall.It also seems weird, now that I think about it, that the Magua's fighters stood around after those in the front were hacked down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glorious if uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last of the Mohicans is such a fast-paced, lushly shot and impeccably acted film that I didn't notice the first few times I watched it that it is essentially a string of action set-pieces. While these set-pieces are essentially very well woven into the fabric of the story (so well that they do not emerge immediately as any different), it has the unfortunate effect that the rest of the narrative tends to sag somewhat in the face of the amazing animal highs presented by the action sequences. The sudden attack of Magua as Col. Hayward and the Monroe sisters travel to Fort William Henry; the resumption of the attack after the fall of the fort, and the amazing closing fifteen minutes as Alice is led away -- these scenes dominate the narrative, and whilst - much to the credit of the cast - the romantic storyline still propels the film forwards and maintains audience interest, its purpose is largely to simply add greater significance to the inevitably violent resolution of the conflict. The romantic scenes elevate the action to a more important plane, but in doing so diminish the relative significance of these scenes in themselves.However, despite the violence and brutal, animal code of the frontier which is used to resolve almost all of the film's conflicts, the most enduring image in my mind is the suicide of Alice (Jodhi May) in the final set-piece. Struggling bravely with adolescence ("I mustn't be an invalid schoolgirl"), falling for Uncas (Eric Schweig), and now led away by the malicious Magua (Wes Studi), she is forced to see her tentative love interest fight and die for her at the hands of her captor. Her response to this is utterly silent grief. Tears filling her eyes, yet almost bored and indifferent to Magua's gesture of mercy, she slowly throws herself from the scenic mountain ledge. A perfect image of grief-stricken beauty, May manages to steal the moment, however briefly, from the action sequence, and has produced, to my mind, one of the greatest enduring images of modern cinema (to rival Ir?ne Jacob in Kieslowski's Trois Couleurs Rouge) as the score winds inexorably onwards throughout and in spite of Alice's passive demiseNonetheless, however, the film cannot maintain the highs of the action in the other scenes -- perhaps what prevents it from becoming a truly "Great" film. Though both thematic halves of the film are great, it is a shame that they are not more synthesised and fluid. Perhaps this is unavoidable in a film about war, where the pauses are long and the action sudden -- they are by nature antithetical. Unavoidable flaws, perhaps, but flaws nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeously filmed frontier adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Grade 8, my English teacher assigned the class to find a well-known book, review it, and then make some kind of presentation to her about the novel. My aunt had sent me a newly publicized version of James Fenimore Cooper's "The Last of the Mohicans", so I figured "why not?" and sped-read through the whole thing. All I could remember about the book was that it was a good adventure story, but speed-reading through it did not help me in the way of "comprehending" it. Then I realized there was a movie too, and further figured "why not", and then picked it up at the video store. I watched it, and to my surprise, it WAS a good adventure story! I had actually understood what I read in a book!The story is centered around a dying Indian tribe, the Mohicans. There are only two left, the chief, Chingachgook (Russell Means), and his son, Uncas (Eric Shweig). They have taken under their wing a White man, Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), found abandoned in the forest. Hawkeye is raised as one of their own, and might as well be called a Mohican save for the fact that he was not born one. The "Last of the Mohicans" are caught in the middle of a war between the French and the British for control of New France, or British North America, respectively. A powerful British colonel asks that his daughters and one of his troops be put under the watchful eye of Magua (Wes Studi), a forest-savvy member of the Huron people. Little do they know that Magua has already conspired with the French general, Marquis de Montcalm. Magua turns on the colonel in favor of the French and attempts to take the daughters hostage as revenge on the British for killing his own family.The Mohicans, meanwhile, are bitter rivals to the Huron, and are forced to choose sides in this colonial war by rescuing the British girls. Both girls, Alice (Jodhi May) and Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe), fall in love with Uncas and Hawkeye, respectively. They set off through the forest, doing all they can to avoid Magua and the Huron so that they may bring the girls back to their father at Fort William Henry. Their problem is that the Huron act on revenge, and at their own expense, not for the French. This makes their desire to take the girls even greater, now that they are under the watchful eye of their rivals. A minimally-spoken adventure-drama, "The Last of the Mohicans" is a gorgeous film to watch and listen to. The cinematography depicting the early colonies is simply marvelous to look at, and gives the film a sense of grandeur in its visual style. Then there's a beautiful musical score by veteran composers Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman, not doing much to help the story or the events but still a pleasure to hear just the same.The actors also deserve some mention, particularly Daniel Day-Lewis, who proves that he is an excellent actor by several other standards then just his voice. This film uses its visuals and actions to tell a story, and is very underwritten to evoke that. It is an excellent move by superb director Michael Mann, who certainly knows how to stage a production on a grand scale with the smallest amount of dialogue possible. However, this may not appeal to some who are accustomed to hearing actors truly "acting", by which I mean saying lines and displaying emotion that way. In summary, this film is a violent, emotional, spectacular adventure that will certainly find its place in the hearts of those who crave period pieces, romance, and action. It delivers well on all counts. I give this film 3 stars on a five star scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What to say about The Last of the Mohicans that hasn't already been said?The cinematography is absolutely stunning. The colors and scenery used are phenomenal. Just an absolutely beautifully shot movie. Likewise, the acting and directing are nearly perfect, and we all know the music is some of the best ever made.It seems there is currently a trio of war/patriot movies out now. "The Last of the Mohicans", "Braveheart" and "The Patriot" make up this trio, and they all have amazing similarities. They all contain the brawny, long-haired pacifist drawn into the fighting when his loved ones are drawn into it. They all dog on the British pretty badly. And they all contain that last climactic scene between hero and archvillain.But Last of the Mohicans breaks several of the stereotypes set by the movies that came after it. While the shortest of the three, Mohicans feels more like the epic, what with its cinematography and soaring score making the movie seem ethereal at times. And although it seems epic, it doesn't seem to run long enough. By the time you realize that inevitable climactic battle has happened, the movie is already ending. And that climactic fight is far shorter than say, The Patriot's. Also, Mohicans has a more complex plot. Because Lewis' character is fighting not only to protect his girl, but also the families of the settlers, the rights of the colonists and the lives of his adoptive family. (As opposed to Mel Gibson's characters who fight for revenge and "FREEEEDOOOM!")Needless to say, Last of the Mohicans is incredibly impressive. Some of the speeches (especially the argument between Madeleine Stowe's character and her father) are moving and believable, while the violence is done quite tastefully.Unfortunately, the fight scenes are a bit hard to follow at times, but this seems to be the only part where the movie is even the slightest bit lacking.Overall Last of the Mohicans is an excellent movie, just below The Patriot on the war/action/romance scale. It is truly stunning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Last of the Mohicans" is a glossy, romanticized version of James Fenimore Cooper's classic novel. But I mean this in a good way. Does anyone remember reading Cooper's novel in High School? No one does. No one cared. This movie MAKES you care. This movie thrusts the characters in your face, puts human emotion on display, and leaves you genuinely interested in their lives.Daniel Day Lewis gives an incredible performance as "Hawkeye" - the white "brother" of the Mohican tribe, which, for reasons I can't remember, only consists of two members. Madeleine Stowe is superb as the Englishman's daughter, who gets caught up in the fight for American Independence. The chemistry between Daniel Day Lewis and Ms. Stowe is outstanding. There wouldn't be a better pair for this movie.Even if you are not impressed with the performances given by the principal leads, you WILL be impressed with the breathtaking cinematography. Also, there is no more haunting and gorgeous soundtrack in existance than the score for "The Last of the Mohicans."In short, no matter why you would choose to see "The Last of the Mohicans" - SEE IT. It's beautiful in every way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last of the Mohicans is perfect in almost every way. Yes, Dances With Wolves was interesting and had beautiful scenery and a moving soundtrack, but it has to be said that towards the last third I was hoping it would end soon, as it is over three hours long. Michael Mann, however, expertly made Last of the Mohicans only 100 minutes long. This means there is no unnecessary dialogue, no boring bits and no repetition. It is action-packed, with strong underlying feelings of inspiration and romance. The score is powerful, dramatic and breathtaking, all in one. The penultimate scene is the most exciting and, without giving too much away, it will leave you sobbing yet satisfied. Some may be put off by the violence, but if you watch carefully, you will see that while a lot of it seems bloody, the camera is neatly placed on something else before the crucial killing moment. The amazing pieces of music will leave you wanting to join the Mohicans in their fight for freedom and survival. There is romance too, yet not too much emphasis is placed on it, so the film does not get sidetracked. While Daniel Day Lewis' Irish lilt is occasionally evident, he plays a brilliant Hawkeye. Some things have been changed from the original novel by James Fenimore Cooper, but the film does him justice superbly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic in Our Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does this movie affect people so? A lot of reviewers have commented on how well-made it is, how good the music is, how realistic the battle scenes. Others point out that the acting (especially from Day-Lewis and Wes Studi) is outstanding. And of course, "it has everything": action, romance, war, even a kind of proto-Western.These factors are surely important. Yet I believe there is one more factor that tips the balance from "well-made film" to "classic": Last of the Mohicans is simply the best film ever made about the American Revolution.Ah, but you say, it isn't about the American Revolution, it's set in the French and Indian Wars, 20 years before the start of the Revolution. True enough. It isn't set in the Revolution, but it is about it. To be exact, it's about the birth of America as a distinctive nation.This theme is carried by the friction between the settlers and the British soldiers, by the existence of the farmers along the Hudson River frontier who are seeking an independent life after their term in indentured servitude, by the way the great powers of Europe squabble over a continent that isn't theirs (shades of the Monroe doctrine), by the go-where-we-please attitude of men like Nathaniel Poe, and lastly by the Indians.It must be remembered how much the European settlers learned from the Indians - and one important thing they learned is how to fight on American terrain with limited ammunition against massed forces. In the American Revolution, bluecoats bedeviled the redcoats by shooting from behind trees and boulders, by ducking and running instead of fighting mano a mano. We see this lesson more than once in Last of the Mohicans.So if we take the movie to be a portrayal of how a combination of European and Native cultures, shaped by the frontier, and a passionate desire to live by one's own judgment beholden to no one created a new human type, then we can also see how another title for the film, just as apt as Last of the Mohicans, would have been First of the Americans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An epic adventure, a classic story, rendered beautifully by Michael Mann and delivered in all its visual and aural splendour via DVD. This is a fine piece of movie making. The brutality and violence of the battle scenes are shocking, but everything here has the ring of authenticity. Even a quick scene of the colonialists and Native Americans playing some sort of field hockey together leaves you thinking, "I'll bet that's how it really was." The involvement of Russell Banks and Dennis Means probably accounts for this. Daniel Day-Lewis gives what probably is his best performance to date, and the supporting cast is superb. It's a beautiful, suspenseful and thrilling movie, one you can watch over and over again and never feel like you wasted your time. Rent this movie.

		<fullReview>The Last of the Mohicans has some of the most beautiful scenery ever filmed. It also takes us to the time before the Revolutionary War. That doesn't mean it is boring. This isn't a Merchant-Ivory picture, this is a modern action movie that doesn't slow down once it starts rolling. Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe are thrown into the mix for beauty's sake, and they give strong performances as would-be lovers in a savage wilderness. Historical inaccuracies pretty much run wild in this picture, but no one really cares because the action is so stirring and the sights are so gorgeous. In fact, the action and cinematography almost make up for the lame story, but not quite. But once again, who watches an action movie for plot?Unless you are a hard-core historian who gives a rats behind about whether muskets could be used like sniper rifles, you will find The Last of the Mohicans to be a quality action picture.</fullReview>

This movie has a little bit of everything, for the romantics a wonderful love story between 2 people with nothing in common, and for the action lovers death and violence from an ongoing war. Enjoy this movie if you get the chance and if possible watch in dolby digital surround sound. It makes a big difference......</fullReview>

Eric Schweig as the doomed Uncas, quiet, handsome &amp; noble. Russell Means is perfect at Chingachgook - Last of the Mohicans. The magnificent scenery is expertly captured to film. The story is faithful (pretty much) to Cooper's. I love this flick. So do my kids and my parents - that says something, I think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic of American Wilderness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started to write this short review on the film "The Last of the Mohicans" (1992), my utter amazement left me stupefied in front of an avalanche of information that was available on the background novel and its author James Fenimore Cooper. This is good and bad simultaneously. If someone in their teens try to understand the plot, he will soon become too shy in his endeavor. The Leatherstocking Tales as a series of novels each featuring the main hero Natty Bumppo and his adventures in American Wild West have long time became a historical legacy. The five novels are themselves based on real events reflecting episodes from life of the author (James F. Cooper) as frontiersman and navigator on the area of Great Lakes (Ontario and Erie). So the lush youngster should beware before making hurried conclusions. Now on some personal commentaries."The Last of the Mohicans" (a novel) was written in 1826, and tells a narrative from 1757 (the Seven Years' War between France and Great Britain battled for control of North America). This war led ultimately to the American War of Independence (1775-1783) since the British settlers were not pressed southward anymore by the French and their Indian Allies. In continental Europe the French defeat led to outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792. So one can realize now the immense impact of this local Indian Drama from 18th century on the global ebb of historical events. No offence for titular author, but Cooper himself was a poor historian and couldn't grasp in his imaginative mind the long term consequences of what was going on around him - the French and Indian Wars, the American War of Independence, etc. His main source of information was the local Antiquarian Society which was in itself an achievement. Consider, for instance, the contribution of people like Lewis Morgan and his anthropological research on the Iroquois Ancient Society (the Mohawks and Five Nations). As in the movie and the novel they fought against their adversaries the Hurons (from Algonquin tribes of Canada) and intermittently with the White Settlers that in due course sacked them to a vanishing race.As good as the novel has been - though sometimes packed with slow action and much verbosity - the film, directed by Michael Mann, appears to me even better. Several are the reasons and in first place the simplified plot. The credits for the screen adaptation belong to several people but they did an excellent job. Get here the differences with the novel which I consider essential:1/ Only the leading male characters remain unchanged - Natty Bumppo or Hawkeye, Chingachgook the Big Snake, Uncas the Last of Mohicans, and Magua the Huron;2/ Colonel Munro's family doesn't die in the book except Cora - in the film Cora remains alive, while the Colonel is killed by Magua and later he also kills Alice and Uncas. Magua is slain finally by Chingachgook;3/ Duncan Heyward - a British army major is presented as traitor and dies on fire-stake. David Gamut ? a psalmodist, is not existent in the Film. Thank you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Last of the Mohicans is set in 1757 during the French and Indian war. This film is a excellent war epic all the way down to the perfect customs. Director Michael Mann takes you into this detailed action that is staged with excitement and excellence. Mann knows how to direct action sequences with such grace because he draws you into Daniel Day-Lewis's character and you actually feel for him. I want to see Michael Mann direct another action film! The Last of the Mohicans is based off the novel of the same title. The script for this film is impeccable. It is written with the right amount of action, great dialogue, &amp; the perfect love story. The Last of the Mohicans has excellent performances from just about the whole cast, but the incredible, Daniel Day-Lewis has another flawless performance. What I believe makes Day-Lewis stand out as one of the greatest actors is that he becomes his characters. When you watch the films he is in your not watching Daniel Day-Lewis, your watching the character. His use of method acting is perfection and shines in The Last of the Mohicans down to the last second. This film has one of the best scores I have ever heard in a war film composed by Trevor Jones. I can't say much about the score because I don't know a lot of the aspects that go into creating the score for films, but I can say the score in The Last of the Mohicans is unforgettable. The Last of the Mohicans is a excellent period piece, extremely well done war film, and the perfect love story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two colonial powers fight,cheat,lie and murder for supremacy over an occupied land,a continuing feud that was not to end until both had bled almost to death in the holocaust of the First World War. Neither the French nor the English come out of "The Last of the Mohicans" with any credit.The settlers and the Indians were reaching a delicately balanced co - existence when the European Superpowers made it their business to present them with the dubious gift of "civilisation" whether they wanted it or not,and of course rape the country while they were at it. It was a situation that was never going to end well for the Native Americans,and nor did it.No wonder Magua(Mr W.Studi)was an angry man. In a marriage de convenance with the French he leads an attack on a column of defeated English soldiers led by the hated Grey Hair(Mr M Roeves)whose heart he cuts out and holds high in the air. A prisoner in this column is Hawkeye (Mr D.Day - Lewis) who rescues Grey Hair's daughters and takes to the hills. Hawkeye is seen in the opening sequence running speedily and gracefully with his long rifle through the woods and the overwhelming impression given by "The Last of the Mohicans" is one of breathless speed. Rarely does Hawkeye slow to walking pace except to play court to Cora(Miss M.Stowe) Grey Hair's elder daughter. Mr Day - Lewis is supremely athletic and devilishly handsome to boot,but it is Miss Stowe whose deceptively fragile beauty stays in my mind.She is exactly the type of woman who - in the coming years - will be needed to tame the continent. Magua remorselessly chases Hawkeye and his companions until he is despatched by Chingachkook the eponymous "Last of the Mohicans" . Hard to believe it's twenty years old now,even on TV the sound of Magua's axe smashing the soldiers' skulls sends shivers down my spine.Unreservedly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is very good, though somewhat visceral in the fight sequences.It is, throughout its running time, quite beautiful - the spectacular scenery is presented in beautifully composed images. And, against that scenery is played out a complex drama between the English, French, colonists, and native Americans, all of whom have their own agendas, as well as a number of intimate dramas of which the main ones are the romance between Hawkeye and Cora, and Magua's revenge.The action sequences are extremely well staged, with the ambush and the final chase and fight being outstanding set pieces.Daniel Day-Lewis is always utterly convincing as a very physical Hawkeye, but for me Wes Studi steals the picture - his Magua is a study in cold, dignified malevolence, the turmoil of the hate which drives him being buried beneath an exterior of steely self-discipline.I didn't care for the music: the otherwise effective main theme was over-used, and needed variation.</fullReview>

Surprisingly in this case the movie was more enjoyable than the book for me. Where the film departs from the book only improves the storyline to my mind. Special mention must be made of the cinematography by Dante Spinnotti providing some breathtaking scenery at times.The film still holds up well despite being made in 1992 and to me it is a film I can watch many times without tiring of it. I believe this film is a modern classic and deserves to be be rated with the top echelon of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, we kinda face to the north and turn left real subtle-like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Mann trades Armani suits and machine guns for loincloths and tomahawks with "The Last Of The Mohicans", a gloriously old fashioned romantic adventure which seems to have been embraced by a bevy of new fans, most of whom are young moviegoers hungry for popcorn thrills without the infantilism and irony of modern action movies.Owing more to the 1920 Maurice Tourneur film than the 1826 James Cooper novel upon which it is based, Mann's film offers a fairly complex portrait of Mohican/Huron/French/British relations, though of course it is mostly the director's style which elevates things, Mann applying silky smooth visuals to composer Trevor Jones' evocative score and doing his best to strip his tale of as much dialogue as possible. The result is a very cinematic film, the plot told through gazes, musical swells, sudden bursts of violence and moments of unspoken passion.It also helps that the film taps strongly into very primal emotions. Essentially a large scale damsel-in-distress movie, this is the tale of sexy bare-chested men gallantly defending their woman from would be rapists. Heroes and villains thus spend this entire film racing across landscapes and fighting tooth and nail to protect or kill dames, all to ensure the survival of their kin, spread their seed and avenge the deaths of their families. It's the kind of tale you'd imagine cavemen grunted about a million years ago, before they bashed their competitors over the head and violently procured their rival's cave girl.Survival and procreation are thus Mann's key themes here, our hero yelling "Stay alive! Survive! I will find you!" to his woman before leaping off a cliff in a moment of alpha manliness. Elsewhere Clannad's lyrics - "No matter where you go, I will find you, if it takes a thousand years" - waft tenderly over the soundtrack, at once super romantic and super creepy, like a rape movie rendered tenderly.Beyond this, all the usual Michael Mann traits are here: men living by strict moral codes, predator and prey dynamics, effeminate macho men, moody existentialism, an aesthetic based on paintings (the 19th century landscapes of Thomas Cole and Albert Bierstady), glossy visuals, fluid action sequences etc. But what's interesting is the way the first 2/3rds of the film are fairly conventional, featuring relatively flat camera work, simple compositions and character interactions, only for the whole thing to slowly pull its various strands together and escalate into a super emotional third act climax. If most action movies are sex movies, complete with ejaculatory explosions and cathartic blood wounds, and if most narratives are patterned on the male sexual experience, then "Mohicans" is one of the classiest libidinal larks out there, one and a half hours of pent up emotions, heaving bodices, bare chests and repressed passions giving way suddenly to multiple abrupt sexual resolutions. Indeed, during the film's climax, everyone is being f**ked, men getting woman, women losing men, dads gaining daughters, daughters losing dads, whole tribes being wiped out and seeds cross-pollinating into eternity.Howard Hawks once stated that a good film need only three good scenes and no bad ones. "Mohicans" fits this credo to a tee, its last act climax elevating the film to some kind of action masterpiece. Of course the problem with these archetypal tales is that their archetypes don't stand up to much scrutiny, for though our Huron villain (played with subtle depth by Wes Studi) is a fairly multifaceted bad guy, the film still breaks down into easy demarcations: frontiersmen good, Europe bad, Indians either savage or noble. Then there's the fact that "Mohicans" is not about Mohicans, Native Indians, the Seven Years War or Colonial powers, but about white people and what it means to be American.The film follows Nathaniel Poe (Daniel Day Lewis, playing it for both the ladies and male romantics), a white English orphan who is adopted by a Mohican father and son. As the film progresses, Nathaniel will fall in love with Cora, the daughter of an English General. Cora is also being pursued by a snobbish English officer, but it is Nathaniel whom she longs for. Why? Because neither culturally English nor biological Mohican, Nathaniel represents the forging of a distinctly "American" identity. Though at times assisting both Mohicans and the English, his primary concern is the people of the frontier. "Out here they're beholden to none," he says.In short, Nathaniel is the ideal reconciliation of two paradigms: the bumbling European idiocy (represented by a character called Duncan) and evil native savagery (represented by Magua, a Huron warrior), both of which want his woman. This either or/neither nor state is best typified by the film's treatment of sex and loyalty. The Duncan character not only represents a neutered brand of romance, who hides behind formalities and appeals to friendship as a reason for marriage, but is morally righteous and gives his life in service of "the crown". Magua, in contrast, is driven by personal blood-lust and is implied to be animalistic in his regard for women and mating. "White man is a dog to his women," Magua says, and it is stated that his wife jumped to another man when she thought he had died, the character representing a savage take on sexuality. Nathaniel, in contrast, exists in the middle, balancing both stoic chivalry and hot passion; the passion and the soul of the Indian and the ability and the morals of the European. In this regard, he literally is the frontier, the meeting of civilisation and wilderness. Like Davey Crocket and John Wayne, he is not only the American hero, but America itself, the struggle and cohesion between civilisation and barbarism, forever on the cusp of change.And the Indians? They're just disposable scenery, their history hijacked and mowed down for tomorrow's family.8.5/10 ? Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Mann's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting. Michael Mann is probably best known for his film Heat. And it's not hard to see why. It is a grand epic in the cops and robbers genre that pits two of the greatest actors (Robert De Niro and Al Pacino) in the history of cinema against each other (and delivers their first on-screen appearance together in a classic scene...probably one of the best ever). It also has, possibly, the best and most intricately orchestrated shoot-out ever committed to film. Actually, to call it a shoot-out trivializes the beauty of it. It is an all-out gun battle. And yet, in my opinion, Heat is not Mann's best film. His best film came three years earlier. It is The Last Of The Mohicans, and is, I would contend, Mann's masterpiece. It is one of the best films I've ever seen, and is certainly in my top five of all time. It's difficult to try and even remotely convey just how close to perfect this movie is. First there is the acting. Every performance by every major player is utterly convincing. Especially from Daniel Day Lewis. I think this may be his best performance ever, and yet he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for it. In fact this movie was virtually ignored (save for the Sound) by the Academy. One of the most epic movies ever made, and the Academy only recognized it for its Sound (which was very good by the way). Almost criminal. This is a movie mind you, that is virtually impossible to nail down as far as genre is concerned. It literally has almost every element that one could think of. It's a powerful drama, and a beautiful love story. It's action-packed (and quite violent), and yet has much historical significance. It's one of the most beautifully filmed pieces of cinema I've ever laid my eyes on (North Carolina in its most glorious splendor), and the story is obviously strong. I remember the first time I ever saw The Last Of The Mohicans. I expected very little of it to be quite honest. Some good action and hopefully some great battle scenes. Well it delivered on that front. But it delivered in droves in so many other ways. Seldom have I ever underestimated a film as grossly as I did Mohicans. And seldom have I seen a film so grand. What I got, quite simply, was one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action Love Story that just about works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot to like about this film. A western about the eighteenth century, with sweeping epic pretensions, action, romance, music, locations, fine acting etc, but it loses itself at times in overegging the Colonial freedom-loving set against the cold-hearted British soldiers defending them. Actually the American revolution was set in train by the UK trying to recoup some of the expense of defending the ungrateful colonialists against the French, and the French monarchy went up in flames because of its financial support of the Patriots in the actual Revolution! But Americans love simplicity, and here they get it in plenty. I read the novel before this umpteenth rewatching on video, and it's okay, but hardly the great US novel it is made out to be. Quite rightly the plot has been speeded up, but the fort sequence is stretching credulity too far, while Hawkeye's love for Cora tears down the great White individual's total incorruptability matching the purity of the wilderness - a model that had stood Hollywood in good stead till the revisionist Seventies. As in the book, the red Indian is portrayed as good and bad, and it works well, except the usual Hollywood failing of redcoats can do down in hundreds before tomahawks because they are not sympathetic to US tastes. How did the British win the French and Colonial Wars (Seven Years War to us Brits!)? But the magic works, dashing through the forest to save the innocent, firing flintlocks (but no reference to 'Kill-Deer) as if they were breech loaders, hacking scalps and hearts, Indian versus Indian as if in a danse macabre, lovers parting with the real fear of a'fate worse than death (this fear apparently set up the red Indian as the savage for the next hundred or so years!) and a beautiful background location (even if it is North Carolina, and the Indian camp is the setting for 'Dirty Dancing!). Go on immerse yourself in some great escapism, even if Hawkeye does not get to use his 'longue carabine' to kill Magua!</fullReview>

Well, with Last of the Mohicans, the screenwriters and director Michael Mann create a three-fer: one part romance, one part historical adventure, and one part political thriller. By political thriller I mean conveying exquisitely the rising idea of the natural Rights of Man challenging the Divine Right of Pontificating Royal Assholes. So many examples from the dialog show that the spirit of the border, of the frontier, was indeed the same American spirit that in the late 18th century animated the taverns of Virginia, the meeting halls of Philadelphia, and the streets of Boston....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2009</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exciting and invigorating dramatisation of the hoary old Fenimore Cooper classic novel, this was the feature with which both Michael Mann and Daniel Day-Lewis announced themselves to Hollywood as a director/auteur and charismatic leading actor respectively. And while there's much to admire besides, essentially it's these vital essential two components which make this film so compelling. Mann's direction is imaginative and sure of pace - some of the scene-setting shots are magnificent (I'm thinking in particular of an early shot of the English Army crossing a bridge, reflected in the water below). Whilst music is a strong and I'm not always sure a wholly congruous element in the drama, Mann is clever enough to eschew dialogue at key moments of the narrative (which is how I remember the book, heavy on plot and description, light on speech), from Day-Lewis's love scenes with Madeleine Stowe, the brutal slaying of Maurice Roeves' Colonel Munro and of course the climactic duels on the mountainside between firstly the villainous Magua and Chingachook's son Uncas, and the revenge killing of Magua by Chingachook himself, in a concise and yet still thrilling combat scene. The film ends satisfyingly with the eponymous title-giving speech by Chingachook to the valley below in a fittingly elegiac conclusion. Day-Lewis is terrific in his star-part, famously at ease with the technical and physical demands of the role (learning how to speak the authentic language of the Indians and how to handle the ancient weaponry of the colonials). His playing is of necessity very physical (he runs like the wind and it's difficult to notice scenes where he was doubled by stunt-men) but yet portrayed with intelligence and conviction from first to last. I have bemoaned before that Hollywood doesn't make great actioners anymore without reaching for the SFX button but here while the film is obviously expensively mounted (the credits list alone affirms this), the story rings true and rightly replaces fake glamour and wise-cracking cynicism in favour of convincing realism and involving story-telling, to make for a satisfying and rewarding movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bottom line: Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am convinced that this film would not have been as engaging and enjoyable if it had another actor in the lead role. Daniel Day-Lewis is quite possibly the greatest living actor today - his performances are uniformly jaw-dropping. In his last few films, he has played darker, heavier roles, so what a treat to watch this film and see him as a smoldering hero.I, too, have objections to the director's expanded edition and continue to hope that the original version will be released on DVD. But, despite its flaws, the expanded edition does not take away the enjoyment of watching this film. It's not perfect - the lovely Jodhi May's talents are just about wasted, and a couple of the scenes are poorly edited. But it has many virtues: good action sequences, an exquisite score, a wonderful romance, and a sensational Daniel Day-Lewis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A ten rating is rare indeed for me.Even the greatest work might always have been tweaked just that little bit more. But with Michael Mann's masterpiece that would appear churlish, because the sum of its component parts is so overwhelming.Of course it helps that James Fennimore Cooper's story is a classic. A story that conjures up vast open spaces, heroic emotions, and rich colours in the mind of the reader.To so successfully translate those images onto the screen is a tremendous achievement.Daniel Day Lewis is superb as Hawkeye, understated, but decisive, sensitive but brave.The music is as lush and rich as the cinematography which itself has only been matched by "Lawrence of Arabia" and the Epic quality of the film is established from the opening frames to the closing credits.For a running time only eight minutes short of two hours, Mann keeps the narrative racing along with some set pieces which are quite simply astounding, The Mohawk ambush of the retreating surrendered garrison is as bloody and visceral as anything I have seen on screen, and a chase in the caves under a waterfall as beautiful as it is compelling.There is no bad language, there are no special effects. There is a nostalgic examination of vanity,pride, love, honour,duty,sacrifice, revenge and injustice. A Shakespearean task is taken on, and achieved by Mann in this regard. Rarely can a project as multi-layered in its ambitions have succeeded quite as triumphantly as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great movies of the 90's that stands the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far my favorite Michael Mann film. The soundtrack is legendary but in my humble opinion the movie itself should be considered one of the greatest movies in the 1990's.The cast is perfect. Daniel Day-Lewis is, well, Daniel Day Lewis. Wes Studi played Magua so well I have trouble suspending disbelief when I see him in another role. Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means and Pete Postlethwaite stand out with dynamic performances as also.The cinematography was stunning, the acting was flawless and the movie is everything you could ever ask for.If you have not seen this you are missing out.I give it 10 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mann's Best?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Mann's films are never bad, but this one truly is a beauty. Based on Cooper's novel and an earlier screenplay, the film could have come along as "okay", nothing more. Yet Mann makes it breathtaking thanks to three key elements: Daniel Day-Lewis (the method-man looks even more here heroic than Gibson's William Wallace in Braveheart!), the photography (the scenery and battles are filmed with equal beauty, the already excellent Spinoti never surpassed his work on this) and one of the best action scores ever (the themes by Trevor Jones are among the greatest music ever associated to the film industry). "Last of the Mohicans" is also a very smart romantic portrayal, thanks to it's pragmatism and impartiality, and above all, the film feels honest and authentic; that's something you rarely get in a historical epic, for at heart this is what Mann's film remains. It just also happens to be an unusually good one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some years back I saw this movie for sale on DVD and made the purchase blindly. If I could only pick stocks this way ! Having seen literally thousands of movies in my lifetime this is THE absolute best.The actors chosen for each part were a perfect fit. The scenery presented on location is breath taking. The story line is great and the music is chilling. The track for this movie transports you to that time as though YOU are there experiencing this all yourself.Wes Studi does an excellent portrayal of the villain ( we were both in Viet Nam serving in the same Army unit then ).It is appreciated by me personally how the movie depicts with great accuracy how it took great survival skills just to live another day. Bear this in mind as you watch the film. It will give you as a viewer some idea of the hardships Americas pioneers faced and we can only imagine. I watch this film periodically and urge you to get for your collection a world class film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an ending worthy of leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie is underrated. i've never read the book so the only thing i can judge this by is what is on the screen. i've also never seen any other works by DD Lewis but from this his is one (in)credible actor. my favourite tho is Russell Means, his portrayal as the Mohican patriarch is outstanding. he must have all of three lines but his credibility is always present. M Stowe, much underused in movies, is beautiful in this and is no shrinking violet when needs be. W Studi is one of the best villains in film and, as Magua, shines. from the time that hawkeye enters the Huron encampment, the action rises to a new level, taking on a ballet like character set to an irish jig. a very good choice by M Mann. the last sequences are Mann at his very best, and there are such focused emotions here. the heroics of Lewis and others, while a little unrealistic, suit the emotional mood, a do what you'd expect from them as characters. only the fabulous S Leone could have done the climax better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the more realistic "history movies"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not expecting much when I read the reviews of this movie but I was surprised when I saw it and I still watch it now and again. As the plot line has been gone over extensively by other reviewers I only want to make a few points. First, while not perfect, this movie very accurately portrayed life in 1700's America. I love historical movies but I am so often disappointed by the cheesy Hollywood portrayal. That has started to change with movies like "Platoon", "Full Metal Jacket", and "Master And Commander", to name a few. I'd like to see more. Another thing that struck me was how clearly superior the Mohicans were over the Huron and Mohawk. Though their numbers had dwindled they were living a lifestyle that advocated honesty, mercy, and denounced hatred, revenge and cruelty. But in battle they were fast and fierce. They clove through the ranks of attacking Huron like a knife through soft butter. Also the speech Hawkeye gives as a captive in the Huron village shows good foresight for the times to come, and the colonial treatment by their British "masters" definitely sows the seed of rebellion. Well casted, well acted and well done. What happened to the DVD? I rented it and lines like "Have you nothing better to do on the lake today Major?" (one of my favorite) seemed to have been chopped. Bummer! Hopefully there is a director's cut or some such by now and it is back up to speed. Excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>from a book which is not easy to read, a film worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Fenimore Cooper's book 'The Last Of The Mohicans' created the basic structure of the western. Although the story was about the east, the east at that time was just as a place of pioneers as the west. It was a hard book to read for the generation which had TV and western movies. I tried reading it a couple of times and gave up. Even the film starring Randolph Scott made in 1936 was hard to follow. When I saw this film made in 1992 I felt a sense of accomplishment. I had managed to finally absorb that story and enjoy it. There are four conflicting sides in the story: the British, the French, the Colonials and the Indians. Sometimes two sides join forces, but it is only temporary. Daniel Day Lewis is ideal as Hawkeye, a man who is always running (they had no horses) and facing danger. Madeleine Stowe makes you feel the drama of a woman who by falling in love is breaking all the rules of her family. This film has three elements that make a great western:a good story,fascination for the virgin land, expressed by the breathtaking scenery and many action scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Balletic quality violence, good sex (although the spiciest bits are happening just outside the frame and left to the imagination), a smoldering hero of nearly superhuman skills, a heroine who rises to the occasion and discovers resources she didn't know she had, a sidekick with a (literally) killer backhand, a Brit whose stiff upper lip never fails him to the bitter end, a villain worthy of Paradise Lost, magnificent visuals, a lush score that clubs any lingering disbelief into submission, and, finally, one of the great romantic suicides in the movies.The climactic sequence is a classic of silent film. We've already been set up by the trilingual debate over the Munro sisters' fate between Magua, Hawkeye and the old Huron sachem. Once Hawkeye takes Cora and leaves the Huron camp, there is not a word of dialog until after Magua's death. It's all action and music, building tension during the pursuit with the same theme previously used for Hawkeye and Cora's lovemaking. The actors communicate by glance and gesture. The music and the editing pull you into a climax that breaks your heart, pause, pull you into another, completely unexpected one, pause again, and build to the murderous, but now bittersweet resolution we've been promised. Only a brief epilogue is spoken.</fullReview>

The dialog between the the characters are enveloping. It's easy to get caught up in the scenes. My favorite line is when the group is behind the waterfall. Antoher favorite scene is when the three first hook up with the two daughter and they are spending the night in the Indian burial.

A good friend of mine said that when he saw it first in Dublin after the scene when Hawkeye(Daniel Day Lewis) shoots the deer one Dublin wag shouted out "nice one Christy" a reference to Christy Brown in "My Left Foot". Yes LOMH is one of my favourite dvds, the fights scenes are the best ever and in my view have not been bettered yet. Is Magua not one of the greatest bad guys. I presume Wes got the part after his sterling performance as the mad pawnee in Dances with Wolves. I love the menace of the forest and the fantastic locations. I'm considering purchasing the Directors Cut to compare it with the European version. I have just bought a home cinema system and enjoy watching LOMH for every tomahawk throw and every musket shot.

		<shortDescription>Magnificent war-drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last of the Mohicans, is rousing, romantic war drama of the highest caliber. Recently we have been bombarded with historical epics, like "Troy", "Last Samarui", "Gladiator", "Alexander" etc.... However when this film came out, there was a scarcity of them, and even more so of good historical epics, with "Dances with Wolves" being the exception. However this film breathed new live into the genre and did so with such vividness and excitement! The film takes place during the French-Indian war of the mid-18th century. Nathaniel (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his small family of Mohican trappers get caught up in the war, while attempting to defend a group of Brtish soldiers and women from a Huron war party. The Mohicans and their "white son" Nathaniel agree to escort the lone British survivor and the daughters of a British general to a nearby British fort, which unbeknown to them is currently under siege by the French. Nathaniel and Cora, daughter of British general Muro fall in love and this causes Nathaniel to fight for her and her sister and to safely see them through the hell that is war. As Cora remarks after witnessing the horrors of the war: "The whole world is on fire". It is now the obligation that Nathaniel feels for his new love that leads him and his Mohican family into the danger of the war and into a fight for their very survival. This film boasts beautiful natural landscapes, rousing war action, romance, and a great musical score, which puts you right into the middle of the action. The film has a visual beauty that is rarely equaled and a great story with plenty of action. It also remarks on the coming of the white man and how his wars become Indian wars, and how his vices became Indian vices. The ways of the white man have begun to corrupt the Indians. The once delicate balance between the natives and the land and their ancestors has been forever altered due to the intrusion of the white man, and they are continually pushed west into the frontier until there is no more frontier. Chingachgook, the elder Mohican has a line near the end of the film, which is highly prophetic: "The frontier moves with the sun and pushes the Red Man of these wilderness forests in front of it until one day there will be nowhere left. Then our race will be no more, or be not us."Highly recommended!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Cooper's writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have the misfortune of having read all of the Leatherstocking Tales. Utterly terrible writing. I find myself agreeing with Mark Twain about Cooper as a writer: he is a terrible craftsman. But his characters are compelling, particularly in The Deerslayer. This movie captures the raw power of the characters, and while it does conflate some plotlines and adjust the relationships of the characters to introduce a romance, it does so in way that enhances Cooper's work.I believe that this film will stand as the definitive interpretation of Cooper's work. I saw it in a preview showing, and I immediately bought the soundtrack. The music works so well with the movie, it is difficult for me to accept that it was composed by two different people, neither of whom was the director or editor of the movie. The Clannad song adds a nice touch to the film.The acting is uniformly great. Several of the minor characters (General Webb, for example) exist as caricatures, but very useful ones to both the plot and the development of the major characters. In particular the Marquis de Montcalm provides a fascinating portrait of the aristocrat who happens to be an excellent soldier.Russell Means does a fine job as Chingachgook. Daniel Day-Lewis fits perfectly as Hawkeye. Wes Studi brings a practiced malevolence to the role of Magua. The dialogue is so spare, and so concentrated (there are quite a few scenes with no dialogue) that it must be good when present, and it is.I remember my utter shock when this movie was not nominated for a single Academy Award. Not a sausage. Bugger all. It blows my mind to this day that Michael Mann was not honored with a best director nod, and that Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman were not nominated. But the continued vitalit of the movie is pleasing indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a sensational movie: mix of both war and love. It was great how the characters seemed to grow alive with the surroundings around them and would react in some unexpected ways and turn. But what i would like to focus on is the love between Uncas and Alice Munro. I have read comments and summaries and all i hear about is the love between Hawkeye and Kora which i thought was kind of lamely done! But between Uncas and Alice you find something passionate and rare. I thought it was truly fantastic the way it was done. Slowly growing though not too much interaction between the two. Though throughout the film clues are given and distributed. And at the end, you realize the two would rather die then be alone because the love is so strong between them though there were never any words involved in it. It's as if their love had blinded them from any sort of fear. It's beautifully done and imaged perfectly.Other actors such as the one that played Magua...he also played real well, the thought of revenge for his family was very well expressed though i must say they never quite explained why he hated Mr. Munro so much!For all this and more, this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 for great spontaneous scenes, special effects, wonderful actors, etc...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm actually not totally pleased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I should explain. I'm in the process of reading the entire Leatherstocking Tales by Cooper. 3 out of 5 finished so far. I'm rather impressed. The characters in this film are changed drastically from the story though. Hawkeye isn't boastful, he falls in love, and his entire reason for protecting these girls comes from the love. In the story it's because of the honor he sees in himself for doing such a deed. He left mankind, wasn't adopted by Chingachgook. Uncas didn't speak english clearly at all. The list goes on. Now let me stop for a minute and say, yes, I love this movie. It's fantastic. I listen to the score from the climatic scene often. Lewis is fantastic as Hawkeye. Now why the ending was changed I don't quite follow. In the book (stop reading as this contains a spoiler) it was Cora and Uncas who died. And Cora and Uncas who have love. Alice lives and marries Duncan Heyward, who also lives. Hawkeye and Chingachgook have a VERY emotional scene over Uncas' grave. Magua dies a much more pleasing death in the book. And in general the 3 outsmart the Huron war party every step of the way. It focuses plenty on the tracking techniques and how to be stealthy when dealing with Indians. This movie is more of a hail to old western films, where out and out shooting is the primary way of ridding oneself of Injins.So yeah, I have mixed emotions. I guess it comes from the fact I would love the movie a thousand times more if they had kept some of the scenes in the book that made me stop and just say "Wow" to myself over and over at how intelligent it was, even by today's standards. Uncas diverting a stream to find footprints that were all but buried is one that comes to mind. But as a film, go see it. Rent it, love it, buy it. It's that good. Just don't expect a novel adaptation that is accurate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last of the Mohicans is perfect in almost every way. Yes, Dances With Wolves was interesting and had beautiful scenery and a moving soundtrack, but it has to be said that towards the last third I was hoping it would end soon, as it is over three hours long. Michael Mann, however, expertly made Last of the Mohicans only 100 minutes long. This means there is no unnecessary dialogue, no boring bits and no repetition. It is action-packed, with strong underlying feelings of inspiration and romance. The score is powerful, dramatic and breathtaking, all in one. The penultimate scene is the most exciting and, without giving too much away, it will leave you sobbing yet satisfied. Some may be put off by the violence, but if you watch carefully, you will see that while a lot of it seems bloody, the camera is neatly placed on something else before the crucial killing moment. The amazing pieces of music will leave you wanting to join the Mohicans in their fight for freedom and survival. There is romance too, yet not too much emphasis is placed on it, so the film does not get sidetracked. While Daniel Day Lewis' Irish lilt is occasionally evident, he plays a brilliant Hawkeye. Some things have been changed from the original novel by James Fenimore Cooper, but the film does him justice superbly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic and beautiful film with an extraordinary soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite films, one that I can watch over and over again and never grow tired. It is a classic movie about romance, adventure, sadness and having the courage to follow your feelings. I won't start describing the plot to you. I will instead tell you what sets this movie apart from others.First of all, the cast. It was my first movie with Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe and they were both wonderful. Their acting is so intense, it gets right to your heart. He is undeniably very handsome, although not in the classic Tom Cruise way; he is much more rugged and masculine. The word I would choose to picture her is delicate; frail and vulnerable without being soapy. I especially like her because she is not blond and blue-eyed, doll-like; also not the sex-symbol kind of woman. She is the perfect choice for a romantic role. Her beauty is of the kind which goes to the heart, not to the eyes.Second, the images. I first saw this movie at the theater and I was overwhelmed. I have never seen such beautiful scenery until and I haven't seen such scenery since. It takes your breath away and puts the action into a different perspective; you realize how small you are compared with the world. Since then I have (of course) bought the tape and I must confess that viewing it on a TV-size screen takes something away. But it's beautiful nevertheless.And last but not least, the musical score. It's the perfect example of how a soundtrack can increase the value of a movie by at least 50% (I would have given it a 8/10 instead of a 10/10 if it weren't for the music :). The only soundtrack which comes close to achieving the same result was Michael Madsen's "The Piano". It is simply wonderful and so well connected with the action, you just live everything twice as intense: once through the images and once through the music. It's a music about open spaces and the grandeur and aloofness of nature; a music about war; a music about romance and the way feelings keep growing inside you until you can't contain them anymore; a music about sadness and desperate searching; and so much more.This movie is especially for romantics. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else, I wouldn't want them to sniff at it and say it's just another soapy :). Everyone with his own tastes, after all.</fullReview>

Michael Mann's adaptation ofthe venerable James Fenimore Cooper story dusts off the storyand gives it a ferocity that the author probably never imagined. Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeline Stowe ignite the screen withstolen glances and firey eyes conveying their thoughts. Noclunky dialouge needed here. The battle scenes are fast andvicious, and they get your blood moving. The ambush of theBritish army by the Huron war party is wonderfully shot andedited. The climax of the film becomes a silent picture as Mannuses a graceful camera to capture the emotion and danger that abattle atop a mountain can offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films ever, I can't get enough of this masterpiece. It has all the elements of a classic film, excellent direction by Michael Mann which keeps the film moving, stunning cinematography of lush landscapes, a brilliant cast, beautiful production values (sets, props, art direction, costumes), a fabulous music score by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman (I play the CD quite often), a literate script and more. The cast is perfection, with Daniel Day-Lewis an extremely masculine and rugged Hawkeye, Madeline Stowe so beautiful and stunning as Cora Munro, Jodhi May is the beautiful, Alice Munro and gives a wonderful touch of sadness to her doomed character, Russell Means is brilliant as Chingachcook, Eric Schweig handsome and stoic as Uncas does much with very few lines, the terrific Wes Studi as the vengeful Magua is cunning and evil, yet sympathetic, Maurice Roeves as Munro created an interesting British officer as did Steven Waddington as the rival lover of Cora. To fully enjoy this film in all its glory I would suggest seeing it on blu-ray to experience the sounds and lush colors of this masterpiece. I was quite surprised at Russell Means' performance. It was a very physical and emotional role and he pulled it off magnificently for a non-professional actor. Dennis Banks appeared in a small role as Ongewasgone and he too nailed it. I suspect this film was divinely inspired in some way. This is a film you can watch over and over again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How is this all-timer not in the Top250?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely underrated. Last of the Mohicans just barely falls short of 4-star caliber, but recognizing that it is not quite perfect, I still hold this as one of my favorite 20 films, maybe even top 10 for me. The flaws are very minor. It has a very epic story, but it isn't presented on screen in the most epic manner. The scenes, cuts, and camera angles are just a little weak. I would of liked more widescreen, epic-type shots. The love story has to develop, and it sort of slows the pace of the film. But not too bad at all. That's almost nitpicking. The writing and dialogue is decent at times; it doesn't have enough impactful lines throughout. The characters do not have the greatest depth to them, but doesn't that sort of play to the ending, that the star of the final scene was a side character who barely spoke. I thought the ending was brilliant obviously. No one can argue that the final half-hour or so of this film isn't absolutely awesome. The score during the end is great. Daniel Day Lewis is phenomenal like in all of his roles. Madeleine Stowe is strong. There are 3 distinct scenes that make this movie for me, the waterfall scene, the ambush/battle scene, and the end. Those scenes are all A+ quality and the ending is one of the best ever. It's certain parts of other scenes that barely lessen the film. I agree that Last of the Mohicans just falls short of a masterpiece, but it should be well into the Top250; it is a shame that so many valuable flicks like this one get such low scores. Last of the Mohicans, Titanic, Apollo 13, among many others are getting seriously mistreated. To have a list of the best movies and leave out so many sure-fire classics almost spoils it all. But I can understand how the haters will hate for no reason on certain movies and hence destroy the rating, but Last of the Mohicans doesn't seem like the kind of film that would spawn many haters. That makes the 7.8 score even more confusing. This deserves higher ratings. If I was a film critic I would give this movie a 9/10, but just being a fan of cinema, I can forgive the minor flaws and appreciate the movie as a whole. Gets a perfect 10/10. I really loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Instant Classic !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An instant classic if I need to express this movie in one word.Michael Mann's "The Last of the Mohicans" is loosely based on the famous classic novel of the same name written by James Copper.If we start digging, we will notice lots of the main stream movies have taken its roots from legendary literary works. Well though it's not a bad thing but most of the time in general the movies have always deviated from the source material. End result is, you will find them less gripping than the novel. Well this is not in the case of "The Last of the Mohicans" which is a very good thing. If any of you have read the novel you will know that the story had a kind of tragic ending. None the less, this movie had been highly compelling; I hope every one will agree with me.For those who have not yet seen this movie, the story is set in the time of 1757 when Great Britain &amp; France fought for gaining control of the North American colonies along with the support of local militia &amp; Native American tribes. In parallel to this we also get to see a beautiful love story wedged in the middle of the war. Though this movie does have some unpredictable tragic note still I feel that this movie was extraordinary. I will not go into full details of the story as it really ruins the anticipation.First thing which comes to mind about this movie are its remarkable scenery &amp; an amazing musical score by Randy Edelman. Even if some one does not find the story appealing I am sure they will get transfixed with the soundtrack as well as the hand to hand action displayed which is really satisfying. Considering the time this movie was made I just cannot forget how beautiful the cinematography had been.This movie has used some great talents like Daniel Day-Lewis &amp; Madeleine Stowe?she looked so stunning &amp; majestic ?simply I can't forget her... :) Steven Waddington as Maj. Duncan was also very impressive. Overall I feel it was not only the actors which made this movie a sensation but the story itself along with the backdrop score. Considering all together we were presented with a high octane action adventure. This movie has two versions, one is the "theatrical cut" other one is the "director cut". Well I have seen both of them &amp; the only difference between the two is inclusion of some two minutes footage &amp; emission of one song from the movie. This fact hardly makes any difference.If any of you have not seen this, do give it a try. This definitely should find a place in any collector's shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action/Romance with Pedigree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A retelling of the classic tale from James Fennimore Cooper, although it may be argued the story told here relates more closely to 1936 film adaptation than the original novel, the end result is an effective story.Prior to American Independence, Hawkeye (Daniel Day Lewis) a non-native raised by Chingachgook (Russell Means) who along with his son Uncas (Eric Schweig) are the last members of the Mohican tribe. The three are on good terms with local settlers, but less well disposed to the British Army when the French Indian War breaks out. While trying to remain independent and aid their friends they are drawn directly into the conflict when they encounter Magua (Wes Studi) a native guide fighting for the French. The three of them are successful in rescuing the two daughters (Madeline Stowe, Johdi May) of the local British commander from Magua, but their problems are far from over.While Daniel Day Lewis gives a strong compelling performance, he is effectively matched by Wes Studi who is a powerful screen presence throughout the film. Both Means and Shweig give effective low key performances but Stowe is for the most part underused. Both Steven Waddington and Maurice Roëves also give effective supporting performances.While this could readily be dismissed as essentially an action /romance, it's the films great production values, the impressive pedigree of its contributors and the historical setting that make it considerably more. The film is very impressive thanks likely both to the cinematographer Dante Spinotti, and the dynamic visual style one associates with director Michael Mann. The film also features an evocative and rousing score.While the film won only a single Oscar for Best Sound it was nominated for and won a number of other awards and boasts an impressive rating of 97% from Rotten Tomatoes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enough's been said by my fellow amateur reviewers here that I don't have much to add to remark about this film's greatness. Having seen more than enough of current movies, though, a contemporary director would modify this script to a point where there would be little resemblance to the 1992 work by Mann. First, the pioneer families would complain, complain, complain about being victims of the over- arching villainy of ordinary business interests, wanting to install a Marxist economic system more than anything. Second, Cora and Alice Munro would be using karate kicks, punches and against anyone who attacked them, Indians, French troops, you name it...then they'd slowly walk off after setting explosive charges and would be shown silhouetted against the huge balls of fire. Thirly, Hawkeye would find moments alone with Cora to express his inner feelings of inadequacy and burning hatred of all violence. He'd admit to being plagued by inner demons from the past that he has no power to banish. However, he'd later go out to meet the foe and commit countless stagy, gratuitous acts of violence for which we'd find little justification. Fourthly, Chingachgook would be the main character, keeping the other characters at arms' length, occasionally spouting phrases from Shirley MacClaine's latest works of religious impotence which have nothing to do with traditional American Indian culture or faith. Fifthly, the French would have wisely refrained from attacking British positions and would have already surrendered. Finally, Magua and his band would be revealed to be not American Indian at all, but the last remains from an early settlement of brutal, northern-European white males from the land of Halliburton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Perfection, Yet Easily the Best Historical Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reconstruction of the 'French and Indian War' is amazing in its details. And its romantic elements. Did you notice how Uncas clearly 'falls' for the Brit Alice, who after seeing Magua (Wes Studi) graphically kill him, chooses to leap to her death, than accept being Magua's woman--real 'reincarnation' study. As for things mentioned (doors in wrong places, scene to scene), there are numerous other small editing errors, but i've noted a lot depends on which format, VHS, DVD, you're watching. There's absolutely no explanation, at the end (much weaker on the VHS), why Russel Means declares himself 'The Last of the Anything.'? Still I watch this over and over, as with Carpenter's 'The Thing', one has to remember that screenplays vs. a novel have a wide license, you're not reading prose---you're sitting there enthralled by a vision---and the procedures of cinema are quite apart from literature---scenes are flying by, and few viewers note minor discrepancies---no time for such.the real treasure is the acting/directing, for the most part, and the basic view of that certain time. The sets, clothes, and action are A++. The special-effects, the realism are nothing short of spectacular. Unlike 'thrown-in' romantic hoke as in 'Titanic' (serves no purpose), here we have a wonderful Romance, on film--rare in any era---sure, for the Huron with knife to the the heroine's throat to wait around for Hawk-eye to whack him? Chalk it up to the concept of cinema--whose demands do reach a budget-time-limit. When you see the scenes of Col. Munroe, a typical taciturn Scot meet his adversary, Le General Marquis de Montcalm, with his classic French near obsequious display of respect--no one may forget such. Flawed, yes, but still quite magnificent--worthy of many views--and a solid 'Romance 10'. Oh, and the soundtrack? I yet hear bits of it in TV exercise-for-ladies episodes--another bit that will persist--one 'killer' soundtrack--So if you want historic and accurate action, high romance, and you have not seen it? Please do so---a helluva ride--tough act to follow---i'll never forget a napster user comment---'The bestest movie i ever seed.'</fullReview>

(You must rent Ivanhoe with Steven Waddington if you're a fan of his or even of period stuff) I love how the writers really develop each character, Alice's story line was my favourite.

The score contains possibly one of the best theme's in cinema history. The photography is stunning as is the action. Day Lewis gives his customary brilliant performance. Plus the movie manages to depict native Americans in a way that does not seem like a pathetic apology (see: dances with wolves) or remotely patronising in a "my, they're so mystical and at one with nature" kind of way that most films seem to fall into.

Special praise goes to Russell Means and Eric Schweig, who convey the dignity and decency of their characters with only the slightest of dialogue. Kudos, too, to Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe. Their sizzling chemistry elevates this movie far above the typical western-adventure, boosting it into the cinematic stratosphere.

		<fullReview>Watching this movie has always brought me closer to the truth of the past. The colonialists, thought they were supposed to rule over the land and bring the 'savages' into the "Way of God". It never crossed their minds that they were driving the "True Americans" away from their homes. This movie points out the heroism of a few immigrants and some native Americans. The French and English were only concerned about their possessions. The Indians were concerned about losing their culture and their way of life. The immigrants wanted to raise their children and their crops away from excess taxes and tyranny. We forced them under our rule. They lost their way(s) of life and now, we are the poorer for that loss. Daniel Day Lewis and Wes Studi are the absolute embodiment of that time and these characters, and I applaud them each time I watch this movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers) Although The Last of the Mohicans is sometimes overlooked by movie buffs, it caught my eye. This film is solid all the way around. Set in 1750's New York State when this was America's frontier and the Native Americans ruled the land, the French and Indian War rages on. We begin the film with following a man named Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his two Indian friends Uncas and Chingachgook across the forests. We soon come upon Madeline Stowe's character of Cora Munro and of Maj. Heyward. After and ambush occurs in the forest and a British Company is slaughtered Hawkeye and his company become Ms. Munro and Maj. Heyward's scouts. After various encounters with the Huron and French Armies the movies climaxes with an unforgettable fight along the ledges while an excellent score plays in the background.The Last of the Mohicans is the kind of movie for any movie buff. I has love when it is needed. Drama, action and just a hint of comedy here and their. Daniel Day-Lewis does a superb job as Hawkeye and Russell Means as Chingachgook. The story stays mostly true to the book with a few changes here and there and the visualizations are great with excellent filming of upstate New York. 4 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Drama, but not true to the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was great cinema, but not the story of the Last of the Mochicans as crafted 200 years ago by James Fenimore Cooper. The characters exhibited traits more commonly attributed to the archetypes that was held in Cooper's day. Major Heyward was a good guy from the start, not some nancy, blustering "red coat" with anti-colonist leanings. In love with Alice (the frail, blonde one) from the start, not the dark haired Cora. Uncas loved the dark one, not the blond one, who was stabbed to death by one of Magua's crew, while he was dispatching the reckless Uncas. Hawkeye (Natty Bumppo) was a middle-aged (for the time), non-romantic woodsman with a good rifle, who had no feelings for anyone other than Chengachgook and Uncas his Indian blood brothers. He was a supporter of King and country and the white race (actually a bit of a bigot where bloodlines were considered), not a free-thinking, he-man as portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis. Magua is probably the only one portrayed accurately (with respect to the novel) he was purely, and unremittingly evil. Wes Studi nailed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Fennimore Cooper would be pleased.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to fully appreciate the film, one must first have read the original novel by James Fennimore Cooper. Unfortunately, very few under the age of 40 were exposed to this fine novel and great author if they attended public schools.Students since the late 1960's have been force-fed worthless crap about non-Western-Civ material that will not help them on their road to discovering their purpose in this world.Cooper stands as one of the finest American writers of all time and his books will simply move you and educate you at the same time.Michael Mann has been one of my favorite film makers since Miami Vice. He uses sound, emotion, and filmography all at once. Your senses can be overwhelmed at times; however, if you are not moved by his films, especially this one, your emotions must be dead.The film is fairly true to the original Cooper novel, however, most who have commented on it are wrong! It is a love story at several levels. The first level is that of the relationship of Hawkeye, Uncas, and Chingachgook. Hawkeye is the adopted son of Chingachgook and Uncas is his step-brother. Uncas and Hawkeye were raised in the Mohican ways, but exposed to the white ways in by a Christian missionary.The second level is that between Hawkeye and Cora Munro. The love story at this level was more fully explored in the novel (much easier in print due to the size of the book). However, it was no wonder why Cora chose this magnificent warrior, who saved her and her sister from barbarians, over the stuff-shirt English Major.The third level to the love story is that of the last three Mohicans' for their country. Not just "their land" but all of the untainted and pristine Frontier.At the close, Chingachgook and Hawkeye mourn the loss of the frontier to white-man's progress. But take comfort in the fact that future people will make their homes here, work, suffer, and live.If you don't love this film, I pity you, for it would be very difficult to make a better film. Daniel Day Lewis, a much under utilized actor is great, and Russel Means (Chingachgook) and Eric Schweig are great actors.Enjoy the great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of "Last of the Mohicans" is an outstanding production, with some of the best musical background ever - the mood was completely captured, and add to that brilliant cinematography, superb color and a great performance by all characters, with a special plus to perhaps, today's greatest actor, Daniel Day Lewis. I rate this movie in the Top 10 of the last decade, and each time it is viewed, my appreciation of all the factors above imcreases. The use of sub-titles was excellent, and not overdone, but helped significantly in getting into the full Huron culture and approach. The climax was an outstanding piece of movie making, while the river scenes were completely realistic and gripping. I gave this a 10 out of 10 - it can be viewed many times, and still hold one's interest to the very end.</fullReview>

The music was superb and send chills down my back...you know its good when it can do that every time. I do agree with others...its sad that an entire culture had to be eliminated way back then, but I do love our short history as a nation and will continue to. All of the actors in this film were great, Magua was my favorite. When a movie can make a character part good without having that character say many lines, you know they've done a good job.</fullReview>

Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe deserve a lot of credit and while there love story between Hawk-eye and Cora is beautiful there is another love story not as clear but just as beautiful. The scenes with Uncas and Alice are breathtaking and I love those scenes.I love the scene when they all climb up the waterfall and the shot where Uncas watch Alice and you can see what he is thinking hes feeling something that he never felt before. The music is perfect and dramatic and it is hard holding back the tears.

		<fullReview>I don't think I have ever seen a more accurate (my perception) of how the times might have been. Ms, Stowe is unbelievably good here. Wes who plays Magua is beyond excellent. I believe this film captures the real terror of the white man and the Native American pitted against one another. The invisible wall that existed between them is a barrier one can see on the screen. The battles for the fort are magnificent, and monumental. Shock and Awe. Russel Means is the real thing as the Last Mohican. I love the music, it is the best you will ever hear. Often this music is stolen to build appeal for other films in their trailers. It is a must see for historians and those who believe historical productions provide an important genre in the movie industry. I love this film, it really takes you there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a filmaker's film, pure and simple. Mann obviously loves this story and it's there to see in every shot. The story is brilliantly told, neither toning down the brutality nor overstating or overplaying the stereotypes of the era. An old-fashioned adventure that's been given the attention it deserves with fantastic performances from all involved. Daniel Day-Lewis acts like he's been born into the time and the culture, Wes Studi is suitably malevolent as the Mohican's nemesis, Madeline Stowe and Jodhi May both feisty and intelligent as the two women caught up in the events of an empire's making. Like I said; they just don't make them like this anymore.</fullReview>

Ok the movie resembles English losing one battle... WOW!!! That is NOT the point of the movie...The whole battle thing is brought into this movie to depict the destruction war caused in this land...And ofcourse when you write a film for Indian people its very logical to reveal English and French as destroyers-killers which they were at that period. There is never a possibility I will listen to the ending scene music and my hair wont stand up in excitement... Cheers!! 11/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, this has been my favorite movie since the first time that I saw all of the story lines converge into one awesome theatrical experience. I think that anyone who gives a bad review for this movie sees only one of the levels. When one movie talks so eloquently about the expansion of the British, has multiple love stories, and enough blood-filled battle scenes for even the most blood thirsty, I can't see where people find the faults. I have watched the last half-hour of that movie more times than I care to remember. Starting from when Hawkeye goes into the village to rescue Cora, Alice, and Duncan to the point where the panoramic view shows the deadly blow applied to Magua. The three separate accounts of self-sacrifice should inspire even the most hard-hearted person (except for Alice's suicide maybe). Enough rambling, Last of the Mohicans is the best movie, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Period Piece With A Story That's Somewhat Lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right off the top I have to say that there was a lot about this movie that I admired. As a period piece, it works very well. It has wonderful costumes, and there's a general air of air of authenticity to this.When I say it has an "air of authenticity," I'm not suggesting that it's "historical" or "based on real events," other than in a very loose sense. Obviously, it's based (loosely as I understand it) on the novel by James Fenimore Cooper, and it's set in the midst of a very real historical event. But, generally, it is fiction. But it has an air of authenticity because it seems to offer a believable enough taste of life in a very difficult era."Last of the Mohicans" is set in 1757, at the height of the war between England and France for control of North America. The English-French rivalry is very well portrayed, and I was intrigued toward the end of the movie with the portrayal of the dilemma of the native peoples. How far should they adapt themselves to European colonizers and co-operate with them? Or, should they maintain their sense of self and dignity? Obviously that is, in some ways, still a valid issue for North American natives.All those are good things. Good things - but basic problem is the story is not that interesting as far as I was concerned. The historical elements of the story are basically window dressing to - wait for it - a romance. Of course. The story revolves around Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) - a white man who has adopted Indian ways - helping lead a group of British soldiers to a Fort along with the daughters of the fort's commanders. I have to say that I wondered why - in a time of brutal warfare - the girls were travelling through the wilderness to a British fort. I realize that the fort's commander is their father, but I still found myself wondering. So what if he's their father. This would be a very hazardous journey under the best of conditions. During a time of war, with native war parties in the woods they're travelling through? This seemed unnecessarily risky to me.Setting that question aside, though, I simply found the basic story to be a bit of a yawn - although some of the battle scenes (and there aren't really that many) - were well done and moderately graphic. The acting was pretty good. For my tastes, this just needed something a little more compelling in the storyline to make it worthwhile. (4/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well made and well meaning movie but I was surprised to find myself so unengaged in the story. Daniel Day Lewis looks great but can be seen to be acting rather than being his character. I really found the whole enterprise rather dreary and even boring at times. Dressing a set and costuming the participants is never a waste of time but if the actors are not convincing then you are onto a loser. Only the Native Americans were believable in this film. Magua was a terrific character and was easy to hate at first but then to sympathise with when you knew why he hated so much himself. Some of the action sequences were well directed and set up but I was disappointed that the musical score was not more stirring at these points. Perhaps it is my dislike for Day Lewis's hammy performances that spoil the films I have seen with him in them. This , I guess his least hammy performance but it is still unconvincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last of the Mohicians-Directors Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having the VHS version of this excellent movie, I was anxious to see what the DVD Directors Cut had to offer. I thought it would be even better than the original theatrical release and my own VHS version. I was disappointed with some edits, such as the song "I Will Find You" being deleted from the DVD version. I don't mind additions but the removal of the song was of a major disappointment to me personally . The whole score is absolute excellence but it is diminished by the deletion of that song, played as they search frantically for Cora, Alice and Duncan... I now have the DVD in my collection, but for the first time I feel that the original version is better than the Director's Cut for the DVD. I don't know who made these decisions for the DVD but I don't think they were wise ones. This is such an outstanding movie from beginning to end it should only have been added to and nothing deleted from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Mann's 'The Last of the Mohicans,' a retelling of the tale by James Fenimore Cooper, is interesting in its radical shifts from terrific to terrible and back. Let me ensure that I am a fan of M. Mann as a director, specifically: Heat &amp; Manhunter. I had seen this film some time ago and decided to revisit it due to my affinity for the director and Daniel Day Lewis, whom I think is one of the most gifted actors today. Here's a brief list of the good, the bad and the ugly.THE GOOD Cinematography: Wow! Breathtakingly beautiful landscapes coupled with a fantastic score (Trevor Jones &amp; Randy Edelman) really set the tone early for a legend of epic proportions. I felt this made some of the more unbelievable portions of the movie much easier to accept. Interestingly enough, Dante Spinotti recently worked on the making of Red Dragon, a retelling of Mann's earlier project, Manhunter. Costumes: Kudos to Elsa Zamparelli who actually hasn't done anything of note in recent history. Not surprising she worked on the costumes for 'Dances with Wolves.' Not too much of a reach from this film but her effort deserves recognition none the less. Fight Sequences: Amazing!!! I really couldn't believe how well these scenes were choreographed. I think of so many movies that tried to do what Mann accomplished with this film and didn't even come close to the beauty and fluidity of 'Mohicans.'THE BAD Pace: As he is prone, Mann directed this movie at a snail's pace and I was amazed to see the runtime at only two hours. Epics of this sort do require length to adequately explain the situation, evolve the characters to a point were the viewer's care for them, etc., etc., etc. but this should move quickly to the point were the viewer leaves wanting more (watch Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' to see what I mean). The Score: Though I previously stated how fantastic it was (and I stick by that) the moving theme of the movie was way, way overused. Mann doesn't seem to understand you can have too much of a good thing. I think by the ninth time he panned over the mountains with the score blaring inspiring music and moved to DDL running in slow motion that the awe effect he was looking for had worn off. This leads into.THE UGLY (possible spoilers ahead) One really bad scene: The escape from the massacre towards the end (i.e., canoe race). I blinked and thought that I was watching a different movie. Suddenly the falsity of setting was disgustingly clear and it was like a bucket of cold water. The river had three different looks: 1) stock footage of a river I would expect from a Superstation original, 2) distant shots of stuntmen on the river (not as bad) and 3) the actors in what is clearly a set (that really killed me). There's a particular scene where they go over a small waterfall and it looks like a bathtub and then Mann, seemingly quite impressed with his own cleverness, shows it a second time. For the next 10 minutes of the movie we see the actors in some sort of a cave/underhanging/whatever behind a waterfall. Again the scene is foolish looking. Basically, I felt the movie really lost a step towards the end.I hope I didn't wander too much in my description but I'm sure the point was obvious. Really good / Really bad. Worth seeing? Yes. Rating: 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary Kinetic Movie, with a Great SoundTrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True hero is the white man Hawk Eye (D. Day-Lewis in great shape), while the two Mohicani friends, Chingachook and its Uncas son, act as co-stars. More than in past, the apex of the vicissitude is the besieges of Fort William Henry in which, during the Franco-British war of seven years (1756-63), English were defeated from preponderant French forces. Flaws and Weaknesses do not lack, but a lot has to be forgiven because it recreates an ancient sense of the adventure and of the great spaces, it gives back (also because of the color of Dante Spinotti and a huge sonorous column) the flavour of an age with the taste of an old press, and it has the ingenuous force of great feelings and characters all rounded. The film gives "visual concreteness" to the word "ambush" and holds faith to the beautiful image that was made from the manifesto: the agile Day-Lewis in race with tomahawk in fist and the long carabina on shoulder . A "kinetic" film of wide breath, with an end of cinematographic anthology.</fullReview>

I turn a deaf ear to the 'tarzanesque' and wanton scenes of the first film minutes, but soon my body starts to become embittered when I see the ridiculous first "action" scene, a brawl which reminds to the Bruce Lee movies taking place in a world 300 hundred years younger. 'The Last of the Mohicans' introduces archetypal characters (the glorious hero, the beautiful princess, the unscrupulous villain), a predictable ending and a hardly sufferable development, spiced by a love story so sweetened that you want to turn off the screen. It was actually what I had to do at times ?or at least, leaving somewhere else. In addition, the tear-jerking music during the dramatic key moments ?such as tragic deaths or leaps into the void? produce laughter. Quo vadis, Daniel Day-Lewis? How could Michael Mann persuade him to participate in such a commercial and empty product? Oh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite a great score, very good costumes and make-up, great locations, and some fine acting, this movie was disappointing because of the unnecessary changes to the original story and some poorly written dialogue.Most of the cast were ideal for their roles and performed well: Russell Means, Wes Studi, Eric Schweig, Maurice Roëves, Patrice Chéreau, Jodhi May and Madeleine Stowe. However, I didn't like the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, it seemed contrived and he came across as fake.The original book was a great historical novel that I read several times as a boy and very much enjoyed. However, the movie made too many changes, and would have been better just to follow the book. The movie is too short, there isn't much character development (unlike the book, the movie pays little attention to the Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans). There is too much focus on the romance between Hawkeye and Cora and too little on everything else in the original story.Maj. Duncan Heyward, who is a honourable man in the book, is portrayed in a degrading way in the movie (as an unlikable man who can't shoot straight, and a liar who doesn't care if British settlers are slaughtered). This is an example of the anti-English political agenda and negative stereotyping in the movie (as in other historical movies such as Braveheart and The Patriot). This negative political theme was absent from the book and was entirely unnecessary - it just cheapened the movie.So although The Last of the Mohicans had the right cast, locations, score and original story to make for a truly great movie, it fell far short of expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Second Half Is A Real Treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film in which its first half is slightly slow and kind of a let down, but the second half completely delivers with the drama, action and romance. Scenes such as the final ambush and the mountain top show down really stand out and will impress film lovers. The Last Of The Mohicans is more than likely remembered as a classic because of this second half that really makes up for the first. To start off with, this film has some great performances. It seems that everyone gives it their all, stand outs being Daniel Day-Lewis and Wes Studi. Everyone is believable and really works. The visuals are also pretty great. Lots of beautiful foliage and rivers that are appealing to the eye. There's also a great deal of work put into the costumes and what not, giving the whole film a very "Barry Lyndon" feeling, where you start to feel like your actually seeing people from that time period as opposed to people in costumes on set, which is a huge compliment. The soundtrack is also really great, and enhances every scene that it's used in. My main issue with the film is that the first half can be slightly slow and boring. Yes, there is character development, which is needed to make the second half better, but I just found myself in and out of interest with the first half. I wish the whole film could have been as strong as the second half was, but oh well.Overall, this is a historical film that is quite well done. For fans of movies like Barry Lyndon, you will certainly find something to like. Anyone who has no interest in historical films would, obviously, not find much to please them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New world: falling bodies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could trot off here a number of flaws, I'm sure the same flaws that are generally levelled against the film.Constructed history of a similar sort to what I dislike in Spielberg. The world filtered through simple dualities: nobility and barbarity, law and instinct, sin and redemption, and a lot of effort that goes to shuffle them so that each surfaces in the others, for instance so that the lawful English officer can be shown to be the opposite and noble again in the end. And Day-Lewis was not as interesting at this point, doing a role that DiCaprio could do now.But there's an intuitive horizon here that is worth it for me bypassing all that stuff for. To get there I have to wait for the film to shift from the 'white' world of structured chaos to the 'indian' world of primeval instincts. It's the same effect that Mann used in Manhunter, where again we had the shift from the detective-world of logic and story to the killer's world of latent vision, logic of a different, intuitive kind.The transition happens with a marvelous scene behind a waterfall. Every element in that scene is great, the flickering shadows on cave walls, the concealment against flowing sheets of water, the jump and fall.Past that point the film hits me in a similar way to Malick. Within the more conventionally fabricated whole it may not register, but I find here the ecstatic camera that I saw in New World (which goes back to Aguirre), an attempt to create a different time flow. It's again in the motions of falling bodies against the void, characters staring from afar at the moment of departure. It's good stuff that reminds me why I'm drawn to Mann much more than to someone like Scorsese.. He is intuitively drawn to the notion that these emotional urges in moving us create stories, that all stories are more or less logical attempts to account for mysterious workings in the soul; he was most clear about this in Manhunter but he attempts to know it again in most of his films, even as he entertains himself with some detective story.He didn't gamble here, you can experience this in the typical way. He did in Public Enemies but people balked. They wanted this, the conventionally fabricated history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal Violent Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Michael Mann brings violence, brutality, romance, and striking visuals to dusty old history. Maj Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) is bringing reinforcements to Ft. William Henry with Col Munro's daughters Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May) when they're betrayed by Magua (Wes Studi). Only the timely arrival of Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his two companions saved their lives.This is an old fashion epic infused with modern brutality and violence. I will not debate historical accuracy. That's beyond the point here. It's a romantic melodrama using some real events as backdrop.The action is powerfully done. The brutal violence is even more powerful due to the close quarters nature of the battles. There is no CG in this one. They're doing the real physical stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Daniel Day-Lewis fan, I really looked forward watching this movie. Having heard good critics about the film, I actually expected many things; electrifying performance by Day-Lewis, a nice cinematography and direction, strong side characters, impressive battles. However, after the film ended I found it hard to vote.The film wasn't bad at all. At some extend it did have what I expected, but in a lesser degree. None of the characters had a real depth and that lead to the actors to just perform 'alright'. Duncan and Magua were perhaps the most interesting characters of the story. The British officer was in love with a woman who never wanted him and even died for her, while the Huron warrior was driven by vengeance and it was revealed that his mind was closer to that of the 'White Man'.I also found the writing to be quite shallow. Most important of all, Hawkeye and Cora's romance felt flat - it felt like there was no chemistry between the two. And after all, there is almost no memorable quote from this film.Without a doubt, the soundtrack was the movie's only flawless part; magical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent with a strong cast and definite Heros and bad guys. There was love, betrayal, hatred, deceit, distrust and loyalty. The time period was 1757 and just 9 years later we declared our Independence and 1787 defeated England at Yorktown. A follow on to this movie would be April Morning where a young boy not quite 16 enlists in the town militia to stand with is father (Tommy Lee Jones) who is killed the first day on the Boston common. He spends the rest of the day hiding and firing at the Redcoats. Another movie that follows on to this one is The Patriot starring Mel Gibson. This takes place in South Carolina and concludes with the surrender of Cornwallace at Yorktown. For all practical purposes that was the end of the war but it went on for two more years until the English finally signed surrender documents in New York and we became a nation of 13 states in 1789. The music in Last of the Mohican was beautiful and intoxicating. It also played a significant part in the movie. One will thoroughly enjoy this movie. For most of the movie Cora Monroe was the stronger of the two sisters. However, at the end, Alice Monroe exercised great courage and threw herself off the cliff rather than allow Mauga the pleasure of killing her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most devastating drama ever seen in a cinema movie.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me it was the most devastating drama ever seen in a cinema movie....very unusual for an American movie with happy end. I did not like the book (boring style writing) but the movie is unforgettable. Very characteristic is the soundtrack with psycho-sad effect (especially the part 2 of the soundtrack -&gt; "Elk hunt", Trevor Jones has a particular talent for such effects, see Gulliver's Travels soundtrack). The music has a very important role in drama movies, even if this is a SF (see Solaris 2002, soundtrack by Cliff Martinez, also has a psychedelic-sad effect). In my opinion those movies are not recommended to depressed peoples, there are some parts of soundtracks with subliminal psychic effects, very good chosen by those who made the selection and soundtrack editing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this film some years back... the only thing I could still recall today, before re-watching it, was a brutal fight at one point in it. Having just watched it again, I can say without doubt that it was the fault of the shoddy taste I possessed back then(that I could not remember more of it), and not the quality of this grand motion picture. Michael Mann is an impressive director, and he takes a huge step away from his typical path in creating this film. From a man who usually helms police dramas comes the story of Hawkeye... and this time, it's as huge as it should be(for the first time, from what I understand). The plot is well-written and gripping. It develops constantly... blink and you'll miss something. The pacing is intense... the film never stands still. The version I watched was just over an hour and 45 minutes, and there wasn't a single moment of boredom or distraction among them. As always with Mann, the action is spectacular, and the scope of it is simply stunning. The cinematography is breathtaking... as my father remarked near the end of watching the film, "they found a lot of picturesque locations to shoot at". The editing is effective. The acting is strong all-round. You truly believe that Daniel Day-Lewis grew up among Indians, that he is a master within all the abilities that the Indians were known to possess. The characters are well-written, and going by what my father recollects, quite true to the book, as is the story. A thoroughly entertaining(and seemingly authentic) story of the country that is now known as the United states of America. I recommend this to any fan of epics and/or Mann. 8/10</fullReview>

Fighting action looks fast, brutal but (or should I say) for that reason real. Even the romance is well done. Everything fits!The Indians where portrayed as "normal" human beings: One the one side not stupid villains but villains with reasons to be so. And one the other side not the glorified ecological beings of pure good.There is one thing (but not stopping me from giving it a well deserved 10!): The miraculous appearance of "liveboat canoes" at the end of the Huron slaughter of the British.

		<fullReview>Lasting impressions The cinematography was excellent because the action scenes were not "super human" they were "real" and the camera angles complemented the emotions of the actors and the surrounding situations. When the Indian warriors were engaged in hand to hand combat there was no drawn out flashy choreography, it realistic and brutal. To show the emotion of the actors at moments of intense drama the camera was very close in to establish personal feeling for the actors. Most action scene were mid-shots to extreme close even in a scene were you may want to see the action the camera was close to the faces. I was on the edge of my seat during every action scene and I enjoyed in drama I felt a degree of ambivalence when certain characters were killed because if felt like I knew them on a personal level or I may feel like I was them. The director, I think did a good job of building relation ships with the audience and the actors in a short period of time. He was able to reveal that history of the individuals in a way that was personal.After observing this film several times I couldn't help but notice the way each scene was approached in a way that enabled a smooth transaction from the relatively lengthy dolly shoots into the intense action scenes. This also made a devastating impact on how the characters interacted with each other and how they viewed each other; for instance when the British officer was talking to the Indian scout. The officer was on a horse and on the right side making him appear dominant to the Indian; not only that but yet another example, when the officer was being led by Hawkeye to the fort. They were walking from the left while in the background a raging river flowed against the way the characters were walking, symbolizing the struggles they would encounter and the flood of events that lay on the horizon. The action in the movie was not superficial in the way that some action adventure films are made. Even in the movie "The Patriot" the fight scenes tended to have a scene of mysticism that the brutal fighting and rigid choreography of "Last of the Mohicans" did not have. the extreme solidity of the motions pertained to real life combat. The choreography and the special effects department must have work tirelessly to show the rawness of the French and Indian war. Nobody was flying through the air and punching each others heads off. It was grounded hand to hand fighting. In the battle field scene they used real people and not digital effects most of the extras were professional re-en-actors.In the action scenes despite choreography the camera was kept close to the actor's face, now and then it will go to a mid shot or a full shot. This technique allows the actors to show the emotion with their faces, as in the silent film era, forcing the audience to feel the same feelings or contrary ones. Talking all this into account we see a very expressive style of filming but it still contains equal contrast with wide shots and tight shots, so the viewer doesn't feel like the actors are in his or her face the whole time. Still the viewer makes a connection with the characters. The audience can live the adventure with the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Last of the Mohicans is a very good film. Although a war movie, set during the French and Indian Wars in upstate New York in the mid 1700's, it is primarily a relationship movie. Relationships between father and son; sisters and father; general and troops; suitor and the object of his desire; Native American tribes and European colonists; and between the tribes themselves.What I most like about this film is its focus on the tribes. They are not just window dressing like with other, similar movies. They are the story, the main characters, the center around which the plot revolves.Sadly it does depend on the stereotypical "white adopted son of a chief", but fortunately Daniel Day-Lewis plays it on the up-and-up. It's a pretty good performance.The movie is well photographed and scored, and is set in some beautiful scenery.There are a few problems, a few slow spots, and a few plot holes. But overall it's an outstanding film.9 out of 10.Barky</fullReview>

She was pretty good here. I haven't seen too many movies with her in it but she can't be that bad of an actress, right? I've read the book and I've seen the differences, but this is an instance where the differences aren't bad at all.

It is still one of my favourite soundtrack albums along with the one from "The thin red line". The movie itself is just suberb and Michael Mann deserved an Oscar for his work. I fell in love with this movie and bought it as soon as it came out on VHS. Unfortunately the DVD version is from 20th Century Fox and as I have placed a ban on buying anything from a Murdoch-owned company, I would have gladly gone through life with my old VHS copy until someone bought it for me. So I have it now and the directors copy is neither here nor there as it does not spoil the film for me. I miss the line "Someday you and I are going to have a serious disagreement" but I already have enough to worry about because I now actually own some FOX movies. That aside, the movie rates a 9 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WARNING AGAINST THE DVD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people have given the movie itself praise enough, so I will it to others to sing it's praises while I vent my one major criticism.My criticism is with the DVD release of the movie. Like other people have said, the DVD "Director's Expanded Version" isn't enhanced, it's been hacked. There are a few scenes added that when you look at them, you know why they were edited out in the first place. But what's worse, some of the dialogue and music has been cut. Some good lines were taken out, and the music excerpt from Clannad's "I Will Find You" towards the end is missing. Plus, there is expanded dialogue to the speech made in the end that goes on to predict modern life with buildings and the plight of the faceless office worker- it's preachy and unrealistic.The only reason I can see as to why they did this was a money making scheme- release a hacked up version of a movie that everyone loves on DVD, then when enough people have bought it and seen how messed up it is and clamor for the original theatrical release, they'll re-release the original version on DVD so people will have to buy it all over again.My recommendation is to buy a legal copy of the original, unaltered widescreen version on VHS and copy it to DVD for yourself, in case they never release the "good" version on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid the DVD "director's cut"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The DVD version of Mohicans is terrible. It reveals that Mann really had no clue at all about the movie he was making and that it was originally salvaged by smart editting.There is about 10-15 minutes (though it seems interminable) of reinserted battle-scene footage that serves absolutely no purpose other than to show that Mann apparently likes blowing stuff up and firing big cannons. The original theatrical cut gives small glimpses of the combat, enough to establish a mood, but (correctly) realized that the story isn't about the war, it's about our main characters. The result is the movie really bogs down in the scenes at Fort William..Furthermore, one of Day-Lewis's most "fun" lines from the original version was inexplicably cut from the DVD. (he gives an icy stare to the English officer and says "One day you and I are going to have a serious disagreement.") Good stuff! No clue why Mann cut it.Finally, the WORST addition by far is at the end of the movie. After all the tragedy and deaths, the original cut ends with a short and succinct speech by Chingachgook mourning the death of his son and declaring that he is the "Last of the Mohicans." Cue up music, wide shot of cliffs, roll credits. It was good that way -- a poignant end to a powerfully emotional movie. But in Mann's DVD, the final scene is butchered by a *very* cheesy, very cliched speech by Chingachgook about how the natives are being driven from their lands by white people, and he fortells that eventually they will all disappear, blah blah blah.. and then ends with some really "Hollywood" line about how "but us Mohicans were here first." It's all so contrived and hamfisted that it completely betrays the emotional climax of the movie.I like Mohicans, but avoid the "director's cut" of this movie at all costs.</fullReview>

Don't expect this to be like the book. It is VERY loosely adapted to Cooper's work, and actually takes elements from many of his letherstocking tales. The main differences between the page and the film are: there is no love interest between Natty and a woman in the novel and their is no rivalry between Natty and the British Major (they become really good friends). There is no ambush of the English escort in the woods in the book--yet that is a plus for the film, because it is one of its best scenes. Also the General (the father of the girls) remains alive throughout the written version. The only scene that keeps close to both works is the indian ambush after the surrender of the fort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have Any of the Film's Fans Actually Read the Book?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who've studied up on your history and researched the French and Indian War, you would know that it was a disastrously bloody war between two supreme powers, chaotically pitting the native people of America against each other?some tribes siding with the English and others with the French, each promised notable benefits. The Last of the Mohicans places us into the center of this conflict as a white man, raised by Indians, named Hawkeye/Nathaniel (Daniel Day-Lewis) guides a British group through corybantic rivers and the unpredictable wilderness to their ultimate destination. First of all?to begin on a positive note ?the elaborate, fitting production design is certainly appreciated, as well as some satisfyingly epic battle sequences that wondrously visualize my imaginings of the grandiose battles within the book. Now, I'm going to approach my criticism of this film from the perspective of a literature fan who has recently read the actual 19th- century work. With that in mind, I can say that monumental disappointment struck me not only because of the failed text-to-film adaptation itself but also because it was directed by an otherwise incredibly talented filmmaker (Michael Mann) who has proved time and time again he's leagues above this; I sense this was a director-for-hire sort of project though. What the audience gets is essentially a classic, important, and spectacular story that's boggled down by safe Hollywood conventions. The depth and sheer intricacy of the source material is completely lost on this unfortunate Mann production that is so conspicuously influenced by studio restraints. Considering that this is a nearly 25-year-old film, the remainder of my review will feature major, major spoilers. So, let's look at my first example of the movie's insufficiency: the Huron ambush after the surrender in the novel sees men, women, and children as a part of the English evacuation. The writing brutally illustrates the initiation of the massacre by a Huron bashing a mother's baby against a rock and then driving a tomahawk into the woman's skull. Since Hollywood decided to censor this horrific scene from your oh-so- innocent eyes, allow me to rebel and inform you of its existence myself. Where are all the women and children here? Why wasn't this prized British fort housing anyone other than the male soldiers? Obviously, killing a multitude of armed, fully competent men lessens the impact of the ambush and understates the unfair brutality and utter hostility that came with the French and Indian War. In addition, we get?of course?a forced romance subplot that drastically alters relationships and makes very little sense, forcing me to question its exact necessity other than stereotypically pairing the lead with a romantic interest. Duncan (portrayed by Steven Waddington in this rendition) was involved with the two young women (Cora and Alice) in the novel, establishing an interesting dynamic between the three?an interconnection of confused love. Duncan in the book was also actually a crucial character who bridged the cultural gap between the Native Americans and white folk?certainly a significant theme of the story. In this case, that type of complex thematic material is lazily substituted with archetypal white folk who merely desire their land and act with vapidity. Another one of considerable flaws is the motion picture's abhorrently short runtime (under two hours) for such a grandly-scaled tale that not only initially consisted of far more complex relationships and characters but also a superior build-up in the various one-on-one Indian combats and general clashes. The utter potential is immediately squandered by such a brief duration that cuts plenty of the bulk out, leaving in its stead the Hollywood conventions (of an action film) heretofore mentioned. Aside from cutting out copious pivotal segments, the film also daringly alters some events and puts a new twist on the narrative such as killing off different characters, filling the viewers with intrigue in regards to how this particular cinematic adaptation can pan out differently. Alas, the deaths don't exactly lead into a brand- new direction for the story-- no consequences whatsoever?therefore deeming the disparate decisions a little pointless.The last act takes a surprisingly dark turn, killing off even more significant characters than James Fenimore Cooper did. However, the difference is that the impact of theses deaths isn't genuinely felt, regardless of the body count, since barely anyone in this film is adequately developed in the first place. Uncas (Eric Schweig) is an absolutely major presence in the book as we see his deliberate evolution from a submissive, diffident son to an intrepid warrior who manages to rescue the daughters and formidably face off against Magua (Wes Studi). In this case?on the other hand?we rarely hear so much as an utterance from him, and the camera is only occasionally placed on his whereabouts. This fascinating growth of a character is painfully sacrificed for the sake of a climax that's translated through an indolent montage?little to no dialogue; simply following every plot point from the last part of the book to its definitive finish as quickly as the filmmakers possibly can. A sweeping score plays as apparently principal people are abruptly (or rather anti-climactically) killed. Duncan?the vital cultural bridge in the original story, without so much as a discernible personality here?is burned at the stake very quickly. Alice (Jodhi May)?with very little to do throughout the picture?suicidally leaps off a cliff with a strangely calm demeanor. Even if this adaptation is substantially unfaithful, it could've at least found other compelling alternatives to explore the setting and relationships, but instead, this turns out to be an obviously rushed and poorly executed action flick that has so much thoughtful source material distantly behind it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually thrilling movie whose attempts at Romanticism fall short at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last of the Mohicans is a book written by James Fenimore Cooper in the 1800's. The novel upon which this film was based was part of the Romantic era, and so director Michael Mann evidently tried to bring that spirit and character of the time on screen. However, the film The Last of the Mohicans is a somewhat loose translation of the book, and sometimes the so-called "Romantic" touches are no more than dramatic appeals to modern audiences.There are many things that may have worked in the romantic era, but in this day and age can seem essentially "cheesy," especially on film. There is one scene in which Hawkeye, Daniel Day-Lewis' main character, stares at his romantic interest, Cora, provoking the question: "What are you looking at, sir?" to which he responds, "I'm looking at you, miss." What kind of response is that? This type of dialogue suggests a liberal departure from history, however Mann seems to try to ground the film in history and a trueness to that period. There lies the contradiction, and from it the feeling of cheesiness. Further, Mann also employs wide, sweeping shots of the surrounding nature in which much of the film is set. While true to the Romantic ideal of reverence for nature, after a while one does start to think, "All right, the setting has been established, how about a little more intimacy with the actual characters?" Although, it must be admitted: backgrounds of waterfalls and palates of beautiful, green forests give the film a boost and even realism.It would be difficult to be true to romantic characteristics while trying to appeal to modern audiences. There can't be a ten-minute monologue in which Hawkeye explains to a companion exactly how he is tracking the British soldiers. Modern audiences just wouldn't care. Thankfully, Mann has the sense not to do anything of the sort. He delicately balances Romantic idealism and Hollywood blockbuster standard. The screen is blasted with gunshots, shooting arrows, flying cannons, and explosions galore, and while some of the battles may not have been so dramatic?-and gory?-it certainly does make the heart race in a good way.Now, how do the actors themselves stand in all this? Day-Lewis does a fine job portraying that resourceful, culturally-mixed, almost unapproachable, and All-American hero. He knows when to poke at the humor, as well as he knows how to stir the heartstrings?or play out the drama in a fight sequence. What can one say? This is the kind of role made for Day-Lewis. Madeleine Stowe strongly plays his woman, Cora Munro. She plays the kind of woman who can take charge and, most importantly, grab the interest of the audience. Bringing out the strength of women in the time period, she is a fine supporting actress to the hero Hawkeye. Their romance may be a little corny, but it provides a nice side story for the film. Besides, what's a film based on a Romantic novel without a little romance? Editing is right-on, clearly bringing out the intended pace of the essentially "war film." We don't have too many "conversation scenes" before we are thrown into a battle again, which keeps the blood pumping but also allows some story and depth to be woven into the product. Mann was clearly an experienced director who knew what he wanted and how to get there.All in all, should you watch this movie? Well, what are you looking for? Just a couple of hours to zone out to mindless violent battles? You may be a little bored at times. A timeless romance about an American-Indian and half-Scottish women who meet in the battlefield? You might be a little disappointed, though intrigued at parts. How about a film about a war that tries to be historically accurate but also can entertain with some artistry and modernity? Sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good film!. Excellent soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a very good film!The acting was pretty good, certainly Daniel Day-Lewis did a good job, but the rest of the cast was also good.The music by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman was also excellent! The Last Of The Mohicans won an Oscar for the soundtrack. Personally I'm not sure if that Oscar was deserved, because I think the music in the film 1492: Conquest Of Paradise (by Vangelis), also released in 1992 is maybe a little bit better. But, nevertheless, the music is really excellent! One of the best soundtracks ever made! Michael Mann did a good job as director. The film had some beautiful scenes.If you watch it, try to get the slightly longer DVD-version. I haven't seen that version yet, but I think it will be a little bit better than the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie exciting all the way, although it does have some glaring weaknesses but it still drags you in and makes you forget about some of its faults. I thought Day-Lewis' character was the let down of the whole movie, just irritating he was, Stowe was solid without being brilliant, but the best performance goes to Wes Studi who played the fearsome Huron war captain.I don't know if its in the league of Braveheart for most people, but in comparing the 2 movies i think that LOTM at times soared above the heights of Braveheart, whereas Braveheart has a well developed story and is really solid entertainment, Mohicans is much looser and gives the actors more room to move, i didn't really feel anything for Mel Gibson when he was put to death in braveheart, however the last 10 minutes of Mohicans was some of the most moving i've ever seen. Its a no contest between Jodhi May's final scene and M.Gibson's death in Braveheart, whereas one was genuine the other was less convincing because it wasn't William Wallace suffering it was Mel Gibson. Most of the big name actors have this problem as well: they can't seem to "become" their character instead they bring their real life personality into the film. That is the difference between The Last of the Mohicans and Braveheart, and The Last of the Mohicans and The Patriot. I'm not just picking on Mel Gibson here either, its across the board.I love the way they bring everything together in Mohicans, the music, the scenery, this is what making movies is all about. I like it that there's no reason or apologizing for the murders of the soldiers and innocents alike (British, French, Huron, Mohican) its just how they lived in those times, death was on every side. The bad points in the movie is that there is little character development and some of the heroics of Day-Lewis are a bit hard to stomach, otherwise i thought it was a truly entertaining and different kind of movie to what we usually see in this genre nowdays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly one of the best films ever done, Certainly Michael Mann's best. This film only won the best sound Oscar but should have won more. If you breakdown the movie into the major categories it excels in all of them. The screenplay A work in progress since 1936 is superior. Cinematography-LOTM was not even nominated for an Oscar in this category. I think some of locations chosen for this movie give the movie its grand scope and gritty feel. Best Actor- Daniel Day Lewis has you believing he is an adopted native about 30 seconds into the movie. Editing- the editing of this movie is excellent, just like the characters we are given just enough time to rest before being whisked away to some other adrenaline pumping adventure. Music- Started by Trevor Jones finished by Randy Endleman, this soundtrack is what has me coming back for repeat viewings. Pay attention to the music during the opening sequence and by the end of the movie you will be buying the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>maybe it's just another lavish historical epic, but very well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set during the French and Indian Wars (1754-63), "The Last of the Mohicans" tells the story of a love affair between Nathaniel "Hawkeye" Poe (Daniel Day-Lewis), a white man living with the Indians, and Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe), a colonist. The wars naturally interrupt their relationship.Among other things, the movie does a really neat job showing the vast landscape in upstate New York. I'll admit that I don't know how accurate the movie is, or how closely it follows James Fenimore Cooper's novel, but like "Legends of the Fall", this is what historical epics are all about. This movie, along with "My Left Foot", "In the Name of the Father" and "Gangs of New York", certainly shows Daniel Day-Lewis to be one of the greatest actors of our time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6 out of 10Three Indian trappers must protect two lovely young women from a renegade Huron chief during the French and Indian War. This high epic action/romance tries covering too many themes and bases, but is too short in length to make everything come together. There are a lot of lulls in pacing, and the romance between Daniel-Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe is fairly palpable, but hardly smoldering.To the film's credit, the performances are mostly really good (though Eric Schweig and Jodhi May are underused), the musical score is fantastic and the final half hour displays a sure hand with powerful drama and rousing action sequences. When all is said and done, though, The Last of the Mohicans plays better as escapist entertainment than the grand epic it aspires to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is by far better than the book for many reasons.Hawkeye, in the book, is the dog of the British. He is a scout and is called throughout the whole book as being a scout. From which the surprise of the audience when Hawkeye of the movie told Heyward: "I ain't your scout. And we sure ain't no damn militia." Ironically, Hawkeye of the book rejects the white civilization while helping the ones who spread it. In the novel, Hawkeye is friendly with Colonel Munro and join him to find back Alice and Cora. In the movie, Hawkeye seems totally heroic by standing his ground against the evil and uncompromising Colonel Munro. The Hawkeye of the movie looks smart, independent and does not follow anybody, on the contrary of the Hawkeye of the novel. Hawkeye of the novel does not feel love for any woman; in fact, he does not understand the feeling between men and women, which makes no sense, unless he is gay. Hawkeye of the novel is still a great hero, but is not willing to sacrifice as much as in the movie.Uncas falls in love with Cora in the novel, while Duncan loves Alice. Since Hawkeye or Nathaniel is the protagonist, it is normal that he should have a love story too, while he got none in the novel. That is why in the movie, a love triangle is created between Cora, Hawkeye and Duncan, which create a lot of tension. In the movie, Uncas rather loves Alice, which seems more normal, since they are about the same age (both in the novel and in the movie). In the book, Uncas and Cora both die, but in the movie, both Uncas and Alice die. It is better like this, since it is sad to see them both die, but we are relieved to see that Hawkeye and Cora survived.I like the character of Heyward of the movie. He is a gentleman and is sometime seen as an antagonist, but we later realize that he was misunderstood. He is a soldier, after all, and definitely not a coward. It is normal that he wants to punish Hawkeye for sedition. The sacrifice he gives at the end of the movie shows his worth. It is a good way to redeem himself. In the novel, nothing of that happens.In the novel, Magua's story is elaborated. He had an alcohol problem and was wiped by Colonel Munro, thus he wants his revenge. In the movie, to simplify all his long and complicated story, Magua just says that he lost his wife and that his children were killed by the British army.The scene of the waterfall does not happen at the same time in the novel and in the movie. In the novel, this scene happens at the beginning and is ineffective, since Hawkeye and Cora are not in love. In the movie, this scene happens later, so Hawkeye and Cora had the time to fall in love. Since he loves Cora, Hawkeye does not want to leave her to the Huron. Also, the annoying singer of the novel has been removed. It was better like this, since the singer had no key role in the plot. After, the tribe of the Delaware in the book has been removed. It is much more entertaining to see Hawkeye face the whole Huron tribe alone. In the book, he rather fights the Huron with the Delaware.The most impressive scene of the movie is when the British army is attacked by the Huron. In the movie only, Hawkeye, Uncas and their father save Alice and Cora. In the book, they don't save Alice and Cora. This scene is heroic and the greatest of all.I recommend the director's cut, since the rhythm is better and the last and best quote of the movie is not cut out (the one from Chingachgook). "Then our race will be no more, or be not us." Of course, it is an American movie, made for Americans, thus Americans must not be the bad guys. If that great quote had been said in the theatrical version, the American audience would have felt guilty for what Americans have done to Native Americans. No, it is better for them if the bad guys are the British, the French and the Hurons. Also, the movie is way better on DVD, don't watch it on VHS. The landscapes must fit in the screen. The director's cut is more elaborated, since the introduction describes the setting: "It is the third year of war between France and England for possession of the continent." This is not written in the theatrical version, thus the audience probably had trouble understanding. Stupid Fox!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Fenimore Cooper was another in a prominent line of `European' authors who invented the modern Indian. In this model, the negatives of man were assigned to the white man, and the positives to an artificially ennobled Indian. Americans take this myth very seriously today from the Boy Scouts to environmentalism. And in a sad irony, Native Americans themselves suffer from this fantastic aggrandizement. It is how they see themselves. In my locality, the Native Americans define themselves exclusively through such stories.Cooper's book was poorly structured and written, and survives only because the basic matter -- attractive passion, keening nobility, intrinsic evil -- is so hungrily consumed. We now have a film of this book, and it suffers from the same problems. Even discussing it is without interest. Even Day Lewis' famed intensity is converted into staged traits, patently artificial.But in many other movies, I am content to just enter this mythical world of simple people and clear conflict and just enjoy myself. After all, we have the setting in the oldest mountains on the planet which by themselves amaze. We have some history that is more honest, complex and interesting than say that of `The Patriot.'What puts me off on this, at almost every instant of watching, is Mann's composition. The camera is our eye, but the director determines our philosophy of the world by defining how that eye works. One philosophy is to cast that eye in such a way that it appears to be discovering reality. That's how we use our `real' eyes.Another approach is to see the frame as a stage, and reshape the world so that it all appears therein. The way these poles are mixed is what makes people like dePalma, Tarkovsky and Kubrick worth the time. Hitchcock's `Rear Window' was self-referential in this respect: the very geometry of the world was created by the camera.But Mann is a mere stager. He sets up his camera, defines a boundary and then fills it. His camera doesn't move, explore, discover. The world is created for us. So every shot is artificially filled. No space is empty. This is not like the way Kurosawa fills the frame: we get the impression that Kurosawa's world is so rich that wherever we look, we see many layers. Not so with Mann: we get the impression that he has collected things from all around us and rearranged them in front of us, emptying what is outside our field of vision. Everything we see down to the last detail is false.Once this is pointed out, every shot offends. The direction of the actors follows this: no motion is real -- every movement or affect is artificial. Every motive, plot development, point of action is cartoonish rather than a powerful abstraction (as in, say `Moby Dick,' `Huck Finn,' or `Treasure Island').The French won.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

I mean these things always have the romanticisms attached to them LOL. Most Hollywood made films that deal with Native North Americans always have the negative stereotypes that come with them..... with the exception of "Dances with Wolves". It was great to see that most of the cast were all Natives anyway!! :D So that was a bonus. But I loved that scene where Wes Studi was trying to save that white girl from falling off that cliff after chasing her. She attempted suicide because she didn't want the warrior to take her life. However it was real good to see him trying to save her since he probably never intended on killing her anyway.But......... anyway........... that's why I gave this film a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

More importantly, why haven't they pulled a shot of her from this movie to at least have a picture of her?? I'm thinking the shot from just before she jumps, when a fine mist is gently caressing her perfect hair and face. *sigh* She's every bit as attractive as the girl in Pirates of the Carribbean and King Arthur. ... But I digress... Last of the Mohicans is an incredible adventure love story set in the unspoiled west. Our star is a white boy, who was raised as a Mohican but is bilingual because they sent him to a priest to learn English. It's good stuff people. If you missed it, see it.

Unfortunately, I found I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped, mainly thanks to the director's attempts at po-faced grandeur and the overlong running time that makes some parts feel repetitive despite the engaging characters.On the plus side we have a typically winning performance from Daniel Day-Lewis as the noble hero and a frightening Wes Studi (GERONIMO: AN American LEGEND) playing the vicious enemy. Madeleine Stowe looks lovely in period gear, and the beautiful scenics are played to the hilt. There are a handful of great action sequences thrown in along the way, and the climax is as gripping as they come. But at other times the worthiness becomes dull, and this doesn't have the same kind of untouchable quality as something like THERE WILL BE BLOOD.</fullReview>

I saw his forgotten gem THe Keep which had all the Mann touches: periods of silent acting accompanied by odd lighting and music and this reappears in this film. Far more thoughtful than similar films would be in the action genre Mann has taken Cooper's novel which is dated long before the usual western heroics. Instead of cowboys its the rivalry between the British and the Native American tribes that is the plot. Hawkeye is a white man adopted as a boy by the Mohicans. They have a greater sense of honour than many of the tribes and having been raised as one of them Hawkeye brings this nobility in contrast to them and the ruling British whose ceremony doesn't match his sense of honour. They also have an uneasy relationship. Relying on Hawkeye's local expertize but seeing him as something savage and untrustworthy because of his adoption. This intriguing set up is let down by the lack of characterisation in the script and the repetitious nature of the action. Hawkeye is diluted from the novel's far more independent and abrasive persona and the romance between him and Madelaine Stowe is unconvincing since Mann isn't know for directing romance</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good effort, but hampered by an added poor settler sub-plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last of the Mohican is a great novel. Its is surprisingly sensitive to the cultural divide between Christians and Natives. It sets up a mythology of the great American Frontiersman without casting dispersions on the British, French or Natives. The Hurons are shown to be ruthless, but Haweye expresses respect of their skill and their religion (I was quite surprised when he equated the great spirit with the Christian idea of God). The book is strongly biased in favor of the Mohicans who are presented as noble savages, but shows them to be quite ruthless as well (the French guard that was scalped by Uncas). What Cooper present us with a fascinating story about a clash of cultures -- who live and fight wars according to very different rule books.The movie captures some of the spirit of the book, but focuses more on the adventure than on the clash of cultural values. This movie reproduction follows the original story in many respects, but is flawed by an annoying story of poor American settlers and an anti-British sentiment. As in the Patriot, the British are shown as foolish snobs. As examples the scene where an entire group of British soldiers are surprised and massacred in the woods (duh didn't they use scouts and flanker while marching?). Their snobbish attitude towards the poor Yankee settlers. The resentment of the Americans towards the British regulars (even though it was the American settlers that were the main beneficiary of the war.) I'm really quite puzzled by the anti-British attitude given the strong military alliance between the US and the UK at the time when the movie was filmed (and continuing to the present).The poor settlers are no where in the book. Heyward was not a snob, (anyway hes from Connecticut, not England) he is a brave young man, inexperienced in the ways of wilderness war. He quickly comes to admire Haweye... Unca respects him enough to offer him a leadership role in the final battle, but he declines it. He is also shown to be skilled in the ways of European war, diplomacy and language, but modest. He also learns quickly and is soon shown in the book fighting with a tomahawk. In the book Cora is partly of black origin (through her mother), but that was missed by the movie... (another surprise in the book was how Black Cora is given much more of a role than Blond Alice). Oh and Uncas, not Hawkeye was in love with Cora -- how else could one explain his fanatical drive to rescue her (at her burial, the Indian maidens sing a song about them being united in death).Incidentally, another reviewer criticizes the accuracy of Hawkeye in the movie -- that part is in the book (the long carbine) and its pretty accurate... muzzle loading riffles were used, but were very slow to load which is why they were used by skirmishers, marksmen, and hunters. The range of those 18th century muzzle loading riffles was on a par with modern riffles. Smoothbore muskets were used more often in battle because they could be loaded 4 or more times faster (much better as stopping a calvary charge). In the book Cooper actually calls most of the fire arms riffles, but very few soldiers used riffles at the time.I enjoyed the movie, but marked it down for (1) thrusting in the poor settlers into the story for not apparent reason, (2) the anti-British sentiments, (3) the romance between Hawkeye and Cora. It would definitely not be a good idea to base an essay about the book on this movie. However, the movie is pretty entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not terribly original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie, but it wasn't a masterpiece. The action scenes were enthralling, the locales exquisite, and the drama (particularly from Waddington, Roeves, Means, and Studi) solid. The forest battle scenes and the canoe chase sure were great to watch while on the treadmill. I also liked that the indians weren't all portrayed as peaceful, helpless victims of the evil white man, and that many of the whites were depicted as friendly and fraternal with the natives. My gripes? Well, the music for one, it was great in the opening credits, until i realized it was going to be replayed through the whole movie (much like the indiana jones and happy days themes). The story was kinda dumb as well, gotta get the colonel's two daughters to the fort, where they shouldnt even be, then help them escape amidst tragedy and death. Madeline Stowe was horrible as Cora, virtually every word out of her mouth was an annoying cliche (even worse was her phony english accent). Jodhi May appeared to be far more skillful, but her dialogue and screen time was scant in comparison. Daniel Day Lewis is a fine actor, but his scenes with Cora were equally iritating. I thought the ending was very poor, but not disappointing, since my expectations waned after the first hour. On the other hand, it wasn't a bad film, and though it deserved its mixed reviews, i'd advise those who haven't seen it to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only best version of the Fennimore Cooper classic is the book itself. Never in movie history did someone captures the magic of the book. Here, we have beautiful Day-Lewis, Stowe and May, with beautiful landscapes. Slow motion action (yerk!) and fat ugly instrumental music. Sometimes Day-Lewis looks like a native Rambo. The only good thing about this syrup is Wes Studi. Do you know that this guy can play other roles than Indian? Perhaps he can play a man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very poor adaptation of an excellent novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having finally got round to watching this movie after reading the novel last year, I was compelled to compose a review to vent my utter disappointment in the movie.Yes it looks pretty and yes the music is beautiful, but I cannot understand the reasons for deviating so far from the original plot.The novel was perfect for a movie. Two romances, multiple action scenes, conflict, death and a unique central character. I quite like DDL in his other performances, but here he was so unlike Hawkeye in every way. No humility, quick to anger, lustful and arrogant. Heyward was unlikeable, Cora lacked depth, while Alice, Uncas and Chingachgook were dull and forgettable.The changes in the romances were unnecessary as was the introduction of the militia storyline. This took up time that could have been spent developing the characters so we actually cared when any of them died. I can only guess that the people who love this movie didn't meet these characters on paper first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A historical epic, set during the French and Indian War, The Last of the Mohicans is a movie which has a lot going for it but it also has enough working against it to make the entire package less than satisfying. It's a movie with stunningly brilliant cinematography. Very few movies look as nice. There are some exceedingly well done battle scenes. There are some very good acting performances, most notably from Wes Studi as a truly memorable and menacing villain. Unfortunately there are many areas in which the film fails. Most importantly, the story fails to engage. Yes, there are the nice battle scenes but what happens in between those scenes does not measure up. The pace of the film is slow and plodding and all too often the story being presented simply isn't interesting. It's a movie about romance as much as it is about action. And the romance just doesn't work. The two lead performers, Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe, have little to no chemistry. And the fact that their characters, who come from very different backgrounds to say the least, fall in love seemingly at the drop of a hat strains credulity. As the movie progresses their "epic" romance really isn't very epic at all. The passion and drama in this relationship is sorely lacking. And with so much of the focus on this couple the film ends up being rather dull until another battle scene comes along to liven things up again.For a performer with as many notable credits as Day-Lewis, it must be said that his performance here is disappointing. Stiff, awkward, forced and unconvincing. And as it is his character of Hawkeye, adopted son of the last of the Mohicans of the film's title, who is very much the focus of the story the film never really has much of a chance to succeed. There are some nice pieces around Day-Lewis but his performance has to hold the movie together and he proves to be rather surprisingly not up to the task. If you can't buy into his character you can't buy into the movie. But even a truly brilliant performance would not have been able to hide all the flaws of the story. Much too often the film seems to be simply biding time, with nothing of any particular significance happening. The battle scenes may grab your attention but that's about it. As an action movie the film works. As a romantic drama it fails. And unfortunately the film is too much romance, too little action. It's a movie which leaves you much more impressed with the background scenery than with the story itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Native American Film Should Have Been Dances With Wolves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The epic historical film The Last of the Mohicans is directed by Michael Mann and stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, and Jodhi May. The films take place in 1757 in the American Colonies.The films starts off with three of the Mohicans hunting and successfully killing an antelope. Then the Mohicans are recruited by the British Army to become a militia and are promised that if their homes are attacked that they can go back and defend them by Major Heyward. Major Heyward is dating and plans on marrying Colonel Munro's daughter Cora (Stowe). While the Major, Cora and her sister, and other British troops they are ambushed by Native Americans that are supported by the French only to be saved in perfect time by three Mohicans, including Hawkeye (Day-Lewis). From there Hawkeye and Cora begin to start falling for each other as the tension between the Native Americans, French, and British grows in this corny adventure story.The plot of this film is extremely weak. It is full of romance and drama... just like every other film except that every other film is remotely interesting. The whole time I was watching this film I was losing my interest because there was nothing interesting going on. Everything was so predictable and many things were just unbelievable. Such as how one of the Native Americans faced about twenty and was able to kill them all. And also at the beginning during the ambush that everyone died that was not a significant part. During the film is was queue brutal murder to make an emotional reaction and queue a minor character's death. It just seemed so staged and traditional that it was not at all enjoyable.The acting in the film was not all that great. The great Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the greatest actors of all time, is not known to be such a great actor for this film. Yes, he did put on a believable accent, but I was not able to feel a connection to his character. Nor could I feel one to Stowe's whose performance was not in any way special. All she did was look sad at certain parts and like she was in love at others. Another poor thing is that I did not feel any connection between their characters. If I feel no connection with myself with the characters or between the characters themselves then the acting is not very good.The direction of this film by Michael Mann was under par as well. Anyone can get beautiful shots of beautiful landscape there is nothing noteworthy about that. Mann didn't succeed in getting beautiful shots of not so beautiful landscape, which is what a great director needs to be able to do. A great director also needs to connect the characters on the screen so a connection from the audience to the characters can be made, but yet Mann fails again. Now Michael Mann is a very successful director and he goes on to make some pretty solid films so don't think I am bashing him. It is just good to know that he improves in the future.The best part of the film is easily the score. It is moving and provides the emotion that the rest of the film is not able to give. Perfect for this kind of epic film. The film won an Oscar for sound which it definitely deserves.Overall I give this film a 3/10, due to the fact that it is very bad for the reasons explained above. I don't know why this film is so highly rated everywhere I check, maybe it is not for me. Anyway I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys historical, romance, or epic films.</fullReview>

The story line is weak with "Injun" adopted white man instantly falling in love with English colonel's daughter being allowed so , even acknowledged publicly during the height of a colonial French?English hate campaign , another of the colonel's kin falling in instantaneous love with the savage "Injun" boy , even instantly sacrificing the life for him by jumping off the cliff . Fluent French and English speaking red Indians , three men stalking the forest decimating every hoard of opponents ( of whatever number strength ) they meet everywhere , in the midst of a brutal Indian ambush on the retreating defeated English the clearly recognizable shirt sporting rival clan three Indians are allowed to dodge every bullet , club and tomahawk flung at them ... or do they have to ? everyone ... friend or foe alike seem to make way for them to facilitate escape with their chosen ones indeed totally unharmed !!! Daniel DeyLewis has done much better acting elsewhere .. nothing much that he can do to make the unconvincing violent spectacle more acceptable !! The musical score and photography were the only impressive features in this much hyped bloodshot 'epic' . Albeit the overdoing , the final mountain chase and individual decimation loop was the only gripping segment for me . On any day i would rate " The last Samurai " or even " Dances with wolves " way much higher than this movie rightfully discounted by the Oscar academy !!! Wait a minute ...was that a Bollywood reel that i was watching ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The subject matter's interesting, but the film itself was rather bland and uninvolving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last of the Mohicans basically chronicles the French and Indian war in 1757 and is based on the book by James Fenimore Cooper. It follows 3 trappers who intercept an ambush by Native Americans on a small group of British Militia (which includes 2 of General Munro's daughters) who are being escorted to the General's fort. Love soon begins to blossom between Hawkeye (Day Lewis) who is an adopted son of the Mohicans and one of General Munro's daughters Cora Munro (Stowe). This angers one of the British Milita Major Duncan Heyward (Waddington) due to the fact that he too is in love with Cora.This film is dubbed as an 'Adventure' film, but for me there are certain things I expect when watching a film in this genre; excitement, interesting dialogue, funny/quirky/interesting characters (think Raiders of the Lost Ark). I know that this is a poor analogy as the 2 films are completely different, but the point I'm trying to make is that a really good adventure film will have all these things. A good adventure may have some of these things, but sadly for me Last of the Mohicans had none of these things. I found the characters to be rather dull, the dialogue for the most part was either corny or non descript. Aside from all this, the film was painfully slow and boring (particularly the first hour where very little happened).There were also problems from a technical aspect such as; some of the night time scenes - at one point where Cora and Hawkeye are being stalked by the Natives you can barely see anything because of how dark it was. This was meant to be a tense scene, but how can you feel any tension when you can't see anything? I swear that I was just staring at a blank screen for 10 minutes.There is a scene towards the end where Alice Munro (the General's other daughter)decides to jump off a cliff rather than be killed by Magua. I'm sure this scene will have been moving to a lot of people, but I wasn't particularly moved by her death because again her character was rather bland like most of the other characters in this film. This may sound cold, but I find it hard to get emotional at death scenes in films if characters are uninteresting or aren't well developed - sorry, but that's just me.Last of the Mohicans did get some things right; the score in this film was beautiful and is probably one of the film's greatest strengths so full credit goes to Randy Edelman &amp; Trevor Jones. The battle sequences were well staged and exciting (although they came too infrequently for my liking). I also quite liked the way that Heyward sacrificed himself in order to let Cora and Hawkeye live. I thought his character was 'spineless' for the most part, but this was a nice plot twist and was a 'selfless' act by Heyward. I was also a bit moved when Hawkeye shot Heyward so that he would have a quick painless death rather than a slow painful death by being burned alive. The 2 men didn't get along throughout the film and both helped each other towards the end which was nice to see.The main problems with this film were that it was far too slow moving and the characters and dialogue were largely uninteresting and I was just never given much reason to care about anything that happened. That's a shame as with the interesting subject matter, the potential was most definitely there. Mann has made some great films in his time such as Manhunter Heat &amp; Collateral, but Last of The Mohicans is not one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite the Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So overall the movie looked as if it was intended to be the want to be "Braveheart." Which it didn't come close to at all. First off, I didn't feel any connection to the characters... if one was to die, I wouldn't really care. When Hawkeye and Cora are in love I don't buy it for one minute because there was no gradual rise to that... it appeared they just woke up one morning and decided to be in love. When Alice falls... it clearly is supposed to be a heartbreaking climax of the movie... except for the fact that the movie gave no insight to this character at all causing myself not to care about her fate. I think Daniel Day-Lewis didn't do a swift job in this movie. The movie would have been greater if he would have brought out more of a since of charm or maybe insecure... he didn't however... he played it rough (which is good... but there needs to be some reason for us to love him... follow him... cry with him... and take his journey with him; there is none). I think Madeline Stowe is what kept my interest in the movie... I thought she did an okay job, not great, just enough to keep my interest. I saw no love in her eyes or desire to be with Hawkeye. She was the one who jumped to love him... Lewis had a little better build up than her but still not great. I thought Steven Waddington was good in this movie... he also kept my interest. I thought the settings for this movie were okay (Like waterfall... don't like characters in it, they ruin it, but like waterfall). The fort battle scenes were often confusing because you had no clue what you were watching due to some bad angles with the camera. A note on the storyline... isn't it great how all the characters for the most part die at the end... Kind of gives you a taste of Shakespeare... yes well, anyways on a scale of 10 I would have to rank this movie a 3 the script of the movie a 6.</fullReview>

Daniel Day-Lewis slaying three Indians while running in slow-motion to save his beloved Cora during the post fort-departure ambush was more believable. At least Wes Studi brought a sense of vengeance that viewers could relate to (boy was that guy p***ed). "Magua took the hatchet to color with blood!!!!" He should have starred in the Death Wish movies instead of Charles Bronson. And why the hell did they give Jodhi May so few lines, then have her jump off a cliff??? If I were her agent, I'd be chasing down Michael Mann Crockett-n-Tubbs style. Best part of this film: Chingachcook using his, his, well whatever the hell that thing is called to boomerang/slash/club the enemies of Mohican. I'm sure Foxwoods' security staff would pay him good money to consult. Worst part: Chingachcook's 20 minute speech in the "Special Edition" DVD. Back where I come from, previously deleted footage is best left that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The title is all, or modern day sex on Mann's frontier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During a lifetime spent viewing and talking about movies, my pet peeve has been those who compare movies to books and are congenitally incapable of seeing (that's SEEING) that a movie can be a good movie, even an outstanding one, without being a faithful retelling of the book on which it is based. (Two good examples, EAST OF EDEN and THE WIZARD OF OZ.) Unfortunately I saw Michael Mann's (and Christopher Crowe's) THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS immediately after reading the novel, and for the first time I find myself in the camp of those viewers and critics who make invidious comparisons.There is little left of James Fenimore Cooper but his title. As to characters: Major Heyward, so noble if a trifle stuffy in the book, is unaccountably made a first-rate sonofabitch. This turns him into an uninteresting person except for his last grand gesture. (SPOILERS AHEAD.) Even Munro, the girls' father, even played by charming Maurice Roeves, becomes a villain. But the most disturbing change is the personality of the hero as conceived by actor, director and writers. (Mann and Crowe credit the writers of the 1936 movie.) Cooper's Hawkeye is never arrogant. He is never condescending to frontier tenderfoots. He knows when he's right, and he's supremely confident; but he never needs to prove himself right; and he is never supercilious. In fact, he is scrupulously courteous. But even his name is altered for this movie. Is Daniel Day-Lewis too exalted for the homespun name of America's first superman, Natty Bumppo? I have always believed that if you are changing a good book what you do differently had better be as good, if not better, than what you are replacing -- or, at the least, be more appropriate for your medium. (Dorothy Johnson said she thought the changes made for the movie of her story THE HANGING TREE were improvements.) The point of these changes to Cooper's characters and plot escape me, and what this movie is about eludes me as well, unless it's about sex-ahead-of-its-time. No matter the danger, no matter who has just been brutally killed, hero and heroine always have time for a squeeze. And in crowded Fort William Henry they even find a place to screw as it's being bombarded by Montcalm and his artillery. And they do 20th century, American-movie bite kisses. At least we don't see her mounting HIM, and she stays off her knees. But what we do see of lovemaking is as anachronistic as the slow-motion photography and the over-meticulous effects which jar you away from the 18th century.And all this is less powerful than Cooper's original. There is the unforgettable moment in the novel when Cora realizes that the Indian Magua, to her astonishment, has sexuality, and that it is directed towards her. This is subtly done -- as it had to be at the time Cooper wrote -- and is all the more moving because it is.Madeleine Stowe is excellent as Cora in a quiet and subtle performance. Daniel Day-Lewis is much less interesting than usual because of the script that has him playing a wilderness snot whose main concern is women, or one woman, anyway. And while Chingachgook and Uncas are serviceably played by Russell Means and Eric Schweig, the characters lack the nobility and humanity which in Cooper's book caused us to care so much about them and made almost unbearable the death of Uncas (Cooper's but not the film's last of the Mohicans).Ignoring the novel, however, and taking the film on its own terms, I see this as one of the most over-rated movies of the last couple of decades.Addendum: Did Pete Postlethwaite especially want to be in this. Or was the rest of his now very small part edited out?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyably old fashioned film despite it's flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1759. With England and France at war for control of America, settlers and natives are forced to pick sides, with many being 'drafted' to form colonial militias. Despite the promise of being allowed to return home if their families are attacked, the last three members of the Mohicans decide not to fight and continue their journey west. However Hawkeye and his family come across a war party fighting with the French and track it. When the party attacks a British unit, the Mohawks join the fight and save a handful of the unit. They escort the survivors to the nearest English fort. However, they find themselves drawn into a war that they wanted no part of, made more urgent by Hawkeye's growing love for Cora Munro ? the daughter of an English officer.Despite it's flaws I did enjoy this film for it's solid action sequences, characters and it's total sweep. The plot is more complex in detail than it really is ? in essence it is a love story set against the background of the colonial wars. In this regard it sort of works and sort of doesn't. The war backdrop allows for plenty of skirmishes, battles, stiff upper lips, sacrifice and treachery; all of which is delivered well and are the reasons I kept watching the film, however the weakness of the film is in the core that is meant to act as our focal point ? the romance. The actual love story is rushed and never really convinced me; I'm well aware that many viewers can easily be won over by heroic words and swelling music but without characters who visibly grow on each other then this rarely is enough for me. Hawkeye and Cora have so few good moments together on screen that it is hard to really feel for them as a couple ? their story is still entertaining but I never really cared that these lovers were apart.The direction is good and makes use of the landscapes without doing what usually happens and becoming slow and longer as a film. Even if he doesn't do the businesses as far as the romance is concerned, Mann still gives the film a good healthy pace and it never becomes dull even if it once or twice becomes a bit corny. The performances are mostly good despite the odd iffy touch. Day-Lewis is OK in the lead; he has a good physical presence although I didn't really feel he fitted in with his time ? he had a very modern attitude in some of his dialogue and would a white man 'going native' really be as widely accepted and liked at the time as he was here? Nevertheless he holds the interest well and delivers his lines convincingly and can jump through waterfalls with the best of `em! Stowe was a childhood crush of mine and is still an attractive woman but here she cannot muster enough fire to convince me of the romance. Add to this the fact that she is an 'action babe' at times and has a feisty nature to help with modern audiences and her character and performance are OK without really making the impact they needed to. Waddington is good but it is Wes Studi that stands out in the bad guy role ? a great look and commanding presence. Of the rest of the English, only a small, pre-Suspects role for Postlethwaite stands out and even then that is only due to the surprise of seeing him in such a small role.Overall this is an OK film with enough good factors going for it to provide an enjoyable yarn with good action, pace and characters. It's biggest failing is sadly a near critical one ? the love story. The pivotal romance is not convincing and relies heavily on the rest of the film to carry it, which it nearly does ? in a lesser film the same dialogue and reliance on sweeping music to produce emotions in the audience would have been cheesy and lazy ? here it mostly gets away with it. However for me, the lack of chemistry and convincing love between the two leads was a disappointment and, had it been there, this film would have been a lot better than it was ? still worth a watch though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last of the Mohicans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From writer, producer and director Michael Mann (Heat, Collateral) I was expecting a bit more, but it wasn't too bad. I must admit the first half an hour to me was pretty boring, and I only woke up (not literally) when the bigger battles started when the leading character escapes the death sentence of hanging, and continuing from there. Anyway, from what I gathered, colonial America is the setting of the battle between the British and French troops, and various native American war parties are joining in. In one of the parties, independent man reared as a Mohawk, Nathaniel Poe aka Hawkeye (BAFTA nominated Daniel Day-Lewis) starts a romance with the British officer's daughter Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) complicates things. Hawkeye is somehow caught and as I said, sentenced to be hanged, but he escapes when another battle begins, and he takes Cora and some companions to hide under a waterfall, before a final battle, where all the Mohicans are killed, except one (that's obviously what the title relates to). Also starring Russell Means as Chingachgook, Eric Schweig as Uncas, Jodhi May as Alice Munro, Steven Waddington as Maj. Duncan Heyward, Wes Studi as Magua, Maurice Roëves as Col. Edmund Munro, Patrice Chéreau as Gen. Montcalm, Pete Postlethwaite as Capt. Beams, Colm Meaney as Maj. Ambrose, David Schofield as Sergeant Major and Dylan Baker as Capt. De Bougainville. The war/battle scenes are worth a look, particularly for some small violent moments, and the romance element is okay, this isn't a film I'd see that often, but worth watching. It won the Oscar for Best Sound, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Make Up Artist, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Original Film Score for Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman, Best Production Design and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 9 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 15 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 35 on The 100 Greatest War Films.

		<shortDescription>Too much Jane Austen not enough Apocolypto</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When choosing my viewing choice and peering through the selection of DVDs i had assembled i instantly looked at "The Last of The Mohicans" because of Daniel Day-Lewis and Michael Mann, I read the synopsis and gathered it was an adventure film. I watched this film expecting an epic tale of adventure and found my self vomiting in my mouth for the sheer amount of putrid slush that ruins a film that could of been so much more. My father had briefly described the book and I was very intrigued but this film is awful. If you're looking for an adventure film, it's not what you want if you're looking for a BBC style Austen drama set in a war zone, who is?, it's exactly what you require. The dialog is poor the cast is average, not one of Day-Lewis' better films, in particular the female lead is irritating and the rest are distinctly average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll give this a 3 out of 10 for trying to be an epic. The music that everyone raves about is, frankly, ordinary. Try a movie like Legends Of The Fall if you want truly great music.As to war movies, The Patriot beats this movie by a factor of ten. For one thing, Mel Gibson's character is a suitable centerpiece whereas this movie lacks one.Some of the scenes are truly bizarre. Have a look at that "tea in a field" scene in the first hour of the movie. Why on Earth were they in the middle of a field having tea? And why did the camera zoom back to show us this highly improbable location? This "Director's Expanded Edition" DVD has a bunch of stuff removed from it (according to other comments). This is a major drawback, and goes against the name (Director's EXPANDED Edition), yet 19 of the 20 most recent comments give this movie nothing less than an 8 out of 10. Most give it 10 out of 10. This DEE DVD has no commentary, no extras of any kind. Why? Because this is one very ordinary movie, people.Some poor movies are sleep inducing, others simply fail to draw the viewers in. This movie is in the latter category -- without merits, frankly. The only reasons I can think of for the high votes are (1) the usual ballot stuffing by studio shills, (2) those who love blood and guts movies and enjoy seeing realistic scalping scenes.Michael Mann makes great, and awful, movies. I've got the Special Edition of Heat and like it a great deal, but both The Insider and Collateral were immensely awful.No reason to see this movie. Rent something like The Prestige or The Guardian instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knows the tale of the Last Mohicans. The plot didn't change from the novel.For the most part you see I enjoyed the movie except... well not to put a fine point on it... you see.Background. I am an old bushwhacker. Grew up in the deep woods of Canada's northern forests since I stood the height of a squirrel's knees. The woods look like the one's in the footage. Camped out. Hunted the normal thing. Just like the guys in the movie. So you know that is much like me... So I know you see... Well don't know how to say it, but every single scene I sort of burst out laughing. Its ignorant I know... But you see.No bugs. Hey a close up Daniel Day Lewis, no bites. How does he do that? Clean as a whistle. Everyone else in the movie. No bites.No bugs couldn't get over it. And no see-ums. If you ran around the forest all day you see bugs .... everywhere, all the time from dawn to dusk. No forest on this planet, has no bugs like that. Bugs are part of the forest.This took the believability out of it pronto. In this movie not a mite, a tick, a skitter, a beetle, a spider, a spider's web, or a fly... the little black fly where ever you go... You move in the woods you sweat and breath heavy. You would have bugs and mosquitoes swirling around your beady skull just aiming to land on your juicy skin to grind their mandibles into the skin. In the closeups you would see the little bugs swirling in the back light resting on the face. In this movie. Great cinematography, ... but no bugs.</fullReview>
