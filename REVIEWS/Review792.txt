		<shortDescription>An abomination of near-epic proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One would love to have heard the story planning sessions for this abysmal third film that pretty much put the final nail in the series coffin before a lackluster attempt to revive it with another ill-fated fourth film. Ridley Scott's original was a simple And Then There Were None haunted house feature set in outer space, but filled with jaw-dropping class and style that made it stand out from the pack of a number of worthless imitators. James Cameron's sequel was a virtual text book on how a sequel should be made in that it upped the ante both action-wise and emotionally by expanding the Sigourney Weaver character, getting the audience firmly on her side and giving her a compelling relationship with a daughter figure. If the first film was an homage to a haunted house film, then the sequel is a rip-roaring homage to war films.By contrast, it is difficult to figure what the goal of David Fincher's atrocious sequel is aiming for. It does not up the ante action-wise nor does it expand the characters from the prior films. In fact, Fincher's audience-hating mess offs two of the major characters from the prior film in the opening moments and sidelines another - apparently because of lack of imagination. We then discover relatively early in the proceedings that the leading lady is living on borrowed time, which all but eliminates any rooting interest in the film. While creatively Fincher has license to eliminate audience favorites from the prior films, he cannot jettison them with so little respect and then not replace them with characters at least as interesting without it seeming like a slap in the face, but that is exactly what he does. The denizens of the prison asteroid where the doomed heroine and her ill-fated crew crash in the opening moments is populated by an interchangeable melange of nobodies who blur together.The storyline, such as it is, conspires a dubious and illogical scenario of how an alien could have accompanied our heroine and then propagated itself on the asteroid. Rather than an army of aliens (a la Cameron), Fincher ratchets it back so far that we instead get one modest-sized alien that is far less intriguing or frightening than the one found in Ridley Scott's original. Action-wise we get badly directed, murky-looking scenes of frantic bald men running down hallways. The alien moves at the speed of sound (almost like a Benny Hill sped-up sketch) so that it would be impossible to elude it, yet a number of characters illogically seem able to outrun it.Fincher makes it clear from the start that he is far less interested in action or character development, but merely wishes to hang his own bizarre stabs at style onto an unwieldy framework - and stylistically he is no Ridley Scott or even a James Cameron. Why Weaver, who no doubt could have negotiated for a better story, would have returned and participated in this pap is indefensible. Even worse, why 20th Century Fox did not just end a promising sci-fi saga on a brilliant note and instead chose to have it interred and vivisected by hacks is equally unknowable. As it is, we have the perfect example of Class 101 on how NOT to make a sequel in a successful franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most disappointing sequels of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers ahead)The only film I can think of that I knew I hated before the opening credits even finished. Aliens was by far my favorite of all the movies in this series and before the opening credits are even done, they kill off all the characters which survived from #2--making Ripley's heroic rescue of Newt totally pointless. One of the things I liked about Aliens is that they didn't pull the typical horror movie plot about killing everyone but the main character and then they totally ruin it in this one. If they couldn't get the other actors, okay, but don't kill them off for crying out loud.Other things I hated about this movie: no likeable or memorable characters (strictly monster fodder here), lousy dialog, boring backdrop, a putrid plot with gaping holes and even Ripley is so depressing and lame you are actually glad when she dies. This is one time you would have loved for them to end with the entire movie just being a bad dream Ripley had while sleeping in the cryogenic chamber. Then we could have dumped her and made a movie about Hicks and Bishop fighting aliens.I give this movie a rating of 1. It rates right up there with Highlander 2 in my opinion as one of the worst movie sequels of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kill me! Please!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher has populated his movie with a metric ton of completely unsympathetic characters. The alien spends most of its time chasing random, interchangeable bald convicts to their doom. (They even *look* the same!) Anyone who begins to show some sort of character development (the doctor and the dastardly warden come to mind) are slain immediately. Only Charles S. Dutton gets any mileage out of his character, and manages to pull off the single act of heroism in the entire film.As for our returning heroes: Hicks dies off-screen. Newt appears just long enough to undergo a chest-cracking autopsy. Bishop is reactivated long enough to lament that he is no longer "top of the line" and ask to be switched off again. Ripley herself spends half the movie bemoaning her fate ("We're f*cked!") and trying to convince a convicted rapist/murderer to kill her and put her out of her misery. Clearly, these don't even resemble the scrappy, resourceful characters we've come to admire. No one seems particularly interested in overcoming their situation; I have to ask why should we care, either?What does it all add up to? There is not a single moment of suspense in this entire movie. I really didn't care whether the alien hunted down all those generic convicted felons. I didn't even really care if it hunted down Ripley, since she is clearly set up as doomed from the beginning. This is grim stuff, but not in any interesting way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustratingly Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS AHEAD**I can't help thinking how much better this film could have been, had a more talented writer and director been set to work on it, artists who had a better feel for the series. As it is, I just try to believe that this and it's successor are bad dreams Ripley had after Aliens.The plot holes indicate either a lack of commitment by the creators, or a lack of respect toward the viewers. For example, there is no logical way an egg could've gotten on the Sulaco, which means that the events in the film couldn't have occurred in the first place. Ripley's "great sacrifice" at the end is meaningless, as there is an entire shipfull of eggs ready for collection back on LV-426.Clemens is introduced as the only truly interesting and sympathetic character in the film besides Ripley, and yet is killed off for nothing other than (existential? Ironic? Both?) shock value; all that building-up of a character, which is then flushed down the toilet for no good reason. The other characters are largely nameless and forgettable (excepting possibly Dillon and "85"), existing only as cannon fodder to remind us of how mean and scary the Alien is.Many pro-Alien3 fans point out what an alleged departure this film is from the first two, yet the plot is essentially identical to Alien, except with no real suspense and no characters to root/fear for. We've become well-acquainted with the creatures by now, so there aren't any new surprises there. The action scenes themselves are rather flat, and Fincher completely lacks the subtlety Scott employed with his "impressionistic" shots of the Alien in the first film.Fincher's cinematography is well-done, but it's overly stylistic and distracts the viewer, like he's saying to us, "Look how clever and talented I am!". Weaver gives a good performance, but I just wish she had better material to work with. Alien3 is primarily of interest to film buffs interested in how not to make a successful horror film.Sad, really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely bloody terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has to be the worst of the series. Whereas Alien 4 would be hilarious if it wasn't so tragic, this is terrible in every way. Alien had only one, super-intelligent, creature. Aliens successfully altered the formula by having an army of gormless critters. This film has one alien, but unfortunately it's just as gormless. I won't give away plot points, but it does some stupid things. The characters are all bald in this film, making it more difficult to tell them apart. This fact, along with the fact that they are all rapists, murderers etc. does little to generate sympathy. The only character who we care about, played by Dance, is dropped from the story almost as soon as he appears. Finally, the overall tone of the film is VERY depressing and draining. Fincher (who should be shot for this film, however good Seven and Fight Club were) has tried to describe this film as upbeat. He must have some major emotional issues as you cannot describe a film in which 95% of the cast dies as upbeat.**********PLOT SPOILERS BELOW!!!!****************I can only think that this film was Fincher's deliberate attempt to murder a fantastic franchise. He kills Ripley, for a start, and in killing Hicks he destroys the possible replacement. I can see how the death of Hicks could have worked- going down in the blaze of glory against the aliens- but the helpless and ultimately pathetic death he suffers before the film even starts is wholly unacceptable. Killing Newt is just cruel.I don't know what else to say about this travesty of a film. It has destroyed one of my favourite series of films. No wonder Alien 4 was so bad when it had to follow this crap.I would give it 0/10 if I could, but I can't, so 1 it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abominable - a shame to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is really horrible. It messes up everything that made Alien and Aliens great movies. The transition from the end of Aliens to the beginning of this crap makes no sense at all. The survivors of Aliens are simply killing off, probably for no better reason than that the script simply doesn't fit into the Alien series at all. A military ship jettisoning its crew after a tiny fire (don't they build warships to stand a little damage anymore?). An "escape pod" crashes headlong into a planet with not even an attempt at steering or breaking (wasn't there something called "landing")?. And all of a sudden two Aliens pop up out of nowhere. The nice high-tech environments and cool hardware are exchanged for a prison that more reminds of sewers than anything else. And from there it's just a boring matter of watching the Alien doggy eat all of those feeble, uninteresting characters (good that suddenly humans can outrun the doggy). I have seen this one once and being a fan of Aliens, I regret it. If you liked Alien and Aliens, do yourself a favor and stay away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pales in comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" This is rumor control, and these are the facts.." Alien 3 pales in comparison to the previous two films. It seems David Fincher wanted to combine the elements of the first two films to create a dark, foreboding action movie.Something just didn't work. For one thing there isn't anyone in the film to truly like, after all, everyone is a double y chromo and prone to things like murder and rape. Not exactly the cast you get all teary-eyed over when they meet the alien. Only Riply (Sigourney Weaver) remains from the other films, and she is acting a tad strange in this one too. For example: Ripley is asked to remain in sick-bay because the men have not even seen a woman in years. Remember too, that these are men that are all lifers, having no qualms about committing horrid acts. So what does Riply do? She goes to the mess hall to have lunch with them. Ripley was a very smart woman in the other two films, what happened? Too long in cryogenic sleep? At one point Riply tells the inmates "I've never seen one(the alien) move Quite like this one does." I guess she hasn't seen too many poor cgi effects before. This is the weakest of the alien series. That is, of course, until they made Alien Resurrection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of the series, and one of my least favorite sequels. Truly disastrous. No wonder Fincher and everyone associated with it has disowned it since its release...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In its complexity, "Alien3" is a failed story. It's bleak, it's flawed, it's stupid. "Alien3" is a sequel to two of the most memorable films of all time--and it completely ruins the ending of its 1986 predecessor, "Aliens," by killing off two of the lasting characters and entirely negating the emotional underpinning of the film. It practically scratches out the second movie with its mediocrity, and the fourth scratches out the first.In its simplicity, it sucks.If you recall the ending of the last film, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) survived her encounters with an alien colony, along with the marine, Hicks (Michael Biehn), and a young survivalist much like herself named Newt (Carrie Henn). They were put into cryogenic sleep and all was well. The story ended happily and should have stayed that way. It was the ending we all loved.Now it's ruined. Ripley is picked up by a large space ship another number of years later. She is the only survivor. The spaceship suffered a malfunction. Hicks bled to death and Newt drowned in her cryo chamber. But Ripley believes that Newt may have been impregnated with a chestburster after finding traces of acid on the floor of the ship.That's a problem with this film. Everything's contrived. I was willing to believe that Ellen Ripley could and would encounter aliens once again in the film "Aliens" because the plot was strong, so any minor contrivances set up by James Cameron were not very noticeable. It was a very good sci-fi film, and the more I view it on the new Quadrilogy DVD, the more I grow to like it.Same with "Alien3." The new cut is better than the old one. But it's still an awful film--so bad that everyone associated with it has only bad things to say about it. Even its director, David Fincher, has reportedly disowned the film. He claims that the film is not his, that FOX controlled every aspect of it. He was the only director on the entire Quadrilogy DVD collection to refuse a DVD commentary track recording. "Alien3," even with the superior extended version, still stinks to high heaven. Fincher can disown the film all he wants, but he still made it. The "Alien" series was always dark and brooding and somewhat disturbing, but this pushes the limit--it's too dark, too brooding, too disturbing. The characters are extremely strange and weird; Ellen Ripley is very different, and her new hairstyle--no hair--is just silly. This whole film is just too dark. Another problem? There's nowhere to go after "Aliens." In 1979, "Alien" introduced the new face of horror a year after John Carpenter's "Halloween." The two back-to-back slasher flicks were both very different and yet very similar. One took place in the future, one in the present. Both were films about killing creatures (for Michael Myers is not a human). And so to change the genre, in 1986 James Cameron made the sequel an all-out combat film, preparing audiences for the change with the tagline, "This time it's war." He wanted people to know that it wasn't "Alien." It was "Aliens.""Alien3" is infamous for its awfulness. It is the movie no one wants to claim credit for. Not Fincher, not Hill, not the producers, and not even FOX, really. It made a lot of cash, but for the most part everyone hated it. Some die-hard fans enjoy it, but if you ask them, they'll always tell you that it's the worst of the series (sometimes they choose "Alien Resurrection," though).I'll tell you what: It's certainly my least favorite. I hate this movie. I literally find it painful to watch. And I wouldn't even call myself a huge fan of this series. But it bugs me when directors take liberties to kill off characters. The story of James Cameron's hatred for "Alien3" is pretty well known. Some people say he needs to get over it. Now he's talking about making a sequel with Ridley and forgetting about the latter two sequels. I don't think this is a good idea (forgetting the other two--it would confuse audiences), but I don't blame him for despising "Alien3" and often referencing it as an awful film in his interviews.

		<shortDescription>gag me with a spoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During this movie I found watching the inside of my eyelids much more appealing. Something was just plain wrong about the whole movie. The biggest problem was that I didn't care about any of the characters but Ripley. This film was made in between the use of actual puppets and good computer animation (which is still obvious). That means that many times the Alien looked very fake. I thought the monster was more realistic in the original Alien.Nothing was suspenseful of scary about this movie. The Alien point of view ruins the mystery and suspense of the Alien. I don't want to see what the Alien is seeing, what's the fun in that? I don't want to know where its going, I just want to be surprised. Also, Ripley crashing on a planet of double Y chromosome rapists was immediately lame. Also, the doctor's little sob story made me wanna stop the movie right there. This movie had all the elements of a cheezy blockbuster, an embarrassment to the series. Because of this film, I'll probably never rent Alien: Resurrection. I can't even imagine the far-fetched, pathetic way Ripley comes back. I heard that Jeunet directed that film without knowing how to speak English to the cast. As the Godfather and Star Wars series' pointed out, three's a crowd. This is not an exception. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disastrous sequel that should have never seen the light of day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cameron showed us everything. Tons of aliens running around in bright light, right in front of the camera, and a giant queen alien to top it off.No matter what you thought of THAT movie, but after seeing all those aliens, the worst possible option for a third movie was to go back to the roots with a claustrophobic horror sequel featuring one small alien lurking in the dark. And guess what they did!!! Alien 3 was destined to fail - and fail it did. The "suspense" moments with the alien did not work at all. It gets you from behind, cracks your skull open, pulls you up to the ceiling, well no sh*t! I've never seen that before! ;) The final thirty minutes with the alien chasing prisoners through endless corridors just drag and drag on forever. Maybe the writers should have spent more time on fleshing out the characters before pitting them against the alien! And why use rapists and killers as characters? Are we supposed to feel excitement, thrill, outrage, or pity when they are killed off? Are we supposed to feel anything in this frigid tale of bleakness and despair? I doubt it.Ripley's jump into the hot lead left the audience cold. Her death was predictable and meaningless, since we had given up on her character when she did, half-way into the movie. Her final leap into the bubbling cauldron was allegorical of the movie, if not the fate of the entire series, and a welcome end to a disastrous sequel that should have never seen the light of day.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third act in the Alien series brings nothing new to it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien^3 is a textbook example of how too much studio control can destroy a potentially decent film. After the massive success of Aliens, the studio wanted yet another film to bring in more profit. That makes perfect sense to me. If you have a good thing going then why not milk it? But here's the problem: Aliens ended with very little wiggle room in which to make another film. For all intents and purposes, it was the end of the story. As Alien^3 went through various drafts, the numerous writers attempted to bring new things into the story regarding the aliens. For example, William Gibson's screenplay had the idea of the aliens having an alternate means of reproduction via spores. A very neat idea, mind you, and the descriptions of the transformations in the script would've made for very horrific imagery on film.Unfortunately, Alien^3 decided to throw any good ideas out the window and magically place an alien egg aboard our heroes' ship, despite the fact that in the previous film we are shown that the Queen has left her eggs at the hive.And I'm just getting warmed up.Another common gripe about Alien^3 is the death of the characters Newt and Hicks. Many fans of the film felt that it was necessary and that it helped eliminate the "happy ending" of Aliens. I personally don't think it was a bad idea to kill off the characters, except that it was executed poorly on screen. Their deaths carried no meaning other than to forcefully make Ripley a fish out of water again. Not only that, but Newt and Hicks (who were engaging characters) are replaced by uninteresting stock characters who serve no other purpose than to be cannon fodder. Now the previous two films had their share of cannon fodder, but they at least left you wondering who exactly was going to die. Example: few suspected that Ripley would be the sole survivor of Alien.Lastly, people complain that Alien^3 was nothing more than a retread of the original film. That's very true. Except that, unlike Alien, this film didn't work. Instead we are treated to a rather formulaic slasher-like storyline. The ending is one of the few parts that truly work and it serves as an excellent bookend to the series.Director David Fincher, who was unfortunately reduced to the level of studio puppet, does manage to save the film with his talent in creating a moody atmosphere. One can only wonder how much better this film might have been had he been given a greater amount of control.Alien^3 could best be described as "the great sequel that never was". Given a more interesting script and more control on the director's part, this film could've been at least as good as it's predecessors. Fortunately, Fox took a step in the right direction with Alien Resurrection by having entertaining characters and a more original story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One question...why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This looks like one of those incidents where someone, sometime said "What would happen if..." and the idea spiraled into a film that really should never have been made.Besides being totally unnecessary (as is the case with so many sequels), the movie takes the satisfying, hopeful ending of James Cameron's 1986 'Aliens' (which I loved) and brings it to the most miserable, depressing conclusion imaginable.The major problems with this movie:1. The characters from 'Aliens' (with the exception of Sigourney Weaver, of course) are all dead at the beginning of this film (this is not a spoiler, because it's in the FIRST SCENE). Tough luck to anyone who may have liked the little girl Newt or the android Bishop, and so much for our hopes that a love interest might arise between Weaver's character Ripley and the soldier Hicks (the only military survivor).2. The characters who *are* in this film are, with few exceptions, uninteresting and difficult to feel for. The marines in 'Aliens' were a diverse, colourful, and fascinating group. We rooted for them. With very few exceptions (such as Charles S. Dutton and Charles Dance), we do not root for the prisoners.3. The story is uninspired. We're back to the one-alien-killing-everyone-when-they-have-no-weapons scenario, just like in the original. So much for James Cameron's attempts to actually make the franchise exciting.4. Sigourney Weaver shaves her head. She actually looks quite unattractive, which is a shame because she looked awesome in the tank top and carrying around the heavy artillery in 'Aliens'. Too bad she didn't use the weapons on the costume designer for this one.Overall, it is a sorry addition to the Alien series because everything that follows it (such as the comic books) must accommodate its miserable and depressing plot. This is one of those concepts that should have died at the table.(But do see 'Aliens'...it really does rock!)</fullReview>

In an attempt to extend the Alien series beyond its true life, they came up with an unbelievable concept (as it goes in the world of film) to extend this series. Heck, they even went to ludicrous lengths in Alien: Resurrection.This was a film made for monetary gain, nothing more.

		<fullReview>This movie makes no sense whatsoever. The very beginning is just killer. I know there have been countess discussions on "how did the egg get there?". But instead of going into that (which you can just read on the message boards, I will say this.This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it's not just because of the random egg. These characters don't have any real development and the ones that do get killed anyway. On the special edition they change the entire way the alien was born. This movie was so miserable for David Fincher (who later redeemed himself by making Fight Club) that he was the only director who did not contribute commentary on the Quadrilidgy. Yes, I know he was brought on late, but it didn't stop the movie from being nearly a complete failure.It did have some things going for it, however. I like that this time they had a different host for the bug, so it moves diffrently. And Riply looks decent, even with shaved head. But that's about it.Most of the characters are alien fodder, it has numerous plot holes, and at the end of the day, it just wasn't really that good.Just pretend this and Resurrection didn't happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the response I received from a friend of mine when I asked his opinion of this film before I went to see it; he paused a long time before replying, then said: "I'm sorry; I was searching for the most appropriate words." The bizarre part is, that most people I have spoken to, both guys AND girls, have chosen a very close approximation of this phrase after seeing this movie. Either there is a subliminal message in this movie the audience picked up on, or this really is the only way to describe this movie. After finally seeing this movie years later, I have to agree wholeheartedly.Deliberate spoilers ahead:I liked `Aliens', and wanted to see where the characters would go after the movie. Unfortunately, they literally go nowhere. Newt (the little girl) and the robot are destroyed when the escape pod they were on crash-lands on a prison planet (we see a still photograph of the little girl, horribly burned beyond recognition), conveniently saving the studio a few grand in actors' fees. `Aliens' showed these two struggling valiantly against death for most of the film, and here they don't even make it to the planet alive? Did the producers think the audience wouldn't care about this? The movie begins with this scene, and if I had seen it at the theater, it would have inspired the quickest walkout in history. My friends and I cared about the events 90% less after this.Weaver miraculously survives, as you can't kill the hero or any actor who is commanding $2 million to appear in the film. Apparently this sucked up most of the film's tiny budget, as it was made for only a few million including Weaver's salary. If the producers couldn't do better than this budget for a sequel, they should have waited for more money, because the effects are seen in the claustrophobic prison planet and sets they are on.Apparently, one of the aliens (resourceful little buggers) manages to stow away on the escape pod for the trip (by this time you'd think they would expect this before headin' out. "Computer, have any aliens come on board lately?" "Why yes, there's one hiding under the third manifold in fact. Funny you should ask.)" After Ripley heals up, she discovers she is on a prison world surrounded by male cons who have found religion. She meets Charles Dutton, playing a charming character: `I am a former rapist and murderer of women', he boasts. `Don't I make you nervous?' `No', she replies. `Do I make you nervous?' This scene doesn't create dramatic tension, but does induce nausea.Sigourney Weaver is a gun opponent, and allegedly only agreed to do Alien3 if the producers would eliminate the use of guns in the film to make an anti-gun statement. In this film, she says `You mean you have absolutely NO WEAPONS on this base??' The one alien proceeds to shred most of the male inhabitants with ease. In Aliens, Ripley was blowing away dozens of aliens with her machine gun. Nice, um, anti-gun statement there, Sigourney. The NRA could not have made their point better than this film.Naturally, the evil mega corporation finds out about the alien and high-tails it over to the planet to capture Ripley and the critter. We also find out that Ripley has been implanted with an alien Queen larva, who is about to emerge, and will surely create thousands of more aliens or worse, thousands of sequels like this one. Somehow the bad guys know about this as well. It is never explained how she got implanted with the larvae, but this is one of too many story holes to count.In the final scene, to prevent the bad guys from getting the queen larva she is infested with, Ripley leaps into a convenient pit of molten lava to sacrifice herself for the sake of humanity, just as the queen larva bursts from her chest, in slow motion. This scene has to be seen to be believed. Then again, don't see it. Just believe it happens.I didn't see Alien 4, because I had lost interest in the series after this. The only way they could have induced me to see it is if number four had started with her waking up in the escape pod, shuddering and saying `God, what a horrible nightmare. What a horrible, cheap, underproduced nightmare.'Unfortunately for the audience, the nightmare was real.In honor of the movie's title, three out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad taste in the mouth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is normal to often have a happy story go bad, somehow it just seems out of place here in a way you can't explain in words. Some of the happiness achieved at the end of 'Aliens' is taken away in this third film and it takes forever to get going once the new situation is established. There is minimal action and while the first 'Alien' movie was low on action and made up for it by being and high on tension, this film is just stale. Sigourney Weaver does her best this time around and she is quite good but David Fincher, who did well after this with 'Se7en', 'The Game', and 'Fight Club', seems like the wrong guy to direct a movie like this as his vision is full of potential but low on actual execution as he looks confused at times in the story he is trying to complete. Do yourself a favour and take this one with a grain of salt and put up a road block in lumping it in with 1 &amp; 2, and avoid the fourth film at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insulting to the Alien series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few spoilers ahead, but trust me, it won't make this film any less enjoying, because it couldn't go any lower. I can just say right now that the first two "Alien" films are at the top of GOOD sci-fi movies. They also had two talented directors(Ridley Scott and Jim Cameron) leading them. However, Alien 3 has nothing special about it. I can say right now that Sigourney Weaver is the ONLY good thing this film has.The story and the cinematography is what frustrated me the most. First off, the movie gives no explanation to how another Alien got into Ripley's ship. Strike one. Next, we find that the other three survivors from "Aliens" die in their pods. Strike two AND three. This idiotic move was a team effort of a flashy film editor, the director, the writers, and the cheapskate producers who couldn't afford to have Michael Biehn in the film. Alien 3 is shot using orange/yellow light to make the corridors feel dark and foreboding. Wrong. It simply sickened me because all David Fincher was trying to do was mimic Cameron's clever use of blue-green light in "Aliens". One part in the movie was just so ignorant that it almost made me laugh out loud, until I realized the writers were actually serious. For the first 1/2 hour of Alien 3 a male lead role is built up rather well, and then all of the sudden, he is killed. Right then I knew that this film really blew it. Finally, I should comment on the actual Alien. I can understand that in the first 3 films all the aliens(except the queen) are only briefly shown because of lack of technological advances. In Alien 3 the beast is poorly superimposed onto the film, much like those dogs in Ghostbusters. I still prefer the body-suit aliens, cause at least then they wouldn't look so fake. That's all I have to say about that. 1-10 Overall-- 5 Direction--6 Photography--2 Acting--7 Music score--7 Visuals--6</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the fist two films in the series, needless to say, I was totally pumped to see the third installment. Then I saw the trailer: no weapons, a prison colony, a rookie director?! Has Hell frozen over?This film has to go down as one of the biggest let downs in movie history. When a film goes through twelve scripts, you know a project is in trouble. Have you ever noticed that when a fan of "Alien 3" praises the film, (I'm generalizing) most of the time he/she will comment on the great cinematography? Then if the conversation shifts to "Aliens", (again, I'm generalizing) mostly everyone talks about the great story? This is because the story and characters of "Alien 3" were awful. The characters were not memorable, in fact, it was difficult to distinguish them apart from each other because they were all bald.The master stroke was killing off Hicks and Newt before the opening credits were finished! I almost walked out of the theater and asked for a refund. This means whenever you watch "Aliens", youre thinking, "Oh well, none of this matters, they're dead anyway." The third Alien movie couldn't have been set up better with Hicks and Newt surviving in "Aliens".After seeing this movie, I thought, "Ok, in "Alien 4", Ripley realizes it was all a dream. Now that I've seen "Alien 4", Ripley has two dreams in "Alien 5"!This is a shame. The Alien franchise could have been one of the best film series of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kills off the franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't care about continuity, then this is the flick for you. If you don't care about good characters, then this is for you. If you want to see a future Doctor Who, then this is for you. The biggest problem with this flick is the beginning. In Aliens, Ripley risked her life twice to rescue Hicks, Bishop and the little girl. It was a major plot point and very important to the overall chronology of the films. Along comes Alien3 and the first thing the director does is to kill off all three of the people Ripley had worked so hard to save. These were the only people in the Universe she had any feelings for. To senselessly murder them killed off any interest I had in the rest of the film. The remainder of the flick was unpleasant at best, with no one to root for except Ripley. What kills this film and any others that may follow is the end. When Ripley jumps into the fire pit(Whatever it was) because she is carrying a queen alien just insulted those fans for whom Ripley was the Ultimate Survivor. Now she was dead, and there was no way to carry on the franchise. Alien4 was a cheap cheat, and the less said about it the better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dissapoining end (yes END, there was no 4)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the horror filled excellence of Alien, and the pulse racing, nail biting brilliance of Aliens, Alien3 is somewhat of a let down.After the events on LV-426, the shuttle craft carrying Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop crash lands on a prison planet, populated by the galaxies worst criminals (murderers, r@pists etc). Hicks and Newt are killed in the crash and Ripley is taken in by the prison warden, but the Alien menace has followed her, and to end the nightmare, she will have to make the ultimate sacrifice.This movie isn't terrible, the acting is pretty good for most part, Weaver delivers once again as the heroine of the trilogy, and she is supported by some of Englands finest actors (Charles Dance, Pete Poselthwaite).Ultimately though, the plot of this movie is where it falls short. The setting is dark and dank, which gives a very depressing feel (this was probably the intention, but it doesn't work for me), and basically, very little happens in this movie. Hicks and Newts deaths are easily spotted as cop outs for the studio failing to re hire the actors rather than plot advancements. Then we have lots of arguing between the prisoners over Ripley, an attempted r@pe, then everyone dies.Alien3 seems too contrived to be taken as a serious movie, and comes across as a student film that tries to be too deep. It also feels like a remake sequel, copying Scotts original master piece, almost shamelessly at times.Not the worst movie ever, but a let down, after the first two classic installments</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The funny thing about this movie and I don't mean funny haha, but that the acting is good, the sets are okay, but what really reeked in this movie was the plot.I MEAN IT REALLY SUCKED! This is science fiction. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. Yet they had to revert to the same old plot used in the first movie which was one of the best science fiction/horror movies ever made if not THE BEST horror movie ever made. Trapped with no weapons. Oh geeez give me a break.As I said as well, you can do anything. Meet the original race. Go to another ship. Make the story a few years later. AND this piece of dreck makes watching the second Aliens, which I consider the best sequel, with a plot arc that makes sense, ever made, sort of worthless because you now know no one gets out alive.One of the endearing qualities to ALIENS was Ripley saving Newt and then forming a mother daughter bond wherein Ripley says she won't let anything happen to her.AND on top of that...GIVE ME A BREAK! HOW DID THE ALIEN plant eggs?The alien plants embryos in the sleeping people? How lame is that? Where did they come from? The Queen alien was dead, did an alien managed to jump on the shuttle, plants eggs it was carrying and then die? OR WTF? Made no sense. None at all.So yeah the photography is good, the acting is good, the storyline was unbelievable (and we are talking science fiction here) and it basicaly comes across as a mess with no real direction and definitely no plot arcs that make you suspend your disbelief.I gave it a 1 and was trying to figure out how to give it a MINUS 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish but Empty (And such a disappointing third chapter)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS ALERT)I know I'm in the minority on this, but I hated this chapter with the fire of a thousand suns. This was just such a disappointing direction for the series to go in -- I'm a huge fan of Alien and Aliens, and I walked out of Alien3 halfway through the first time I saw this, when I saw what they'd done to the lovely ending of Aliens. James Cameron made a fantastic, thrilling, pulse-pounding film with the second one, gave Ripley a well-deserved happy ending (complete with a new family) -- and this film goes and takes a dump all over it. It just seemed like a pointless and cruel choice for the series to go in.Fincher may be a prodigiously talented director -- no argument, I'm a huge fan of his other work -- but in this case it's all overblown, overdone -- it feels more to me like a "look what I can do" film exercise than a Scifi film. I just wish the film had paid half as much attention to the script as Fincher does in setting up his shots. Fancy, too-long shots of blood spattering in slo-mo, predictable artsy shadows for the alien to lurk in, etc -- even upon rewatching this (it's taken me three times simply to make it to the end), I just didn't care, and it's obvious the filmmakers don't either. It's very cold, characters are dispatched on schedule, and oh, look at the pretty slomo.On the good side, the acting is uniformly fine, with Weaver fantastic as always in a totally thankless role, and the cinematography is really gorgeous. People get slaughtered right and left but at least it's by candlelight.Ultimately, what bothered me most (and still does) was Alien3's underlying humiliation of Ripley -- it was like they went out of their way to rob her of all previous happiness, then further degrade, debase, and humiliate the character until she dies a gruesome, painful and unhappy death. Um, OK. Nice ending.Anyway, all you Fincher fans will probably throw things at me, but count me in as one of the minority who hated this. (I still love the rumor mill that says Joss Whedon's first draft of Alien Resurrection was to simply make all of Alien3 a dream. Works for me!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seem to remember when I watched this a while ago that I really liked it, and also that it was one of the best in the series. It seems that I was really stupid back then.This movie is horrible. Awful. Terrible. I honestly was surprised at how poorly I reacted to it. I love Fincher, I love the Alien series, I have good memories of enjoying this movie, but this movie is still very poor.Apparently, it isn't much Fincher's fault that it didn't work out so well, what with the studio control issue and whatever, but a lot of what I find distasteful in this film is the Fincher element. This movie is very nihilistic, antimaterialistic, and strongly airs a lot of Fincher's later work. I wouldn't mind it so much, in fact I'd rather enjoy it, except that it messes up Ripley's character too much.In each movie she changes. In the first, she starts out almost completely genderless until the end while in the second she's very motherly. In this one, she's pretty much just despicable. In a way it makes sense... if you kept going through revolving periods of stasis and action--LITERALLY--you'd become a cynical nihilist as well. But this was overdone and unbelievable, not to mention ruined by her very out of character sleeping with the doctor. It doesn't fit, and it makes the ending even worse with her martyrism. Nothing's worse than a nihilist martyr.Anyway, it would make up for it with wonderful visuals if it weren't for the fact that the graphics have aged poorly. The CGI alien, though good for the time, is so bad by today's standards that it's ultimately unbelievable. It's sad that that has happened, but honestly there's no denying it. Apparently Fincher was trying for another psychological horror like the first one (an approach I agree with, considering the second one was pretty much a dull action film), but he shows too much and makes it too bloody. Most of the time the CGI wasn't even needed anyway. Whatever.Finally, I couldn't stand any of the other characters. Their religiosity, their Australian accents, all of that stuff really didn't add anything but a resounding sense of fatigue. It was a risky approach; if it succeeded it would have been awesome. It didn't.This is the worst part of the series.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far the weakest of the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are spoilers in my review) "Alien" was great, and "Aliens" was one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. I was really looking forward to seeing "Alien 3". I wasn't able to see it in the theater, so I decided to rent it.I was really disappointed. As soon as I realized that Hicks, Newt, and Bishop were dead, I had a bad feeling about this movie. It got even worse when I found out that Ripley was going to die. This movie completely ruins the entire series. Why, you may ask? Well, here are some of those reasons:1)First of all, how did the alien get on board the "Sulaco"? The Queen couldn't have laid one of her eggs on the ship, nor was she carrying any of them. My best guess is that the face-hugger snuck on board while the dropship was still on LV4-26.2)Obviously, the deaths of Newt, Hicks, and Bishop bothered me to no end. I was disgusted even further when I realized that Bishop was really just another Company man, interested in only bringing the alien back to Earth. Some like this because it made the rest of the movie filled with hopelessness and despair. But, my God, there IS such things as happy endings! Ripley more than deserved it.3)How could the face-hugger implant an embryo inside Ripley while her cryo-tube was still intact? Furthermore, how can it impregnate her, and then a dog? In "Alien", we found out that the face-hugger is supposed to die after impregnating a living host.4)When the alien burst out of the dog, it already looked like it was fully grown-up. Another mistake. Plus, the creature looked really fake in most parts, except when it was face-to-face with Ripley, probably the best scene in the entire movie.5)Most of the movie was bathed in that orange-yellow light, giving it a really ugly appearance.Surprisingly, Ripley's death wasn't that very earth-shattering. I was actually glad to see her die; she was now free from all the misery and suffering the aliens put her through. Of course, "Alien: Resurrection" comes along...Easily the weak link of the series. It starts to improve with the next sequel, but eventually falls flat on its face. As far as I'm concerned, "Alien" and "Aliens" make up the entire series. The other two don't even exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Alien" + "Aliens" = A Disjointed Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Alien 3" combines the major elements of the first two entries in the popular series to make a disjointed mess that feels forced and rushed. This time Sigourney Weaver crash-lands her space ship from the last installment on a planet of jailed murderers and rapists. Everyone else on the ship dies and she believes that the alien has hitched a ride with her to this new planet. Of course it has and soon she, and everyone else on the planet, is trying to kill the alien and save themselves. "Alien 3" has the eerie feel of the first film and the in-your-face action of the second. These two elements make the film disjointed. At some points the audience is bored stiff and at other moments they are confused by the outlandish action sequences. The direction is never clear and there is no real screenplay here at all. Weaver tries to carry the film by herself, but she lacks the support that she had for the first two entries. Lance Henriksen only makes a token appearance. Charles Dutton is pretty good, but his character lacks the development to really make him interesting. Everyone else is just present and ultimately the alien proves to be little more than a jack-in-the-box monster that hops out at the most predictable moments. Overall a disappointment that is not very impressive at all. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

If you saw and liked "Aliens", avoid this movie at all costs.)You had an excellent film in Aliens, one which could've ended the whole "Alien" saga right there and we would've all been happy. But no, some idiot in the studios decides he's going to buy the rights to make a third flick and does an absolutely horrific job with it. First, let's ruin the previous movie by killing everyone. Then, let's send the main character to a varitable planet of Hell and do a Mad Max-ish rehash of the first movie. Oh yea, let's kill her in the end too.Total failure.There are few movies that I actually *hate*. Granted, Lynch's "Dune" sucked, "AI" was depressing, but this one is just total, total crap and a half. I hate this movie for what it did to the whole "Alien" saga.I give it 0 out of 5 stars. In fact, throw it two or three stars into the negative scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the Alien series. That is, up to when I saw Alien3. The movie is so tortured by bad graphics, lame acting, and a plot that just isn't up to standards, that it shouldn't even be added into the Alien franchise. So many things are overlooked throughout the movie, that I feel that the director didn't even really try. I mean, come on! You are making an Alien movie. It should carefully be considered and thought through, not just thrown out there like some teen slasher flick. And this is very disappointing. Why wouldn't you spend time on a movie that has such high standards, and should be one of the best movies at the time. But instead, the director decided to just make a very mediocre movie (and that's being nice). I really wish that it could have been better, but it's not. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Weakest Of The Four</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: ** out of ****. Alien 3 is a big disappointment. There are many flaws in the film plus one possible plot hole. Many will argue that Alien: Resurrection is worse, but I found many more aspects of that better than Alien 3. The first problem with this movie is the story is basically a rehash of the first Alien. The only difference is that Alien was much more effective. The story is in no way thrilling at all. Also, the tagline for the film "On Earth everyone can hear you scream". What the hell? This movie doesn't take place anywhere near earth. Another problem is the characters which are really poor. I know I did complain about some of Alien's characters, but they were ten times more interesting and likable compared to some of these characters. There are basically too many characters, its obvious there just here to get killed. One of the only characters to have a personality is Charles S. Dutton's characters, but when he talks he sounds more like a reverend. We do not need religious people in an Alien film. It doesnt fit at all.The film does contain good visual effects, one of its strengths. The film also has a dark atmosphere thats suitable. It also has some style by director David Fincher, I liked his point of view shots of the Alien. I also liked the ending, it was the perfect way to end a disappointing film. Unfortunately, these are just about the only strengths Alien 3 has.The action scenes werent that suspenseful. The scene where The Alien pins Ripley against the wall was the only part I felt that was suspenseful. The other scenes I just didnt feel anything. Something else I found disappointing was the killing of Newt and Hicks. I cared much about those characters and they just kill them off here. Overall, Alien 3 is worth watching just to see all of the films but other than that its really disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry, I have tried hard to like this movie but I really don't! The only thing that makes me giving it 3 instead of 1 is that the Directors Cut version I have just seen is an awful lot more cohesive in structure and characterization than the one I saw in the cinema - full credit to Paul McGann. The whole behind the scenes struggle to make the film is very apparent in the final film - characters are introduced and dispatched, and do we care? No The sets are beautiful - but what are they for?! The prisoners / monk set up just isn't credible, Charles Dance is wasted (literally!) for what? There are no answers to any of the questions posed by the first two films, no development to the franchise as we knew the company were no gooders in the first one! The only scenes (apart from the restored Golic ones) that meant anything to me were the ones involving Ripley, Bishop the android and the bodies of Newt &amp; Hicks. They were very poignant after all the trials we had been through with the characters in Aliens. The ending didn't help much at the time I first saw it either, as Ripleys big suicide moment came to the screens too close to Arnies trip to the furnice in T2 to be anything approaching original. But of all the criticism I could heap on this unfortunate film, the biggest one in my eyes is that along with killing Hicks and Newt, the writers dismissed Aliens altogether and turned Alien3 into a dismal rehash of Alien. The more I think of it, the more I am inclined to give it 1 out of 10 after all... But the poster and T shirt were great</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of time and talent is ALIEN 3. Ripley wakes up to find herself on a prison planet. Newt is dead and it is many years later. The prison planet is dark and drab and stark, and so are the characters. For those ALIENS fans hoping for an extension of James Cameron's masterpiece of a sequel, what a huge disappointment ALIEN 3 turned out to be. Death and despair is at every turn, and there is little action to compensate for the gloom that pervades the storyline. Susan "Sigourney" Weaver is absolutely wasted as Ripley. If she were a more discerning actress, perhaps she would have turned down a third go at the role. If the movie itself had been better, perhaps the series would have wound up a memorable trilogy. Instead, this turkey led to an even bigger turkey, ALIEN: RESURRECTION. Neither original director Renny Harlin nor his replacement David Fincher should have been allowed within 500 miles of this project. It needed a sure hand like Cameron's. Believe me when I tell you, you may safely skip this one and the one that follows. For that matter, the fifth movie in the series, AvP, isn't much of an improvement, but in its own odd way is slightly more watchable than ALIEN 3 and ALIEN: RESURRECTION. I agree with those fans who felt the series should have ended with ALIENS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SPOILER ALERT*** This review WILL reveal story elements and other spoilers, stop now if you do not wish to know such information!!!"Alien" was an accidental masterpiece. O'Bannon, Scott and some inspired acting all added up to one of the best monster movies (even it WAS just a guy in a suit in the final analysis) of all time. As a teenager of that time, I can tell you it was seminal to our appreciation of horror AND sci-fi! "Aliens" was sheer genius and one of the most FUN movies to just roller-coaster through! One of the best sci-fi action pictures ever (that's 2 feathers in the cap of this franchise)."Aliens3" brought the sleek bullet-train of the franchise smashing at 130 mph right into a mountain. Never in the history of motion pictures has a deus ex machina so flagrantly betrayed a fanbase. Let's see, you the viewer sat through 4+ hours of gripping excitement and chills...only to have the utter bad-ass heroes, including at CHILD who was one of the coolest young characters ever written for the screen simply wasted OFF SCREEN?????? Oh, but we're being ARTSY here so it's OK. Never mind that the Queen had NO EGGSAC left to make anymore eggs (and clearly wasn't carrying any on her body). Never mind that Burke never had a chance to bring any eggs to the second drop ship, him being busy with dying and all.The BEST I could come up with was Bishop having had secret(possibly even to himself) programming to stash a few eggs on the second dropship when he piloted it down. Of course...where did he GET them? The medical bay only had the two facehuggers. Again, DEUS EX MACHINA. Oz, The Great and Terrible!!! Or in simpler terms LAMENESS beyond anything I've seen on the screen.As if all that wasn't insult enough, the followup to all this heroism is a world of villains and freaks you actually WANTED to see die off anyway? Real good cinematic triumph there Fincher. Again, lame and horrid. Just a sad attempt to make money at the cost of art.As far as I'm concerned, the school of thought that says "Aliens 3" and "Alien: Ressurrection" were simply hypersleep nightmares had by the survivors (most likely Ripley) is the ONLY explanation for this TRAVESTY.End of Line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a horrible movie if you liked "Aliens" (Alien 2). This movie starts out by saying all the heroics and sacrifice in Aliens was a waste of time. This movie starts out by killing the surviving space marine and little girl from Aliens. Why was that necessary? Beyond that there is a big plot hole in that this all is necessary to get an Alien to be used as some kind of weapon. In "Aliens" we saw that a platoon of human space Marines could kill off hundreds of the creatures with limited weapons. A simple shotgun was enough to kill one. So why go through all that trouble? But putting that aside there are still other problems. The action takes place on a prison planet where the convicts were given the choice to leave or stay but this group volunteers to stay due to a new religion. However within minutes of seeing Sigourney Weaver most of the staff turn into rapists. Huh? If they wanted a woman that bad why did they stay behind? Sigourney hops into bed with the local doctor which would to her have been about the day after the events in "Aliens" took place. Why was that? If you set aside all that it still boils down to people with bare hands in a dark setting against an Alien predator. It was done before and better in the original "Alien". This is a waste of time and energy.</fullReview>

Gibson's version of the Alien 3 script, parts of which were incorporated into Alien Resurrection, is by far superior to this literary accident. One glaring factual error mars the script before the Alien even gets any screen time: cholera is not a virus, it is a bacterium. A reference to bubonic plague or ebola would have been far more appropriate, given that we're talking about a dead body in that scene.However, the fundamental problem in Alien 3 is the humans. In the previous two installments of the series, you could have almost called the films "Human" and "Humans" respectively, because the alien was often incidental to the way the human characters related to one another. The alien seemed to exist only to highlight the dangers of curiosity without caution or cooperation at times. Add to this the fact that both the films feature the best simulations of alien creatures outside of the digital era, and you can soon see where Alien 3 falls down.A special effects company who won't be mentioned here rallied hard for the contract to do the CGI effects for the alien in some shots. Funny that, because when one rallies to be awarded a job, one normally tries to do a good one. The alien in this film was so poorly simulated during CGI shots that it is quite clear which shots are the man in the suit, and which ones aren't. But by far the worst aspect of the film is the manner in which the human characters are conspicuously reduced at one point. It highlights the fact that the characters are not fleshed out enough for anyone to care.Another problem that becomes apparent when watching making-ofs is that the film was rushed into production without even a script to work from. The manner in which cast and crew members defend director David Fincher, highlighting the fact that he had to start shooting without a script, really suggests where the blame should be laid. Of the crew, only Alex Thomson is willing to openly blame the studio, but the fact that he is long since retired makes it clear that Fox particularly has a big problem with the dismal failure of this rush job.I gave Alien 3 a two out of ten. The first thought that came to mind when I saw the third Alien film at the theatre was one of disappointment. The last thought was that at least they couldn't screw the series up any worse. Alien Resurrection didn't prove me wrong as far as entertainment value was concerned. This movie sucks like a Godfrey's showroom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh it was disappointing and bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien? takes everything from the first two films and obliterates it. They tried way to hard to scare people by putting in all sorts of gore and showing the Alien everywhere. As I have said in my reviews of Halloween, gore does not equal scary and sadly the makers of this movie could not realize this. The story is good but is dragged down plot holes that occur all throughout the film. While there is some good acting, there are no interesting characters except for Riply (the writers saw to that didn't they). This film seriously lacked the horror of the first film and the action of the second. Where was James Cameron when we needed him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's fun to compare Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher, the directors of Alien, Aliens and Alien^3, respectively. You couldn't find three more different directors. In Alien ^3, Fincher wants you to think he's cool. In Aliens, Cameron wants you to see the movie three times at the theater, tell all your friends how terrific it is, then buy the video the day it comes out. And in Alien, Scott wants you to eat sh*t and die. Cameron and Scott succeed, Fincher fails.Or maybe: Scott is NYC, Cameron is LA, and Fincher is Seattle.How about: Scott is a Lamborghini, Cameron is a Lincoln Navigator, and Fincher is a Prius with a Hummer hidden in the garage at home.Alien^3 just doesn't make it. Its grim penal colony is a boring clich. The script is lame. Because of it, Sigourney Weaver gives her weakest performance in the Alien series. Alien^3 tries to be pretentious and fails even at that. Skip over this one and move on to Alien Resurrection, which might not be up to the standards of the first two but still towers above Alien^3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ugly, depressing mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Calling this movie a disappoitnment is an understatement. "Alien 3" would be a bad movie on its own, but following the masterpieces that were "Alien" and "Aliens" makes it even worse."Alien 3" is a relentlessly grim movie. For starters, Newt and Hicks are killed off literally at the beginning. The two people who gave Ripley some much-deserved completion and happiness in her life at the end of "Aliens" are instantly killed. It's not a good sign when the audience is depressed before the opening credits are even over. The setting of the movie is really bleak as well. It's set on an abonened prison colony on a hot, lice-infested planer occupied by criminals who have formed some kind of religious cult. Ripley, like all the other occupants of the colony, are trapped on this planet with no way out. And as it turns out, an alien is right down there with them. The hopelessness of the whole scenario and the fact that there are no likeable characters other than Ripley make this movie a real downer. The whole movie is real ugly to look at and badly lit. The inept direction and editing make the whole movie real confusing. The score is decent, but it hardly matches up to the excellent scores of Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner in the first two films.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie as well as the next one in the series, "Alien Resurrestion." Watch the first two movies instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would happen if the Alien series had been turned into a TV series? Lots of episodes just like this one. Alien3 breaks no new ground, introduces no new characters, and rehashes rather blandly the plots that preceded it. Predictable, dreary, dismal.If this is the only Alien movie you've seen and you didn't like it, take heart. Aliens is one of the finest sci fi or war movies ever made, and Alien did for horror what Star Trek did for sci fi.My advice would be to skip this one unless you, like I, just can't resist finding out what happened in the chapter you were told to avoid all along. Charles Dance (the Doctor) is the only bright spot. A 3 on a scale of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing the trailers for this film the December before it opened. On a sort of high from just seeing the first two movies, I was expecting big things from the second "Alien" sequel, and the trailer promised exactly that: "In space, no one can hear you scream... but on Earth, everyone can!" was the tagline.So what do we get instead? A wretched excuse for a sequel to two of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. First of all, the story is beyond simply depressing... it undoes everything from the first two movies, and utterly destroys Ripley's world. Everything she's fought for is for naught. We almost want her to die, to end the ceaseless buffet of suffering her life has become. We must suffer through uninteresting characters that are indistinguishable from each other, dull "turn around and there's the alien" shocks, poor camera work during the action sequences (some would call it style, I call it confusing and obnoxious), and finally the ending that gels perfectly with this bottomless abyss of a movie. Alien Ressurection be damned... this travesty should have been a dream, and David Fincher should have stuck to directing Madonna videos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did IQs drop sharply while this film was being made? How did the facehuggers get on to the Sulako? How? Watch the end of Aliens - the Queen is quite clearly NOT carrying any eggs. This is the worst type of sequel, one which undermines previous films in an attempt to eclipse them. The story for Alien3 doesn't consider Alien or Aliens at all. Unforgivably it instead does its best to wipe the slate clean killing Newt and Hicks off in the cheapest most anonymous way possible. This makes the rescue of Newt (the last 20 minutes of the fantastic and infinitely superior Aliens) totally redundant.The sets and music are on the whole good but lack the imagination and variety of the previous two films. The CGI is dreadful, the Aliens size is inconsistent and on several occasions it looks as 2 dimensional as the plot. Also the inter crew tension from the first film and marine banter from the second film is replaced with vulgar insults exchanged between the prisoners. Its a strange coincidence that the sole convict character with any merit is the only one with an American accent. Sigourney Weaver puts in a huge effort but its not enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie definitely wasn't it. There were plot holes you could fly a starship through, starting with a ridiculous initial premise. The characters were uninteresting. I was never sure who just died or why I should care. I've always believed that there was more potential backstory that could have been mined from the original Alien. Primarily, some scriptwriter could have given thought to the original alien spacecraft, where it came from, why were they transporting these creatures, what went wrong, etc. Unfortunately, that would have required intelligent thought and some originality, which is -not- what went into this film. There are two things I remember about the first time I saw this film. One was that I caught myself checking my watch a lot (which didn't happen when I saw Aliens the first time). Second, I remember feeling utterly depressed when it was (finally) over. Over the years, I've largely been successful in purging this film from my mind, but every now and then something happens to remind me of it and of how much I hated it. As I said, I wish someone would make a sequel to Aliens, forgetting that this travesty ever existed.</fullReview>

The hypersleep pods are totally different. The ship design was different. The "Sulaco" painted on the ship was white instead of black. The alien was plainly stupid in not cocooning the victims as in previous films. Killing off the main characters was pointless. The prisoners know only one word, the "F" word. The gore is excessive and thrust directly in the audience's face unlike the stylish methods in the first two films.This was not an ALIEN movie. It was a copycat clone that screwed up every chance it got. Those who say it was a "good" or an "okay" film are forgetting that it is a SEQUEL which has certain responsibilites to live up to.Michael Biehn (Hicks) once said, "They will never top ALIENS."

		<shortDescription>Third time's NOT the charm....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a limit to how many times a story can be told....For the "Alien" saga, that number is 3.This third installment of the venerable saga basically plays out like a Greek tragedy where everything is desolate and everyone is in despair, either over personal loss or their own discontent. Ripley ends up on a prison planet and, of course, one of the aliens from the original has followed her, ensuring an onslaught of epic proportions. UNFORTUNATELY, too much time is given to think about certain plot points. Such as:Why are so many interesting characters introduced (namely Dance), then dropped so arbitrarily?Why does Fincher's direction seem so shaky and unsure (in great contrast to his work in "Se7en")?How could the same writers (mainly Hill and Giler) write a story that has little or no emotional impact and next to no development as far as plot, motivation or even (in the alien's instance) shock value?And you'll notice, once you've seen this film, that it hasn't got the same sensibilities the first film had. There is too much time spent on the downbeat, the morose and the evil that men do that there is little to no time left for the sporadic alien attacks. Sometimes, it's easy to forget this is science fiction we're watching; it might as well be a prison drama for all this movie cares.I won't give away how this movie ends, but to ask one question: if this was, indeed how the series was supposed to end, what are we to make of Ripley's act? Was she indeed being ascended to the Christ-like for her actions (as is made all too obvious by the final symbolism) or was she a martyr for the cause of good vs. evil? Or was it, as is my opinion, misplaced symbolism just for symbolism's sake?Even in the theater I saw this in, many of those around me reacted to this film like they would one of "Alien"'s many rip-offs. Lots of exasperated sighs at different points, some non-amused laughter and at least one person commented aloud "Aw, jeez!".My feelings, exactly.Three stars for the effort but as far as sequels go, this probably wasn't as "Alien" a product as they wanted to get to the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the sequel that never should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien was nothing short of a true sci-fi masterpiece from the great Ridley Scott. Then James Cameron comes in and creates one of the greatest sequels of all time. But Alien 3 is the absolute slap in the face to anyone who loves the series. This is a cold, heartless, and hopeless film. When I saw this film, I felt absolutely nothing for any of the characters. My only compassion went to Ripley at seeing all the hardships she had endured throughout the ordeal. The film had absolutely no memorable or likeable characters so when someone got killed, I really didn't care. What really bothers me about the film is it's lack of heart. The film had absolutely no humanity to it. I felt emotionally cut off by it from the opening credits. The death of Newt and Hicks, to me, was a huge mistake. I really thought that something could have emerged between Hicks and Ripley. And Ripley's relationship with Newt was such a wonderful connection that was really the driving force of Aliens. But now with Hicks and Newt dead, Ripley seems to have lost all her humanity and soul which gives the audience nothing to root for. All in all, this film can never and will never go up to par with the original two, and I continue to refuse to acknowledge Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection as part of the franchise. I even hear that there is a possible Alien 5. My only advice to Fox is that they get either Ridley Scott or James Cameron back in the director's chair. If you really want to enjoy a good Alien film, then watch Alien and Aliens. Don't waste your time with any others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There should be a rule of sequels that one does not invalidate the entire purpose of the one preceding it.Aliens 3 cynically opens with, "Hey everything you saw in Aliens 2, everything Ripley endured and did meant NOTHING."Once you strip away that gleam of hope, instill a complete sense of futility, you create in the viewer a, "What's the purpose, they are all gonna die anyway" mindset. Sequels these days while complained about do carry with them advantage over say the trilogies of even a decade ago. Today most films with even a promise of a sequel or a series of sequels carry along with them a story arc. There is a lot less of the making it up as we go along to the writing of each installment than in the past. Even this is a double edge sword. Where as you don't have to explain how a person who in the first movement was seen having their head chopped off didn't really die, you loose the creativity of having to write yourself out of what was once a story's deadend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Alien" was a relentlessly bleak, beautifully atmospheric masterpiece of horror and dread, one of the few truly adult examples of the science fiction genre. Its sequel, "Aliens," was far less disturbing, aiming more for visceral, action-movie thrills; nonetheless, it was still a powerhouse of a movie, especially in its wonderful "special edition" laserdisc incarnation. The notorious "Alien 3," on the other hand, is an utterly miserable failure, certainly the most insultingly juvenile follow-up to a good movie since the equally terrible "Return of the Jedi." From its hopelessly rushed, sloppily edited opening title sequence, to its endless, murky "alien-cam" chase finale, "Alien 3" consists of nothing more than a shocking series of miscalculations on the part of the filmmakers, who manage to create not even one moment of suspense, horror or thrills in nearly two hours of MTV-styled tedium. Particularly frustrating (and embarrassing) for the viewer is watching Sigourney Weaver and Lance Henriksen, two great performers, struggle to create anything interesting with their underwritten characters; both fail horribly. Even "Alien 4" looks great in comparison to this, possibly the worst sequel ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very rare that I rate a movie as low as I rate Aliens3 (one star out of ten). There are lots of bad sequels in the history of film making, so that in itself is not unusual. Yet it wasn't enough for David Fincher to make a mound of garbage such as this, in the process he felt it necessary to completely obliterate the Alien movies by totally disregarding everything that had come before his film. I'm not saying he had to make the same kind of movie as the previous two films, but to kill two main characters in the first five minutes of a sequel, two characters that we had invested so much time in in Aliens, and to do it without blinking an eye is not only inexcusable, but makes Alien 3 so downbeat from the start, it's hard to care one iota about what comes afterward. The closest thing I can compare it to would be if George Lucas had killed Princess Leia And Han Solo in the opening scroll of The Empire Strikes Back. As if all this wasn't bad enough, there is not one character in this movie that we care about or gives us any reason to care about them. They are just there to supply food fodder for the Aliens when they decide to pop out and move the plot along. Then again, we see so little of any of the characters as Fincher decided not only to make a "dark film" but to film it in the dark as well. I guess this is what one calls atmosphere. I call it covering up your big boo boo.Poor Sigourney Weaver. She does try. Yet we know so far in advance what is going to happen to Ripley, that we are not shocked or saddened by it. We only know that after the hell she went through in the first two films, she sure deserved a lot better than this mess.When you singlehandedly destroy a great series, you get a one rating, and you get that one because I can't give you a zero.

		<fullReview>* * (2 out of 5)Alien3Directed by : David Fincher, 1992If you liked Aliens, it is probably best you don't see Alien3. It, for some reason, turns the triumph of Aliens and the conclusion herein into a depression deeper than the vastness of a hundred black holes.First off, the characters of Hicks, Newt and Bishop - who went through such a terrible ordeal in Aliens - are mysteriously dead as this one opens and obviously not due to anything terribly story related. Other than that, director Fincher (of former MTV fame) dishes up a stylized alien universe and his camera style ? more close-ups and more zoom shots ? is easily different from both Ridley Scott (Alien) and James Cameron (Aliens). Where Fincher is an original artiste this also quickly becomes annoying when any real suspense is missing (there is a lone alien running around again), the story is a no-story and when no characters (other than Ripley) are even vaguely interesting. Ellen Ripley is joined by one, big, faceless mob.Alien3 has moments; yet everything ultimately seems like a huge deja-vu. Charles Dance and Sigourney Weaver even share some interesting chemistry (that should have been further built on) - that too fizzles.Weaver co-produced this time, she also shaved her head (literally) and if nothing else Alien3 has a magnificent scene where Ripley - at last - comes face to face with an alien. We are talking inches.Note : The ending was one move that Warner wish they had never done. See Alien : Resurrection.</fullReview>

Killing all the characters from Aliens, even Ripley, kills the movie for me. The first two had amazing characters, this movie replaces them with undeveloped, bland prisoners whose main contribution is to beef up the language rating and serve as cannon fodder for the alien. The only characters that stand out are killed off too early. And what's the point of this story anyhow? The plot is much like the plot of the first movie, the scenes with the alien are not scary and there is no suspense, thanks to the lack of characters the audience cares about.Overall this movie was a major disappointment, it not only failed to live up to the high standards of its predecessors, but it paved the way for a further decline of this once promising franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher's contribution to the "Alien" series is a completely unpleasant experience. It's grim, dour, grungy and depressing, filled with ugly characters who we don't learn anything about and therefore don't care about. As they get picked off one by one by the alien, we're moved to feel nothing more than that Fincher is automatically going through the motions. There's no thrill in this film, as there was in the first two films. There's also not a scare -- neither psychological nor visceral -- to be had. This sequel brings nothing new to the story -- after "Aliens," the creators of this series should have put it to rest, because there isn't much more material to mine from this particular concept.And one of the things that bothered me the most about "Alien 3" is its inconsistency. How can Ripley be impregnated with an alien for weeks before it hatches from her, whereas every other single creature infected before her (even including the dog in this one) hatches an alien seemingly within hours? You can't change the rules on us and not expect us to rebel.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intrigue. In Alien, the characters don't know what they're getting into and the only reason the audience knows is because 1. The trailers, 2. the Title and 3. by now everyone knows the reputation of the film . . . and it was good. In Aliens the characters know the creature, and declare war neglecting to calculate the possible numbers they face . . . and it was good. In Alien 3 we get a prison. "But they're not prepared! That's the intrigue," you say to which I would answer, "If they were prepared there *couldn't* be a film. They'd take out the Alien in 10 minutes."Alien 3 just cannot compete with its predecessors. The film is 'okay' and it's up against two of the most influential sci-fi horror films by Ridley Scott (the director with the slickest style) and James Cameran (one of the best action directors) scores composed by the legendary Goldsmith and Horner. . . Alien 3 has David Fincher and Elliot Goldenthal. Fincher is a good director, but outclassed by Scott &amp; Cameran; Goldenthall has yet to impress me with one of his scores, and has yet to not annoy me with one of his "sequel" scores (Batman Forever &amp; Batman &amp; Robin come to mind). The uninteresting premise of the film, the uninteresting setting, uninteresting characters, uninteresting story in the end just kill the film.More effort seemed to go into shaving Weaver's head than making the script good. And, I'm sorry, but the handful of well crafted scenes where Ripley is emotionally torn, or faces a difficult decision--the whole 3 scenes in the film what have a valid 'deeper meaning' does not save the 90% of the film that is boring and stale. Many people found the jump from Aliens to Alien 3, the return to one alien and the fate of the survivors from Aliens unforgivable. I'm somewhat torn--I don't mind such things happening if the new route is good. The route chosen for Alien 3 was mediocre, and so the break from its predecessors did come across more disappointing. Change is not always good; change for the sake of change is typically bad. Alien 3 is a good example of this. In the end, all of the elements of the film are mediocre to good with the exception of the script which did not live up to standards. Hence, the film is overall just "okay." But after the caliber of its predecessors, Alien 3 really is a disappointment in terms of quality.</fullReview>

First, there is no way that an egg (or eggs) made it onto the spaceship at the end of Aliens. The queen didn't lay any eggs anywhere (she was detached from her egg sack, remember?) Even if you want to believe that eggs could have been on board, you can't believe that if you clone an "infected" human, that you also get a clone of the alien.

		<shortDescription>Trainwreck or not? Not an easy decision, but the answer is: Trainwreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never used to flat-out hate Alien 3, but I was never a huge fan of it, either. Of course, both Alien and Aliens are perfect 10s, while Alien 3 deviates from the course of excellence. It had many problems, chief of which was the way it continued and yet did not continue from the previous film. If Hollywood wants to do a continuation, they should do a continuation, instead of making a movie that really stands alone, but has a misplaced reference to continuity between the two movies ungracefully inserted. That's a very inconsistent, half-assed and frankly shitty way to present a movie to devoted audiences.However, I did watch Alien 3 several times up through the last 12 years, and seemed to like it better and better each time. I was starting to convince - I mean fool - myself that it was a wholesome stylistic exercise and experience.Then the Director's Cut came out. A friend of mine characterizes it as "different, but not better or worse. Just different". We have a longer and infinitely more well-rounded story, with a completely different opening (Ripley having been flung out of the EEV, and the chest-burster having infected an ox - not a dog), and much, much bigger roles for the inmates at the penal colony. Finally, there is a reason for the story to be set in a prison. And there's much more human drama, and it's quite well-made.But. There's a big "but". It is stylistically well done, but it just doesn't work very well. It's not a terribly interesting story. The whole thing reeks of a bad idea that has nothing much to do with sci-fi *or* aliens - or anything else. One doesn't really care about the characters. Sigourney Weaver and Charles Dance both do a good job in their roles, but the story is just not substantial. Where are the overtones and the subtext; the symbolism? What is the movie saying? Not much.All the Director's Cut has accomplished for me is to demonstrate how enormously empty the theatrical version was, and replaced it with something that indeed is not better, just different. One cannot call the Director's Cut worse, because the story is much more coherent and wholesome. It just isn't of much interest.I am sad to say that I have now lost the mild appreciation I used to have for Alien 3. I used to rate it a 6 out of 10, but now, in the realization that it really is quite a bad movie, I have to revise that rating to a 4. *Sigh!*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly the most disappointing end to a trilogy ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first film review on IMDb, so I'm going to brief you on how I'll write my reviews from now on. First, I'll go through the positive attributes of a film (if any), followed by the negative attributes (if any). Then I'll end the review with 3 choice words that describe what I thought or how I feel about the film. With that out of the way, I'll start my review of the third (and what should have been the final) installment of the Alien franchise.The positives: -I like the look and style of the film, even though some of the areas of the prison look the same. Since this is a David Fincher film, though, that's to be expected. -I still love Ripley, and I like all the moments of the film between her and the characters that actually get developed (except the warden, he's just annoying). -I love the musical score of the film, and it's possibly the best score of all the Alien films. It's officially dented into my brain. -I think the film's ending is great, with the exception of the chestburster coming out of Ripley while she takes the Nestea plunge into molten lead (How can she grab onto it? She should be dead the instant it bursts out!).The Negatives: -Not a single moment of this film is frightening. We see all the "scares" coming, when they should be unexpected. It seems that the filmmakers instead decided to make the deaths more graphic, which just makes these scenes repulsive (I find the chestburster coming out of the dog very distasteful). -WHY DID THEY KILL HICKS AND NEWT AT THE START OF THE MOVIE?! I realize that I'm sounding like a whiny fanboy right now, but this is a slap in the face to James Cameron, the numerous fans of "Aliens", and me! They had all of this potential by keeping them alive, but they flushed it down the crapper anyway. What a waste. -The new characters other than Clemens and Dillon are one-dimensional bald guys with no character definition. They only seem to be there so they can get killed by the alien. -The visual effects are a mixed bag (how they got an Academy Award nomination is beyond me). While some effects look pretty good, others look obvious or below average, and the aforementioned chestburster coming out of Ripley almost looks cheesy.My 3 choice words: Frightless, Mediocre, Stylish</fullReview>

It completely ruins its predecessor, "Aliens," and was clearly only made to make a quick buck.Fun to watch, but this movie is not a sequel.

		<fullReview>Alien was such a good movie... Aliens ALMOST topped it... but this? What is this movie? Where is the suspense? The terror? The awesome feeling you get from watching Alien for the first time? It seems to me like this movie was targeted at 14 year olds (or immature adults for that matter) who like to see blood and people getting hacked up. The beginning alone was awful. Everybody died! Producer: "Hmm... since nobody wanted to remake a classic and they all hated the script, they refused to be in it... well, lets just MURDER THEM ALL AT THE BEGINNING"Anyways... This is a sad movie... and Alien Resurrection isn't a whole lot better. The only value that this movie has is if you have a girlfriend who doesnt like blood... maybe she'll get closer to you... eh, but then she would break up with you cause you showed her such a stupid movie... what am I talking about...

		<fullReview>This is by far, the worst of the Alien series. The idea is kinda neat, but the execution was just really bad. There is no suspense, no terror, and I really did not care if Ripley made it through this one or not. The most disapointing thing to me is that they never explored the mutation, if that was what it was of the Alien in the prison, what was different about it.

		<fullReview>After the brilliant Alien, and the maybe even better Aliens, what was the obvious progression? That's right, Alien Cubed. That's something of an optimistic title though, as this is certainly not Alien to the power of three. Actually, the only real problem with Alien3 is that everyone involved in it, with the exception of David Fincher, Sigourney Weaver, H.R.Giger, and maybe Charles Dance seems to be completely useless. The acting is (with the exception of the above) uniformly awful, truly dreadful. The clunking dialogue is not helpful to their cause.Fincher does a decent job with what he has to work with and his past in music videos doesn't make the film too flashy and disorientating. Particularly impressive is the scene with the alien's point of view while it runs along the ceiling. But the whole film is let down by the disappointing visuals. Where the first two films had darkness and dinginess, or just sheer scale to impress you with, Alien3 just has a rust coloured prison planet that looks like something from Dune. Only worse. This is the downfall of the film - if the visuals had been better, the films other many bad points could probably have been ignored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Sorry for some spelling-misstakes** This is the worst Alien-movie. Fincher tries to mix the dark feeling in the first movie with the 100 % action of ''Aliens''. I'm sorry Dave, it's simply doesn't work. OK, OK. I can admit it. It is entertaining at some points, but it is just because ''Alien 3'' is more of a copy of the other movies. Now, whats wrong with that picture? Everything is stolen from the other movies and you don't feel as amused of anything any more. The actors was really, really good but that can't save the bad script and the direction. I ( as a pure movielover ) will forever be gratefull for Fincher's job with ''Se7en''. This is though not one of his better movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How? Why? What were these writers thinking? How can you take a movie like "Aliens", arguably one of the best movies of all time and in essence ruin everything it stood for! "Aliens" had a great story and developed characters you really learn to care about. Then, along comes "Alien 3."When I first saw that another Alien movie was coming out I was extremely excited, being a huge fan of the previous two. I could not wait to see the continuation of "Aliens." What happened to the survivors, Hicks, Newt, Bishop, and Ripley. These characters were awesome! The developing relationships between Hicks and Ripley, and Newt and Ripley really added to the story. The characters in "Aliens" made the movie special.So what does this piece of garbage "Alien 3" do? It kills off the survivors from "Aliens" and replaces them with awful characters within an awful story. I am hoping and praying that Mr. James Cameron comes aboard to direct Alien 5 to stop the bleeding. He can pick up where "Aliens" left off. Perhaps start it off 20 years later so that he can use the same actors. Forget that the last two Alien movies even exist. Just AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>um be advised this review may contain spoilers!Well I have to say this is probably a little better then 4,but thats not saying much since 4 was an embarrassment to the franchise. They irritate you at the very beginning of the film and slowly bore you to death through the rest. Now don't get me wrong there were ok acting points in here, Dutton and Weaver. Yet they don't save the final product, now having the Xenomorph come out of a Dog wasn't a bad idea, and having it take some canine attributes was very nice idea. BUT its given nothing to do but kill murderers and rapist. Who is going to be saddened by that?! I am sorry but watching a cast of Cannon fodder is fine if you are watching a B Movie, but doesn't work here its disappointingly irritating. No development no quality story here..excellent mood and monster but little else. The ending was good in that its shot well and you do feel a little for her...But the whole movie was a stinker so best leave it on the shelves kiddies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 is a sequel that has bothered me for years. I had the pleasure of recently voting it as one of the worst movies of the last 100 years. It really irritated me for the following reasons: (This review is a comment to those who have already seen the movie)I swear the writers of Alien 3 never saw the first two movies or at least forgot them. Where did the "face hugger" come from in the shuttle?? It`s obvious in the first two movies that the "face huggers" impregnate their victims and die but in Alien 3 it impregnates Ripley and the dog... Why did it seems to take a week for the Alien to explode from Ripley while in the first movie it took about an hour??? How did Ripley know she had a "Queen" Alien in her????I also think the point of the first 2 movies was Ripley was a survivor.We know she is going to die about 1/3 the way through the movie. This destroyed all the suspense!!!!!!I also think the Alien looked really fake!!!! The use of computer effects didn`t work...2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Agreed, it was just about the hardest thing in the world to follow-up after Alien and Aliens but did it have to be this bad? Instead of expanding on the premise, all Fincher does is go back to just one Alien-threat. And all that ever happens is some running around in corridors and some shrieking music, which makes for a poor attempt to achieve the same atmosphere as in Alien. Fincher also tries to rob us of any future alien-installments in the climax but luckily they went ahead and did it anyway with Alien: Resurrection.</fullReview>

Alien 3 didn't need to be told, the story wasn't convincing. Perhaps the fatal flaw was setting it in a space prison. It's hard to care for characters who are murderers and rapists.

		<shortDescription>Ruined the Alien series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this is just another Sci-Fi flick I'd probably find it acceptable, but wouldn't think it as anything special. But it isn't, it is the third of the Alien series, and as such, it is absolutely dreadful as it ruined what could have been the greatest series of Sci-Fi films of all time.Plotwise it is pencil thin, another person more imaginative might place the action on Earth with the aliens creating havoc, or a planet discovered to be the source of the aliens. The possibilities are endless, but what have we got instead? A woebegone prison on a misbegotten planet full of refugees from other films. There is nothing new or interesting about this film, just a lot of regurgitated stuff from earlier Alien films and filled with dreary characters. Worse that Ripley was killed off so you can't have anything but the turgid Resurrection. If the director wanted to make a statement or do a prison drama, he should really have done it with another films and not ruin this great series.Absolutely unforgivable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented Alien? in an old Albertson's grocery store. I knew that it was by far the least of the series, but how bad could it be? The answer: REALLY bad. There are almost no moments of actual suspense or even horror. The decision to see through the alien's eyes like in "Predator" is such a huge mistake; it drains away every bit of interest you could have since you know where the alien is at all times. Sigourney Weaver goes a bit darker and more cynical in this film, and, by golly, it works. Everyone else, even returning veteran Lance Henrikson, is pretty much window dressing. See "Jaws", "Robocop", "The Silence of the Lambs", and save yourself 2 hours of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great atmosphere, yet not Alien worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me a good sequel needs to have new things, and it should not be a rehash of it's prequel. That's the problem with Alien3. Alien was a great movie, the Alien is one of the coolest movie monsters ever created (together with Predator). Aliens improved on this by adding a lot of new cool things, most noticeable the Alien Queen. Alien3 doesn't add anything new. Well, there is the queen parasite, and the new alien is a "dog Alien" (makes you wonder what the Alien from the space jocks (Alien 1) looks like...), but these are so insignificantly. So we're stuck with a been-there-done-that monster-chasing-victims movie. Still the movie is fun, and it looks absolutely awesome (great atmosphere). Not the crappy movie you might expect, but not a worthy addition to the Alien series too. Go see parts 1,2 and 4 !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weakest of the four films to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 is not a bad film but it is the weakest of the four that have been made. Its just nowhere near as good as it could have been. If you take the premise that sequels need to introduce something new in order to keep the audience interest and progress the story, then this movie doesn't do a lot. The only new thing I learned about the aliens from this film, is that they can apparently use any creature as a host and that the resulting alien offspring inherit some of the characteristics of the host. And thats all.Alien introduced us to the alien, Aliens gave us the hive structure and the rest of the breeding cycle, this gave us very little more, apart from the fact that most criminals appear to be English.The casual killing off of two of the survivors from Aliens was a really weak way to get them out of the way at the start of the film.This film is basically a rehashing of the first one - a single alien and a bunch of people fighting it with limited resources. Not good, not bad, just average.</fullReview>

But the real crime is that, by answering the question of what happened to the android and little girl Ripley saved in Alien 2, and given what happens to Ripley in this movie, you feel like your investment in the series and in the characters was a complete waste of time and emotion. Thus this movie not only ruined itself but the entire series!Do NOT see this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually wasted money seeing this movie on pay-per-view. The movie was soooooooooo boring that my brother decided to fall asleep and told me to wake him up when something exciting happened. After seeing this movie, I read in an issue of US magazine, that Sigourney Weaver was responsible for the way the movie was scripted. She demanded that the script not contain any firearms (hence the boring and dank prison environment which unusually had no weapons-go figure). She really messed this Alien pic up big time!!! Aliens success (in my opinion) was that action provided by the weaponary. Also, Alien 3 was more a sorry excuse to end the Alien saga on a wishy-washy sentimental note. For me, the movie failed miserably. The attack scenes are unbelievably predictable. I felt like like I knew 15 minutes in advance of who was going to get killed by the alien. The alien creature itself is rather dull and unimpressive. The plot is geered more towards a soap opera audience than a sci-fi movie. This movie failed to provide anything exciting or rewarding. I remember the printed advertisements for this movie were saying stuff like: "3 times the terror". GIVE ME A BREAK! This movie was more like 3,000 times the disappointment.My advice, stick to Alien and Aliens for true satisfaction and don't even bother to watch Alien 3!</fullReview>

It didn't help much that they were all bald and so you couldn't tell them apart!! Other than that this film isn't bad (and Resurrection) if you consider this. They never happened! Ripley is still in Hypersleep, having one long nightmare provoked by her experiences on LV426. After all she did end Aliens with Newt asking her 'can I dream?'. So that's what's happened. She'll wake up marry Hicks,adopt Newt and live happily ever after.(Yeah? and then they'll return to earth and discover that Hudson hadn't really died, he'd escaped the aliens clutches, found an abandoned ship and took off before the place was nuked!) Now I'm dreaming! O.k, but seriously I think if they must make ANOTHER alien film, they should try and answer the questions raised from the original movie like...-Where are the aliens from in the first place?-Where did that boneship come from and what/who was the dead pilot?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deceiving a lot for all the fans of Alien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, I bought the Alien Quadrilogy collection (I already saw Alien and Alien: Resurrection on TV by the way) I saw Aliens, and it's an incredibly good movie. However, about Alien?, I found the experience very deceiving, cause there's very less action and horror comparing to the 2 first movies, not to mention that on the planet, there's no weapons or modern technology, which makes the film too obscure and fade for the genre.When Newt and Hicks died in the beginning of the film, I felt sorry for them, but we didn't need a so bad conclusion about all the survivors of the Sulaco. Another thing that deceived me is Lance Henriksen's role as Bishop II, the human inventor of the synthetic Bishop. He told that he was working for the Company, and he wants the Alien queen who's growing inside of Ripley. The synthetic was by the side of Ellen Ripley, and now his creator is against her... This makes nonsense, and the whole experience shocked me a little when watching it.Oh yes, I saw the special edition of Alien?, and it's far beyond worse than the original film. What a waste of time it was this bunch of acid that falls on your face...Also, I had the SNES game years ago, and it was very good: we had many Aliens, a new one (the Mother Alien), the same weapons that we saw in previous films and all the stuff that can please you in an action/sci-fi/horror movie. But Alien? doesn't have this famous stuff, what makes it a deceiving movie.It's so bad that without this heap crap, Alien: Resurrection wouldn't exist, but now I agree that Alien? shouldn't exist either. If you want to watch all the Alien movies, ignore this worthless one...Steve Baillargeon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I feel like Annie Wilkes from Misery...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to begin by pointing out the most glaring error of this movie--the Queen Alien simply could not have brought eggs on board. I have watched both Aliens and Alien 3 enough to know. Either she laid them (which could not have happened since we saw her after she exited the drop-ship, and she probably needed her reproductive apparatus), or she carried them on board (another impossibility, she wasn't holding them, and even if she was and simply tossed them out while the camera wasn't looking, why would the blasted face-huggers wait for the 30 min - 1 hr period it would take for Ripley to shower, change, fix Hicks up, clean poor Bishop up, and enter the cryo-tube before they {or it} jumped out to latch on. That is assuming they even found their way to a part of the ship close enough to the cryo-tubes.) Phew! I feel like Annie Wilkes from Misery when she railed about the chapter plays--that simply isn't what happened. As a friend of mine pointed out, 20th Century Fox needed to know then they didn't need Ripley to continue the series. The need to include (and bump off) the series' leading lady landed them in that difficult, albeit impossible storytelling position. Alien 3's previews hinted at a possible earth-battle, the epic Alien story we all imagine in the future, but it obviously failed to deliver. The special effects of the alien were sadly lacking in this film--the prequels succeeded far better. The feel of the movie is somewhat unusual, dreamlike, but not what I would call good or bad. I do believe the movie's attempt to provide modernism is a little over the top. My goodness, Alien and Aliens weren't "overly Romantic" because Ripley survived. Good Lord, virtually everyone died in each film! To the remainder of the character, Hicks, Newt, and unfortunately Ripley was truly a waste to me. It totally nullified the second film. It cheaply tried to mimic the first film by providing the suspense of a hopeless group stumbling in the dark against the perfect predator. All too familiar, right? The other films at least tried to add to the series with some new idea. I can't totally bash the move though. It does continue the tradition of providing colourful characters, although they all do perish. My overall thoughts--the movie, apart from the series, could stay afloat as a B class science fiction thriller.But it fails miserably as an attempt to carry on the series called "The Alien Legacy." It attempts to be so much, but achieves so little... My suggestion--watch it and attempt to wade through the pretense. But watch the other three, too, because... We know Alien can do better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot like the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am one of the people who doesn't dislike this film because it is different, but because it wasn't different enough. Oh no, there is an alien behind you. Look out, it is picking you off one by one. I really didn't think it even tried to do something else. I would've preferred Alien 4 to this one if that one wasn't campy. However, if you liked the first Alien the best out of all the movies, you will probably enjoy this film more than I did. I just kinda enjoyed the combat of Aliens more than the thriller movies. However, Alien was one of the first to do this, so it is a testament to the timelessness of it's concept which we younger viewers take for granted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't succeed like its two predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "Alien" (1979) was the first film of the saga to make me fall in love with the Horror/Sci-Fi genre, people told me about the first sequel "Aliens" (1986) and how amazing it was from the action and special effects. Somehow my classmate from middle school had to bring me Alien 3 in which he was too cheap to show me the first outstanding sequel.Grrr, I still hate him! Alien 3 takes place after the event of "Aliens" where the remaining survivors crash land on another planet with Ripley being the lone survivor realizing she's at a prison. There are no guns, no axes, no kind of weapons for the guards to defend themselves. Sigourney Weaver plays the lone hero where she thinks that despite being a prisoner, all of her problems are gone where maybe none of the creatures would return...Yet...A face-hugger manages to hijack on the ship where Ripley is sleeping before going after its first victim and later creating the famous monster creature. The alien goes after the prisoners and guards in the detention center where Ripley must find a way for her and the survivors to take on the single beast.Alien 3 doesn't have the same thrills and drama as the first movie nor the horror and action of the first sequel where fans would go back and take a look at these marvelous scenes. There's not even a character to cheer for or admire unlike Aliens where people would say how much they'd admire Hudson, Hicks, Vazquez or any of the supporting characters besides Ripley.What a shame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In defense of David Fincher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this again. I've seen Alien and Aliens countless time, but have only seen Alien 3 once and that was pretty much enough for the last 15 years.This movie is really just a waste of time, because the few good ideas and interesting things that happen are completely overshadowed by the illogical plot, worthless characters and slasher feel (you could replace the alien with any other movie monster, no problem).I don't think this has anything to do with David Fincher, though.He did not write the story or the script, and those areas are where the major problems lie.Think of all the other movies he has directed since then:Seven, Fight Club, The GameThose are three of my all-time favorite movies, and the ones I didn't list above, like panic room, are still good movies.I just can't believe that it was Fincher causing the problems here, but I can believe that he could be easily pushed around by a studio during his directorial debut (maybe even their fall-guy?). Blame the studio for letting this P.O.S. go into production in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly Thrill-less or: How I Learned That the Alien is Really Just a Dangerous Pet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm hardly the first to mention it, but it should be known by any potential viewer; the title being just is not in any way, shape or form as threatening herein as in the first two(which right there takes a chunk of the appeal, and proceeds to burn it to cinders). There's also really no atmosphere, not one that could unnerve anyone but the most easily intimidated, anyway, which further eliminates reasons we watched the prior entries. So what *do* we have? Well, the Fincher touch(though it should be known that he disowned it, and clearly with good cause) is there, somewhat. We're treated to Giger doing more design work. The score certainly isn't bad. Some of the writing isn't awful(and, not unlike the other sequels, it didn't exactly have a great start-off point, so let's give it at least a little slack... but let's keep to the pocket-knife for the cutting of it for now), if there are lines that... really couldn't work no matter how well they had been delivered. Anyway, I was on the positives of this; Ripley is still consistent, and Henriksen is back(if his performance is... shall we say "overplayed", to put it nicely). Some of the effects are the best yet of the series(others... not so much). The plot isn't all that interesting(oh dear, we're back at the criticisms), if it does have an idea or two that give the whole thing some merit(as well as characters and back-stories fit for something done by David). The Special Edition/Assembled Cut(not Director's Cut) adds scenes, some of which of lesser technical quality(but hardly a major bother, if one is up for watching more), which I would suggest for anyone who want to give this another chance(I enjoyed some of the new it brought about). In the end, I'm afraid I just find it more and more difficult and unsatisfying to actually sit down for the one hour and forty five minutes that this lasts before the ending credits start on their usual, anticipated roll(they really ought to jump, maybe do a little dance(...get down tonight), you know, mix it up a little) with each viewing. I recommend this to those who want to watch every movie in this series, and/or all of David Fincher's films. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So *wrong*.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*******Spoiler Warning*************This was the sequel that shouldn't have been made. True, taken by itself it's a ho-hum movie that doesn't really deserve the bad rap it gets all by itself, and now a decade or more after the fact it seems quite a lot of footage was cut out that apparently would have made it a much better movie...except what makes it to the theaters is what counts. "Director's Cuts" and special editions don't have much influence if people didn't like the movie in the first place.There were simply two big problems I had with this movie, (well, actually, three.) First was how Newt and Hicks are simply written out without so much as a second thought. The actress who played Newt would probably have been around twelve when this was filmed, and maybe Michael Biehn wouldn't have returned, but still after the endless survivals and escapes in "Aliens" and Ripley risking her life to save Newt, it's a cheap shot to just have the characters be dead at the start.Second was the setting; we get stuck in a prison with all the miscreants and malfeasants and whatever, even worse a nearly shut down prison where for some reason the inmates do a minimal job of maintaining the decaying installation. Sure, the tension of survival and desperation, even more so since the inmates themselves are almost as much a threat as the Alien, but who are you supposed to care about? Ripley herself is doomed, and none of the other characters prove redeeming. I remember there was a strong rumor before release that this one would have been set on earth, (I'd hoped we go to the Alien's home world) they should have stuck with that.Lastly is the little things that don't make sense. The Alien comes out of a dog and now has some canine characteristics. Yet the Aliens in the previous two movies didn't take on traits from whomever hosted them. Why is the corporation that was simply Corporate America in the first two movies now suddenly a Japanese corporation? In the end this movie is little more than a gloomy and grim fight to kill the Alien, and offering little hope to anyone who does survive. Compared to the previous ones that gave us characters to root for or despise, it's a major letdown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak sequel hasn't aged well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last time I saw Alien 3 in full and unedited was about 10 years ago. At the time, I considered the sequel to be a dark, brooding, mostly satisfying follow-up to Aliens. I dug the film's bleakness, and while it wasn't as elegant as the first film or as action-packed as the second, I still considered Alien 3 be a fitting (if depressing) end to Ripley's dark journey.I recently read about the studio cut of the film, so I decided to revisit it via Netflix. The longer studio version (not a director's cut?as I understand it Fincher had nothing do with it) offers an altered beginning and ending, as well as several extra scenes that flesh out a few secondary characters and fill a few plot holes (like what happened to prisoner Golic). Unfortunately, the longer cut only serves to exacerbate flaws that weren't readily apparent to me upon that first glance a decade ago.(MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD)--It pains me to write this, but Alien 3 is largely an incoherent mess. The first 30 minutes are OK, as we see Ripley mourning the loss of her surrogate daughter and adjusting to her potentially dangerous new environs. Sigourney Weaver is fantastic as she was in the first two films, so no problems there.The plot begins to unravel after the beast's first appearance. The last 90 minutes consist of the alien (only one creature this time, like in the first flick) picking off the prison population, an interchangeable band of bald, white, English guys. Only a few characters stand out, and one of them is inexplicably killed halfway through. The final elongated action scene is particularly wonky, as we get alien POV shots as it chases its victims through the prison complex's dank corridors. After awhile it becomes difficult to tell who's getting eaten and who's not, and frankly, it doesn't really matter, as these characters were so thinly sketched in the first place. And the final-scene cameo of a certain actor from the previous film simply makes no sense.Plot's not the only problem: I remember reading about the various script changes during the long hiatus between Aliens and Alien 3. That instability shows here...particularly towards the end of the film when the dialogue becomes ridiculously vulgar. I'm no prude, far from it, but all the f-bombs seemed forced and unnecessary. Again, Weaver's quite good, but there's only so much she can do with garbage lines like, "They think we're crud." Alien 3 isn't a complete waste of time...and it's better than Alien:Resurrection ...the special effects aren't great, but not as bad as some IMDb reviewers contend. The sets and costumes are industrial and gritty, and I still enjoy the movie's overall bleak atmosphere, which at least sets this film apart from its predecessors. However, Alien 3 does not give me the kick that it once did. That makes me a little sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Essence, Killed Before the Film Even Starts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the very glue that held the air-tight plot of ALIENS together is torn off its fabric before the film begins, proper, can any amount of "clever camera angles" and "moody set pieces" fill in the void that is left? That is the question I ask myself because at the time this film was released I was in awe of David Fincher's dark images and clever editing, most notably in his videos for Madonna. True, ALIEN 3 tries to bring back the dread that the first movie contained and has some very unnerving sequences, but numerous re-writes leading to Newt's off screen death and Ripley's impregnation by an alien (as forced as any life-like expression on a mannequin) killed any emotional resonance that otherwise it would have had. This is what happens when money takes over and creativity flies out the window. Everything becomes a color-by-numbers cat and mouse game where everyone is a mouse running away from an alien. Ripley makes some questionable choices which are out of character early in the film and the time it takes for her own alien to pop out raises the issue: does the chest burster come flying out only when the plot deems it so?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing when compared to the first 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not in the same league as the first 2 Alien films. The special effects were well done, and while the action scenes were excellent, there weren't nearly enough of them. Nothing against director David Fincher, but I would not put him in the same class as Ridley Scott and James Cameron (directors of the first 2 films). This movie did not have a great flow. For the better part of an hour, we're left listening to dull dialogue, before the action picks up. At least with the first Alien film, the suspense kept up the pace of the movie. Also, aside from Lt. Ripley, none of the other characters are the least bit interesting in this film. This movie is enjoyable, and better than a many sci-fi movies out there, but I would not consider this one to be a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember being so excited to see the continuing saga of the Alien universe... What I saw was a boring story, unsympathetic, annoying, one dimensional characters you wanted to die so they'd be removed from the story - we saw that again in Alien Resurrection... The characters in Aliens were one-dimensional also, but they didn't pretend to be "deep, thoughtful and complicated". You have to admire the change in feel of the third alien outing, but did anyone read the script? It also seemed to short change the heroic accomplishments of the survivors of the second film to have them die in their sleep because they didn't examine their ship properly before entering hypersleep, why did they need to sleep? Their ship was only 6 weeks out?... Maybe they could have found the alien homeworld or some military types could have smuggled some pods to earth or something... oh well now we have Alien v Predator because they wanted special effects and visuals to take the place of story... when will we have Alien v Predator v Jason v Freddy?</fullReview>

That right there is enough to p*** me off. This movie could have been so much better than this. And come on now, a prison setting? Please.

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 was a letdown of a sort when compared to both Alien and Aliens, classics in their own right. Sigourney Weaver returns as does Lance Hendriksen in two different roles. But even though Weaver is there, the movie just doesn't have the same power as the first two films.Ripley (Weaver) crash lands on a prison planet and is taken in by a doctor (Charles Dance). But the Alien has followed her again in a different way, and goes about destroying the inhabitants of the planet. Once again its up to Ripley to destroy the monster.The acting in this film was pretty good, and the visuals are amazing, but this movie, as directed by David Fincher, is way too dark and depressing when compared to the first and second films. This film leaves us with no real hope for anyone. Yes there are some genuine scares to be found here, and like I said the film has a good look to go with quality acting. Too bad that the director took it down this despairing road with a horrible ending that I never could accept.When compared to the first two movies, this film is second rate. However, it is still much better than Alien Resurrection which followed. That movie, to me, was a waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The long delayed sequel to James Camerons Aliens turned out to be a mediocore affair. I remember going to the local movie theater in my teens to see this film with my brother and I was so dissapointed. It just seemed like an inferiour rehash of the first film. No characters to feel a true sympathy for (though Charles Dance's character gets more depth in the new special edition release). Watching the documentary that comes along with the new re-releae you can plainly see the rough time the producers and writers, etc. had in coming up with a story for the third film. In the end what we got was a brave effort but a failure in comparison with the first two films. The fourth one in the series was a better return to form for me anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been just as good as the first two had it had a better director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my comment for ALIEN, I referred to ALIEN 3 as awful. After re-watching the film a second time, I now have come to realize that is not awful like I once thought, it's horrendous beyond belief. It ultimately suffers from a poor choice for director. David Fincher has his fans, but I have never quite warmed up to his style. Like Tim Burton, his style is an acquired taste. His style certainly doesn't fit ALIEN 3. In his feature film debut, Fincher directs as if he was directing one of his music videos, which damages the picture beyond repair. It comes across as if MTV was behind it. There are those who will say I am being unfair to Fincher since he walked off the project before editing even began and the production was an extremely troubled one, but regardless of how much studio interference comes into play, he ultimately was the man behind the camera and its his directing that makes ALIEN 3 the worst in the series. Fox should have put a more experienced director at the helm. As much as I hated the directing, the script is actually okay. In fact, had Walter Hill directed from the script he co-wrote, I have a feeling ALIEN 3 could have been just as good as the first two in the series. There are some good lines, and some intelligent ideas. It's a case where the script is better than the movie itself. 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like the summary says, this movie is terrible ! The plot, the cast, and the direction all make for a very boring and stale movie. Not to mention the special effects, which are particularly disapointing. This becomes very obvious during the scenes when the alien is chasing the prisoners through the hallways/tunnels. When you see the alien, it is a very obviously computer-generated animation. Also, because of the way the scene was shot, I believe the director (David Fincher "Se7en", and "Fight Club") tried to cover up these cheezy effects by only giving very brief glimpses of the alien. He also seems to be trying to compensate for the lack of alien content by showing a "first person" view of the alien chasing prisoners...with the camera spinning and climbing the walls. It makes what could have been an exciting scene into an annoying and visually confusing scene.Very disapointing performances by Sigourney Weaver and Charles Dutton."Alien Resurrection" (prt. 4) is better. This one should not have even been made. It really serves no purpose. I would recommend watching the first two, and if you still have a desire to see more of the 'Alien' movies (as you probably will because the first two are excellent movies), then watch "Alien Resurrection" next. You will miss absolutely nothing by skipping this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad timing (editing problems?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the third time now and I hoped that I might enjoy it a little bit more than the first two times. But, though I really did my best to like it, I was disappointed again.But then, there are moments when I thought: hey, this could be very good, but it just doesn't work, it just doesn't touch me at all, so what is wrong with it? Maybe I just don't see it the way it is intended?After all this is I think the truth about this movie: like it is, you can't see it the way it is intended.I just can't believe that someone who directed such a solid and compact movie as Se7en, could make such a horrible mistake: there is no story, there is no center, the whole thing just falls apart in pieces when you watch it.I think this is due to some wrong editing (and maybe this was caused by a not thoroughly thought trough scenario, but that I can't say). There were several moments when I thought: hey, why is this happening now, it should happen minutes ago and moments when I thought: why is this happening right now, it just spoils the enjoyment of suspense, they should show this way later in the movie. And there were scenes I thought: my God, why didn't they cut this piece away, it just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.Like the 'running scenes' closing to the end: you just can't make head nor tale of it, they're just running around, while you never get what they're plan actually is and how they would like to make it work. You just wait till they're done and get on with the 'story'. This is just annoying as it is. But I think what the director meant was to create this feeling of being lost in endless tunnels without ever really seeing it from a bird's view, to run and hope you will get somewhere, with only the help of your fear and the intuition it brings with it. Done well, this could prove to be some really exciting and nerve-cracking sequence, a real build-up to the grand finale.There were also moments when I thought the music was kicking in way too early or too late, making it some kind of a mere commentary instead of accompanying and enforcing the action (like it is so well done in Star Wars or The X-files just to name a few).I think a better editing could make this movie a whole new experience, getting things at the right moments and making it one whole again, like it proved possible with "Blade Runner". I for one wouldn't mind to see it one more time, but only the way it was probably intended, so I hope they will give the director a chance to remake this movie and to prove that it is a good one after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A potentially great movie ruined by some unorthodox stylistic decisions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'd like to say that had Alien and Aliens never been filmed, Alien3 would've made a good movie just as it is. Unfortunately the reality is that since both of the first 2 movies were great, this movie had high expectations. Ultimately, Alien3 is not worthy to be accepted as part of Alien series.Alien3 had some good acting and music and some excellent cinematography I thought. It was also darker than the first 2. Also, the concept of crashing in a maximum security prison was a good one I thought. But since this review only rationalizes a 3/10 for this movie, I will spend the rest of the time explaining what made this movie a bad one.First of all, it completely ruins the second Alien movie for three reasons: Firstly by introducing the egg that had been on board that had hatched into an alien. How the heck did that egg get there anyway? No explanation is offered. Secondly by introducing the fact that Ripley somehow had a queen alien chestburster inside of her. How did that get there? No explanation is offered. Thirdly by killing off 2 of the main characters from "Aliens", Newt and Hicks, right at the very beginning, giving them senseless deaths. Many say this was for "shock value". Shock value my ass, it was just a letdown. Killing them off halfway through or something would've been more effective. Besides, they could've developed Newt and Hicks a lot more. The sole fact that the innocent child Newt has to live in a maximum security prison makes for some good character development. Hicks would've been a bit trickier, but with some creativity they could've come up with something (i.e. maybe Hicks went to prison when he was younger and he's scared of them now and has to deal with it). Maybe if Hicks and Newt were the first victims, it would've been more satisfying (and then Ripley would be a loner again, which is what her character is all about IMO, as nobody would believe her about the alien again, etc).Another element lacking in the third movie is the absence of one of the dominant themes in the first 2 movies, about the protection of the innocent. Ripley went out of her way to protect Jones (in Alien) and Newt (in Aliens) but there was none of her "motherly" role in this movie. I felt this element was important to the first 2 movies, yet it became non-existent in the third.Another negative point was that I feel this movie sort of ruined the image of the alien. Having the alien run after people at high velocities and having the people herd it like a sheep is not what the alien is supposed to be. The aliens are supposed to be slow, sneaky, and stealthy and pop out from behind you when you least expect it. By making the alien run, they were trying to make it scarier, but they actually made it less scary. Come to think of it, the scariest bad guys in movies are never fast moving creatures. And the aliens are supposed to be smart, not stupid. Remember in Alien how the alien was hiding in the escape ship at the end? Or in Aliens how the queen used the elevator and then stowed away? A final point that made this movie bad was a stupid stylistic decision: Kill off the main secondary character, Clemens, halfway through the movie. They had just begun to develop his character, and he could've been the next Hicks or Newt, but no, they kill him off halfway through. Then instead they try to develop the character of Dillon, however, they only get to developing his character halfway through as well. As a result, we have 2 half-developed characters (both of which die by the end), leaving Ripley the only character the viewer really cares about (unlike in Aliens where we had Hicks, Newt, Bishop, Vasquez, Apone, etc).In conclusion, this was a well made movie with terrible stylistic decisions that essentially ruined it. The only good decision was to have Ripley sacrifice herself for the protection of humans at the end. This was done very well and ended off the movie well (albeit it was a sad ending).</fullReview>

Whoop dee doo. This movie completely failed to hold my attention, and I almost fast-forwarded at several points... which isn't how an Alien movie should be. I don't know what people see in this one, but it's horrible. Don't see it, ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien 3 is a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I have to say as a big fan of the Alien movies is that David Fincher was a terrible Director and the writers were not exactly thinking straight when they put out this horrendous flick about how a bunch of prison inmates "didn't" get attacked by an alien. You'll notice that throughout the movie there are 10-15 ,hell even 20-25 minute gaps where the alien isn't even on the screen. At least the first Alien movie kept the victims high while presenting a mysterious mood by having the alien appear randomly and unexpectedly.Aliens on the other hand made the viewer feel pity for the soldiers that died because we knew so much about them. Alien 3 was cold and dark and because the characters were never formally introduced we as the viewer didn't know who was getting killed nor did we care. The emotion of the movie was silent and the beginning as well as the ending was bitter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who enjoyed the first 2 films, especially the 2nd film would be disappointed at this one. Set in a prison colony where no one has any guns, why would one make a movie like this? To those who don't want a violent movie, watch a drama... you don't make a storyline with ferocious creatures like that in a movie where no guns are present. The aliens proved to be kickass creatures in the first 2 films, and in this one, they should've been dispatched in the same manner as in the 2nd one.Simply killing off Newt &amp; Hicks was a bad idea too. They fought hard in the 2nd film, and deserve better.I heard about the plot and only saw bits &amp; pieces of this movie. I had no desire to see it at all, after I heard about the no guns.

		<fullReview>If you are a fan of the series, go see the movie. It's not as good as the others, but watch it with that in mind.(Spoilers ahead.) To be honest, I found no huge plot holes that ruined the experience for me, however, all the little flaws really added up in the end. They are not really goofs, just minor inconsistencies with the other two movies (such as how the alien first attached itself to the dog - I didn't like that because the xenomorphs never showed an interest in pets before - remember Jones the cat?). And I was really disappointed that all the survivors from the second movie were killed. Up until this point, every character that died in the series died standing up, so to speak. Its like the writer said "Well, we can't get a contract with these actors, so we'll kill 'em off in the first five minutes." These characters (especially Bishop) deserved more respect.Compared to the glory that was Alien and Aliens, Alien 3 added nothing new to the series. In fact, some of it flies in the face of what we've seen before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridely Scott's 'Alien' was an excellently constructed thriller. In the opening, a strong ensemble cast faced a vague sense of menace; over the course of the film, this gradually transformed into a fight to the death between just one of the characters (Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver) and the eponymous beast. The sequel, directed by James Cameron, was also good, but at heart a more conventional Hollywood blockbuster. For the third film, David Fincher was in the director's chair, and I'm a big fan of Fincher's later films, 'The Game' and 'Fight Club'. But 'Alien3' is not his greatest work.Fincher keeps the murky, claustrophobic feel of the earlier films (a mood also apparent in his next film, 'Se7en'). In the original movie, the camera never dwelt on the alien, we only saw it in brief, terrifying glimpses. This was justified by the alien's exceptional speed of movement, but perhaps necessitated by limitations in what the special effects department could do, circa 1979. By 1992, technology had moved on, but Fincher stuck to the formula, and the fact that we never truly comprehend the exact nature of the monster adds to its capacity to scare us. But Fincher also added some broad comedy, a lot of gratuitous swearing, and, with his setting of a prison planet occupied almost entirely by British-accented convicts, a certain resemblance to a vulgarised 'Porridge'. Riply, meanwhile, has transformed into someone almost unimaginably macho; the prisoners are supposedly men with two Y chromosomes, but a desexualised Ripley appears to possess more testosterone than all of them together.The real problem with the film, however, is principally that as the third movie in a franchise, there's not really anywhere new for it to go. The plot is presented to us with little in the way of underlying explanation, but it's basic contours are already defined. The fourth film in the series was called 'Alien Resurrection'; this one might have been called 'Alien Rehash'. It ends with an overlong action sequence devoid of variety (whereas in the first film, every kill was sudden and fresh). And the impact of the ending is muted when you know that in spite of the apparently terminal conclusion, another movie followed in a couple of years. The rest of Fincher's work is all original. But here he is just another hack director, forcing another life out of a great, but exhausted concept. Two films should really have been enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Alien saga gets turned into an average monster-movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two extremely atmospheric, haunting and tense movies, this third Alien movie came as a bitter disappointment. It picks a more monster-horror approach, in which the 'monster' wants to kill everyone. Yes, it's true that in a way "Alien" wasn't much different, only difference was that in 1979 this approach was still new and original but not by 1992 standards anymore.Problem is that this movie is fairly standard and mostly predictable. Basically this movie isn't much different from most other genre movies, in which a monster is on the loose and on a killing-spree. In this movie you exactly know who is going to die and when. It also really kills the tension the movie. The only thing that makes the killings still good and interesting is the amount of gore used for it. The more 'monster' like approach of the alien also wasn't a good movie and it differs from the first two alien movies. The alien has a too prominent part in the movie and has way too much screen time. The mystery and horror of the character(s) in the first two movies was they the movie didn't showed them in many scene's, at least not fully. In the first two movies the alien was more presented as an animal, killing for their own survival. Not as a monster who kills for pleasure as in this movie is the case. This can be explained because of the reason that this alien in this movie is different from the aliens in the first two movies but this is not satisfying enough, considering that it is never explained in the movie why the alien acts and looks different.The movie went too various re-writes, even during filming and suffered heavily from the studio's- and producers influences. No wonder that David Fincher doesn't want to have anything to do with this movie. With other movies he definitely showed that he is capable of directing both atmospheric and tense movies ("Se7en", "The Game", "Panic Room"), so it's definitely not has fault that the movie failed. As a matter of fact, the visual style and atmosphere of the movie still make sure that this movie is a better than average one.There are some nice looking and claustrophobic sets featured in the movie. On the other hand the movie unfortunately felt the need to put in some computer effects and even though they of course look quite good for early '90's standards, it's terribly outdated and fake looking now.The movie is carried once more by Sigourney Weaver's performance. Ripley is such a great and strong female character. It also shows courage and dedication to the movies and character that Sigourney Weaver shaved her head bald for this movie. Too bad that none of the other characters really work out in this movie. They mostly remain flat and uninteresting. The movie does feature some interesting actors such as Charles Dance, Ralph Brown and Pete Postlethwaite but all of their talent is wasted in the script, in which they get very little interesting to do or say. The re-appearance of Bishop also feels more of an obligation than it serves a real purpose, though fans won't complain about it and neither would I really. I love Lance!Not the greatest, most tense, most original genre-piece around, not even on its own.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After giddy anticipation of the release of a 3rd installment of my favorite Monster Saga of all time, I was overwhelmed with curiosity and begged my friend to take me for my birthday. I eagerly walked in with him as he bought our tickets, a popcorn, and large sodas and we settled into our seats. I could tell by the grainy look of the film, and horrible costume and sets, that this was not the sequel I had hoped for. But I tried to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment and give it a chance. I made it 20 minutes before I finally stood up in protest, jerking my bewildered date along with me, and stormed out of the theater in utter disgust and outrage. I still have never watched it all the way through, even though I have the "Quadrilogy" Box Set which contains all 4 movies. I have boycotted it. The movie was so unsettling on every level that I know it would burn like alien acidic blood into my brain and corrupt all of my idealism for the first 2 movies forever. I can't afford to allow my self to be so compromised as David Finchner. I warn all true fans of the first 2 movies to BEWARE! Avoid this movie at all costs unless you are more able than me to recover from such an assault on the imagination of such sick and twisted proportions as this film does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killed the Series...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow... where to start on this movie. I think this one REALLY just killed the series. First off, by killing of Hicks, Newt, and kind of Bishop at the very start. Plus there were so many plot devices it was scary. The characters had no depth to them, except for Ripley, Dillon, Clemens, and maybe Aaron. They tried to make you care about them, EG after the quinacetraline explosion, when they have the sad-toned music, and the prisoners who survived walk slowly down the halls finding the dead ones and taking them away. Kind of like the "Bring out your dead" scene in Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail, except not funny. But, they're prisoners! Why would you honestly care about them?! And the movie itself was just plain BORING. Everything was either silver or sepia toned, there were long periods where absolutely nothing happens, but this is different from Alien's case. The first movie, there are long uneventful periods, because it adds to the creep factor. In this, they're there because they want to save the few action sequences for the end. However, I will say in it's defense, I liked the ending. A different turn from the first to, and rather poignant. Seeing as there's this woman who is tormented every *waking* moment of her life by these alien creatures, and she finally has no choice but to give up. But all and all, a very weak entry to the series. I don't like David Fincher. Now, the special edition is SO MUCH BETTER! All that extra stuff they cut out made the film much more watchable! Golic going crazy, releasing the alien, and all that extra stuff. For me, it raised the watch-ability rate to about a 6.5 rather than a 4! In conclusion, if you're going to see Alien3, see the special edition, NOT the theatrical!</fullReview>

To save time I will just tell you one of them! We see a fan blade in the background and so the audience knows someone is going to die in that blade! In 2003 FOX released the original cut on DVD of this movie and its just boring as the movie they released in 1992! Also FOX could of saved itself when ALien 4 came out! They could of have Ripley waking up from the nightmare and thus Alien 3 was just her dream! That way we could of had all the survivors form "ALiens" in "Alien 4". Yes I know that is too "Dallas" but Alien 4 wasn't much better than this! Yes David Fincher has gone on to make "Fight Club" "Seven" and "PANIC ROOM" but I think this was his "student movie" and therefore plays like it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far my least favorite entry into the Alien franchise and that includes "Alien vs Predator". There is nothing new or innovative about this installment except for the fact that the alien is mixed with a dog or something. Lets just say this one plays out like the first one, but it is not as involving or as interesting. Weaver goes through the motions and that is the shame because she is the only actor you will recognize here with the exception of Lance. The story, Ripley lands on a space prison, alien tagged along, it starts killing, and the startling revelation why said alien will not kill her. Of course evil people want to use the alien again for weapon purposes. Why? Who knows, but I think it would be obvious by this time that the aliens are simply killing machines, and they are incapable of being trained. The ending is the lone bright spot here, but I was bored out of my mind by the time it rolled around. I can't believe this one ranks higher than four, which by admission is a bit goofy at times, but it is a much faster ride than this slow plodded yawn fest.</fullReview>

Sigourney Weaver is good though and elevates the material. Characters appear from out of nowhere and it seems that a lot of tinkering was done with the final product.

		<fullReview>Alien3 is garbage. Not only an insult to the Alien series, but one of the worst horror movies ever made. Or perhaps it was the worst. A non-existent script, a silly sequence of uninspired gore (and nudity!) scenes, laughably predictable scares, obnoxious characters and the lamest creature effects since King Kong (1933) make for damn crappy sequels, but this one was crappier than most. Never has a lead actress wrecked her defining role as thoroughly as has Sigourney Weaver in Alien3. She mindlessly stumbles through this entire movie, does Ripley want to fight or die, we don't know and she doesn't know either, there was no script when they shot all these awful scenes, there was no concept, nothing, just pressure from the studio bosses to meet the production deadline. And then there is Weaver and the plot holes: Why does she escape the impact unscathed, and how does she get to the shore? Where did the alien egg come from in the first place, and how are there two aliens? Why does her lifeboat just crash into a planet, and how did the ship get into its orbit in the first place? How can she run around for days carrying an alien embryo, and why would she venture out of the infirmary station knowing she's in a maximum security prison for sex offenders? Unanswered questions, because the actual answer is cheap writing. The writers of this movie, and reportedly there were many, didn't care about continuity or common sense. Just throw logic out the window, throw in Weaver, some alien eggs, some gore scenes and let the audience swallow this load of crap! But Weaver was not alone in having a terrible time in this stinker: The prisoners were some of the most obnoxious "characters" you've ever seen. Not just lame, phony and undeveloped, but downright annoying. The audience wanted them and Weaver to die, well, then how were we supposed to be entertained? Guess we weren't, it's a Fincher movie, and undoubtedly his worst to date. Half of the lines in the movie are four letter words, but don't take that to mean the rest of the dialog is sophisticated. After two hours of tiresome slaughter scenes, the number of characters has been thankfully reduced from a distracting 25 to 3, predictably including Weaver's character, and we are confronted with the final letdown: A cheesy ending that turns out to be a laughable Christ allegory: Weaver's character is tempted, resists and sacrifices herself... only to be reanimated for the next paycheck, in the equally atrocious Alien Resurrection! This is Hollywood and here are the facts: Alien3 is complete garbage, it is beyond me how this story came to be accepted by the studio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do NOT avoid this movie. Watch it because it's so unbelievably bad it's absolutely hilarious! It might very well be the worst sequel I have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and I were able to laugh at almost every single moment of this film. At times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but we're pretty sure it's not. First of all, an alien egg appears out of nowhere as if it was the most natural thing in the world, then there's a fire and all the main characters from the previous movie except Ripley are conveniently killed. Enter Clemens, a doctor on a remote prison planet with a sad history and a future to match. He finds Ripley on the beach. They perform an autopsy on the crash victims, attend the funeral and have sex. Next, another alien appears and slaughters the prisoners (and the doctor, ouch!) one by one all over the prison, an industrial/Gothic scenery that was utterly ripped off from the first movie. So was the plot, apparently, only the astronauts from Alien are replaced by filthy British prisoners who are absolutely impossible to distinguish, much less like much. The amount of profanity in this movie is hilarious! You will also enjoy the hammy acting performances. In one particular scene, the prison warden is killed right in front of the prisoners, one looks up sheepishly and exclaims: *beep* And just when you thought the acting couldn't get any worse, the gang leader motivates the other prisoners to fight the alien in another hilariously overacted scene. The creature effects were so awful it made us laugh while we replayed through the worst scenes. The movie is supposed to end on a down note but it doesn't work because it's too corny to be taken seriously. If you've seen the first two, you'll probably expect a good movie, but prepare for the worst... and it will be even worse than that. I seriously want to buy this movie and place it atop my comedy movie selection. Right next to Flight Cub.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure I've seen a film as poorly made as Alien 3. Anyone who hasn't seen this abomination should avoid this film like the plague. It sucks in every way. It starts off by killing all the characters the audience had grown to like, it throws out everything that made the first two movies great and replaces it with a mutant infested prison colony "at the ass end of space". Who wants to see that I wonder...The plot unfolds like in a generic slasher-by-the-numbers flick, but you will never get to know or like the prisoners, the alien just kills them off randomly and mindlessly, no cocooning like in the previous movies. Amidst this mess Ripley, the last survivor of Aliens, but don't expect her to fill the emotional void, she turns out to be a soulless bitch torn between the desire to kill herself and wipe out the alien before the company get their hands on it.The concept of this movie couldn't be more unoriginal: The first half plays out like a cheesy copy of Alien: The humans don't have guns and the alien hides in the dark and takes them out one by one. Unfortunately, since the characters were never developed in the first place, this part is completely void of suspense. When the remaining characters realize what is going on, they try to "guide" the alien through a maze of tunnels to a room with a blast furnace, the only way to kill it. The movie then changes pace and genre in what seems like a pathetic attempt to cater to Aliens fans: The alien chases prisoners through tunnels for a whole hour of cheesy and muddled action scenes - with the worst special effects in the entire series! I didn't go into this movie expecting it to be as good as the first two movies (third movies never are!), but I surely didn't expect it to be this weak. A mockery of the first two movies and an insult to the creative geniuses of Ridley Scott and James Cameron.</fullReview>

The disappointment was crushing.But when Alien Resurrection came out, it was a sequel that went largely unnoticed because people had given up on this series, thanks to Alien 3. If anything, they expected another abomination, and when they got the expected result, the disappointment was much diminished.Alien Resurrection and Alien 3 were horrible movies, but A:R was far from being the huge letdown Alien 3 was. It was just another bad flick.Stay away from Alien 3. It's a terrible movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. They put out a so-called Assembly Edition a couple of years ago, but it offered no essential improvements. The movie is CONCEPTUALLY flawed, and can never be fixed by re-cutting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Series note: It is strongly recommended that you watch the Alien series in order, beginning with Alien (1979), followed by Aliens (1986), then Alien 3. Each is a direct continuation of the plot of the earlier entry, like chapters in a novel.Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is unintentionally crash-landed on Fury 161, a remote, maximum-security prison planet. The prison, which was also a work camp in the mining industry, has been reduced to a bare-bones inmate population and staff, with the inmates--murderers, rapists and such--consisting primarily of those who have converted to their own brand of religious sect. No one at the prison has seen a woman in years, and they have never seen what Ripley has accidentally brought with her to the facility--a hostile alien, intent on killing them all.This may be the most "difficult" film of the Alien franchise. Although it has some stylistic elements from the first two films--everything from claustrophobic pursuits down dark, crypt-like corridors to the feeling (if not accoutrements) of big action blow-outs--director David Fincher has created the Bleak House of the series. In a personification of the films, Alien 3 covers the later adolescent years, when the series has decided to become a nihilist and write doom-laden poetry.And that is the deciding factor regarding whether one is likely to enjoy this film or not. Fincher has abandoned the breakneck pacing of the second, James Cameron-helmed film, and returned to a slow, complex dramatic pacing more akin to Ridley Scott's first Alien. Alien 3 trades traditional horror material (the first film could be seen as an almost Gothic haunted house story), gunfights and explosions for a constant dark, dingy atmosphere, both literally and figuratively in terms of the characters and their relationships. The film is imbued with brown tones, with a bluish-gray for contrast. Everything and everyone is dirty, beat-up, bruised and bloody. There is threatening machinery everywhere you look and infestations of overgrown lice. Imagine Clive Barker supervising the set design of a bloated subway system merging with the inside of an Egyptian pyramid, and you get the idea. (That is a more literal analogy than you may think--the climax could easily be seen as basically a Mummy film set in Egypt due to the environment and the structure of the action.) Alex Thomson's consistently remarkable cinematography is also worth noting in contributing to the delicious, gloomy atmosphere of the film.I love that atmosphere, and the regularly graphic grimness of this film (especially in the director's cut, or "special edition", which you should be sure to watch rather than the theatrical release), but it may be difficult for some viewers to take. Add that Fincher has made the film primarily about the intricate relationships of a relatively large cast of prisoners and their trying to deal with the sudden presence of a woman in their midst, and you lose another gaggle of viewers, but again, some of us still love it. Of course, there is alien-fighting stuff here, but we're back down to a single alien, and our heroes have to fight it with whatever is at hand, including weapons like axes and the machinery at the prison. The villain in Alien 3 is just as much "man against himself" as it is "man against monster".Fincher also wisely continued the plot thread from Aliens about Ripley's daughter, and her motivation towards the end of that film based on the loss of her daughter, in conjunction with the adoption of a functional surrogate. That aspect continues to supply the motivation for her actions in this film, where she undergoes a number of crises, and where in the end, she becomes a much more mythical figure.A lot of people dislike both the ending of this film and the fact that two primary characters are killed off without so much as a peep in the beginning, but it's important to remember that the underlying theme is nihilism, and the remote possibility of overcoming it through sacrifice--for example, with the prisoners finding a highly questionable religion, complete with "celibacy", with the hardships experienced by Clemens and his subsequent decisions, and with the final acts of redemption at the climax of the film. In that context, the plot points that tend to be disliked do not only make sense, they're absolutely necessary if we're not to completely ruin the tenor and subtext of the film.It is again worth noting the influences that the Alien series has had on other films. A prominent example is the Matrix series, which took power loaders as weapons of war (used in The Matrix Revolutions (2003)) from Aliens, and much of the atmosphere, production design, costume design and even some character structure from this film and used it in the early scenes aboard the Nebuchadnezzar in The Matrix (1999), as well as parts of Zion (in The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions).While I can easily see how Alien 3 would not be for all tastes, it is as a gourmet meal to me. It is at least recommended viewing if you are interesting in experiencing later films in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One mess of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3, the third installment of the series, is essentially a boring, stylish remake of the first movie. Supposed to be dark and dreary, it is unintentionally funny and full of plot holes, thanks to constant studio interference and script changes: Alien eggs and face huggers keep appearing out of nowhere and characters vanish into thin air. The characters' actions make no sense at all: For example, Ripley wakes up in the infirmary station of a maximum security prison for sex offenders and is warned about the psychopathic nature of the inmates right away... So what does she do? She takes the first chance she gets to leave the infirmary and hang out with the inmates, and stays with them even after they try to rape her! Yeah, right...Even considering the messy script, Weaver is surprisingly wooden in this, whatever happened after her career-highlighting performance in Aliens? The plot of Alien 3 is totally predictable if you've seen the first movie. There is a lot of gore, but absolutely no suspense in this movie, it simply fails to scare the audience. Like Ridley Scott once said, Alien 3 tries to be Alien but it cannot be frightening - we've seen it all before! The prisoners are the most boring characters ever written, their struggle in the endless corridors and tunnels of the prison drags and drags, and even the religious allegory falls apart when Bishop II reveals himself as the stereotypical company bad guy who was never interested in saving Ripley in the first place, so there was no sacrifice on her part - she would have died anyway! I laughed tears at her pathetic Jesus Christ pose when she jumped into the molten lead. Good riddance I thought, this little slut who threw herself at junkies, rapists and murderers had nothing in common with the Ripley we knew from Alien and Aliens. If Alien 3 succeeded at one thing, it was to thoroughly ruin Ripley's character.All told, Alien 3 is one mess of a movie. If you're interested in the series, I recommend to watch the first two and stop right there. Alien 3 &amp; 4 are so bad it's better to ignore them altogether.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Train Wreck Of A Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First point i'd like to make is that I am a BIG "Alien" fan and love the Sci-Fi Horror genre. I mean the first film Alien and James Cameron's Aliens are among my top films of all time and I love them. Recently I just watched the third Alien film and opinion: absolutely awful. I mean the film literally throws out everything that made the other two films great: Horror thats actually decent, suspense, setting, good alien design, STORY, acting, soundtrack, giving the audience what it wants etc. and replaces it with a David Fincher concoction thats a total mockery. I have no good points to make about the film so I'll just get on with what gave the film a despicable 1 out of 10 in my opinion.Firstly why and I MEAN WHY kill off the two characters we had hopes that they had LIVED through the nightmare in the previous film. I mean James Cameron does a fantastic job of characterising Corporal Hicks and Rebecca(Newt) and it leaves the audience with relief that they survived and fully we believe or should believe they fully deserve it. Then here comes along David Fincher and chooses to kill them off in a crash that is literally seconds after the opening credits like we had no emotional connection to them whatsoever what were you thinking...D**K!. Another point about the actual Alien is how come they can breed inside buffalo? when breeding inside humans was a major aspect of the story. The actual design of the alien is also poor hardly horrifying at all in fact instead of moving like a serpent with heavy movement and a lent over posture it prances along like a cat, not even half as good. Next after a bit of tender loving care Ripley is found to be O.K and Fincher seems to be characterising the Medical Officer that does most of the looking after so logically we should be thinking he is the important one and the one that survives right? or at least has a very dramatic death at the end. But once again little bit of emotional scene between him and Ripley alien comes up behind him middle of the film I might add and dead, just as quickly as he kills off the two surviving characters earlier on. Then few seconds later Commanding Officer is killed but he hasn't been characterised, we don't know him, maybe dislike him a bit so who cares. And this process is repeated slavishly through the rest of the film over and over and over again until only one man apart from Ripley remains. Oh and I forgot to mention for some stupid unexplained reason Ripley happens to have an alien queen inside of her so she has to kill herself then end of film. A few hints if Fincher can read this on how to have improved YOUR film: Firstly characterise characters you actually want to survive it is very confusing for the audience to portray someone as good and great then kill them with no one left characterised to hope to survive the ordeal. Secondly stick to the aliens breeding inside humans I mean it IS an aspect of the story that they breed inside humans so changing it is just pure stupidity. Thirdly improve the setting by a mile or scrap it all together i mean its supposed to be a Sci-Fi horror for most of the film I thought they were battling the alien in a hospital on earth, space is infinite if your going to call the planet Fiorina 161 at least have an imagination. I also have one important question for Fincher himself why? why kill off the best characters from the previous film within the first five minutes for no reason whatsoever?, why use a script that is utterly poor and the most basic of storys?, why does David Fincher expect sympathies or an emotive reaction from characters he didn't even characterise? and why did he have to ruin a franchise that had so much potential left? so through an awful plot, awful story badly trying to repeat aspects from the first film, awful characters and making a total mess of the film overall avoid watching this at all costs you WILL be very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher let down by tiresome script and action predictability</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ripley (Weaver) and her remaining crew crash land on a prison planet. As the only survivor Ripley must lead the inmates into finding an Alien that was onboard her ship.Six years after the remarkably brilliant Aliens and new director David Fincher was assigned the huge responsibility to maintain the scientific brilliance of the Alien series and sadly (and never has the word been more appropriate) he failed. Apart from a wonderful upside down chase in the final stages, there is no experimentation, no vintage scene stealing camera sweeps and no fast flowing consistency, which would become so powerful in his future releases (Fight Club, Panic Room) Fincher is let down by the script. Vincent Ward's story is amazingly flat and obvious, a contrast to the previous two releases. Ward takes a tried and tested format of having the creature hovering around in the background with the characters on the edge of their seats. Unlike Alien and Predator where this technique worked so magnificently, there is no urgency, no scare factor and most significantly no surprise. The alien in fact doesn't even feel scary when it is on screen. It appears as a matter of fact. There is no surprise to the creation whereas in Alien we didn't know what it was and in Aliens we couldn't count how many were out there or where they were. Plus this is a complete CGI creation and an obvious one at that whereas previously it felt like the Alien was right there in front of you. Effects flew out of the window and you were there sitting on the edge waiting for the creature to steal the lives of its prey. Here there is predictability about it; this along with the Star Wars prequels is the saddest moment in Sci-Fi history.However the film doesn't start off all too badly. The action is rolling in the credits and we glimpse some Alien activity on board Ripley's ship, leaving questions open as she crash lands. The ending, as in true Alien franchise fashion, is a sad depressing and highly dramatic turn of events. Personally I love films which don't have happy ending as they are too clichd, there is realism to be had, which the series isn't afraid to justify.Despite the lack of originality and the predictability, Sigourney Weaver still maintains that opinionated persona of Ripley and is one of two bright points about this third part.Alien? was the definitive turn in the series, the time when the Alien was no longer scary and original horror and suspense was thrown out for action convention and special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish horror video clip lacking substance and meaning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3, pretentiously written as Alien "cubed", follows Ridley Scott's horror classic Alien (1979) and James Cameron's amazing sequel Aliens (1986). Alien 3 was directed by David Fincher, a guy who made video clips for MTV before he was inexplicably hired to follow in the footsteps of two of the greatest directors Hollywood has ever seen. To get straight to the point, Fincher knows how to handle his camera, he has a distinctive style, but that's about it. His movie is ruined by an awfully unimaginative script that essentially repeats the story of the first movie on a remote planet, but it does so without fleshing out the characters, without giving the movie an underlying meaning except for some vague notions of religion (which were apparently taken over from an abandoned script about a religious cult inhabiting the planet).Weaver returns as Ripley, strangely promoted to the rank of Lieutenant since Aliens (impossible really, since there is no time gap between the second and third movie to allow this to happen). I guess this is one of the many flaws and plot holes in Alien 3, another is the impossible appearance of an alien egg on the Sulaco right at the beginning of the movie, obviously put there by the script writers to trigger off the story. Weaver fails to give her character the depth it had in Aliens, quite likely thanks to the weakness of the script. The other characters are mostly cannon fodder whose only function is to cross the alien's path, scream and die. There is virtually no character development in Alien 3, and thus no suspense.Alien 3 is a cheap, unimaginative Hollywood sequel that should have never been made. It has no respect for the grandiose first two movies and the only reason why it was made was money. Unfortunately Alien 3 didn't tank as badly as could have been expected, and so the producers decided to make a fourth movie and the AVP movies. My recommendation: Consider all these movies nightmares and ignore them. The Alien Series, quality wise, ended with Aliens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You really do have to feel sorry for Ms Ripley; she must be the unluckiest lady in the galaxy. Lost in space for 57 years, outliving her own daughter, blamed for sabotaging a spaceship, stitched-up over a 'phoney' alien, demoted from flight-crew to fork-lift driver, stricken with ongoing nightmares and then tricked into going back and re-living them again. On top of all that, she finally gets infected by the alien, jettisoned once more into space, a child she fought so hard to save gets drowned, a marine she begins to develop romantic attachments to is killed, and finally; she crash-lands on a penal colony crammed with murderers and rapists - and oh-deary-me, another alien.You wouldn't perhaps want her as a friend.'Aliens' - an absolute cracker of a movie - ended on something of a victorious note. Most everyone was wiped-out, but the aliens were done for and she found a surrogate daughter to replace the one she outlived. There was also a nascent love interest in the form of Corporal Hicks. It was about as near to a fairytale finish as any genuine dragon-slaying horror movie could get. And the franchise should have ended there. Sadly; it didn't. Those grasping Hollwood moguls could see only more dollar signs.'Alien-3' had an impossibly hard act to follow. There were no more shocks or suspenseful moments left in the system, no more creepy scenarios in dimly-lit mysterious places that hadn't already been exploited, no more pools of drool to leave you wondering what came next.There was quite an interesting beginning, with brief explanatory glimpses sequenced to the accompaniment of bewitching choral voices. Some interesting visual effects were complemented by a suitably robust audio and sound-effects package. But after that it was simply more of the same: Ripley the knowing witness attempting to convince the sceptical inexperienced. Until the beast makes a showing, and once again she has to save everyone's ass. Feminism can be taken to implausible lengths.It's yet another small, hostile world. We seem to spend most of our time in poor light, etc, etc. There are some interesting and equally crass mood sequences. At times, Ms Ripley becomes tiresomely evasive, especially with the doctor - well played by Charles Dance.He heads a curious mix of British character actors that includes rumbustious Brian Glover as the colony's scathing warden, and Pete Postlethwaite as one of the inmates. It seems an unlikely place for Yorkshire lads to have wound up.With an inevitability that is barely interesting, the alien begins systematically bumping them all off. None of the characters are particularly likable or memorable, so it's hard to care for their loss. Dance's character is arguably the most sympathetic, but he gets creamed pretty early in the list. The whole thing is pretty grim, dismal and down-beat. Ms Ripley herself commits suicide in the end (not that it spared us further sequels). The un-killable alien is finally killed in a way that is quite preposterous.And that's more or less it - until next time.It may be that I do the movie a dis-service, but as I say; coming hot on the heels of such an edge-of-the-seat smash-hit like 'Aliens' it could hardly assume any other guise than an anti-climax. If the first two episodes had been less entertaining this might have seemed to shine more brightly, but it wasn't meant to be.Worth a watch if you get the chance, but it certainly isn't worth a purchase or changing you plans to stop in and see.Since this outing there has been 'Resurrection', 'Alien vs Predator' 'Requiem' and probably 'Daleks Defy Face-huggers', with 'Blob meets Drool', each featuring Sigourney Weaver in increasingly silly situations. But; money talks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most underrated and misunderstood film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like 'Alien 3.' I really do. I can confidently say that is on my top 5 list for my favorite films. I think that there is a specific list of reasons why people don't like the film. Since I have a limited word count, I will only explore a few. -Their gripe: the entire film is cold, dark, and depressing...too depressing for most Alien fans. =My response: What were you expecting? Bunny rabbits and candy canes? Please! The universe that this trilogy is a very dark and depressing place. Fincher (the director of Alien 3) perfectly captures it! -Their gripe: There is little action. =My response: I can understand that fans were hungry for another shoot-em-up film like 'Aliens', but the point of a sequel is to explore new ground and give the viewer something fresh and new! Why was 'Resurrection' so bad? Because it tried to combine all of the previous films into one and the result was a giant s*** ball! Alien 3 does play out like a drama, but what the hell is wrong with that? It is, by far, the most bloody and violent of the 4 films. -Their gripe: Character development sucks. =My response: Ok, first watch the new 'assembly cut' that just came out, it should stop some of your bitching. Second, the majority of the characters are convicts, and, as you will find out in the film, they are expendable, so once you know one, you basically know them all. I mean they're convicts for Christ's sakes! They're violent, loud, dirty, and crude (even though they are trying not to be). What more could you possibly want from them? The 'Assembly Cut' does give more insight to their characters, though. I really don't understand why 'Alien 3' is the most bashed film in the series, while 'Resurrection' was accepted as the finale. I know that the reason why 'Alien 3' was hard to accept was the fact that the fans were expecting another gun/marine movie and not something bold, daring, and different, which is exactly what 'Alien 3' is. If you have not seen 'Alien 3' you really should. Don't take other people opinions. Watch it with an open mind, and make your own decision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who enjoyed both Ridley Scott's original and James Cameron's excellent sequel, the disappointment I felt with this horrible abortion of a film is almost tiring. Not only did it ruin a series which could have been one of the best Sci-Fi trilogies ever made (The Matrix suffered the same fate), it took everything that made Aliens great and threw it out the window.Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley, who is now even more of a man, and even her performance can't save the film. The film makes its biggest mistake at the very beginning, by killing off Hicks (Michael Biehn) and Newt (Carrie Henn), effectively alienating the audience before the film even starts. Nice work there guys. They could have at least given a good explanation for their deaths, but instead give us the worst plot hole ever conceived and expect us to swallow it.There are no characters in this film you can root for, like the first two films, they're all a bunch of evangelical criminals who haven't had sex in years. The plot is inconsistent, the script is shoddy and the special effects are laughably atrocious. The film was made six years after Aliens, and it looks worse.Although David Fincher has smartened up ever since he made this turkey (Seven and Fight Club are two of my favorite films), this will always be a blemish on his resume. Avoid this film at all costs, unless you're hobby is wasting money. Don't even bother downloading it either, you can save that space on your computer for something worth while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A3 is an unprecedented accumulation of wrong decisions: Reverting back to a use-once concept, using anti-heroes in a context that requires emotional attachment (to make a trivial point that never needed to be made), underestimating the impact of the previous movie's characters (and wasting them carelessly).But maybe the biggest mistake of all was to press ahead with the production without having a clear-cut idea of where this story was heading. It is painful to see even seasoned actors like Sigourney Weaver struggling with the immaturity of the script - a battle beyond hope that ends with everyone capitulating to a hopelessly muddled plot-line, awfully witless dialog, terribly overblown pathos and totally uninspired gore scenes. Every dramatic moment is unintentionally funny, every attempt at sarcasm inappropriate, every attempt at suspense fails to hit the mark.A3 falls flat as a horror film, but even more so as a drama. It is easily debunked as the kind of pseudo-intellectual garbage that desperately tries to be more, and fails so horribly that it must be recommended to film students as a lesson in how *not* to make a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*************This review may contain spoilers************** There is a rule with sequels and that is generally that they are never as good as the original. However, every once in a while a sequel comes along that is every bit as good as the original, hell, some even blow the original out of the water. This is what we got with Aliens. So, when you're making a sequel to a sequel, nay, one of the best ever sequels, it is a fairly good idea to try and keep in tone with the first two, to respect what they did.This is where Alien 3 puts its first step wrong. Aliens gave us several lovable, well developed characters who had chances of a real future in the Alien universe, particularly the protagonists surrogate daughter Newt. Now instead of continuing their story, as seems logical, Alien 3 simply kills all these lovable characters, with the exception of Ellen Ripley, within the first five minutes. This is a real kick in the teeth for any audience so to get them back on the movies ground the film is going to have to give us some really amazing characters with TOP acting. Only it doesn't. What we get is a lot of British convicts whose excuse for depth is that they have 'found God'. Now I am all for religious undertones but these are so forced down your throat that they do not feel at all natural, they are just there as an attempt at depth to these frankly unlikeable characters. On top of this, there are just too many people. What Alien and Aliens managed was to give us just enough characters so that we are able to remember who everybody is. ALien 3 gives us far too many people and this just adds to their lack of likability meaning that by the end, as a huge chase involving just one alien begins we just do not know who is still alive and, frankly, nobody cares. Even Sigourney Weaver, normally a very accomplished actress, struggles to bring Ripley, previously a likable protagonist, any sympathetic elements. She is just not the same character any more, and this is not a good thing. There are far too many petty attempts to give her character an arc that fail miserably in the face of everything that has come before. There is nothing here which touches the audience in the way the mother daughter relationship with Newt did in the last film. There are many attempts to throw in new things by the director but this is very much a case of throwing everything at the screen and seeing what sticks and, honestly, that doesn't work this time around. If I were to give this film any points I will say this. The score fits the scenes it has been designed for very well and is up to par with the previous scores in the series, perhaps even superior. The scenery also fits the tone of the film rather well. It's bleak, drab and depressing and, whilst this is one of the films main failing points, the scenery does at least fit the films overall feel. However these are minor good points in what is otherwise an awful film with poor, poor acting, too many characters and an unsympathetic protagonist. Watch the first two films for fine examples of what real, quality sci-fi can be like but ignore this turgid drag. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 is by far the bleakest, dullest, most brutal chapter of the "Alien" saga. The film establishes it's despairing tone in it's first scene. Newt, Ripley's cute little sidekick from "Aliens" is killed off before the "directed by" credit appears. As if killing off a 12 year old because she isn't conducive to your plot wasn't enough, the film goes on to have little Newt brutally sliced open in a grim autopsy scene. Sadly, it's the only scene in which Sigourney Weaver emotes at all. I'm guessing she checked out when she realized how bad this film was going to be. The remainder of the film is spent talking about events in the other films, or the back- stories of characters who serve no ultimate purpose. The Alien is loose in the ship all this time (it comes out of a dog this time. This scene is pretty brutal and depressing too.) but doesn't do much until the film has already run out of gas.That brings me to another problem: The Alien itself. It's the same basic xenomorph, but it walks around on four legs like a dog. OOOH scary! Early CGI effects are used to the detriment of the creature. CGI was limited at this time, but the real problem is that it strips the creature of all menace. The original alien was frightening because of how slowly it moved, giving the impression of some kind of intelligence. This alien is all bark and no bite. Maybe they shouldn't have had a dog for the host body. duh.David Fincher has gone on to direct some great films. You can feel him trying to make things work, but either the studio interfered too much, or the script was just that bad, or maybe Fincher just hadn't found his footing yet. Whatever it was, this monster should've been killed before it spawned and gave us Alien:Resurrection, and two AVP movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this next installment of the Alien series, I couldn't stop asking "why?" Why kill Newt, Hicks and Bishop? Why a prison planet with an all-male cast? Why such a bleak, urine-color lighting? Why making the inmates part of a strange cult? I can see why David Fincher wanted to be the least associated with this movie. It's not very good to add to your resum.The reason I saw this movie was because I felt obligated as a film buff and Alien fan to be.Now, the movie isn't exactly bad. The suspense and action sequences were OK, such as the Alien POV chases. Still, it shouldn't have nothing to do with the franchise. It could have worked as a single horror movie, with a lot more development from the male characters and a different monster.If you loved the first two Alien movies, I wouldn't recommend you to watch this or any subsequent Alien title. Alien 3 has started the age where the producers went above the screenwriter's or director's creativeness, and set their foot down on whatever they think is more marketable for the Alien series.It's miles better than Resurrection, but it doesn't really redeem itself. Let's just pretend it was never made, and the franchise ended with James Cameron's "Aliens".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Ever Alien Film Without James Cameron That Refrained Me From Watchin Alien Resurrection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going straight to the point. This movie is pure garbage. It plunges deep down into the ravine full of rotten tomatoes and maggot-filled pies. It is that bad.I have been a true fan of the Alien franchise after being exposed to Aliens 1 &amp; 2 many years ago when I was still a kid in high school. Just lately, I got the Aliens trilogy(1, 2 &amp; 3) and didn't consider Alien Resurrection(4) as I read Sigourney Weaver was not in it and the quality of the movie sucks. I am relieved that I didn't get the 4th instalment after watching the 3rd one just yesterday night.Without James Cameron, the movie seriously lacks quality and depth. The storyline was poor and the acting was terrible. I don't know why the director of this movie chose to focus on the bandits in the prison this time but the vulgarity used in the movie pretty much killed the entire film. Even the iconic Sigourney Weaver cannot salvage this movie from the brink of disaster.To sum it up, this film is pure garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1992, and 20th Century Fox gave the world ALIEN?. For the director's chair, Fox hired silver screen virgin -- David Fincher; who was at the peak of a successful career directing music videos and television commercials, while also having worked at George Lucas' ILM (Industrial Light &amp; Magic) during the 80's.The tale of ALIEN? takes place on one of the most inhospitable environments (asides from Los Angeles) ever portrayed on film. Human criminals and an Alien scream away at each other in the cinematic equivalent of 'Hillary Clinton Vs. Condaleeza Rice' in a Bangkok backstreet prostitute fight. The location is Fury 161, an evacuated lead mine and prison colony with only a fraction of it's original population wishing to voluntarily remain of they're own accord. There, some of society's most wretched and vile convicts have been isolated; murderers, child rapists, serial killers and loons have formed a sort of monastic order, living in the lead mining facilities. The prisoners (logically) have no weapons, no escape vehicle, no booze, no pornography, no TV, no internet access, no HBO and to make matters even worse, are all inclined to regularly shave their head and body hair, as the planet is infested with "future" lice. On this delightful planet arrives Lt. Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), the future equivalent of Typhoid Mary.No sooner has Ripley shaved, deaths immediately begin occurring throughout Fury 161 with a rather suspicious Xenomorphic air about them . Realizing what she may have inadvertently brought Fury's unsuspecting residents from her visit to LV-426, Lt. Ellen Ripley goes about doing what must be done in order to save Fury's quickly dwindling prison population, and perhaps - humanity itself.From this point onwards, the rest of the film is spent franticly running around, strenuously arguing, overly screaming and weeping through the depressing Fury 161 facility, while awaiting Bishop II (played by Lance Henriksen) to arrive to make his (gimmick) guest appearance.On a more serious note, the plot does takes time to advance. The first half of the film is short on action, BIG on character introduction, development, tension and suspense. The thought of having weapons taken away adds even more to the terror as the theme goes into that of vulnerability/helplessness/defenseless. The power structure is reversed and the frustration is evident, and seeing how a group of prisoners, who's crimes are based on those of assumed power, deals with it is a very strong concept. Without the sympathy for Ripley from the previous ALIEN movies and only minor flashes of humanity from the prisoners themselves, the film is without sympathetic characters worthy of redemption. A truly wonderful change from the traditional film status-quo B.S..Asides the undeserving criticism the film received on it's debut, ALIEN?'s superb intermixed UK &amp; US cast, cinematography, excellent production values, beautiful art direction, flawless editing, menacing score, visually stunning set designs and not forgetting of course - skillful directing; make this an underrated masterpiece, that continues to find itself in greater appreciation in a modern day sea of mediocre Hollywood productions. Despite the constant high level daily studio interference throughout the troubled production of ALIEN? (back in 1991), Finchers directorial (debut) brilliance continues to shine throughout ALIEN? in the above noted departments. All in all, this movie is a worthy conclusion to the ALIEN trilogy. It's my personal favorite in the series due to the multiple themes and concepts presented. Brilliantly acted and directed, and the prison/Gothic industrial setting is haunting and eerily beautiful.ALIEN? is akin to a fine wine; it matures with age.An underrated if somewhat misunderstood masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unfortunately underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>contrary to what other viewers might say, i actually find this one the best installment of the Alien TRILOGY. (note the ALLCAPS on the TRILOGY. that means THREE MOVIES. not four. THREE.)each of the three movies is great in its own way. Mr Scott's Alien, of course, started it all with its beautiful simplicity. Mr Cameron brought his own twist to it and made a fine yarn indeed. but with Alien3, i think the story of Lt. Ripley finally comes onto its own.unlike most of its detractors, i actually believe the third installment does NOT disregard the second movie. in fact, i believe it used Mr Cameron's Aliens as the perfect set-up for Ripley's final descent and eventual transcendance from the Alien.this installment is definitely more thoughtful, a lot slower and more of a character study than the first two films. the first was about surviving the Alien. the second was about kicking the crap out of a whole swarm of 'em. this one, this little underrated much kicked-about baby over here, this one's all about Ripley, and how she eventually accepts her fate, starcrossed as it is by the presence of the Alien. oh, and it's also about a bunch of hopeless baddy-types, who turn out to be the most upliftingly, almost heart-achingly human of all the characters we see in the TRILOGY.it is most unfortunate that Mr Cameron and even Mr Fincher himself totally abhore this film. though i can understand Mr Fincher's distaste (being involved in it and having the movie "made for him" by the dictates of "The Company", i can totally understand his opinion, and would probably feel the same way in his shoes), i am totally baffled and outraged by Mr Cameron's opinions. though some may say otherwise, just cause he made the biggest-budgety-looking and most successful of the three films doesn't make the trilogy "his".certainly this is a slow trod for an Alien film, but despite the cliches, this movie for me has the most substance of the three films. here, we actually see humans using their wits and grit against what has become an almost omnipotent killing machine. and though this is also the darkest of the three films, it is also, in its own way, the most uplifting.i daresay, it's almost arthouse. certainly the gore is a little gratuitous (the almost sensual "cruelty" of the Alien from the first film reduced to a simple cold efficiency in this one---which makes more sense to me), and the effects are pretty obvious, B-movieish in fact, but it in no way detracts from (my personal) movie experience. unlike the blustering Aliens, this is not a big-budget, hollywood special effects movie, though it may have cost a lot in the making due to all the corporate s***e. the specialest effect we see here is in the characterization. the "acting" as you will. and the story is cooler than cool, cliches bugs and all (hey, Casablanca was chockful of cliches, and no one ever complains about that little doozy).say what you want, see it for yourself. this is the tightest of the three films IMHO, and though i've only seen the "unwanted" cinematic version and not the DVD version, alls i can say is, I LOVE THIS FILM.FYI, my ranking for the films in descending order: Alien3, Alien, Aliens. but i love them all, and wish they would all just live happily together. without THAT other one, of course. now THAT was such a blasphemy, i don't even want to write its name.dreamwell. c</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The least successful film in this series was directed by style master (and content-underachiever) David Fincher. Ripley, the only survivor of her past mission, awakens on a prison planet in the far corners of the solar system. As she tries to recover, she realizes that not only has an alien gotten loose on the planet, the alien has implanted one of its own within her. As she battles the prison authorities (and is aided by the prisoners) in trying to kill the alien, she must also cope with a distinctly shortened lifespan that awaits her. But the striking imagery makes for muddled action and the script confuses it further. The ending looks startling but it takes a long time--and a not particularly satisfying journey--to get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tragic End.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review 3 of 4Looking at Alien 3 as the final film in a trilogy I have to say that it is one of the better final acts in film history, even though it is perhaps not the final act that many would have wanted. If you follow this guideline for a trilogy: Part one sets up the story, Part Two expands on it, taking it in new and interesting places, and Part three brings closure, then Alien 3 works just fine. I think of this film as a tragedy. Ripley loses everyone she ever cared about. Her situation is bleak, the setting is grim. Where Alien was subtle and Aliens was flamboyant, Alien 3 is more thematic. Much is present in the subtext. There is much religious and symbolic imagery to be digested. It is a very layered film that requires several viewings to take it all in. Again, Sigourney weaver gets much praise for her performance in Aliens, but here I believe she does her best work of the series. How does someone react when everything has been taken from them? What has their life amounted to? What was it all for? These are all questions posed by the film and to her character, and it is not an easy thing to play. This film has an elegiac quality that is absolutely unrelenting. The Extended Version of the film is much more layered and provides much more character depth, but there is one thing that really differentiates Alien 3 from its predecessors (especially in the special edition), it is almost solely focused on character to the point of the Alien not being all that dominant in terms of screen time and moments of suspense. The thematic elements of the film are very dominant; life, death, faith, and internal conflict. Many religious allegories are made with the most obvious being "the last temptation of Ripley" at the hands of Bishop II. The score in this film is much more dominant than either of the previous films, and there is a greater emphasis on the character's faces rather than set design or technology. Alien 3 seems more personal than the other films, perhaps because it centers entirely on Ripley's character. Several other memorable characters are introduced like Clemens, the soft spoken doctor, and Dillon, the religious leader. Golic is a fascinating character who's entire character arc was cut from the theatrical version but thankfully is in the special edition. Alien 3 is a difficult film for a mass audience because it doesn't have the horror or action aspects of the first and second that an audience can easily latch on to. It is a film about loss and internal conflict, not exactly the stuff one thinks of with popular entertainment, but I've always looked at the Alien Trilogy as more than just movies. Alien 3 has it's flaws, mainly the looming question of where the alien egg at the beginning of the film came from (but then again we never found out where the ship in the first film came from did we?) This film gives such a sense of completion and finality to the series that I wish no more installments had been made after it. It has one of the best endings in film history, but seeing David Fincher's subsequent work with Seven, The Game, and Fight Club, great endings are a trend in his films. This is a very rewarding film, but not an easy one to watch if you are looking for mindless entertainment. There are greater ideas and themes at play in Alien 3. Watching the first three back to back as a trilogy creates an amazing experience much like following a well loved character through a series of novels, sharing in their hardship and triumph as they go along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien 3: Assembly Cut. Sci-fi for grownups.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Se7en and Fight Club but after Alien and Aliens came visionary director David Fincher's Alien?. The third in the popular franchise, but easily one of the most hated, Alien? is a grim allegorical tale about life, death, sin and redemption. And it is perhaps because of the weighty themes of this film that many fans of the franchise quickly turned their nose up at it.Directly following the events of Aliens, the film's surviving character's escape pod crash lands on a prison planet filled with Double Y Chromosome convicts who have now found religion. Unfortunately one surviving alien came with the pod and it is not long before it starts feeding off the prison population.A stark contrast to director James Cameron's flashy sci-fi action romp 'Aliens', Alien? is more of a grim psychological horror where the optimism of the first two films are crushed under a near nihilistic tone persistent in this one. However it is this dramatic departure from Cameron's sequel is what gives Alien? an edge above its predecessors. In addition to a grim storyline littered with quasi and overt religious references, Alien? also features all of the hallmarks that make David Fincher one of the most popular movie directors around today. Those low camera angles, stark lighting and filtered colors reminiscent of Se7en, Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, are all present in Alien?, in addition to some very stunning cinematography and a haunting score by Elliot Goldenthal. The performances of the three main leads: Sigourney Weaver, Charles S. Dutton and Charles Dance, are amazing in spite of the weaknesses of the screenplay. It is remarkable that despite all this film had going against it, in its highly publicized development hell (that included a script that went through several extensive rewrites before, during and even after filming had finished), the final product is still a masterpiece, albeit a flawed one. If you watch the 'Assembly Cut' version of Alien? , which is over 30 minutes longer than the theatrical release, you will quickly understand why it is indeed one of the most underrated, but also one of greatest sci-fi monster flicks ever made, and why it quite suitably completes the trilogy in the most fitting manner. Although many complain about the doom and gloom of this feature, this final installment in the trilogy is also the most uplifting. Looking beyond the downbeat nature of the film, Alien? is still essentially a story about hope, and the putting aside of differences to selflessly help achieve a common good. In other words, this film is about redemption. Alien?: Assembly Cut is not only one of the best films in the franchise but it is also one of David Fincher's best efforts to date. 9 out 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a stinker....but it had to happen sometime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes.....Alien 3 was an embarrassment, especially after all the pop-culture and movie influence that both "Alien" and "Aliens" put on. "Alien" was perhaps the greatest horror ever made, even surpassing "The Exorcist" and "Halloween". "Aliens" is a sure contender for being the greatest action/sci-fi movie ever filmed. And just knowing these two facts is why this movie fails, because there was so much riding on this and it turned out to be disappointing. And they also seem to be going back to the first film with the idea of the lone warrior alien and they don't do anything new except make the alien a quadrupedal. But of course, it's understandable because what else could they make of the Alien series? A comedy? But the entire film doesn't present itself very well and that's why it fails.After the end "Aliens", Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop are still in hypersleep until a face-hugger on their ship somehow causes a fire (which makes no sense) and then cracks through Ripley's cryo-tube and impregnates her. Then the spaceship crash-lands on a an all-male prison planet with Ripley as the only survivor. But the face-hugger (which can somehow infect twice) infects a dog, and then all hell breaks loose in the prison.After they couldn't get either Ridley Scott or James Cameron to come back, they gave the job to film auteur David Fincher while he was still a rookie, and his lack of experience is painfully apparent in here. He just doesn't generate a lot of suspense or tension and we start to ponder our reason for watching this movie in the first place. The supporting characters are just a bunch of useless scum that people call prisoners and there isn't a single explanation given as to why we're supposed to care about them, especially Dillon who is perhaps one of the most repulsive characters I've ever seen put on a film. He basically puts down Ripley because of her gender and even unemotionally states to her "I am a murderer and a rapist of women". And you're gonna feel totally magnificent when he ends up dying in vain while fighting the alien at the end. And it also doesn't reveal anything new about the Ellen Ripley character and she's sorta flat in here. But Sigourney Weaver doesn't do that bad of a job at playing the character that she plays best.And also as for the alien itself, its really dumb and poorly done. The idea of it being modeled after a dog isn't remotely interesting nor is it threatening. And also the scene when the chest-burster pops out of the dog was really disturbing to watch and also unnecessary. If it's horror that you're trying to make, you have to make scenes that are scary but at the same time you still want to watch it, and the dog's death scene did neither of that. Honestly, I hope that same dog bit the director and the writers in the @$$'s really hard. And also it was basically poorly done because it was the early 1990's and it was obviously a puppet that they were using and it was very stilted and totally fake. Even the aliens from the first two movies were more convincing and terrifying and those two were made YEARS before this came out.Some stuff I rather liked were the good camera work when the alien was on the ceiling chasing the prisoners, but this still didn't contribute to the suspense and it was more of an eye-candy thing for me. And also the tragedy shown about Ripley that she constantly suffers all because of the aliens. But other than that, just pass this one....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dog Alien?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought both Alien and Aliens were very good films. I had heard many reviewers state that Alien 3 is by far the worst of the entire Alien series and a terrible film. For the most part those reviewers were correct.Basically Ripley winds up a planet that is a prison for criminals. During the ship landing while she was asleep, Newt and Hicks both died. An alien managed to sneak aboard the ship and infects a dog and creates a new dog alien that starts to cause problems for everyone on this planet.First off, I have to say that the story and acting were particularly bad. Why on Earth did this prison planet have NO FREAKING WEOPONS ON IT! It made the conflict somewhat more interesting but that idea is super dumb. Also none of the supporting characters were really that interesting. I did not like how they killed off Hicks and Newt right off the bat. There is no doubt that they just killed them off because they could not get the actors that played them to appear in this film.Sigourney Weaver is pretty good as Ripley in this film, but she always is good. Still, this is her worst performance I think and I blame more of it on a bad director and script then I do on her. It is like Simon Cowell once said to a bad contestant on American Idol, "Coaching you would be like coaching a one legged person to a gold medal in the one hundred meter dash." If the script and plot is bad, the acting will often suffer as a result.The Alien is OK. It is kind of cool how it emerged from a different animal, this time a dog. It gets in some good action, but since the rest of the film was so bad, it really was not worth the wait at all. Also the whole alien point of view shots were kind of stupid because it made the alien seem to move much slower than they appear to in the film.So, bad plot and bad characters. Sigourney Weaver is OK and so is the alien, but I do not recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We have different tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reactions of people towards Alien 3 have always seemed me complicated and weird. I can't explain this by the word hate, because it is more than hate, much more intense. Even the movies in IMDb bottom 100 have not such a bad reputation and people are much more easy to those. Long time ago, I read that Alien 3 was appreciated in Asian and Europe continents, but American and English audiences hated it. This is also so weird to me. It is said that it is because there were not Newt and Hicks for example. I don't know even who they are, probably one of them is the little girl. Why these two characters are very important? Are they main or key characters? No. In the second movie, Ripley made a friendship (a sort of) with her, so these people had wanted a tearjerker melodrama? Ripley is ugly in this movie, but she looks interesting and appealing to me with her short hair and bloodshot. Alien 3 is the darkest, the most bizarre, the most violent and the hardest sequel in the series. However, despite many people like dark movies such as Dark City or The Dark Knight and many people like also bizarre movies like the ones which Takeshi Miike made for example, they find Alien 3 disgusting, abominable. To me, this is a very stylish and appealing bizarreness. Not disturbing. And probably some of them who find this disgusting love Peter Jackson's Braindead or Saw movies? As for violence, this is not a sadistic or sick violence, it is only for showing us the ravenous alien's savagery. Alien 3 is the darkest one in the series, at the same time, it is the darkest movie ever made to me, I did not find even The Dark City that dark. I should add that this darkness did not disturb me, it was not an unappealing dark. It causes a thrilling, mysterious, frightening and the most important choky atmosphere. Some people complain about weapon matter, as if the previous movies are action-packed movies, even in Cameron's Aliens, there was not any gunfight scene almost. To me, this is a very interesting idea; what would you do, if you had not any weapon against the alien? Despite the visual effects of the alien has some defects in some moments, it still looks impressive. My first favorite scene is the scene that one of the prisoners stands in front of the crawly, big impellers and then, he finds the carcass. The never-to-be-forgotten scenes are the surgical operation scene (Ripley's decision and Fincher's great direction), the alien's attack to the infirmary, the horrible dog scene and the final. However, my favorite part is the beautifully bizarre pursuit scenes at the corridors. Fincher uses odd camera angles, a unique cinematic vertiginous experience. Personally, as a Alien movie and also as a science fiction, I found everything. Entertainment, horror, suspense... Alien 3 is my favorite movie in the series by far, we have different tastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first saw Alien 3 i was sad. They killed my favourite characters, inclusive of ripley at the end, it left me hollow and a tad upset! upon repeat viewings i found the tone and atmosphere to be unmatched in any film I've seen since, coupled with the most perfect musical score I've heard (which i still listen to even today) makes for a hard to stomach film which is actually the best in the series. Why do i think this? the character of ripley is really fulfilled, we see her grow from the first film into a strong female character.Such additions as the alien 3 life cycle and alien design just add to the creepy atmosphere, this film i remember more for its tone and new direction it took the series in. Its a sad film, depressing and very dark indeed. Its just like the alien, without remorse or answers.This film restores what the alien is: scary. In aliens they weren't as scary because they seemed to be rather weak? though it still stands as a wonderful film in its own right (action).For me alien 3 is superb, worth watching and studying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The producers of Alien3 should be ashamed of themselves and they owe David Fincher a serious apology and compensation. They caused so much hassle and stuck their noses in places they didn't belong that the theatrical release(TR) of Alien3 was watered down compared to the masterpiece David Fincher produced in the Special Edition(SE). The theatrical version deserves the lowish rating it has received, but the Director's cut is outstanding and in my opinion is the best of all the Alien movies in the franchise to date!!! In this day and age of much longer movies, it doesn't make sense to see in hindsight the editorial debauchery David Fincher's Alien3 was witness too. The TR was bad. Large sections of the plot were stripped, they replaced the pivotal alien host, and in general the sections that set the scene were all missing. One Simple and essential must... SEE THE SPECIAL EDITION !!!!The characters are disturbingly great and portray a very credible motley band of backwater planet prisoners. Charles Dance is brilliant but unfortunately isn't on screen for as long as I wished. Maybe that in itself is a testament to the brilliance and another reason why some people scored Alien3 lowly- their sensibilities were hurt with a fantastic character killed quickly!!. Charles Dutton is a mean and believable 'top dog' and the contribution of the reliable Pete Postlethwaite was a treat. The interaction between prisoners, authorities and visitors was always evident and very well handled. Alien3 further highlighted the expendability of human life for corporate greed.The Alien is one nasty critter. Different to the other Alien movies, the camera angles of the alien's sight and movement are well executed. It is clear the creators wished to return to that claustrophobic and technological defunct world of the first Alien movie, and while it is very different, I believe it worked extremely well.Alien3 has an incredibly beautiful and stirring musical score. It is haunting in parts and from all the 'Alien' movies, I believe most people would have this tune in their head. In the scheme of the Alien saga, I believe Alien3 -Special Edition to be the best. Without giving away serious spoilers, the SE reinstates massive sections that transcend Alien3 from a lowly rated movie to a thoroughly deserved masterpiece. It is a pity David Fincher wasn't more experienced and time under his belt to tell and force the producers to 'My way or the highway'.SPECIAL EDITION ONLY TO BE SEEN!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read quite a few comments about this film saying it trashed the legacy of the two previous films by seemingly condemning Ripley, getting rid of great characters from Aliens etc...but what people are forgetting here, is that from the very first moments of the very first Alien film, the character of Ripley is doomed to never return home, and to fight the Alien/s until her dying breath. The ending of Aliens was not hopeful...it was a small illusion of hope amid a terrible darkness.I was disturbed by the deaths of the Hicks and Newt characters when I first saw the film...it wasn't until I viewed it several more times that I came to realise the overall point (one of darkness and hopelessness but ultimately sacrifice and redemption) and now I see it as a fitting end to the trilogy.I am in total agreement with all fans who do not recognise Alien Resurrection or Alien vs Predator as having anything at all to do with this original trilogy. Winona in an Alien movie? A CLONE of Ripley we're suddenly supposed to CARE about? Please...Rounds out the story nicely...and i love the line (Charles S.

		<fullReview>Alien 3 is probably the most misunderstood movie of all time. The thing is, I think that most people in life just jump on the bandwagon, if they hear that a movie is getting bad reviews, then that is what they expect to see. The characters in this movie are fantastic, the story is original, the ideas and dialogue are engaging and the script is well thought out by some very clever people. OK, it had a few rewrites and killed off the survivors from the second movie....who cares? These days, foreign movie makers aren't afraid to kill the main character or do something with their movie that doesn't follow what most people want to see. This movie took a risk and tried something different and I'm very glad for it. 'Aliens' is dated. It's OK as far as the Quadrilogy goes, but it's a little bit tame and cheesy by todays standards. Alien &amp; Alien 3 has aged just fine and are generally for the adults. There aren't enough movies like Alien 3 out there or enough movie companies with the balls to do something different. Alien 3...... best out of them all and an absolute joy to watch. Absorbing, tense, frightening, thrilling and thought provoking with many underlying ideas that makes you notice something new each time you watch it. Scott and Cameron never managed that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An impossibly bad sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen an A-grade movie series drop as much in quality between the first and second sequels as the Alien series. Alien and Aliens are infinitely more interesting, captivating and exciting than what translates to the screen in David Fincher's grotesquely inept continuation of Ellen Ripley's saga. Visually, the film opens well enough and nicely establishes the setting, a run-down, industrial prison complex on a remote planet at "the ass-end of space". Well enough if you are ready to put up with the downside - a string of outrageous plot holes, conceived by the writers in order to isolate the heroine from the remaining crew (who are immediately killed off in a never explained emergency landing on the previously mentioned planet), and confront her with two more aliens (born of eggs which, in a bizarre twist of fate, appeared out of nowhere on the ship from the second movie).Unfortunately, the ill-fated story never recovers from this clumsy, uninspired opening. As a matter of fact, it does not go anywhere. The first alien infects Ripley (but conveniently waits to burst from her chest until the movie's finale), the second infects a dog/ox, depending on the version you are watching, and the resulting dog/ox/alien hybrid soon begins to attack the inmates of the prison. The remainder of the film is basically a drawn-out cat-and-mouse game in trying to avoid/confront the alien creature. With the exception of two characters, all of the British prisoners are cannon fodder. They blend together and have no distinctive personalities, almost like some of the characters were killed at least three times only to pop up later unharmed making us realize that it was just someone similar and equally forgettable who met their tragic end. The only characters that leave a minimal impression are Charles Dance's prison doctor and Charles S. Dutton's spiritual leader of the prisoners. The remainder of the cast are instantly forgettable and largely unsympathetic. A subplot where some of the prisoners stalk and try (but fail) to rape Ripley makes them even less appealing.The lack of interest in the characters makes large portions of the movie hard to sit through. Even worse, the writers didn't manage (or care) to write a convincing continuation for the main character, forcing Sigourney Weaver to deliver the weakest performance in the series. Her acting is almost unrecognizable from the second movie. The movie ends with a supposedly tragic (actually relieving) suicide of the main character, embarrassingly similar to the prior year's mega hit Terminator 2, ironically directed by the man who made the far superior prequel to this pathetic movie.</fullReview>

A spectacular story bringing back a very claustrophobic feel the original had. David Fincher directed this perfectly and if you have seen the 1991 assembly-cut on the quadrilogy it really opens up the plot into more detail an helps you understand what happens. This is a brilliant film underrated by most. Ripleys death scene at the end was poor how could she hold the thing after its just bust through her ribs and out her stomach????? Interesting how all of the criminals seem to be English well stereo-type English anyway. David Finchers direction is superb. The dark, evil tone of the film was set perfectly by him. This film is a very underrated piece of cinema. The acting was very strong as was the soundtrack. Something about this film just set it out from the rest. All in all a superb film and the second best in the Alien franchise. Go back out and give it a watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always thought that Alien 3 was a major letdown from the first two movies, until I saw the Assembly Cut, and I loved it. I understood all the characters better, and was depressed when they died off one by one.The acting by everyone was much better, and the screenplay made more sense. The action in this movie was better, and for everyone who complained that this movie had little action, the new extended fire sequence adds alittle more action to the movie.This version should've been released in 1992, and I'm pretty sure that if it did, the reviews would be MUCH better than what it got. I highly encourage everyone to watch the Assembly Cut of this movie, because you will enjoy it a lot better than the Theatrical Version that is out now.</fullReview>

After re-watching Fight Club and Se7en recently, I remembered that there was an Alien movie directed by David Fincher and thought holy cow, I gotta re-watch that one. Alien 3 definitely gets way better when you're older. As a kid, I just remember it being dark, gloomy, slow and boring compared to Aliens. It matures with age. I was riveted from beginning to end, and I was surprised how unpredictable and surprising the kills were! Some bits really surprised and shocked me as people were picked off. Ripley looks so hard and cool with the shaved head look too, you don't see female heroes like that anymore, just women like Angelina Jolie in "Salt". It also reminded me of the dark, gritty, gloomy graphic novels I like - it looks like a living breathing graphic novel. I only realised after watching it that I'd seen the Special Edition that restores extra scenes that David Fincher wanted in there - I must recommend the Special Edition, without these scenes ( http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alien+3+scenes&amp;aq=f ) I can imagine the film would feel shallower and rushed.**spoiler**I also liked the idea that the Alien wouldn't touch Ripley because it knew she was breeding the Queen. It is an extremely dark film though especially how we have to sit through an autopsy of Newt within the first 15 minutes! The way the countdown is happening to the arrivial of the Weylon-Utani "rescue team" reminded me of the plot of the recent Sam Rockwell film "Moon". **end of spoiler**Wow, all I can say I really enjoyed it a lot, and surprised at the dreadful reviews on IMDb. I think Fincher takes way too much stick for this one. Compared to the Alien movies that followed, this is easily a masterpiece. You're gonna hate me for saying this but I haven't enjoyed Aliens as much when I've seen it recently, I found Alien 3 had more depth to the characters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best alien movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies I've seen (special edition 2003) has the best photography and soundtrack of the Alien franchise. Many say that alien and aliens are the best, but none was so dark and sinister like alien 3. The cast is exceptional especially Golic, who is my favorite character in the film, Alex Thomson deserved an Oscar for photography, as well as Elliot Goldenthal for the soundtrack. David Fincher has shown in his first film because it is one of the best directors of today at least the fox knew that he would become, maybe had not ruined his film cutting essential parts of the film. Another factor that contributed to the failure of the film in the U.S. was that the film was very depressing and dark that ended up taking the audience by surprise that he expected a direct sequence of aliens, which did not happen, Fincher went further and kill the most charismatic characters of the james cameron movie(well done)This movie is a classic and one day will get the recognition it deserves. note 10/10 this movie someday Will be recognized as the classic it is.Note 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the complete opposite of Aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which is a reason why this movie is hated so much. Even though Alien 3 is much closer to the intent of the original movie. Aliens turned Alien into a neat action/sci-fi flick with a bunch of simple characters and moronic catch-phrases, and Alien 3 takes it to the opposite extreme. It's a dark thriller, not an action flick.Unfortunately it suffers from some big drawbacks. The sound mix is awful. For Example when Ripley is whispering you can barely make out what she's saying, so you turn the sound up and that's when a large explosion goes off and blows out your speakers. The effects hold up rather poorly. Also, every time they build up a character they kill them 5 minutes later. Leaving you with a bunch of characters you don't really care about.There are some great moments in this movie, and the cinematography is great, but it could have been so much better. Fincher said it was only 25% of what he wanted, and it shows. Maybe if the studio hadn't screwed around with the script and the editing, trying to dumb down the movie, this could have been great. Unfortunatley it's not, and is just slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make no mistake; Alien 3 has flaws, all of which are right up on the screen for you to see and hear. Noted for having a script which was being written alongside principle photography - it shows: Dialogue swings from great to terrible in a heartbeat, identikit prisoners suddenly start to develop a glimmer of character.....then vanish without a trace. Vincent Ward's original idea sounded brilliant but gutless suits saw fit to butcher it and force out a rushed lovechild of the first two films (one alien/bigger group of humans). The best example of the problematic script comes when Dillon asks Ripley how she got impregnated by the alien and she replies with; "I don't know, in hypersleep I guess." For a franchise that had already built an established mythology that simply wasn't good enough. I saw it when I was fifteen (just managed to pass for eighteen) and even then I could tell it had problems.......but I absolutely loved it.All these negative reviews are understandable but have any of you seen the restored version? Probably not. If you still haven't seen this film then ONLY watch that version as the original cut has the biggest plot hole of all time. I feel that with this newer version Alien 3 can be enjoyed for what it is: Dark, viciously nihilistic, visually stunning, atmospheric and a great standalone sci-fi film. No, it doesn't sit very well with Alien and Aliens, and Fincher was obviously up against it the whole time, but a poor film? No. Too much hard work and style is present and correct for that to be true. You people do disappoint me so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, brooding movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this move; it exemplified everything that an Alien movie should be composed be; fear, confusion and death, with the underlying threat of the bitch itself. The very fact that Newt and Hicks are bumped off at the beginning is the gun-blast to the race; it shows immediately that Fincher isn't afraid to 'take out' characters, unlike most other action/thrill/horror films. This film took the genre back to its roots; Aliens was a gung-ho splash, and strayed too far from the ideology and concept that Alien stands for; being hunted with no sanctuary. Insanity is another medium that Fincher expressed; whether it be the wails of the manic-depressive Golic or Dillion's Christian Fundmanetalist brew, the composition of the characters is rich and diverse. Weaver is excellent as the tired Ripley, who has been pushed so far by the menace she no longer cares for her life. And the prisoners - you actually feel sorry for the (pretty nasty) skinheads when they get picked off, one by one. Esepcially when they dedicate themselves to destroy the Alien. The gradual deterioration from order to brutal anarchy is both subtle and hideous, and can be compared to a futuristic Lord of the Flies. You, the viewer, is fully aware that the system will collapse under the Alien, and can only watch as the inmates suffer blow after deadly blow.And the ending; what an ending! The very fact that Morse is the only survivor shows just how unpredictable this film is; I don't know about you, but I expected '85, Dillion and Ripley to survive. And thats why I love this move; it defies stereotypical hero survival. The very fact the prisoners team up to kill the 'dragon' at the expense of their own lives is symbolic of human courage that exists within everyone, that co-operation is the only thing that can redeem mankind.Overall, this film is dark, brooding and thoroughly fulfilling. The chase scenes in the lead-works are worthy of a mention of themselves; a mix between adrenaline and hysteria as we see the raw fear of the hunted Convicts. People don't like the third installment because they do not appreciate that this film is a dark portrayal of human nature and must be seen with an open-mind rather than bitter comparison to the other movies. Alien 3 is a triumph in all aspects.</fullReview>

I hope you all understand what movie I'm talking about-Fight club. But this one..... is way too bad.. for fincher of course.It's very moody and gloomy and depressive... of course fincher has tendency to direct such type of movies... I mean fight club and seven are quite depressive and moody too... but we are talking about alien right? this must be an action movie.. sci-fi action, it must not be a movie you should think about. it must be like two previous movies. just entertaining. but this one is not. The only excuse for fincher is that this is his first movie and I'm glad that he compensated this failure by such masterpieces as seven and fight club.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am constantly miffed at the lack of respect this film gets; in my opinion, it has an unsettling mood and atmosphere that supersedes its two predecessors, both of which were outstanding. But "Alien 3" shows that David Fincher, though it was his directorial debut, is a very polished filmmaker. Fury 161 is an abysmal place, one that gives a final challenge to Ellen Ripley. It is grungy and isolated, and its denizens are insipid. In other words, it is the perfect setting for the death of the "perfect organism." What "Alien 3" lacked -- at least in the eyes of those who found it to be a disappointment -- was the Cameronesque aesthetics of "Aliens" and the claustrophobic sense of terror that distinguished the original. It instead reflects its heroine, who is a prisoner much like the inhabitants of Fury, and desires not an escape but merely an end. The film's cohesion with the remainder of the trilogy has always been scrutinized, but unfairly so. It is dissimilar to "Aliens," but that film also scarcely resembles its prequel. The "Alien" trilogy, because it is so eclectic in employing the talents of three different directors, is ahead of the "Star Wars" films as my favorite three-pack; it is diverse and uneven, but it's reflective of Ripley's journey from the Nostromo all the way to the fire which engulfs her body at the end of "Alien 3." In short, "Alien 3" takes a critical beating because it did not meet expectations. Perhaps over time, people who initially found fault in it will see what a truly excellent film this really is. As for "Resurrection," well, it should have stayed on the cutting-room floor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustratingly dull, devoid of suspense, and lacks the fleshed out, likable characters of its predecessors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise behind Alien 3 is interesting: Ripley is the only survivor when her ship crash lands on a prison planet full of murderers and rapists while an alien that somehow survived from Ripley's cashed ship starts wreaking havoc on the inmates. The scary thing is that there are no weapons on this planet. It's a throwback to the suspense of the first movie where all they had was a flamethrower, except in Alien 3 they don't even have that. So as you can assume, they're f*cked. Well unfortunately, so is this movie. It's really bad, and it pains me to say it; even the assembly cut. David Fincher disowns this movie because of the constant studio interference, but even then the worst part of the movie is its script. It's horrendous. Apparently they were doing rewrites as they were shooting the movie and you can tell. None of the characters are relatable (sans Ripley of course), and any time they start to build a character, they kill them off soon after. They're all one-dimensional to the point that it's impossible to care when the fifteen nameless bald guys get slaughtered, partially because you can't even tell them apart. It feels haphazardly thrown together. The pacing is terrible - it's slow and never gains any momentum. There's also nothing quotable in this movie. Nothing. The first two movies had countless quotable lines. This movie has exposition and boring conversations to fill in the gaps between the alien attacks. The alien itself looks like ass - they show it running around a couple times and it looks horrifically bad. They also show POV shots of the alien hunting these guys down which sucks away all the suspense. How can I be afraid of something when I know where it is the whole time? The atmosphere itself is drab and dark, which I wouldn't be opposed to if the movie itself wasn't so boring.On a positive note, the acting is quite good. Sigourney Weaver is great as usual, the preacher and the doctor (the two characters they try to flesh out) are very good. Even the nameless dumb bald guys are decent. The problem is when they say words. The dialogue is excruciatingly bad and the plot is a mess. Ripley isn't nearly as badass as she used to be; I don't care about anyone else so everything they say is just a waste of time. Because of this the movie feels like it's three hours long. The ending is okay I guess; I like how Lance Henriksen was used, and there are a couple scenes that showed promise. But as a whole, it's physically draining to watch. It's especially painful watching it after Alien and Aliens - both of which were riveting from beginning to end - and this dull piece of crap comes along and sucks the life right out of you. In short, Alien 3 is exhaustingly bad. I recommend this only to Alien completists, and even then you'd probably want to forget this one ever happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*This review may contain spoilers* With each installment, the Alien saga kept surprising me. "Alien" was suspense, "Aliens" was action. "Alien 3" was however, something different. It was the mind, the mental factors that played a key role in this one.The USS Solaco experiences a fire and sends an escape pod containing it's passengers to a nearby planet, Fiorina 'Fury' 161, which largely consists of a maximum security prison. Once awake after a hard crash, Ripley finds that her companions have not survived. If her grief wasn't enough, seemingly the horrendous creature managed to come back in Ripley's life once again. A last battle is bound to happen from the point she's aware of the Alien, at least in the time period she's in now...There is only one fact why people seem to really bash this movie: the death of two key characters in "Aliens". Like in most cases, it comes down to opinion of how the audience feels about the events surrounding these two characters. Personally I found it be a daring move, because it allows to expose the true predicament of Ripley.Supported by solid performances, the real plot of the film emerges: the Alien basically has become a curse for Ripley. She'll never truly be rid of the nightmare unless she truly faces it. This allows the film to flow and have some pivotal and memorable scenes (chops to the revelation of an Alien embryo, the hallway chase and the heartstopping final).All in all, this is a good Alien picture. In my honest opinion, it's not the best in the franchise, but emotionally and psychologically the strongest.</fullReview>

It was hard that newt died, etc., but that was part of this story. I can see how it might have less of a mass appeal. And maybe how James Cameron made the amazing Aliens movie (one of the best movies of all time), and people expected the same momentum.It's also certainly more in the spirit of the first two rather then the following sequel.

		<shortDescription>Deserves a second look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally reacted strongly against this film, and I think it's for the same reason that many fans of the series did at the time. Alien was a landmark film and was a certain type of genre. Then Aliens was released and proved to be a faster-paced and exciting thrill of a film. I enjoyed Aliens so much as an action-horror film that I must have watched it well over fifty times. So, you can imagine my surprise when I went to see Alien 3 in the theater, only to find out that the characters that everyone loved from Aliens were dead or dying. After re-watching Alien, Aliens, and Alien 3 again and taking a good close look at the details, I realized that Alien 3 is actually a return to the tone, mood, and nightmarish terror of the first film. If fact, technically speaking, Alien 3 is more true to the series than Aliens is. I'll give Cameron credit for closely following the plot points set by Alien (awaken from sleep, discovery of organism, first encounter, outmatched by organism, hunter becomes the hunted through conduit system, seemingly kill organism, creature returns for an encore, finally kill creature, return to sleep, roll credits). Great, I get that. However, Aliens is an action film that takes a few liberties with the Aliens (introduces a queen and bulks up the formerly sleek alien design). It also initially leaves off the creature design credit for H.R. Giger. Now, we move forward to Alien 3. This film is dark, filled with suspense, features vast sets, and a creature that is more like the one in the first film than the one in the second. Characters are once again stripped of sophisticated weaponry and put into a situation where human must truly struggle against xenomorph. It's the sense of helplessness and hopelessness that is a hallmark of Alien films. Ripley's defiance in such situations is what defines Ripley's character. And it is this that show up in spades in the first and third films. As for the cartoonish fourth film, I barely acknowledge it (for a variety of reasons). So, those who were disappointed in Alien 3, I recommend that you at least give it one more look. First though, re-watch Alien and note the elements that make it what it is. Then keep in mind that -- in real life -- bad things happen to good people. Alien should be the stuff of nightmares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect, but misunderstood and underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love all four Alien films. Each are so unique and different from one another. Yes, they are all installments in the same series, but each director managed to bring something new to the series. Newcomer David Fincher had the daunting task of creating a film that was supposed to live up to the brilliant previous efforts of Ridley Scott and James Cameron.Does he succeed? Well, in many respects, he does. This Alien film is much more like the first one than it's action packed sequel, and I'm glad the decision was made not to make an action packed rehash of "Aliens". The biggest problem with Alien 3 is it's inability to prompt genuine suspense or fright. The scenes where the Xenomorph attacked the prisoners were mind-numbingly predictable, and the early CG effects were far less effective than the puppetry and stunt-men in costume from the previous films.It's biggest strength is it's human apocalypse angle. This is much more fleshed out in the superior Assembly Cut, my preferred cut of the film. The dark tone and grit is wonderful, and you feel true empathy for the character of Ripley, once again brilliantly portrayed by the incomparable Sigourney Weaver. This film is probably considered worse than it's predecessors because it wasn't what audiences were expecting, especially after the action-fest that was "Aliens". They were expecting something along those lines, not the bleak and depressing human journey presented here. But when viewed in it's own light, it stands quite strong, and is a worthy addition to the Alien Legacy.</fullReview>

I think this scares off people who see "Alien3" as the first movie of the Alien Legacy ( like me ) to see the rest! ( I recently saw all the Alien movies, so I got over it... )  LITTLE SPOILER COMING UP...Besides, NOTHING seems to make sense: how did the people on the ship - including Ripley - get impregnated? The Queen who chased them at the end of the previous movie wasn't able to lay eggs inside the ship since she ripped off her abdomen in "Aliens". And the dead of Ripley is not so pleasant as it looks. If you ask me, there was no reason at all to make "Alien3". They should've better made "Resurrection" ride away. Since that one starts a few centuries later, Ripley would have died anyhow...The fx are good, the fights really tough and the actors are fine but the movie is not worth watching. Too bad that when you buy the Legacy Box, this one is included. A good advice: if you do wanna buy the whole Legacy, buy each movie separately. You'll enjoy it even more without "Alien3".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the reconstructed version is a vast improvement even without Fincher's personal supervision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For quite a number of years, between my friends and I was an on-going if minor argument about the favorite Alien movie. Most said the James Cameron sequel, and one or two would pipe in on Ridley Scott's original. Only one would stick up for the 115 minute film of Alien 3 (mostly out of preferences for the characters and the ideas behind having a lack of weapons). Unfortunately, in the theatrical version one can immediately sense the lack of someone really behind the wheels at times, despite the production design still being as top-notch as the previous films (and no wonder; Fincher, on his first studio assignment, practically disowned the theatrical cut after it was taken away from him). Luckily, with the advent of DVD and the 'special edition', a 'reconstructed' version of the film has been put together, including over half an hour of missing footage. While the reports stated this was not a real 'director's cut' (as Fincher didn't supervise the re-edit), according to the producers this comes as close as we're going to get it.And luckily the full version, with its story pumped up with not necessarily back-stories to the supporting cast (all prisoners on a kind of dilapidated mining colony on a remote planet), but just to give more depth to the peril that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is in. The basic outline is this- Ripley, after surviving the hazards of the climax of Aliens, winds up on the planet as an outsider through and through. The colony (including good-to-excellent character actors like Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance, Pete Postletwhaite, and Paul McGann) is full of a nasty bunch, some more-so than others, who have no idea what Ripley has brought along with her on the ship. This then sets up what we might expect from the rest of the film; riveting action sequences, tough dialog, and a climax that is surprising and fulfilling.When looking at the theatrical cut, the look of the film is all in-tact and rather mind-blowing; Norman Reynolds production design is loaded with texture and the grittiness of space that is constant through all the films (though still unique); HR Gieger's alien designs (sometimes for some unconventional bits of business, to say the least) rattle the mind as much as in the first film; Alex Thomson's cinematography is a little relentless at times, but suiting so for the film. Unfortunately, what falls apart is the story, and the thin, trite qualities in the supporting cast, and when looked at in relation to the first film and even the second (which is more of a class unto itself), is pedestrian and very much in-line with something Hollywood. You can sense that there is Fincher's presence in the scenes and ideas, but also that what was cut out wasn't necessarily 'extra fat' to the story.In this reconstructed version, however, it feels more epic in scope, and some things have been changed (i.e. the cow now a dog for the Alien 'birth'), and a lot has been added. To go into everything that has been added would take too long, but to make it short not only do we get a better science-fiction style story, in the end it adds to the effectiveness of the chases down tight corridors, fights, etc. Some of it is even a little more disturbing this time around (an 'attempt' at Ripley by some of the prisoners is as frightening as the Alien), an added plus to the mood of the production design and visual effects. The ending is still a little overtly dramatic, but also Weaver's performance is given more clarity; it's not just seeing her with a shaved head that's worth watching the film, she's given some scenes where she out-acts everyone around her, with her strengths of subtlety and patience as an actor.I would even recommend watching this reconstructed version, if you can, even if you've never seen the theatrical cut. And for those who love the original version anyway (there are things about the studio cut that make the film under-rated if still flawed), you get more for your buck, kind of like Apocalypse Now Redux or something. I still wonder what the director now thinks of this footage put back in, if it comes closer to his vision, albeit through the interference and meddling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both the original cut and the AC versions of this film aren't as horrible as people would like to think. Yes there is one major plot hole (how the hell did that egg end up there and how did it impregnate the dog/ox) However the movie itself plot hole aside wasn't half bad, the characters were all really good, Ripley's character development was great and her personality was much darker, and with good reason, everything she loved was lost because of the damn aliens. Though all of the characters are y chromo rapists, and murderers doesn't mean you can't care about them, especially Dutton's character, that moment when he decides to stay and hold the alien at bay to protect Ripley was just well played and added to the drama and loss of this character who earlier stated he was 'a murderer and rapist of women' and is now sacrificing himself to keep one alive.However there are some gaping problems in this movie that I won't cover because, well everyone knows what those problems are (no not the death of Hicks and Newt it wasn't that bad they died) But the films director should not be the one held responsible for allegedly ruining the franchise (something I think resurrection did) they threw him onto the film and began having them shoot it without a script. Everything Fincher wanted was tossed aside by Fox, hence the reason the guy despises this film and won't do any commentary or interviews based on the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the theatrical version a few times before and never had the feeling that there would have been any problems with it. I always considered the third installment as a dark, thrilling Alien movie, absolutely deserving the Alien logo. Now I'm just trough the assembly cut, it was great too (wouldn't pick one).I read a few reviews and people are tearing the movie apart, usually for no obvious reason so I went researching. Reading all the trivia and the horrible conditions of production, I probably could understand that Fincher nearly bailed out (does not go for the original writers, who are now writing bogus as AVP), still, the end-result never left any obvious signs of the mess.Sigourney Weaver totally owns the movie as doing a seamless performance really showing heart and rock-solid professionalism, congratulations for that. The location is ideal for an Alien movie, a dark and remote labyrinth, what do you want more? The whole thing looks beautiful due to the top notch cinematography, which I'd consider as outstanding for '92. The monster effects are great as ever, but the "new" special effects are quite gross in certain shots (especially around the final). I think it is rather the blue-screen technology that looks messy, not the basic CGI which is actually okay (concidering '92 it's fine).It is obvious that Alien3 somewhat differs from its predecessors in terms of style. However, I find the new angle a very good and brave choice - Fincher does a dark thriller. An aspect that is usually missing in modern science-fiction/horror flicks.Regarding the characters, the minimal depth of the supporting cast is characteristic for the franchise, I wouldn't go there to mess with that, though I could imagine more interesting fellows then a group of religious space prisoners. Guess that's up to you. Otherwise, I found the character of Clerance very interesting and terrificly played by Charles Dance, actually the whole cast is pretty decent.Now, after the outstanding original - groundbreaking and still unmatched in style - and the epic sequel, I do not break out in euphoria seeing this movie, but it was a very good and fresh one with some great highs and minor lows, just fine for closing the original Alien TRILOGY - as I consider part 4 with genetically engineered superpower Ripley rather as a new generation of the franchise, along with the horrible AVP stuff.</fullReview>

Sure it can't hold a candle to the first two installments, or the fourth for that matter. But that doesn't mean the film is unsuccessful in all of its attempts. Alien 3 succeeds in being the most hardened, soulless, and overall depressing film in the series. All of the other Alien films end on a happy ending, but with Alien 3, there is no hope. Moody and dark as hell -- this one is probably just for the fans, but I dug it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people think I'm crazy when I say Alien 3 was a good movie. This film is like the black sheep of the series, villified even though it enhanced the series in ways other than action and dialogue. Charles Dutton was as good as any other character in this series, and he was probably the strongest character among all of those in the series (behind Ripley of course). For a first film, David Fincher brought a lot of great ideas to the table. The "Alien POV" shots were awesome, bringing a disorienting shot which inflicted genuine fear. A truly unappreciated film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie wasn't terrible in and of itself...I think if it hadn't followed the fantastic Alien and then Aliens it wouldn't be judged quite so harshly. I saw it as a kind of return to the first movie, with the largely defenseless alien-fodder floundering about in fear, getting picked off one by one by a frightening alien creature which is obviously superior in both strength and speed. The movie looked very good I thought, the acting was good, the story was not bad either, yet I was disappointed in a way I wouldn't have been if I hadn't first seen the other two because after watching the first two installations unfold, I was looking for the third (traditionally the last installation in a series unless you're looking to make 'Alien 4 - This Time It's Personal'...which unfortunately they actually did, thus tipping the series into foolishness) to build on the other two and send it out of the park - I thought for sure the third installation would be the horrible thing we've been threatened with in the first two movies - that the 'Company' finally got its wish and brought the Aliens back to Earth for bioweapons research, where they escaped into the populace and...ah well. It wasn't bad as it is...but if you're looking for a movie to bring the franchise home and raise the bar yet again, you'd be sorely disappointed - this is a serviceable sci-fi horror that reads a lot like the first, minus the originality.</fullReview>

Hicks was the love interest of Riply and Newt was supposed to replace Riply's dead daughter. If that was not bad enough we have to witness Newt's autopsy. Then just a Riply starts to trust Bishop at the end of Aliens, his evil creator (played by Lance Hendriksen)turns up. Fincher may of directed great films like Seven, Fight Club and The Game but it will be a long time before I forgive him for Alien 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Alien 3" is considered to be the darkest out of all 4 films. It picks up where "Aliens" left off and focuses on Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) troubles with her best friend, the xenomorph, who she has a special connection with this time around. After the assault against the aliens on LV-426, Ripley, the little girl Newt, Corporal Hicks and Bishop the Android are on their way home, but an egg has been planted on the Sulaco (presumably by the Queen before her death) and the facehugger that emerges from it starts a fire. Ripley and her companions get ejected into an EEV, which crash lands on Fiorina 161, a barren planet inhabited by murderers and rapists who now turn to God. Hicks, Newt and Bishop die, which leaves Ripley all alone waiting to be rescued. When some inmates start disappearing, Ripley fears an alien has landed on the planet with her and she was right. With limited weapons, she teams up with the convicts to kill it. She also has to make a life or death decision because of her very special connection to the alien species as well. This film was a HUGE turn around from the previous film, it is dark and slow moving, the survivors are killed in the first 5 minutes and Ripley has a shaved head. The convicts were annoying and they must have spewed the F-word at least 100 times throughout the whole movie. The alien was also different from the others, it ran on all 4 legs and it protected Ripley. This is a good entry in the series, but it is my least favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Sorry for some spelling-misstakes** (Please read my reviews of ''Alien'' and ''Aliens'' too) This is the worst Alien-movie. Fincher tries to mix the dark feeling in the first movie with the 100 % action of ''Aliens''. I'm sorry Dave, it's simply doesn't work. OK, OK. I can admit it. It is entertaining at some points, but it is just because ''Alien 3'' is more of a copy of the other movies. Now, whats wrong with that picture? Everything is stolen from the other movies and you don't feel as amused of anything any more. The actors was really, really good but that can't save the bad script and the direction. I ( as a pure movielover ) will forever be gratefull for Fincher's job with ''Se7en''. This is though not one of his better movies.</fullReview>

The only thing you need to see in Alien 3 is the last 15 minutes so you won't be completely lost when watching the 4th installment - Alien Ressurection.

It's so moody, downbeat and violent and treats the audience with intelligence and a sense of maturity, say, missing from Resurrection and AVP.The special edition does well to cover up most loose ends and is much closer to Fincher's original vision. Alien 3 is visually stunning, still to this day, one of a few flaws is the awful mo-motion that is incredibly dated, but bar that, the Alien looks really cool.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good on many levels, but not the best of the ALIEN films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: DEFINITE SPOILERS.ALIEN 3 is a great example of how too much meddling ruins a promising movie. This movie went thru so many re-writes and director changes it's a wonder it ever got made at all. 20th Century Fox meddled until their meddlers got sore. I can't believe someone thought a wooden planet full of monks was plausible. Luckily, this was changed into a max security prison filled with "YY" men, rapists, pedophiles, sociopaths, serial killers, you name it. Ripley and the survivors from ALIENS are in hypersleep when a fire breaks out aboard the Sulaco, and the escape lifeboat is jettisoned and crash lands on Fiorina 161, the prison planet.One of the problems I had with this film is the fact that since everyone's head is shaved, and almost everyone is British, I had trouble differentiating one character from another. There weren't enough closeups, so many of them simply looked too "alike" for me to get to know characters. Yet everyone did a marvelous job acting, and characters such as Warden Andrews (Brian Glover), Golic (Paul McGann), and Mr. Aaron (Ralph Brown), AKA "85" were amusing as they tried to deal with Ripley's presence in their orderly world. Charles S. Dutton gives a great performance as Dillon, the "leader" of these prisoners, who are trying to live lives of order, atonement, and godliness after committing such heinous crimes. The other problem I had is: how did 2 eggs get aboard the escape pod? How??? Did Queen Bitch lay them before her last attempt to kill Ripley, Newt and Bishop??? If you've seen the film, you know what happened with egg #1, but in the theatrical version, victim #2 is a dog, and in the "Assembly Edition," an ox.Weaver of course is still as commanding as ever, and got an Oscar nom for this portrayal of Ripley. Not because she shaved her head either, but because she gave us even more layers. For the very reasons I was angry about the beginning of the film (the deaths of Hicks and Newt), we got to see a Ripley who has lost so much. She had developed a very deep relationship with Newt, which would have balmed the pain of losing her own daughter (outliving her due to 57 years of hypersleep drifting in space), and she had had an undeniable chemistry and friendship with Hicks as well. She's lost everyone now, and she's not even afforded more than a few hours of closeness with Clemens (Charles Dance) the prison's chief medical officer. I enjoyed the "Assembly Edition" so much more than the original cut. There was a much better look at the individual characters. Even though the ox was a clumsier animal than a Rottweiler to use as the unlikely host to a chestbuster, it was interesting to me. Having an alien more "doglike" than humanoid was very interesting as a twist. I also liked the addition of Junior (Holt McCallany, an actor I've liked since seeing him on CSI Miami) attempting to redeem himself after that horrible scene of Ripley nearly being raped. Another standout is Danny Webb as Morse, who after being hateful to Ripley for bringing lots of problems, one in particular, with her when she crashed, ends up a hero.Again, not my favorite, but as long as the "Assembly Ed.) exists, it has its merits, and once you get used to the disappointing beginning, it's quite a good story with great acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy entry in the series that should have concluded it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not a masterpiece like Alien or Aliens, Alien 3 is still quite a good film, and it would have been better if the series had ended here rather than continuing with the absurd Alien: Resurrection, and the even worse Alien vs. Predator films.After the events of Aliens, the supposedly malfunctioning Sulaco launches an escape pod, which crashes on Fiorina 161, a mostly uninhabited planet that has like a smelting facility and prison on it. Hicks and Newt are both killed in the accident, and Bishop is destroyed beyond repair. Ripley is the only survivor. The prison workers take her in, and she is warned that her mere presence will disturb the cycle of the prison and its inmates, all of which are reborn Christians with pasts of rape and murder. A facehugger makes its way from the escape pod, and impregnates an animal in the prison (a dog or a cow, depending on whether you watch the theatrical cut or the assembly cut), which soon births an alien that wreaks havoc in the prison and Ripley and the inmates attempt to stop it, and the fact is that the prison has little to no weapons complicates trying to kill it. Ripley soon discovers she has been impregnated with an alien queen, and the alien will not kill her because of it, giving her a morbid edge to stop it.Sigourney Weaver's performance is stellar. The highlight of her acting is in the scene where an autopsy is performed on Newt's corpse. Her facial expression and the sadness she emotes is fantastic, she really sells the tragedy her character has gone through and makes you feel really sorry for her. The supporting cast is all around good, the best of them being Charles Dance and Charles S. Dutton.The new quadruped alien is quite cool, and it's interesting to watch it's behavioral differences from the aliens in the previous two films. It isn't as sadistic and calculating as the alien in the first film, and being a singular alien, it doesn't have the hive mentality the aliens in the second film. This one is more quick to kill, and does as such more violently than before, possibly to thin out the amount of people who may harm the alien queen when it's born.There are some aspects of the film that beg for an explanation, most glaringly how exactly an alien egg got on the Sulaco. It seems to work of the alien queen, but it doesn't make much sense how or when she could have put it there. The assembly is quite a bit better than the theatrical cut, but there are two things I prefer from the theatrical cut, the first of which being that the alien comes from a dog rather than a cow (which makes more sense given how it moves), and the second of which being how the alien queen bursts from Ripley's chest as they both fall into the furnace.Quite a few scripts were written for Alien 3, all of which were vastly different. William Gibson's script was little more than a more EXTREEEEEEME!!! version of Aliens, which would've been pretty lame and not at all interesting. Eric Red's script was horribly bad, containing several plot holes and ridiculous plot points (it had an alien chicken, believe it or not). David Twohy's and Vincent Ward's scripts were interesting, but Twohy's script was too divorced from the previous films, and Ward's script had a major concept that didn't fit in with the series at all (a planet constructed of wood). Aspects of Twohy's and Ward's scripts were combined and rewritten into a different version of Alien 3 by Walter Hill &amp; David Giler and Larry Ferguson that ended up as the finished film, and I'd say what got made was the best of any of the scripts.David Fincher, the director of Alien 3, has actually since disowned the movie due to his terrible experience of actually making it. His troubles ranged from constant studio interference to the pressure of being the successor to Ridley Scott and James Cameron, and given that it was his first feature length film and he had to deal with so much making it, his directorial work on it is pretty impressive.It has its flaws, but Alien 3 is ultimately a good movie. It keeps with the tone of the series, adding some new and interesting aspects and conclusively wraps up the story arc of Ripley and the aliens. It's too bad the series had to continue and venture into such lame territory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor old Ripley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Alien, Ripley was the sole survivor of the Nostromo when it inadvertently brought brought a murderous parasitic xenomorph off a distant planet. In Aliens, Ripley was prevailed upon to return to that planet only to discover the xenomorphs decimating a terraforming colony: Ripley, the child Newt, a single marine, and half of artificial person Bishop were the sole survivors, journeying home on the Sulaco. As Alien3 starts, the Sulaco has ejected its escape pods onto a prison planet and Ripley is again the sole survivor. And goes what? Yes, a xenomorph hitchhiker starts wreaking its havoc among the prison inmates.David Fincher kicks off his always interesting career as feature director with this not entirely successful third entry in the Alien franchise. While it wraps up Ripley's story with a satisfactory, if not happy, resolution (and as such, brings the original trilogy to a conclusion - subsequent movies, including Alien: Resurrection can be regarded as afterthoughts), it is not as satisfying as it should be.I'm not entirely sure why this is. Perhaps it is the setting, perhaps it is the characters. Neither has much warmth and it is difficult to find a character to identify with other than Charles Dance and Ripley herself. And even Ripley leans much more towards snivelling victim than the ass-kicking survivor of the earlier films. And the xenomorph, interestingly demonstrating DNA adaptation towards non-human lifeforms, is delivered care of fairly unsatisfactory CGI.It is worth watching, but it disappoints.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Alien 3" became David Fincher's debut on the big screen, which definitely opened the door for him to direct stellar movies like "Se7en" and more. When you take the production with constant changes, delays and conflicts into mind it is not surprising the result becomes uneven. After the masterpieces of the first and second movies one cannot help but look at the theatrical cut as unfinished, thin and something that could have been so much more. (It is redeemed with the later re-releases).I still don't view "Alien 3" as a bad film, the plot has a point, the actors do well given the time they are given on screen, Weaver gives a great performance as always and the real enemy is present - the Company. Sadly enough key characters are killed off in a quick, bad manner which makes the remaining ones blur together.Overall the ending makes for a fitting conclusion for the series overall, the circus of the 4th film should be considered stand-alone. Some people described the end as a loss, to me it's a win, the real enemy is defeated (the company rather than the creature) which gives the movie a redeeming factor. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien and Aliens is Overrated, and Aliens 3 Underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've done a simple review about the two first movies, saying they're overrated for a series of reasons. Simply, they're not as perfect as people say.But Aliens 3 ain't that bad as people say neither.In Aliens 3, the black and blue atmosphere is shifted for a black and yellow. This represents better a prison and the best part: YOU CAN SEE WHATS HAPPENING ON THE MOVIE, what was the worse about the first movies (that was not scary, it was confusing).Of course ain't just that what makes me say Aliens 3 is underrated. But its because the first movies aren't that amazing. Aliens 3 had the capability to surprise me, what didn't happened watching its predecessors. It has lots more fun and action, and since Alien and Aliens didn't scared me a s**t, why would I consider the series as a thriller? Alien 3 has some similarities with first and second movie, even though it is a whole different one. By that I mean: alien will keep killing for fun, such as the company trying to protect it. But except that you will almost don't recognize it.In aliens 1 and 2, producers have gave to good actors forgettable characters, and in Alien 3, producers have gave to forgettable actors, pretty good characters. Even though those actors doesn't give us they best performances.As in Alien 3 as in Alien and Aliens, soundtrack doesn't do much beyond follow the film, so, don't expect to much from it.One problem I've had to notice in Alien 3 is the free gore stupid parts, like someone exploding when crashing into a real slow fan. We could pass without this.Since the first movies didn't leave any of those character in my memory i'm pretty sure I'm gonna remember some from Alien 3, because they were different, more original i'd say.Alien 3 has its issues, I must say that, but i can't talk about them without leaving you spoilers, but if people say those extremely boring first movies are so F*****g amazing, why tha hell would Alien 3 be so bad?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The neglected Alien isn't as awful as you think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In truth newbie director (at the time) David Fincher's Alien 3 is a far more faithful sequel to the original film than Aliens was, which was essentially an especially brilliant space creature shoot 'em up when you think about it. Alien 3 shares many similar elements with the original, many hapless outmatched victims in a confined space being hunted down by a single-minded killing machine, and despite the undeniable similarities with the first film I think Fincher brings enough new elements and flourishes to the table to make Alien 3 worthwhile, and in snippets compelling viewing ? even though when you think about it all the Alien films are basically space monster films.Taking place immediately, only decades after the events of Aliens ? but decades in hypersleep ? the escape pod harbouring Lt Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Newt, Hicks and Bishop crash-land on Fury 161, a remote prison planet with a staff/inmate population of about 25ish. After all the sh*t they went through in Aliens only Ripley survives, which if you think about it means she would have been infinitely better off declining that mission in the first place as she wisely did initially.Ripley comes to to find that as well as being the only survivor of the last mission, she is now surrounded by various rapists, murderers and plain old nasty types. The fact that the planet is also infested with lice and that all inhabitants must routinely shave their heads bald just seems unfair.The early stages find Ripley coming to terms with her situation and taking steps to discover is there were *other* stowaways on board the escape pod, including a graphic-without-being-graphic autopsy of young deceased Newt, carried out by Fury 161's Doc Clemens (Charles Dance), who Ripley swiftly decides to be one of the only sane and non-dangerous members of her new community, leading to the first scene involving nudie hijinks in an Alien film, even though there is no on screen shenanigans.The remainder of the inmates have not so much as seen a fully functional woman in decades, and some harbour nefarious thoughts toward her ? even when Weaver is mannish to begin with and bald to boot! Sensing this the Head of the facility Andrews immediately requests an evac of Ripley off the planet, and is astonished to find that his request is not only acknowledged but fast tracked.So with the impending pick up looming all that is left is for Ripley to stay put and keep out of the way of those that might do her harm.But that's before the inmates start to go missing.In desperation Ripley consults the remaining half of Bishop who was unceremoniously dumped on a scrap heap, using him to hack into the escape pod's onboard black box to ascertain if they were truly alone. Now if you don't think the fact that the film is called "Alien 3" is a clue to the answer then stop reading this and go and bang your head against the wall for a couple hours.Back to the action; in any case the new lone Alien grows and develops quickly. Very quickly. It soon learns that it is there for one reason only, that being to chew through each and every inhabitant on the prison planet. Hey you gotta stick with what you know I guess.Once Ripley realizes that they are not alone she starts delivering warnings left and right. As is always the case with these films the warnings are taken as they usually are? until the Alien starts a'chomping.The rest of the film has Ripley and the various riff-raff of staff and inmates standing around wondering who is to be picked off next and saying "F*CK" a lot. In fact that word is uttered so frequently and so forcefully in this film that I can't help but wonder if the crew had a competition to see who could deliver the line with the most conviction ? and spittle.Alien 3 is not particularly gory or violent, with a couple of notable exceptions in the latter stages of the film, but even in the early going David Fincher knew that a trickle of blood can go a long way and provoke as many squirms as any graphic on screen violence. There are a great many speeches in this film, with various characters getting their shot at standing up and delivering impassioned demands with impressive musical accompaniment ? often just before they are chomped on. Ripley is a little less 'hands on' in this film, what with only one Alien to face, and a special little secret of her own to deal with.I was impressed with the dinginess and depressing elements of Alien 3, there was none of the flashiness, snappy dialogue or hooky elements of Aliens ? which by no means results in this film being better, just different ? I liked the adherence to tone and the willingness of the actors to get down and dirty, and again the acting is quite solid for a space monster movie.This might be the worst of the first three Alien movies (it slaughters Alien: Resurrection), but it is not the lame duck that the critics and punters have made it out to be over the years.Final Rating ? 8 / 10. A return to the thematic and plot elements of the first Alien means a change of tempo and style, but when considered on its own merits Alien 3 is still a fine ? albeit familiar ? film for fans of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why did everyone expect a happy film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just don't get why everyone expected a standard plot line. I've seen reviews about how no- one likes that Hicks and Newt were killed. (Including Alan Dean Foster).Guess What? Life sucks and those things happen. Ripley has had a child ripped away by circumstance again.... a chance at a life with a good guy, all gone. This is a raw deal and explains a lot about how she deals with this situation. I've heard whingeing about how the male lead (Charles Dance),gets killed... boo hoo, that's life. Why would there be any happy endings here? We are dealing with unbelievably tenacious, vicious, hostile creatures. They are not going to spare you because you matter to the main character, or because American audiences don't like unhappy endings.I've heard that there's not much ''character development''. We are dealing with serial killers, and worse. How much development do you want, before it's too much information? Do you want a blow by blow account of all their terrible childhoods, because their hormonal development wasn't normal? We know as much about them as Ripley does- That's more than enough to get the point at issue. This film is about Ripleys journey, her despair, her courage in the face of final defeat.I think that it was really good considering all the changes and difficulty during filming. You can't get a much worse scenario than trying to make a film in those conditions.People seem to have expected to see a Lassie film, as far as I can see. With the good people of Earth prevailing against the nasty Alien hoard. If you want that, go watch Superman movies.OK this wasn't the best film of all time, but it had plenty of pace, lots of ''oh no! Not again!'' moments, and lots of Alien dribble and blood. What more did you want? It was entertaining enough, plenty of brilliant character actors who were all very watchable as usual.Life is crap in so many places in this world and that's just what we do to each other. People survive dreadful things only to get run over or die from something else that's equally horrible - why shouldn't we show that in films? It's a more realistic Scenario, though the subject matter isn't. Personally, I don't want a candy coated Alien, I like 'em in the raw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strongly disagree with others' reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd resolved to repay my considerable debt to IMDb by confining myself to reviewing movies that didn't yet have IMDb reviews. However, after reading a dozen or so reviews of Alien 3, I write what follows in protest. Background: I watched the first three Alien films when they were released in regular theaters. I've just finished watching all four on a 1920x1080 resolution computer screen, using Bose headphones. I used the headphones partly because my wife (who also has an unaccountable dislike for the Three Stooges) can't stand horror movies, but mostly because the films' sounds coming from various directions are especially effective using them. I agree with the majority of IMDb's reviewers that Alien was a splendid, groundbreaking movie, and that Aliens was that rarity: an even better sequel. It's important to note that in many ways the style, the atmosphere of Aliens differed greatly from that of Alien. But hereafter I part company with other IMDb reviewers. The style and atmosphere of Alien 3 differ greatly from that of the first two: it's much bleaker emotionally, and that works. At first there's only one really sympathetic character besides Ripley, and Ripley is doomed from the start; these things work, too. Several of the initially unsympathetic characters became more and more interesting to me as the movie progressed. However that may have been because I've had a fair amount of direct and indirect experience working with convicts. Sigourney Weaver was, of course, superb and convincing. The main thing is that Alien 3 is a DIFFERENT movie, but in its way also a great one. Marvelous sets. Gloomy, gloomy, gloomy. Marvelous dry, dead-pan humor in places. Marvelous scenes where you know that something awful is going to happen. Even fine music. I give it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great chamber piece ending to a terrific series, and possibly the most underrated sequel of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, Alien 3 is neither as exciting or frightening (albeit commercial) as its predecessors and neither is it resistant to the flaws brought upon it by its studio tampering, but whilst Alien and ALiens essentially just revamped the slasher and action genres, Alien 3 still offers an intriguingly original and unpredictable sci-fi story that belongs to a world of its own. At heart, this franchise is neither about Ripley or the monster but about our fears of a corporate dominated future, and Fincher knew that to follow up the adrenalin rush of Aliens with more action and guns would simply be both repetitive and pointless, instead raising the stakes through smart ideas and human dramas. The angle of the story here then is that if a corporation can own everything from industry, military, penal system and in this case, even religion, then mankind's last hope lies in that of its outsiders ('the lifers who found god at the ass end of space') of whom led by a feminine presence, become the saviours of our world. The film could perhaps be seen as being about a battle of our inner selves fighting against the privatisation of the entirety of outer space (reflected through Fury 161's losing battle with the 'outside elements') Having a more vulnerable Ripley leading these 'lifers' into martyrdom then, is perhaps the greatest feminist statement in cinema history, the sound design blends with score to a stunning level of experimentation and Fincher's gloomy atmospherics (nice heat lighting) are just as cinematic the 50th time around as they are the first. I simply cannot believe that nobody on this message board has ever stood up in defence of this film whilst the unnecessary cartoon cheese fest that was Alien Resurrection (of which ranks alongside Terminator 3 or The Phantom Menace for most shocking destroyer of a great franchise ever) gets more applause than this. Upon further viewings the Theatrical Cut isn't even as flawed as people think it is; the alien is a perfect organism (prioritising the existence of its specie over a singular self), so it would make sense for the queen to have left eggs behind on the Sulaco shortly before facing its own death, and the close up shot of Golic's struggle from the stretcher as the alien approaches him, implies that he DOES die there in the infirmary and his body is suggested to be seen being pulled into the vent. Furthermore, who's to say this film didn't have good characters? Morse, Dillon, Clements, Andrews, Golic, Aaron were all great! Just because a bleakness in tone and story isn't commercially accepted, doesn't mean that it can be defined as a flaw. The last great finger to the corporate led franchising of films and a near masterpiece of atmospherics in my view!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand why Alien 3 got so many negative reviews. First, why kill the young girl that managed to survive in Aliens and who everyone got emotionally attached to? And why kill so soon the most interesting character besides Ripley, that it Clemens? He is the only normal person in this zoo full of paedophiles and rapists. Charles Dance offers a pretty good performance as a well educated doctor with a dark side. The scene in which he performs an autopsy is quite remarkable. He should have stayed alive longer. You don't kill such an important character before the very secondary ones. Also, I can understand the fact that Ripley got infected with a monster gives the movie a more pessimist side. Beside that,there seems to be some inconsistencies. Is it me or the images of the lava cauldrons -or weatherer you wanna call the thing in with Ripley plunges at the end - don't match logically with the large plan of the installations? And the image you see on the monitor when Ripley performs a scan is quite bad. Your cant really see the alien. It's all fuzzy and chaotic. Alien 3 is definitely the darkest and saddest of all four. But still I wouldn't go so far to say that it is a bad film. The atmosphere is well established. The acting is good. There are many gory scenes, especially the one with the fan. As in Alien, there is a sense of permanent menace and claustrophobia. Finally, the new version is way better than the original. It makes more sens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philosophy Seminar From Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, I am a theistic existentialist so, obviously, I have a bias towards the film because the philosophy being poorly presented is existentialism. The film is a disaster. When I saw it in 1993 people were getting up and walking out all through the picture. By the time Ripley does her molten samurai thing, there were 5 people, other than my friends and I, out of 200. First, it is not scary not even a little. The scene where the candles are being blown out is as scary as this gets which is not much. If you are looking to be scared watch the original or even ALIENS. Second, as a great reviewer before me wrote, they are interchangeable W&amp;^%$#@ as he put it so well. The audience could not tell who was who; frankly, who cares? What you get is a bunch of bad acting bald guys running around in what looks like a factory basement.The Alien camera finished the movie off. If we know where the alien is, well, that kind of wrecks the suspense now doesn't it? Please, we want the Alien popping out and grabbing people. Yes, I know he grabs Clemmons but come on the rest of the picture we have bald guys running with the Alien camera behind them. WHY? The cast is just awful; they kill off the best two actors the doctor and Clemmons and we are left with 85, Ripley and Dutton. Dutton does a good job in the movie but his subordinating to Ripley feels so phony; look, he rules over all these men, makes it clear he hates women, why would he let her be in charge of anything? It is like ALIENS, why would Marines take orders from Ripley and Newt; I do not think so. Look, I am a philosopher, I read Kant, Sartre and Nietzsche but is this the place for some kind of half ass existentialism class? Also, to convey the hostility of the world we get some real ugly, cruel images like Newt's autopsy; it was necessary philosophically to relate the hostility of the natural universe but it really makes an ugly depressing picture. We are also treated to images of Newt dead in her cryotube screaming, how lovely! Yes, then Dillion starts on the meaninglessness of life the other central tenet and how choice defines meaning; I get all this but IS THIS REALLY THE PLACE FOR A PHILOSOPHY SEMINAR? Do you think the people waiting in line around the block, because they loved ALIENS, were expected some 3rd grade version of existentialism expounded with a boring Alien movie mixed in? The Alien, as that reviewer said, does resemble a little doggy. It is very small, never stands erect and it not scary. What you wind up with is two hours of a little green doggy chasing interchangeable bald men down hallways while you look through its eyes removing all suspense from the movie. I do not like David Fincher; he can disown this movie all he wants he made the same mistake with FIGHT CLUB. He, again, felt compelled to conduct a philosophy class in the middle of the movie alienating, no pun intended, his audience. David, these are action films fans they are not interested in ontology or epistemology. Anyway, the worst of the series by a mile. Long, Boring not scary and ugly, dark and depressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Underrated Sequel (This is a review for the Assembly cut.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 is one of the most controversial sequels of all times. A lot of people hate this film for reasons I don't agree with. Alien 3 is a really well done Sci-Fi horror film. It makes the first 3 films come full circle and is a great ending. I will admit, I still like Alien: Resurrection but, I prefer this one. I think if people just watched it for what it was instead of complaining about the dark tone, dead characters, Ripley making love to the doctor or other silly things like that. The cinematography is fantastic, the storyline is very interesting and brave and I found the cast to be very good. I really, REALLY like this movie and it is in my list of my top 100 favorite films of all time. Which is saying something because I have seen a LOT of films. Overall: 3.5 / 4 StarsExplantation of the Ratings: 4/4 = Masterpice, One of the best films ever made. 3.5/4 = Great, A very well done movie. 3/4 = Good, An enjoyable, solid effort. 2.5/4 = OK, it has its moments. 2/4 = Average, nothing special but, not terrible. 1.5/4 = Bad, a large amount of problems, not enjoyable. 1/4 = Awful, a poorly made, bad experience. 0.5/4 = Abysmal, a train wreck. 0/4 = Horrendous, one of the worst films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien was fantastic. Aliens was amazing. And for David Fincher's first ever film, he did a rather fantastic job. Alien 3 is still one of the scariest, tense, and satisfying film I've seen in quite some time. For a movie fanatic, Alien 3 is one of those films that sticks with you, whether you liked it or you hated it. I of course gobbled this one right up. The ending particularly was somewhat satisfying and heroic.As the third installment to the 'Alien Quadrilogy' (or now 'quintology', now that Prometheus has landed) Ripley survives a brutal crash-landing on a foreign planet that is used to keep in some of the most dangerous convicts off of earth. What she's unaware of, is that an alien egg from the previous film has landed in her ship (most likely from the queen) has impregnated another organism on the planet, and has created a very lethal, hungry, and peeved off son of a *beep*. Sigourney Weaver returns to the role of female protagonist Ellen Ripley, and even has calm affections for the medical doctor, Clemens, played by the wonderful Charles Dance. Ripley strikes me as a god like figure; the entire fact that she descended from the sky, and changed everything about these men, who have seek-ed god in the shaft of their ruin. She tells them to stand and fight back, in the time where a great evil is upon them. At the end, she takes the position of crucified, very much like the human race has pinned her to the cross. So there was a lot of religious references, which made it out to be more of a human apocalyptic movie, rather than a story about motherhood. And of course, the movie is also about the human soul, in terms of Ripley's soul infected by an evil that has grasped her heart. The dialog was great- I particularly liked listening to Dillon's speech, especially towards the final act. Speaking of which, there was a lot of climax, and the tunnel sequence especially was adrenaline rushing, as well as it being the scariest scene in the film. We see more of the alien, as a kind of scary, jack-o-lantern, spindly lethal creature, that could very easily hibernate in your closet wardrobe. I also loved Sigourney's ability to seem powerful in scene with out the Alien- and even show her vulnerability during Clemens' death scene; which was such an iconic ten seconds, and tense, as you were completely clueless as to what would happen next. Aside from the fact that you couldn't tell one bloody prisoner from the other, I really did enjoy this movie more than I can say. Alien Resurrection did make this movie seem better, in a way. It made Alien 3 more climactic, somehow. This film really is a worthy master piece, and should be acknowledged in all great movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather than being an uninspired "OMG they killed people" or "It's so boring" review, how about we get a fresh perspective?Yes they killed off Newt, Hicks and Bishop, so what? Is this an adventure series where people are saved and surrounded by rainbows? NO! This a movie about murderous aliens! And this movie in itself is about letting go and fighting the beast within. And if they didn't die, what would've this movie turned into? Hicks the unstoppable marine, Bishop the faithful and technical friend, Newt the little girl who never gets killed and always needs rescuing.The movie is dark and moody. Exactly, it was the logical step. You can paraphrase "We got tactical smart missiles, phase plasma pulse rifles, RPGs. We got sonic, electronic ball breakers! We got nukes, we got knives, we got sharp sticks." from Aliens with " we ain't got no entertainment center, no climate control, no video system, no surveillance, no freezers, no f*cking ice cream, no rubbers, no women, no guns." The setting and theme are well done although the alien is not, the cgi falling flat quite a bit. When it wasn't, however, it was the usual standard of fear inducing black monster that it is.Bringing it back down to one alien with no weaponry is a smart move. Aliens aren't as scary when you're surrounded by marines with guns rather than a single alien surrounded by rapists and thugs.The religious setting is interesting, with Dillion delivering a eulogy that was awe surprising at the funeral. The characters suit their environment, and the British influence was a nice change to generic 20 yr old Americans. The plot also brought the series to a logical and beautiful conclusion (If you don't count 4...), instead of a mech suit and giant alien fight Ripley confronts the company that was just as bad as the Alien at times. She fights the Alien within as well as the one running around the murky tunnels.Not as good as 1 and 2, but it is not the reincarnated version of Hitler which everyone seems to think it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theatrical Release: 3 / Special Edition: 8</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 sucks. But we already know this.What everyone don't know is that there's a Special Edition of Alien 3, which runs about 30 minutes longer. And after seeing that, you really start to like the movie you've disliked for almost 20 years. And it's this version that this review is about.Today there are Special Editions, Director's Cuts, Extendeds and Unrateds of every other movie being released. Many of them really don't add much; A few seconds of gore here, a pointless dialogue there. In other words, new editions are most of the time just a way for the company to cream out more money.Then there's the re-releases that really makes it a whole other experience: Kingdom of Heaven, Payback, The Abyss, The Lord of The Rings-trilogy, to name but few. And of course, Alien 3.I won't go into everything that's been added and deleted for the A3SE. But one of the gem-scenes is the Golic character, who mysteriously disappeared in the A3TR. Here we find out what actually happened, and his story is so much more than just another inmate being alien food. Why it was cut out is beyond me.The pit bull-scene is deleted, instead we get a way cooler version that includes an ox.More of the outside is shown, and basically all characters gets fleshed out (no pun intended). Especially Dillon.All changes are not for the best though. The stuff about how dangerous it is for Ripley as a woman is hammered in too much. And like the TR, SE still suffers from lack of good action, and you can't deny that it was a mistake to do the 3rd installment without guns, with just one alien, and with characters that you really hate, or at best don't care about.Still, despite it's flaws, gloominess and seriousness, the A3SE makes the saga complete in a way. It fills the gap that A3TR left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfairly criticised entry to the Alien series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have long considered the first Alien movie to be one of my, if not my all time favourite movie. The sequel, Aliens was the rare sequel which came close to being almost as good as the original. The third entry in the series was a film which I once did not care for. I will admit that the theatrical version of this movie is not exactly firing on all cylinders. The studio had butchered David Fincher's work into a near-incomprehensible and deeply flawed movie. The film became dismissed by a lot of people as a misstep in the Alien franchise and rightly so. However...In 2003, with the debut of the truly excellent DVD known as the Alien Quadrilogy, I discovered a so-called Assembeley Cut of Alien 3 which included around half an hour of new footage. I watched this cut and was very surprised with the result.The assembly cut of this movie was a better movie than the theatrical version. Here are several ways in which the assembly cut triumphs over the somewhat dire theatrical version: The pacing. In the theatrical version, the pacing is very convoluted and is not worth following. The special edition (assembly cut, whatever) has far better pacing. We are given an explanation to several things such as how Paul McGann's character dies and whole new interesting subplot involving the capture and subsequent escape of the alien. Many people complain about the cgi, when in reality the movie only had one single cgi shot, the rest was heavily animatronics.The movie still has it's flaws, it's never fully explained exactly how the egg got on the ship, but as far as third entries into a series go, it's not bad. In short, if you watch a version of this movie, make sure it's the assembly cut. If you've only seen the (admittidly poor) theatrical version, seek out the assembly cut before you give this movie a 1/10. You probably won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read many of the negative reviews here on IMDb and in nearly every single one, the author cited their major gripe as the characters of Hicks and Newt being killed off before the start of the movie. WHY is this a problem?? They do not have to be in this movie for it to be good. This movie is different in style from the second movie and the main point is the idea of isolating Ripley while creating an atmosphere of fear, isolation, claustrophobia loneliness and desperation. This would be impossible if Ripley had her buddies from the previous movie with her to back her up! Hicks and Newt were basically the daughter and husband Ripley wished she had so having them dead adds this tremendous feeling of loss (and desperation) which I felt Sigorny Weaver did a great job of expressing.Basically, this is a dark and brooding film with lots of suspense and a great plot twist in the end which also happens to be a great way to end the series as a whole. The soundtrack was decent and the visuals were grim and gritty (as one would expect from a movie in this series). Weaver does a good job acting the character of Ripley and the other characters do a good job being alien-fodder and also helping her in her attempt to kill the alien. The direction is stylistic but in a way that serves to deepen the thematic sense of isolation and desperation.In short, I recommend this film to anyone who likes scifi-suspense or is a fan of the series!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 would be a daunting prospect to any filmmaker. Ridley Scott and James Cameron left such an indelible mark on the Alien series, you almost pity the poor person who should follow in they're footsteps.Add to that the hellish problems that plagued the film behind the scenes, all before it got to the screen. Directors came and went. Scripts were written and rejected. Constant studio interference. Sigourney Weaver had ideas of her own. She even takes a producing credit for the first time in the series.All things that add up to a disaster in the making. And not surprisingly when the film debuted, fans savagely ravaged it. Finding fault with everything. Although not a flop, it was seen as one because the box-office returns were muted by comparison.Although I'll admit it's a step down in quality from the first two, I actually quite liked Alien 3. Its not the classic the others were, but its not a failure either. It was after all caught in the unenviable position of appeasing the fans while establishing its own identity at the same time. The fact it manages to do that at all makes it a success in my book.After many directors hung they're heads in shame failing to make a film out of this mess, the man chosen to helm it was the then unknown David Fincher. David Fincher is one of my favourite filmmakers. He's gone on to make some excellent genre classics. Like the superb Se7en. The fantastic Fight Club. And fine thrillers like Panic Room and Zodiac.David Fincher must have been intimidated when given the reins to Alien 3. Helming the third part of such a well-respected franchise. And he had no experience as a filmmaker outside of music videos. Unlike James Cameron who'd just come from the huge success of The Terminator. And Ridley Scott was no amateur either. But Fincher does surprisingly well in his feature film debut. He may have publicly disowned it afterwards, but he more than holds his own.One of the things I like about the Alien series is each new director brought something new to it. From a haunted house in space adventure to an all out action extravaganza, one wondered what the novice Fincher would bring to this one. The novelty this time is that its set in a prison. And the whole idea of Alien evil in a place of pure human evil was one that appealed to me a great deal.The film does an excellent job of keeping continuity with Aliens, when Ripley's ship crashlands on Fury 161, an all male prison planet. No sooner has she woken up and shaved her head like one of the inmates, her fight with the Alien is far from over. Her constant companion has crashed with her. And its loose. But even worse is that after all the times she's battled the Alien and won, the cruellest irony of all has finally happened. She's got one inside her. And what's worse, its a Queen.By now, Ellen Ripley is a role Sigourney Weaver could play in her sleep. But she thankfully doesn't. In fact, perhaps because of Weaver's need to take an active role behind the scenes, we get to see some complex new dimensions to Ripley this time around. Ripley is now a tragic figure. She's become resigned to the fact she'll never be free of the Alien. Her epiphany is more haunting than a dozen Aliens.Ripley has always been the unifying drive of the Alien series. Without her, it wouldn't be an Alien picture. And its her battle that lends the film its impetus. She throws herself into it not with a fanatic's zeal, but more of a weary resignation. She only hopes to kill the Alien before the one inside kills her. What with the run down, grimy, lived in look of the prison, it seems David Fincher has taken a cue from Ridley Scott rather than James Cameron when coming up with the design scheme for Fury 161. He makes use of some excellent lighting effects that illuminates the mood of the picture. It goes from a brazen, golden hue to a stark, dangerous red as the film nears its climax.Alien 3 is the first of the series made during the time of CGI. And using it to create the Alien is one of the few things about the film that doesn't really work. Whenever it moves, it looks false and cartoonish. An effect that never connects with its surroundings. The prior films relied on good old-fashioned body-suits and that was all they needed. The 1979 Alien looked more real than this does. One of the few disappointing aspects of the movie.Another criticism is the cast. Aside from the excellent Weaver, there are too few noteworthy performers. There are fine turns from the great Charles Dance as a disgraced former doctor and the late Brian Glover as the prison warden. But they're killed off disappointingly early into the action. The rest are filled out by a lot of faceless extras. It takes some of the urgency out of it.But the film builds to a powerful climax. Just as the Company comes to claim the Alien inside Ripley, she sacrifices herself as it bursts out of her. It would have been a terrific, triumphal end to the series. It wasn't necessary to continue, but alas they did with Alien: Resurrection, which if truthfully, is a far more disappointing film.Alien 3 is more successful then people know. Even now, its a neglected work. And even if David Fincher joined the chorus of ardent haters, Alien 3 is a never less then fascinating, gut-wrenching addition to the Alien series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Making of" documentary begins with these words by David Fincher..."I think that they knew that I had given my blood and my every milliliter of my sweat trying to make it work, but I guess that I just wasn't clever enough to come up with something that would really blow everybody away and be something completely different.""It was just set up wrong to begin with. It was a very sort of bad period for us, in this film, because we were fighting a losing battle all the time."That, in a nutshell, sums up the general consensus surrounding this movie.Alcatraz in space, just did not work. It still offers some good moments, but this was clearly NOT the sequel James Cameron had intended. With Aliens (Alien 2), he clearly set it up for Ripley, Newt, and Hicks to return to Earth as a family. It should have been Ripley and Hicks from then on out. Instead, Ripley is alone among a penal space colony, Newt died in transit (a victim of a chestburster during the trip), and Hicks's life support had mysteriously given out.This script was quite bad. Jon Landau, Executive Producer of this project is quoted as having said, "I always felt that Alien 3 was a movie that initially, as a studio, we set out to make a Release Date and not a movie. I think along the way that changed, but that really set us back." They were more concerned with the release date than the story, and unfortunately, that is a glaring reality when viewing this installment behind the first two.All that having been said, however, Sigourney Weaver is no less realistically believable; no less professionally perfect in her performance than she was in both Alien and Aliens. In fact, the performances were lovely all around. It was the plot which was lacking. The story was not beneficial to the line, in any way. Especially in that they killed off Ripley, and thereby terminated their own franchise. This was sad, indeed, as the one to follow also lacked in depth and vision, but was a definite rise above this third attempt.It's the movie I wanted to love, but just couldn't.As such, it rates a 6.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

I must say that up to that moment I was getting by on the great cinematography, and actually getting into the whole sombre mood.We had gotten to know Charles's doctor as a guilt-ridden man with blood on his hands who is trying to redeem himself. He was presented as a soul-mate of sorts for Ripley. Hey, they even made love in a rather tender scene.Then out of nowhere drops an alien which in a wink of an eye simply kills him. I mean, if he's going to be killed so off-handedly, WHY BOTHER giving him so much time to built up a relationship? And the warm atmosphere just ripped away like a bad joke. ARRGHH.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Attention: Spoilers for Aliens and Alien 3 follow.This movie broke my heart. I saw Alien when I was about 11 years old, and dozens of times since. It was one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. We discussed it later in college English, as an update to the classic gothic horror story. When Aliens came out I was 16 and able to drive. I was so enthralled I had to stay and watch it a second time. I long for a chance to take that roller coaster ride again for the first time, but it's not to be. Needless to say, I awaited Alien 3 with baited breath.It sucked.Don't get me wrong, the cinematography was beautiful, the movie had a gritty, desolate feel that I really loved. However, I cannot forgive them for blowing the trilogy in my opinion.I first loved Aliens because of the action, but it's one of those movies that I love more each time I watch it. James Cameron broke the mold! The story had everything! An elite fighting force, that could have easily have fought off the aliens, but Pride goeth before the Fall. After disaster, the core group toughs it out with levelheaded determination to survive. Sigourney Weaver is sublime! She's no Arnold, but she steps up to save the little girl, her daughter figure.In any case not to go on to long about Aliens, but Alien 3 just throws the triumph of the human spirit of Aliens out the window because it isn't convenient. The noble Hicks, who would have changed the dynamic of Ripley's relationship with the convicts by defending her is killed. Newt, the crux of Ripley's determination in the first movie would be a distraction in this one, is killed. Bishop, who shows us that an "Artificial Person" doesn't have to be a menace, is killed, and replaced with just another evil Company lie to restore our cynicism. It seems that everything that represented triumph in the first movie is cast away on a weak premise.Here is where I speak to the other Alien series geeks. My number one problem with this movie, how did the egg get on the Sulaco? The only trip up to the ship was the second dropship that Bishop pilots up in the end. The mother alien didn't have an egg under her arm when she stepped out of the elevator, and she left her egg producing section in the reactor! How did the egg in the beginning of the Alien 3 movie get there? Perhaps another alien hid with an egg on the second drop ship, coming out only when the humans entered the cryosleep chambers? If so, how did it overcome it's dronish instincts to defend the queen when Ripley killed her? How did it get to the cryosleep chamber? There must be at least one door between there and the cargo hold. If it could open doors, why didn't the mother alien do so when Ripley ran behind a door to put on the power loader suit?I just cannot get over my problems with movie 3. Knowing the script battle that went on before this was settled only makes it worse. There could have been 1000 other plots that would have done honor to the 2nd movie, but this wasn't one of them.I just pretend that it doesn't exist, and dream of the Alien 3 that should have been...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated this movie. It was ok as A movie, but not as a part of the series. It just seemed wrong. I won't spoil it to anyone, but it really ruined the previous movie "Aliens".We are back to one Alien, which is quite annoying after we were "Spoiled" with hundreds of aliens in "Aliens"... The movie just feels cold and wrong... I dunno. It does have some nice moment though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm surprised that a lot of comments about this film were positive. I almost envy the people who liked Alien 3. I really wish I could have enjoyed this movie, but instead it ticked me off like no other film. Here are the reasons why I hated it:1) Hicks and Newt were killed off in the very beginning!why couldn't Fincher further develop their relationship with Ripley? They could've AT LEAST have been killed at the end.2) The Alien looks really fake and has too much screen time. It was a rod puppet blue-screened into the action, but it resembles jerky stop-motion.3) Where's the weapons? Unlike the first two there's no flame- throwers or machine guns to kick butt.4) I didn't care about the other chrome-domed characters. They might as well have been those expendable red-shirted ensigns on Star Trek. All in all, it left me cold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's Cut vs Theatrical Release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favourite Alien film - The acting is superb with Charles S. Dutton (Aka "Roc") and Charles Danse - Plus a motley crew of British Actors including Danny Webb as Morse, Paul McGann as "Golic", Brian Glover as "Andrews", Ralph Brown as "85" and of course a younger Pete Postlethwaite as "David" - These guys make up the first British Max Prison in Space. David Fincher made us believe that this was a huge supermax prison on some backwater planet. And then we have the return of Bishop, we get to meet the original Bishop the way he was left from Aliens.The Sulaco of course on the outside was the same Sulaco, inside, it was different, but convincing as a ship interior. The "Model 337 EEV" looked like a piece from a car engine, but as they also made a life-sized version of it, I eventually allowed myself to be convinced that the metal sliver that fell off of the Sulaco was an evacuation unit.My complaint with the Theatrical Release was that it was too short, but there were some great things - The "Dog Alien" for instance... The directors cut is satisfactory in length, but the Dog-Alien angle is omitted, instead we have a Cow-Alien. Doesn't work. Also, the DC includes some digital Alien footage that should have stayed on the cutting floor, although some of it was made by some of the digital pioneers from Lord of the Rings, some of the digital shots are not very convincing. This is minimal in the Theatrical cut, in the DC, these shots should have been fixed up, they have the tech today to fix some of the digital shots and make it more photorealistic.Theatrical or Director's Cut - Fincher did a very good job at combining Practical Footage, Digital shots, Puppeteering and Mechanical/Animatronic Effects to give us one of the best Alien stories.Now although I have inserted a few spoilers here, my only complaint with the film was the Theatrical Length, and of course, After all the stuff these survivors went through to have two of them killed right away at the very beginning, kind of ruined the ending of "Aliens".An original Alien 3 Script I had read Online had Newt and Hicks surviving and were a huge part of the story. I had heard that a Fox exec forced Fincher to do the story the way it is in his film. But other than the disappointing deaths of Newt and Hicks, this alien-chase through a lead foundry was amazing. As someone said, it takes a while for the action to start, but by no means are there non-interesting events being played out on screen.For those of you who enjoyed some of the Music of Alien 3, some of this music re-appears in The Matrix- Watch both together, and you will see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien 3's Only Sin Is Not Being As Good As Alien or Aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 is a perfectly fine continuation of the hit franchise that was rather unfairly bashed by critics and fans simply because it wasn't as good as Alien or Aliens. Well, get over it because few films are. Sigourney Weaver returns to her career making role of Ripley who is now stranded on a desolate prison world. To her horror, she discovers a xenomorph has hitched a ride along with her following the crash of her escape vessel and now the lives of everyone is in danger unless they can trap and kill the deadly creature. It's not as strong a horror film as Ridley Scott's classic or as action packed as James Cameron's sequel but it's a smart, thrilling adventure in it's own right with a terrific cast and highlighted by wonderful production values and special effects. There are signs of studio tampering and the largely unknown director David 'Fight Club' Fincher has publicly disowned the film but overall it's still a tremendous entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misguided and misinterpreted, yet still impressive film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The issues with this movie that have been raised are more than valid. The acting is brilliant from most of the actors, such as Pete Postlethwaite, however some of the actors - a very small amount - could be accused of overacting. The story is harsh and difficult to view, and the film was ravaged by money hungry, franchise desperate producers. Add to that the decent, yet seemingly unneeded special effects, we are given a film with many flaws. And yet, with all that, Alien 3 has a brilliant nasty, uncaring tone, a tone that matches the animalistic nature of all of the characters. And the acclaimed British actors used bounce perfectly off of the previously namely American actors. Sigourney Weaver is brilliant, and the sets are truly incredible. Add to that the cinematography? Wow. Far from flawless, and someone who isn't interested in anything more than viewing films may not like it - totally understandable. But, if you look a little deeper, you may find it enjoyable if not extremely good, but it's all about perspective. Not for everyone, but it's worth a watch. I give it an 8 out of 10, but that's just me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fitting end to the best Trilogy of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SOME SPOILERSIt is no secret that Alien 3 had an extremely troubled production, with many writers and directors being hired and then cast aside. However they settled on David Fincher, who at the time had never directed a movie, this was a good choice as he had the right ideas for the movie. It is worth noting that throughout this review I am referring to the 2004 special edition release.The movie itself is relatively well paced and has the best characters in the trilogy. Which consists of 22 prisoners, (only about 14 of them get any good screen time), 2 guards and a medical officer and of course Ripley. My personal favourite character is Morse played by Danny Webb, as he is a smart-ass dick for most of the film, but becomes more humbled by the end. Other characters include Clemens, the doctor, and Dillon the de-facto priest of the prison. People complain that they are all bald English guys, but still, English guys are awesome. Also there are a few Americans anyway.The Alien is as deadly as ever because it can now run like a cheetah and is quadrupedal, the effects used for the most part are spot on with suit effects being the effect used; however when the Alien is running, a rod puppet is used which looks like crap in some shots. Ellen Ripley is at her wits end in this film as she has lost everything and is now stuck with the scum of the earth on a distant planet with another Alien, Sigourney Weaver plays Ripley as good as ever and does not falter.A common criticism of the film is the fact that all the survivors of the previous film,(Aliens), are immediately killed off and there is a particularly gruesome autopsy on Newt, this is difficult to watch and really shouldn't have been included. I view this as the saddest and the funniest of the Alien films as some scenes are genuinely funny and other have me at tears. FYI this is the only film that makes me cry.The set design is spot on and the sculptors really captured the run down look of this prison facility very well, it certainly suits the trend with the other 2 Alien films. I've never seen a film make the colour brown look so appealing as it does in this movie, as everything is lit in the latter colour. The use of low angles is also a welcomed addition, plus we also get to see some Alien POV shots which increase the tension.To conclude, this film may not be as good as the first 2 Alien films, but it is a damn good film anyway and it does come close to being as good as them. If you can get over character deaths and a slightly downbeat film (which actually has a hopeful end) give this film a watch, you won't regret it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Structured as a series of nightmares, the "Alien" franchise sees actress Sigourney Weaver playing Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut who is repeatedly menaced by phallic and vaginal alien creatures. Throughout the series, Ripley bounces from hell to worse, the poor girl persecuted, tormented and subjected to ridiculously extreme ordeals. By the franchise's fourth instalment, Ripley can't even die peacefully; her body is cloned and resurrected for the purpose of torturous marriages with the very alien monsters she seems unable to escape.Bleak, grimy and hopeless, David Fincher's "Alien 3" is one of the more interesting films in the "Alien" franchise. The film was originally to be based on a script by science fiction author William Gibson, but that screenplay was jettisoned. Another screenplay was written by Vincent Ward, but this was also discarded. Ward's script, oft voted one of the greatest unfilmed scifi screenplays of all time, saw Ripley marooned on wooden Monastery Planet populated by Luddite monks. The monks view Ripley as a sexual temptation sent by God and the alien she brings with her as a manifestation of God's wrath. This script was loosely influenced by the first Dark Horse graphic novels, published in the 1980s, set in the Alien universe ("Alien: Book One"). Those comics began to introduce religious elements into the series, the alien monsters worshipped by cults, viewed as Gods by some, satanic or apocalyptic creatures by others. Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" tries to recapture some of these elements, its heroine a Christian girl who's looking for God but who finds only death, nightmarish monsters and a spiritually vile and/or vacant universe. This unrelenting pessimism ? a kind of messed up, corporeal religion in which man's abandoned by God and repeatedly raped by monsters ? is the franchise's best quality.Fincher's "Alien 3" aims for a similar nihilism. It uses elements from Ward's script, but changes the Luddite monastery into a penal colony populated by rapists and murderers who have "found God". Ripley teams up with this band of convicts to defeat her own private little monster, an alien creature which follows her from LV-426, the planet seen in the previous 2 "Alien" films.It's a good idea, but almost nothing works in Fincher's film. The idea of combining Ward's monks with criminals offers nothing. Better to pick one idea and stick with it. The film's thriller set pieces, horror moments and special effects are also atrocious, as is the film's dialogue, which reeks of bad screen writing. Sigourney Weaver ? iconic with her bald, shaven head ? sells her lines, but the rest of Fincher's cast play their roles like cartoonish caricatures. Elsewhere Fincher overuses low angle shots, his camera work is poor, the film's big "selflessness" theme is unexplored, most scenes flow awkwardly, the film's climax feels like a poor imitation of "Terminator 2's" climax (Fincher made alterations when he learnt that Cameron's film was also ending with a sacrifice in a cauldron of lava), the shape and size of the film's alien creature is inconsistent throughout, and much of the film spends its time watching characters figure out things the audience already knows.Still, there are some good things in "Alien 3". The film bravely kills off the cast of "Alien 2" (fans hate this), features an appropriately sickening autopsy on a little girl (the sequence was heavily cut), Fincher's production designers create perhaps the best sets and architectural designs of the franchise, Fincher's cinematography is uniformly excellent and the film ends with a strong scene, Ripley sacrificially falling into a pool of fire as an Alien bursts out of her chest. This sequence was omitted from the "Alien 3: Assembly Cut", as Fincher never liked it and felt the idea was forced upon him by producers.As is well known, "Alien 3" saw Fincher facing huge pre-production and on-set difficulties. He was hounded by producers, the film's script was incomplete when shooting began, was being re-written daily, and many sequences in the script were reverse engineered to accommodate grand sets which had already been constructed. Fincher would later disown the film. The problems he encountered here would lead to him become a very controlling, methodical director.7/10 ? See "Pandorum" for a slightly better take on the same material. Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually incredibly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1979 Ridley Scott gave us one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made, the horrific masterpiece that was Alien. In 1986 James Cameron dished out a sequel that went a completely different direction from the first one, but was amazingly just as phenomenal, when he made Aliens. And then in 1992 David Fincher, in his very first feature film, gave us Alien 3. Poorly received, initially, this third installment in the saga continues the story of Ripley when her escape pod that her, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop escaped in at the end of Aliens crash lands on an all male prison planet. Ripley is the only survivor of the crash...or so she thinks. Soon enough the horrible xenomorph shows its face again and Ripley once again has to fight for her live while protecting those less experienced in fighting these horrible creatures.Now, a quick disclaimer. The version of Alien 3 I watched was the aptly named Assembly Cut of the film. Alien 3 was stuck in development hell for a very long time, going through a plethora of rewrites and directors. David Fincher signed on and construction began on sets before the script was even finished. Then the script changed drastically and the tons of things had to be reworked and the film was constantly changing. When everything was finally laid out Fincher put together his first cut of the film, which was two and a half hours long, and turned it into 20th Century Fox. The studio was not pleased with it and changed the film significantly. The final product that the studio released was about a half hour shorter with a totally different beginning and end. Fincher despised the reworking of his film and has since disowned this film entirely. But in 2003 when the Alien Quadirlogy box set was released on DVD Fincher's preferred Assembly Cut was included. This is the version I watched.The reason I went into so much detail is because the theatrical release of the film was very poorly received. However, the Assembly Cut that I watched was awesome. It's a truly excellent film and an awesome addition to the series. It hearkens back more to the first film, only featuring one xenomorph and focusing more on claustrophobic terror than the guns blazing action film that was Aliens. Not that Aliens didn't work unbelievably well, but I loved that Alien 3 shifted back to the suspense/horror roots of the series. Of course, this film is not as good as either of its predecessors, but still a fantastic film in its own rights.Alien 3 flows wonderfully, the characters are a lot of fun and they are very fresh archetypes in the series. The setting of the film, again, hearkens back to the setting of the first film, but now with some new and very interesting elements that you have to experience for yourself. Alien 3 is riveting and enthralling from start to finish, with Sigourney Weaver giving it her all as Ripley once again. It has its small flaws here and there, but they are far from fatal. There are some minor plot holes, the script isn't the best in the world, and the CGI is actually pretty bad at times, somewhat removing you from the experience.But, as a whole, this really is an invigorating film where you never know what will happen next. It's a film that just keeps on giving and keeps on impressing in the goriest and most exciting ways possible. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't watch Alien 3. It's not nearly as good as Alien or Aliens, but that is only because those two films are masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, the first two movies in this franchise would have been a tough act to follow, and this movie doesn't offer us much that we hadn't seen before, but it's still unfairly vilified in this reviewer's humble opinion. Story picks up as Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley crash lands on a truly desolate planet at the ass end of the universe, used as a prison facility populated by various unsavoury characters. Once again, a xenomorph must be battled, but we're going back to basics in a way, as it's only the one monster brutalizing individuals left and right in this case. David Fincher, making his feature directing debut here after having worked on music videos, maintains an incredibly bleak vision from start to finish. (It's certainly true that there are elements here that are going to come across as major bummers to some audience members.) The picture returns to the visual style of the first film in one sense in that the aspect ratio is once again 2.35:1. Visuals are appropriately stark and special effects are generally good; owing to the way this particular alien is brought into the world, its movement is even more animal like than usual and there is camera-work representing alien p.o.v. shots that is extremely striking. Now, it's true enough that with so many of the characters being lowlifes - no matter if they have found God - that it's hard to feel much whether they're alive or dead. There are exceptions, of course: Charles S. Dutton has a commanding presence as Dillon, the top con, and Charles Dance is given far and away the most interesting role in the whole thing as the medical officer with the dubious past and who makes a connection with Ripley. Lance Henriksen makes a token appearance reprising his role of the android Bishop (and has a second role as well), and the strong, mostly British supporting cast features capable performers such as Paul McGann, Brian Glover, Ralph Brown, Danny Webb, and Pete Postlethwaite. The screenplay, overall, (credited to Larry Ferguson and longtime series producers David Giler &amp; Walter Hill) may be somewhat formulaic but the movie still delivers in a visceral way. What's recommended is seeing the two hours and 25 minute long assembly cut as it fleshes out the story and characters a bit more and it's a more intriguing experience than the theatrical version. While clearly this entry is not going to be for all series fans, it's got its moments, and at the very least starts off on a nice ominous note with its spin on the Fox Fanfare theme and its opening credits. Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an amazing sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Prometheyus which sucked unbelievably and thought to write a review in my favorite alien sequel. The movie justifies the title Alien. Compared to the first 2 movies: Alien 1 is a masterpiece and the begging of all this hype. Alien 2 is total fluke, you know exactly what is going to happen before it even happens, for a few brief moments but that's it, it doesn't really keep you in there. Its a typical futuristic movie where the writer can just invent new scifi guns to support the script (like automated sentry machine guns). Newt and Hicks was a nice touch in 2 but I'm so glad they didn't use them in 3, i would really hate to see the aliens franchise turned into a chick flick with romance and happy endings... thats not what the alien movies are all about. Alien 3 on the other hand was a masterpiece, all the actors were great. I have to say the dialogs were not the best but lets face it, if the aliens movie is about keeping you in a sense of despair, helplessness, fear of the unknown then alien 3 is right next to the first movie.The set is in a remote prison planet were resources are limited (including weapons), habited by a small group religious prisoners, the alien is only one and the only way to beat the monster is by using their wits. No flashy sci fi other than the monster and maybe the medpod, no space ships, no super guns, no reactors waiting to explode. The characters were well played and they were not just there to feed the monster like the previous movies.Bottom line: Eventho the movie had many problems during the shooting this one turned out to be a great one. A lot of reviewers here complained about removing Newt and Hicks and using a set that is not as sci fi as the previous ones but thats just a matter of opinion, i think the makers of this sequel did right and changed the whole scene radically, if they didn't then they would have to kill at least one of them in the next one, so taking them all together and changing the scenery was the best.. a bit sudden but a good one :p</fullReview>

I would even go as far as to say that it is a better movie than Alien Resurrection in that it carries the deep sensation of foreboding and helplessness that created the Alien mystique in the first place.In retrospect, I'd say its worth a solid 7.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfairly maligned by fans and critics on its release, ALIEN 3 is a film that has a lot going for it. It's unlucky, really, that it follows up two very different movies involving equally brilliant situations: the small-scale claustrophobic horror of ALIEN and the action-packed, large-scale alien war of ALIENS. Yes, the plot follows the same template as in the first film, with a sole creature bumping off a larger cast, but so do many other sci-fi/horror movies. Playing to type isn't necessarily a bad thing.One thing ALIEN 3 does have going for it is style. Along with SE7EN, this helped define new-look realist cinema, full of grittiness and lived-in grime. It's a harsh, pessimistic world we see on screen, incredibly downbeat in its killing-off of key figures from the series, and although David Fincher may have disowned it, I find it one of his finest films. ALIEN 3 is creepily atmospheric and boasts at least one full-on original horror scene, ironically involving video monitoring once again (although a far cry from the motion tracker sequence in ALIENS). The bit in which Ripley undergoes a body scan is one of the most chilling I can remember seeing in the 1990s.It also helps that an ensemble cast brings to life the rather familiar storyline. Ripley, shaven-headed and scarred, is tougher than ever, and she has to be amid one of the most unsympathetic list of characters ever amassed in a film. Despite this, the likes of Pete Postlethwaite, Charles Dance, Paul McGann, Brian Glover, Ralph Brown and in particular Charles S. Dutton bring warmth, humour, pathos and indeed charisma to their prisoner roles. Dutton in particular is outstanding, particularly during a stirring speech he gets late on ("Nobody ever gave me nothing!").Bringing Henriksen back helps tie up the series chronology, and while the CGI-animated alien may have dated slightly (although nowhere near as badly as you might think), Fincher's inventive, frenetic camera-work keeps the action scenes working. Add in an inventive climax (copied by TERMINATOR: SALVATION recently) and you have one heck of an entertaining sequel and the last decent movie in this series.Update: I've recently watched the assembly cut of this movie, which makes it both a better and less satisfying viewing experience at the same time. The story makes a lot more sense this time around and answers most of the plot holes from the theatrical cut, such as the disappearance of crazed prisoner Golic. The addition of 'trapping the alien' sequence is also a decent one, and I don't really buy the reasons for excising it in the first place; does it make the alien a less credible menace? Not a chance. On the other hand, the running time is now close to 2h20m, which absolutely destroys the pacing, and it starts really dragging in the last half hour despite all the action going on. As a fan of the series, I still think the assembly cut is the better version of the film, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, here it is. The third movie in the Alien franchise and the film that almost signalled the end of David Fincher's directorial career before it had really begun.It was always going to be a tough one, how to please fans and give them a sense of closure (IF this was ever intended to be the final instalment) while following on from not only a classic original work but also from a sequel that managed to take things in a different direction while still maintaining an amazingly high standard, being equally good as the first movie for different reasons.So we get another very different affair that takes a very, very dark turn as our heroine, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), crashes onto the prison planet of Fiorina 161. A planet full of nasty, male prisoners who haven't seen a woman in a long, looooooong time. And a planet that now holds one more xenomorph than it used to. With no weapons and no macho marines to help, how will Ripley manage to defeat the monster this time around? There's the old argument about lack of creative control and decisions being made that lessened Fincher's vision but, let's be honest here, this movie was always going to be a tough sell and was always going to be a difficult one for the fans to handle. Viewed now, with the benefit of hindsight and an improved "Assembly Cut" on DVD (though no director's cut as Fincher has had no more to do with the project, to date), it's easy to overlook it's flaws and hail it as a great movie but it's still no classic and still pales in comparison to the instalments that came beforehand. I must say, however, that I love the darkness of the film and it's bleak atmosphere that infuses every scene from start to finish.The cast all do pretty well (and UK audiences, in particular, will enjoy seeing the likes of Ralph Brown, Paul McGann, Charles Dance and Brian Glover coming up against our nasty, alien foe) but, unfortunately, a few too many scenes still descend to the level of bald, angry men simply shouting at each other and running around corridors. Weaver is great, which goes without saying in the context of this series.Fincher will, hopefully, look back on this movie and realise that he did manage to overcome many of the problems in his way to provide audiences with a fantastic film that nobody was ready for at the time. It's enjoyable, stylish, dark and intelligent - pretty much the same as every other movie that Fincher went on to make in the rest of the nineties and beyond so fans of his work should still give it a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three times better than any of the later 'sequels'...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there's a lot of haters out there I never quite understood why they didn't save their anger for the truly stomach-churningly awful Alien(s) vs Predator movies. Maybe it's because while Alien 3 was watched by fans of the original and the sequel, those AVP movies were mainly aimed at a barely-sober teen audience who couldn't care less for the originals and who think that Paul W Anderson is the new Stanley Kubrick... Anyway, Alien 3 is more than just a stylish exercise for David Fincher (it's certainly better than what Fincher's up to nowadays): it's a tight, very dark and suspenseful sci-fi flick that features a great ensemble cast of character actors. All this can be said about the (superior) original, and it's certainly closer to Alien than to Aliens - which is a good thing, because what happens when you try to top Aliens' action and over-the-top characters can be seen in the later 'sequels'. I also liked the story about Ripley being stranded on a planet with only hardened male criminals; it's not just the same old story all over again. I've always seen this one as a very solid end of a great trilogy and still like to pretend it was the last one. I do believe if it came out today it would be much more appreciated - as the state of sci-fi movies and sequels in general has much deteriorated since Alien 3 originally came to cinemas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two words might express the ALIEN's real awesomeness?genuinely scary/ gruesome, and cool. They have cool sets, music, photography, a cool leading actress.First a few words about Fincher's installment, then about my ALIEN history.The fact that the ALIEN franchise benefited from Fincher's services for one go is cool. He gave it a stylish look, unlike the previous, rawer installments, yet without going into undue goofiness. (--The Frenchman's movie is delightful, but as a comic book, not as a gritty horror, which at least the first three movies all were.--) 'Alien 3' differs from the previous installments in that it is a planet?based movie?the Ripley capsule crashes on a planet used as maximum security prison and also industrial setting?they have a huge furnace, etc.. The prisoners are organized in a Christian cult, with vows and everything. The installment is adequately violent and brutal, with a gang of picturesque prisoners, enthralling music and especially beautiful photography?those dark cold tones of browns, etc. . For once, poor Ripley quenches her sexual needs?with the handsome physician.Elliot Goldenthal wrote the wonderfully atmospheric music of the movie; now regarding what is commonly termed the decision to kill off Bishop, Newt, and Hicks, it appealed to me as an original, unpredictable and original move, and I think it suited Fincher's penchant to violent morbidity and gruesomeness, and the critics of this decision had nothing to put forth except for their own puerility, as if some characters of the most respectable Sci?Fi franchise ever were SIMPSONS or STAR TREK characters or something ?. The Walter Hill and David Giler script is a revolutionary attempt of preserving the franchise from decaying into STAR TREK trash. Like in other futuristic thrillers, the mere fact of not understanding all the details of the plot, all the steps, all actions' meanings, the architectural dispositions, simply enhances the intended feelings.Charles Dance is the physician Clemens?one of the notable performances in the whole franchise, like Henriksen doing the android in I haven't seen Alien? Special Edition, but it sounds exciting, promising.I love the franchise's lucidity about the availability of the technological progress in the distant future; also, the avoiding of absurdities like Teleportation, biological improvements of humankind, ethical amelioration, etc.. This is a bleak franchise about a sleazy future.Believe me or not, HR Giger's alien design is not the very best thing about what might be the finest SF franchise ever.I have seen the installments in random order?I have begun at 15 yrs, in a movie--theater, with 'the Henriksen installment', then after many years I have seen the 4th movie?the one with Wynona?again in a movie?theater, then the 1st, then this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lightness in the dark?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favourite Alien film. There I said it; a controversial statement among hardened series fans. I have recently made this decision having watched them all in close succession (though I must confess to watching them in reverse order).It sits as the black sheep of the set and the whole piece has been a magnet for negativity from the start. The film had a troubled and fractious production through business and creative conflicts which lead to negative remarks from cast and crew, and then once released, the series' fanboys were quick to condemn it. So if these two expectedly loyal groups offer little enthusiasm towards the film then why is it my favourite this time round? The most noticeable thing about this instalment is that it's dark. But not straight-up black like a Tim Burton film, more an unsettling exchange of brown and grey expressed through the industrial surroundings of a combined prison and lead smelting plant. The living quarters are lifeless grey brick rooms, flatly lit with a bare white light and the smelting plant's ominous rusty brown metal corridors offer a stark contrast with their dank, shadow rich environment. The lack of natural comfort continues beyond the facility's perimeter where, in the brief glimpses offered, we witness a ravaged and sterile planet, wrathfully weather-beaten with the only hint of softness offered from its dual suns, both large and ominous in view but soft in tone; their energy paling in comparison to the planet's atmospheric blockade and their nurture muted. To observe this level of ecological disarray from beneath a duvet is shear bliss.The score (Elliot Goldenthal) is great too, not amazing, just, 'right'. Its subtle composition uses dark orchestral tones trapped amongst an undulating synthesis to add to the unnatural atmosphere. I could imagine it has been filtered throughout to reduce high frequency content and minimise any potential brightness. The resulting soundscapes are well placed against the visuals and create an emotional extension and a sense of foreboding often felt more than heard. Hints of 'melody' and the wonderfully grave yet momentous theme offer more blatant orchestral prowess which really drives home some of the expressive moments. Indeed the climax of the film has one of my favourite (I have lots) thematic cues which is painfully snubbed in the directors cut by an attempt to improve on a slightly questionable ending.The framing and camera angles at times reflect on the director's music video experience, with cool and quirky camera angles that are effective in the confined spaces adding visual engagement to an action film surviving more on violent threat than realisation. A glut of low level shots leaves the viewer looking up at the surroundings feeling unnaturally small; at times this lends the characters a protective appeal as they tower above your vulnerable position in this hostile environment.The characters themselves are a grisly bunch; troubled souls, pushed to the outer fringe of civilisation, which in this futuristic setting is a whole other planet. They're 'scum' in the purest form and there's little to make you care about or like them. But I do, I warm to them and find their 'company' somehow satisfying. Maybe it's because I've seen it several times and am a little more familiar with them, maybe it's because Big Cuddly Clive from brit TV show Casualty is in it, or maybe it's because of those moments, where no matter how mean or evil they have professed to have been in the past, their human warmth and basic need for friendship, affection and simple help strengthens my earnest belief that within every thorny exterior, no matter how trapped it may seem, there is an innate vulnerability that can only be satisfied through the social rewards offered from positive behaviour.And I believe that is why it was my favourite installment this time.Reassurance.Alien 3's conflicting elements of dark and light, twisted and pure &amp; 'good' and 'evil', combine effectively with its undulating levels of fear and security to offer a satisfying emotional engagement, negative on the surface, but with a hidden sanguinity. If you're watching this for Alien action then you may be disappointed, but if you're feeling bleak, alone or just a wee bit sinister then this could certainly be a satisfying watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most painfully underrated film I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has received much hate, which I believe is undeservedly. people have called this film ''the worst sequel ever'', praising the last film ''aliens'' by Cameron to be ''the best sequel ever''. however, i feel like this is unbelievably exaggerated. first of all ''aliens'' is not nearly as good a film as you might have been led to believe by it's huge amount of fans. I have to give credit to Cameron for not just rehashing the first alien film, but to name just a few of its many flaws; many of the characters are not memorable to say the least, and a few like hudson and Vasquez are just bland stereotypes. the film also feels dated and is painfully predictable. this brings us to the infamous alien 3.alien 3 begins with ripley's escape pod crashing on a prison planet called fiorina 'fury' 161, killing all of the surviving characters from the last film except ripley. many fans of James Cameron's ''aliens'' are outraged about how David fincher shamelessly got rid of their beloved characters. however, i've never been able to sympathise with characters like Hicks and Newt since i found them both to lack personality. in fact, i think their deaths add to the superb dark atmosphere of the film. for some reason, people often say they find the characters from alien 3 to be indistinguishable from each other. this is simply not true. most of the films characters are prisoners who have been shaved bold due to a lice problem. beside almost all characters being bold, it really isn't that hard separating them from one another. i had no trouble recognizing any of them. it's true the film focuses on just a few of the total of 25 prisoners but that's only logical and the characters the film does develop more deeply turn out te be very likable. the film doesn't rush right on to the action like the last film, but takes its time to make you like the characters you're supposed to like. It was actually a shame whenever one of the main characters died, a feeling i never experienced while watching aliens.the film has also been criticized on being to much alike the first alien film. I don't find this bad at all, to be honest. In my opinion, ''aliens'' kind of ruined the whole sense of terror behind the xenomorphs. Alien 3 revisits the idea of a single alien creature terrorizing a group of people and does it well. it doesn't simply copy the first film's story like many people blame it to , but uses the same concept in a whole different context. ripley being stuck between a bunch of rapists and murderers also gives the story a whole new dimension. the story isn't very complicated but is executed very well in my opinion.the thing that makes this movie really stand out for me is the visual style. the movie has a very dark atmosphere which i personally really enjoy. the dark feel of the film is archieved by using some great lighting, beautiful sets and lots of very effective shots. most of the time the alien effects are solid, though sometimes the alien clearly looks pasted in. Especially in the beginning of the film some alien effects look a bit fake but this is all made up for with the very exciting and visually stunning last scene of the film. the finale really got my blood pumping and ripley sacrificing herself for the good of humanity would have been a wonderful ending to the alien franchise (if it hadn't been ruined by resurrection, what's with the french and ruining everything?)all together, alien 3 is a painfully underrated movie. if you've seen the movie and didn't like it, i recommend giving the re-edited version of the film another try. you might even like it going in with the right attitude.4 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb, grim drama that beat all the odds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film. I really, really love this film.Panned as it was for having no guns or violence by the people who probably think Michael Bay is an Oscar winning director, the film shines in so many respects.Alien was a superb and original horror film, Aliens was a great all out action film with a brilliant atmosphere. Alien3 was passed off as a poor mans rip off of the first film when it is in fact an amazing character film.The cast is tremendous featuring an almost entirely vintage British lineup and the delivery of every line is so convincing with Charles Dance taking the biscuit for his amazing Thespien qualities. The sets are grim, industrial and have a character of their own that really makes for a great atmosphere. I've read about the 'Wooden planet' idea and various other script notions that came before but I truly think this was the perfect setting.I'm gushing but even I think that the film is far from perfect. The omission of Newt and Hicks was in very poor taste and served no purpose other than to make the struggle of the events and Aliens utterly pointless. While this does add to the nihilistic feel to the film and coupled with the fact that Carrie Henn would have been a great deal older when this film went into production when it was meant to be set weeks after Aliens it still seemed like a bad move. Also the killing off of such interesting characters like Clemens and Andrews seemed quite a strange decision especially as none of the other characters, good as they were got as much development.All this aside, the biggest kudos has to go to director David Fincher, who through oceans of studio interference and bungling stood what he possibly could of his ground and delivered an amazingly put together and thoroughly enjoyably dark film. I hear many folk slating Fincher for destroying the series but if these morons had bothered to do any research they would know that it was the constant changes and interfering from studio suits, who knew nothing of film making, that really made it suffer. The story is made even better by the Assembly cut which really filled in a lot of the gaps, but even the theatrical release is a fantastic accomplishment in the face of the crap that he had to put up with.If you don't like this then you really don't have the intelligence to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A return to the sensibilities of Alien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien3 attempts to undo much of the damage caused by action/special effects-fest Aliens and return the franchise more to its horror roots. The atmosphere is darker, the setting has a far more confined feel than the previous entry, and once again we have a small group trying to fend off a sole xenomorph.Although many have gawked at how this film departed from the previous title (going so far as to kill most of the previous movie's survivors offscreen), at the same time most of them ignore the fact that Aliens was a complete departure from the original film and turned the series into more of a light-hearted action romp than anything else (and although great in its own right, it should never have been called an Alien movie and would have been better off with a new alien species). Not so in the case of Alien3, as it brings the franchise straight back to its roots: A small group overwhelmed by a strange alien creature where they have to team up and improvise a way to overcome it (as opposed to having a well-equipped small army fight off enemy hordes).And while this sequel could be seen as somewhat unambitious, all the same it was well-made, well-acted, and stayed well within the theme of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad but not as good as the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gets a lot of crap because it was preceded by two much better movies. In truth I found Alien 3 to be the darkest of the series. The prison setting definitely adds a darker mood and feeling to the whole thing. I found that a few things did not make much sense when you looked back at the first two movies, such as (spoiler) {why could the alien come out of a dead animal but couldn't kill Ripley when she had the queen in her stomach? couldn't the queen come out of Ripley's dead body?} but such dissidence's are few and generally unnoticeable. However, to put it frankly, the theatrical version of this movie was missing something and palled in comparison to the first two. It felt strained and did not build up the terror and in the end felt like mindless violence. The added gore seemed like a filler for the fact that the movie lacked a good suspenseful set up.However I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 because after buying the Alien Quadrilogy I found that there was a special edition of this movie, and oh how much better it is. The length is increased to about 3 hours but its all worth it. The added time builds up the suspense much better and when the time finally arrives for the violence, gore and mayhem it all much more nicely set up and seems to have more purpose. Also, many scenes that were deleted contain some good dialogue that helps set up the dark mood of the prison and the feelings of the inmates to the terror that is the alien.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third entry in the Alien series is famous more for its script re-writes, disputes and problems rather than anything that happens in the movie, and has since been slated by fans and critics who expected much more. On the DVD we can see all these problems, the ideas that were thrown out, and how different the film could have been. Eventually Fincher got the director's job and did everything he could to make it good, all the while looking over his shoulders as ravenous producers repeatedly stepped in to make changes. What is left is a disappointment from one perspective, but a thoroughly good movie from another. Hicks and Newt, surviving characters from Aliens are killed off, rendering their escape pointless, and setting the gloomy tone for the movie. Bishop is destroyed and has no wish of being remade as a second grade model. After the excitement of the previous film, here we have one alien, and lots of talking. In this way it disappoints. However, watching it as the story of Ripley, of her never-ending nightmare, of a triumph of lighting, atmosphere and darkness, it works well. The tunnel chase scene is also one of the best movie moments of the decade. Therefore it is nowhere near as bad as many say it is, but it had the potential of being much better.Ripley's escape pod crashes on a prison planet, Fury 101. She is the only survivor, human survivor, and is brought into the prison causing much disruption. The inmates are all men, most murderers and rapists, sentenced to life, but they have adopted religion to get them through each day. There is no way off the planet, no weapons, and it seems a certain creature is loose. The Corporation hears of her survival and prepares to come 'rescue' her, but Ripley is more worried about survival as the Alien begins to pick off the inmates. However, a twist reveals that the Alien will let her live.Weaver is again very good, as are the rest of the cast, particularly Charles S. Dutton and the late Brian Glover. Unfortunately the rest of the cast all look identical, and most are killed without emotion. The score is good, the sets are impressive, and everything is dark and shadowy. The alien itself has changed, but the CG is poor. Many complained the film is too depressing, and if you like your films bright and with a happy ending then this is not for you. For fans of the series, most are split over its merits. I only really enjoyed it after a few watches.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The essence of a good review is not to give people a lecture on the making of a movie. It is to tell people if the movie is good or bad. The sordid production history of this POS should not influence in any way your opinion about its quality. We should always look at the end result, and in the case of Alien3 it is one of the worst sequels ever made. The script is incredibly dull with lots of plot holes and drag, the actors' performances are poor, Weaver is really really bad, the effects are atrocious even for a movie from 1992 (compared to brilliant contemporary movies such as Terminator 2 or Jurassic Park), and there is not a single moment of suspense in the entire movie. A shoddy piece of horror fiction that should have never been released, but the greedy studio couldn't keep their hands of this great Sci-Fi Duology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know people like to defend this movie and some even say it's their favorite, but I just can't get past it's obvious flaws. I blame the producers. These guys got lucky when Ridley Scott came along and they got lucky when James Cameron wrote and directed the 2nd film. On this their luck ran out and their stupidity kicked in. Throwing aliens onto the Sulaco in the beginning could be forgivable, but killing off the great characters Cameron created is not and the new edit of this film can't fix that, even though it is better. As far as I'm concerned this movie didn't happen and the 1st two are the only ones. There was actually a screenplay where Hicks was the main character and it set up a 4th film where Ripley would once again be the main character and they would go to "the source" to destroy the aliens once and for all. I read some of it and it was much better than what they ended up with. There were even a couple scripts where they used all new characters! How the hell did that happen? These producers were morons on this movie and they continue to profit of this series when Ridley Scott and James Cameron are the ones who really made it great. To hell with David Giler and Walter Hill. James Cameron told them he wanted to write and direct a 5th alien film as long as they didn't make the AVP movie. Now Cameron says forget it. These producers have effectively ruined the series regardless of how much money AVP made.</fullReview>

My opinion has changed after viewing it again and although it is neither as fresh as Alien or as exciting as Aliens it still is a fine film. Credit has to go to David Fincher for even attempting this sequel. I think if this had been the second in the series it would have failed. Fincher quite brilliantly recreates some of the tension of the original and manages to work in some great characters.I think that after Aliens, we all know exactly how deadly these creatures are, and to throw one in with a bunch of convicts with no weapons (except Ripley) works surprising well.Overall the movie delivers the terror and suspense, which when added to the shocking ending, makes for entertaining viewing yet again 8/10</fullReview>

It is not great but it does have some decent chills and it has a great ending that apparently sums up the series.The film is very dark and bleak and what I liked most about it was how Weaver seemed tired and beaten. She is so tired of facing " The Bitch " and she conveys that wonderfully. And even the alien seems tired of facing her. To really understand what is meant by all of this you have to watch it. It is not nearly as good as the second, but I believe it is better than the fourth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I appreciate that Alien 3 had numerous flaws, I can't help but wonder why so many people hate it so.The new Special Edition only re-enforces how fantastic this movie is. From the characters to the music, Alien 3 excels on all fronts, and with a constant tone of tradegy and hardship, the finale of Ripley's sacrifice becomes so profound.Other scenes, such as the cremation of Newt and Hicks, are very powerful. The relationship between Ripley and Clemens is perhaps her only tether to a normal life (until the Alien comes along in the infirmary to remind her otherwise!) There are aspects of the theatrical release I prefer over the Special Edition. I think the birth of the Alien from a dog was better than from an ox. Plus some genius ruined the emotional ending in the Special Edition by cutting the music in places and rushing through the swan dive sequence.Still, the Special Edition adds so much more to the characters in the film, especially the Golic character, who mysteriously disappeared in the theatrical cut. He has a much more significant role in the Special Edition.I think David Fincher is foolish for disowning this movie. Had he pushed for the cut footage to be restored sooner, he may have elevated both his and the films stature to at least equal that of the first two films.At times, Alien 3 is much better than Alien or Aliens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS--Being a big fan of the aliens trilogy, I have to say that I was quite disappointed with Alien 3. Firstly, the movie literally killed off Newt and Hicks in the beginning--two characters who would have both made a great sequel to Aliens. And furthermore, it also wiped out all the effort Ripley put into protecting Newt, and in the end, she drowns when the ship crashes into the ocean. In addition: Hicks's death marked the complete annihilation of the marine platoon in Aliens. And even worst: Ripley died at the end!! The most questionable thing in Alien 3 is how on earth another facehugger got on the ship. The queen could not have laid an egg on the ship, because that would take ages. And since when did a single facehugger be able to impregnate two different victims with two different types of aliens? These strange things are the reasons of Alien 3's unfolding story. Which means: Alien 3 should not even have existed. On the plus side: Alien 3 sports some really good acting, and a lot of suspense. There's a lot of blood in it, too. The scenes when the alien chases the colonizers were well-done, which the same can be said for the alien itself. The ending was also good. When everyone who watched it left the cinema, I was fascinated to find out that NOBODY was talking to each other. All in all, Alien 3 isn't such a bad movie, but for a hardcore Aliens trilogy fan, it is the lousiest of the bunch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In fact, i KNOW i need more of a life, but i seriously enjoyed this installment of the bug-bashing saga.To be honest, it is near impossible for ANYTHING to surpass the gung-ho action of Aliens, or the groundbreaking creepiness of Alien, but i cannot see anything truly bad about this movie, or anything that warrants it being labelled as "bad".Biased Aliens fan that i am, i can honestly rate this as good. Not many films get to Number 3 and still remain as enjoyable as this. I cant help feeling a lot of critics bashed this solely on the basis of it being "yet another sequel" Very worthy IMO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Devil's Due</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film (if we overlook the fact that it was handicapped from the beginning in terms of script, budget, and too many cooks in the kitchen), is a movie that was supposed to be the end of Ripley's journey through hell. It's not about a glorious last stand or starting her life over after the threat has past. It is the end of her long nightmare.As Lance Henriksen points out on the commentary, "it's nihilism on top of nihilism, I didn't know who to care about..." There are no heroes on Fury, there are no innocents, just flawed, hard people awaiting their fate. Keeping Hicks or Newt (or Bishop) would have compromised that, that couldn't have had the same ending. This film could go only one place with these kinds of characters.SPOILER WARNINGAlien 3 is all about the last ten minutes of the film, with her suicide to save humanity (and to finish the dance with her devil), and her transmission from the Nostromo (at the end of Alien) echoed, ending the series in an heartbreaking way. The moment the Nostromo lifted off from LV-426, everyone on board that ship was already dead. She was doomed from the beginning and in Alien 3, she finally realizes that on many levels.Not saying I'm happy about certain things, but over time, the movie grew on me and ultimately I'm glad that they went the route that they did. It's a very dark film that was supposed to cap the series and I'm sort of sad the studio didn't just let it be (Resurrection was fine but even Joss Whedon regards it as a bad movie.) The film, to me, is unconventional by setting itself apart from great predecessors, instead of simply copying them. That took guts on Fincher's part and I respect that.Alien 3 is a gritty, fatalistic movie that dared to show not every story about monsters has a happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 starts on the 'US Sulaco' as an electrical fire enables an automated cryo unit jettison procedure &amp; Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Hicks (Michael Biehn who apparently was paid more for the use of his image in Alien 3 than he did for his entire role in Aliens (1986), nice work if you can get it), the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen) &amp; Newt (Danielle Edmond) spiral towards 'Fiorina "Fury" 161 Outer-Veil Mineral Ore Refinery Double Y Chromosome-Work Correctional Facility', basically an old lead works turned prison planet for hardened criminals. Upon crash landing Hicks &amp; Newt are killed &amp; Bishop is damaged beyond repair but Ripley survives &amp; is rescued by the convicts who now inhabit Fiorina, as they help Ripley a dog belonging to one of the prisoners sees something crawling in the shadows... Ripley is taken to the prisons Doctor, Clemens (Charles Dance) where she is given the OK but straight away Ripley's thoughts turn to the alien &amp; whether once again it has followed her. The dog is now in pain &amp; convulsing as eventually an alien bursts out of it's stomach &amp; when it kills an inmate named Murphy (Christopher Fairbank) Ripley tries to convince Warden Andrews (Brian Glover) that the ultimate alien killing machine is loose somewhere in the complex...Directed by David Fincher who has disowned the film due to constant studio interference I thought Alien 3 was a fine film, considering it had a hell of a lot to live up to in it's illustrious predecessors Alien (1979) &amp; Aliens it didn't turn out so bad. Alien 3 was also plagued by production problems, a spiralling budget (I bet Fox liked that), $7 million in built sets for a script that was never used, various directors dropping out or being fired &amp; filming being halted by Fox because of the troubles so it's a surprise that it ended up as good as it did. The script by David Giler, Walter Hill &amp; Larry Ferguson is a little slow &amp; virtually relegates the alien to a bit part as Weaver's Ripley takes centre stage. Ripley's character is explored more here than the previous two films, in fact Alien 3 revolves around her more than the alien which pops up occasionally to kill a prisoner until the final 20 or so minutes when it actually has some significance to the on screen action. I thought the ending rounded things off nicely, that was until Alien: Resurrection (1997) was made anyway. I also thought that Alien 3 tries to blend some of the best elements from the first two, the dark haunted house in space feel of the original &amp; the action &amp; chases of the second. Technically I think Alien 3 is marvellous, I love the way Fincher films shots with an almost candlelit pale yellow hue throughout, lots of great angles, cool shots &amp; well composed framing of images. The production design is also fantastic with a realistic looking gritty lead works setting, while the first two Alien films are futuristic in look Alien 3 has the feel of being set in a Victorian factory with it's pipes dripping water, brickwork walls, darkly lit corridors, industrial machinery &amp; chains all over the place, the sets have a huge amount of detail &amp; a lot of time, effort &amp; work obviously went into the look &amp; feel of Alien 3. Unfortunately the alien itself doesn't get much screen time &amp; while the puppet effects are good with plenty of slime the CGI effects look pretty poor these days. There is some violence here but not too much, mostly blood splats on walls although there is a quick shot when the alien bites into someones head. The acting is good from all involved with Yorkshire man Glover being quite likable. It must have been tough making a sequel to two of the greatest Sc-Fi horror films ever made but everything considered I think Alien 3 doesn't embarrass itself at all. Despite being a bit slow in places &amp; making the alien seem like an afterthought on occasion I found an entertaining &amp; watchable film which I enjoyed. Definitely worth a watch for both Sci-Fi &amp; horror fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ripley has done it again. The first time the alien was alone the next time she faced hundreds. Both times with the aid of weapons. During the showdown Ripley sucked the alien out into space. At least thats what it seemed like. The second time the alien queen laid an egg on Ripley's spaceship before she attacked Bishop. This time its different the deed of killing the alien won't be that easy. The egg hatched and a facehugger attached itself to a dog. Also Ripley has crashed onto a prison planet with no weapons allowed. The closest things they have to weapons are fire axes and knives. When Ripley awakens she finds out that Newt and Hicks are dead. At the funeral the dog dies and we are introduced to a new breed of alien. An alien that walks on all fours! Strange things are happening. Ripley works with Clemens to find out what has happened to some of the dead prisoners. One of the prisoners who has seen a killing is Golic. After seeing his fellow prisoners brutally slaughtered by the alien he goes crazy.While this is happening Ripley asks Bishop if there was an alien on board the ship and Bishop replies Yes. In one part when Ripley and Clemens are operating on Golic Ripley sees Golic panicking and turns around just in time to see Clemens get decapitated. Ripley leaves to find everybody else and warn them and just as she arrives Andrews says GET THIS FOOLISH WOMAN BACK TO THE INFIRMARY! He was standing underneath an air duct as he said this. Then some hands come down drag him up to the ceiling. Everybody hears Andrews scream and look around then they all start panicking. In the very end Ripley kills herself to save the galaxy from the alien menace. Right as she falls into a molten pit a chestburster erupts from within her. This is a great movie.Now go watch this and decide for yourself if you like this movie as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Darkened golden, oily metal surfaces crusty with grim, decaying technology that has outlived its use, gloomy corridors dripping with nameless dirt: this is the nightmare into which we are released, to race the devil. This is the most hopeless Alien world-scape. It is a perfect dystopia, a terrifying image of a future gone irreversibly wrong. Furia 161 is its own hell, and long before the advent of the monster in its decaying premises, it already harbored the horror of a "locus horrendous" where distances expand into oblivious recesses of barren bleakness. And that is exactly what transpires through this movie, a bleak atmosphere enhanced by a slow pace digested through a strong set of impressive imagery to which we add a convincing character study that deepens the ruthless onslaught of merciless despair. The viewer is treated to a whole display of intensely disturbing scenes that have a double impact: a visual expressiveness that doubles its narrative relevance and a sub-textual message dictated through somewhat ambiguous lines. '***spoiler*** That is the case of the autopsy done on Newt's frozen body, of which we see preciously little but that hits a nerve nevertheless: the bloodied surgical instruments clanging against the hard blue metal and Ripley's intense anguish are enough to sober the audience into a sense of profound and unrelenting grief. Or the scene in which we hear the sermon on death being but a new beginning: interspersed with the funeral of Newt and Hicks we are treated to the birth of the Alien, thus hinting to yet another possible interpretation that links this passage to the corrosive ending.***end spoiler***Alien3 goes back to the basics: there is only one Alien, and the means to stop it are far from being competent to the task. And our heroine is a battered, hurt and still unbelievingly strong character, bent on destroying the beast within. In a very literal way, this nihilistic installment is the concretization of all of Ripley's fears: we have seen her panic at the thought of becoming impregnated with an Alien embryo, witnessed her formidable struggle to keep innocence alive in the shape of Newt, were privy to her all abiding combat skills being honed to the extreme as she became the icon of never desisting mankind, all this wide range of emotional states have been shared with us, taking this particular character as the medium. And Alien3 seems to raze out all of her former accomplishments, it gives the desolate impression that all of her efforts were for nothing and that nothing can be sheltered and saved from destruction. This time, the enemy is truly within, and Ripley finally becomes the transcendental figure of conquering victory as she embraces her destiny, in the way she deals with all that befalls her. ***Spoiler*** The temptation scene, in which Ripley is offered a life at the expense of letting the Alien species survive, is one of the most intense of the whole series, as is the one in which she decides to forfeit that life for the sake of something greater. It is through this act that Ripley manages to give continuity to her project of an Alien-free universe.***End Spoiler***There are quite a few hermeneutic subtleties that find their way to the gritty, blood smeared screen, and there are a few that most likely escaped me. The role of fire in its most symbolic form, how religious belief is brought to its shocking hollowness when put in contrast with the flesh grinding reality, the inversion and double role of maternal instinct entwined with deadly consequences, the horrifying intimacy and rape-like situation that the Alien's reproduction entails, the complete pervasion of giving birth distorted to an image of bloody slaughter, the duality of gender issues in the awful figure of the Alien, all elements combine and interact to build a strong, fierce and final chapter of the series: making all further entries nothing but flawed and completely unnecessary watered down versions of what should never be duplicated or cloned (read that as you will). ***mild spoiler*** This is proved by the simple way in which the very ending ties Alien3 to the grand original: This is Commander Ripley, last surviver of the Nostromo. Signing out.***end spoiler*** Without a doubt, it is brilliant in its sheer violence, tactful in its emotional appeal, perfect in its thoughtful use of imagery, and altogether sublime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By a narrow margin, this is actually my favorite entry in the Alien series. Maybe it's because I recognize all the British actors from "Withnail &amp; I" and "Doctor Who," and I get nostalgic...but I think there's more to it than that.I prefer the notion of one all-powerful Alien creature to the hordes of mindless drones that appeared in "Aliens." I also quite like the strange cast of characters on display here - the soft-spoken doctor played so well by Charles Dance, the hapless "85," and Charles S. Dutton's bad-a** preacher man. They're so much more distinctive than big bunches of marines, and even the Nostromo crew members in the first "Alien" film. So I care more, here, when people die.Granted, the special effects are a bit lacking - there's none of the action spectacle of "Aliens" in this film, and the creature itself looks obviously animated in far shots. But the sets are truly stunning, and the level of violence is balanced pretty well - it's more frightening than gross. The longer special edition, available now on DVD, actually hurts the movie a bit - I prefer the leaner, meaner original. And I don't particularly care that the director has disowned the film in all its versions - since he went on to direct rubbish like "The Game" and the forceful but too-grotesque "Fight Club," I think we can dismiss his opinion and just enjoy "Alien 3" ourselves...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Special Edition. I love it, I really do. OK! So it's basically a monster on the loose piece, but the setting at a sci-fi prison colony - complete with nutty religious shards - makes for a thrillingly atmospheric ride. A roll call of Brit thesps line up for some tension filled entertainment, while director David Fincher and cinematographer Alex Thomson provide a look that is both beautiful and scary. Industrial Punk? Steam Punk? Cyber Punk? Fincher Punk? Hey man, we gotta give it a name! And of course there's Siggy Weaver, the reassuring presence. I could live without the attempt at a transcendent finale, but in extended form this has much to light your fires. It also showed that Fincher would be a director to watch - imagine if had he been left alone to craft his own vision? His subsequent career and standing makes a mockery of the studio execs involved in the making of Alien?. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a big step down from the previous two masterpieces but still the film is good. It has a great setting and has great characters and an interesting story but the problem is that this film has to compete with Alien and Aliens which were groundbreaking this is just a good film but it ain't gonna be a huge classic and considered greatest of all time. This should have been where it ended but they make a fourth one because money but the first three alien films lets just forget about four so the first two were classics this was still good but not on the level with the first two it suffered form the God farther three syndrome. The acting is alright I mean it seemed like there was problems on set to the point where no one cared which is true the studio kept getting involved with the film and ruining it. I can understand that people would be disappointed since they were probably expecting another masterpiece but even if the studio didn't get involved the movie probably would have been still good but hated by most.The plot involves Ripley waking up from the ship which crashed on some planet. Ripley who is the only survivor go to the prison where she gets help for her injuries and stays until rescue comes. They then find a Xenomorph is in the prison and starts killing them and that's the movie without me ruining anything for you.The movie is good and better then what most people make of it so yeah watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weakest link in the Alien series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Alien3 at the movie theatre in 1992. Since I'd preferred the ominous atmosphere of Alien to the all-out action of Aliens, the promise that Alien3 would return to the sheer terror and claustrophobic feel of the first movie really piqued my interest. Unfortunately, Alien3 could not live up to expectations.I remember, I found it passable but overall a big disappointment. From a technical point of view, the best sequence are the opening credits - that is, if you don't mind that Fincher basically destroys everything that the ending of Aliens had promised.The settings are bleak, the characters shallow and uninteresting (save for Clemens, but he gets too little screen time). The whole plot feels very forced, and the alien effects are mostly second-rate. (Not only in retrospect, they were B-level at the time, as well.)I have rewatched the movie several times since then (as part of the series), but even time couldn't help this mess. There are good bits here and there, and it's an important link story-wise in the saga (you can't just skip it, unfortunately), but all in all, a depressing and ultimately forgettable experience.PS: Don't bother with the extended cut. It doesn't make much difference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I enjoy the "Alien" franchise, then there is of course one seed in everything that doesn't grow up to be as impressive as all the others. And in my opinion, then "Alien?" is that one 'bad seed'. While the fact that it is an "Alien" movie is good, then the movie was just hindered by some questionable choices from the writers and director David Fincher.The concept idea for "Alien?" was alright and it did have lots of potential. However, director David Fincher just didn't fully utilize the potential that was made available for this movie. And that was a shame, because "Alien?" could have been so much more than the mediocre result that it turned out to be.The story was just a tad too convenient, especially in the terms of writing off the Rebecca "Newt" Jorden, Corporal Dwayne Hicks and the synthetic Bishop characters. I never understood why they wrote off these characters, perhaps because none of the original performers, aside from Lance Henriksen, returned to the franchise. And also that what looked like a miniature egg had managed to get onto the space vessel was just a bit too scripted and forced. But the idea of the story taking place on a prison planet was interesting enough and had some interesting things to it.Now, the things that did work out well enough in favor of "Alien?" was the cast, as they had managed to get some pretty good talents to star in this third movie. Sigourney Weaver is of course a given for the "Alien" movie, and alongside her were the talents of Charles Dance, Charles S. Dutton and a short voice cameo by Lance Henriksen.What killed off "Alien?" for me was the horrible CGI effects that they used in the movie instead of a physical prosthetic puppet or something. It was so bluntly in-your-face fake and bad to look at, especially with that black outlining aura that was around it. The CGI in a movie such as this has to be believable, and trust me, it was nowhere near believable in "Alien?".I will say that the alien creature design was interesting, as it deviated a lot from the creature design of the 1979 and 1986 movies. And that was in itself a refreshing change of pace for the franchise. Just a shame it was so poorly brought to the screen by some very questionable CGI effects."Alien?" is enjoyable enough if you enjoy the "Alien" franchise, but the movie in itself a weak addition to the franchise. I am rating "Alien?" a mediocre five out of ten stars.</fullReview>

It still has some great moments tho Ripley and the Dog Alien is one of them. The effects in this one is not that great either especially the stop motion/cgi on the Alien also the direction is pretty much stupid a very young David Fincher trying to take the torch from Ridley Scott and James Cameron and he fails in most of the things the first 2 had and let's not forget the worst thing from the film the great characters from the 2nd film all died Hicks, Bishop and Newt. It never reaches the heights of the first 2 films but it's still watchable but for sure it's the lowest in the franchise. A 7 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why this movie gets such a low score. Honestly, I really liked this movie and yes there are some flaws but in the end it's a very enjoyable movie. It's not easy to make sequel to the excellent 2 movies by Ridley Scott and James Cameron but I think David Fincher did a good job. Now to be clear I gave both Alien and Aliens a 10/10. This one gets an 8/10.Pros: - Characters that have an interesting background. - Some great chase scenes (especially with the first person camera angle of the alien which is very nice and creative). - Great atmosphere (not as good as first 2 movies but it gets close) - Some interesting ideas like for example the idea that the alien breaks out the stomach of a dog/cow (depends on what version you watch), they could have been lazy and picked a random human to get face-hugged again but they tried something else, which I admire. - The prison planet was a good setting in my opinion. - David Fincher was not afraid to kill of Ripley and end the series (atleast that was the idea) with Alien3 - Charles S. Dutton is amazing in this movie. Such a good performance by him. - I have to mention the scene where Boggs and Rains are basically insulting Golic right in his face, I don't know why but I feel so sorry for Golic in that scene (very well done in my opinion). Some of you might find it a stupid scene but I liked it. Cons: - The movie could have been shorter. After the scene in the middle of the movie where they capture the alien, it feels like the movie is dragging on just to make it longer. I will add to this that towards the last 30 minutes it gets very interesting again. - Some of the alien effects (I would say about 10%) don't look that great but don't forget that this movie came out in 1992 so that's forgivable in my honest opinion.This is of course my opinion but in my opinion this movie should get a little bit more respect. If a movie like AVP can get more than a 5 out of 10 then this one deserves definitely a lot more than the 6,4/10 it has right now on this site).Alien was a perfect horror movie with a lot of suspense, Aliens was a fantastic action movie, Alien3 is somewhere in between so if you like a mix of the 2 movies then this is definitely a good option. Don't expect it to be as perfect as the first 2 movies and you'll have a great time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien and Aliens are both masterpieces. Although the movies are in the same franchise, the genres are very different. Alien is more of a horror movie and Aliens is more of an action movie. I wish I knew what this one tried to be...Aliens ended with Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop getting in cryosleep for their return home to earth. This one starts of with killing everyone off except Ripley. Bishop is reconnected for like two minutes, but asks Ripley to shut him down. Why begin a movie like this? Newt, Hicks and Bishop were GREAT characters! So killing them of immediately in this one means that the studio and/or the screenwriters didn't care for them at all! I don't know a single person who thinks this was the right way to go after a movie like Aliens! And I hope I never will, because it's stupid!This movie had a very misleading trailer with the tag line "on earth, everyone can hear you scream". It appears that this movie doesn't takes PLACE on earth! It takes place on some weird prison planet, owned by "the company" ,instead. I know this movie's production was hell, but don't release a trailer like that when the movie isn't finished!I don't have that many problems with the inmates on the planet. Almost every one of them gets killed by that 'dogalien' (yeah that's what the Alien in this movie is called by the fans). But I don't think they are that annoying.I really liked Charles Dance's character. He plays my favorite character Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones, so when I heard he was in this movie, I was excited to see if he could bring something to a movie like this. And he did! He is actually the only good thing in whole movie! He even made me forget what had happened to the characters from Aliens. He is that good!But he gets killed off after like 45 minutes and nothing good happens after that in the entire movie!Sigourney Weaver is one of the coolest action actors ever, if not THE coolest! But she didn't looked that interested to be in this movie. And the way they tried to end her character's legacy was very lame. Still better handled than Alien: Resurrection, I suppose...This is not a good movie. If you gonna have an Alien binge watching night, please stop watching after Aliens...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you watch the first three Alien films in succession you'll probably be disappointed with this entry in the franchise. The sequels do appear to be derivative of the original with a lot of mileage wrung out of the concepts delivered in the first movie. But if you watch "Alien 3" as a stand alone flick I don't think it's too bad. Unless you're totally invested in the Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) character because she comes to a bad end here. The chest burster theme is revisited just as Ripley makes the ultimate sacrifice, reminiscent of one of the Terminator sequels actually. I guess after a while it gets more and more difficult to come up with creative endings. As for the monster itself, it's not as big and scary as one might expect going in, and there's only one of them to terrorize the prison colony of Weyland-Yutani. The business with Bishop's (Lance Henricksen) synthetic humanoid was a cool way to keep his character part of the continuity and the twist with Clemens (Charles Dance) getting snuffed by the Alien after he'd built a rapport with Ripley was somewhat unexpected. Of course we'll never see Ripley again (yeah, right), but over all, as a quick sci-fi/horror diversion, this one is worth a look if you've seen the first two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Alien?" (1992) has two sides. As a standalone movie it's not bad, but as a sequel to two classics, it'a a bad one. Sure, it's easy to dismiss this movie and call it bad when you compare it to two movies masterpieces. Two things that were interesting in this flick every time i watched it were surprisingly to me Charles Dance's character Clemens, and second Ellen Ripley of course. Clemens was the most interesting character in this movie. I know that this movie have had big problems during making, especially script rewrites, and you can clearly see this, it has plot holes, and not really focused on anything. Even creature itself was a big letdown - take whatever you want scene from "Aliens" with the creature and you will see that on 18 million dollars budget (4 times smaller than Alien?) maestro J.Cameron made a multi times better looking creatures than this one, which is sometimes CGI, good at the time, but very out dated now. I saw "Aliens" and "Alien?" recently back to back in one day, and "Aliens" put "Alien?" on a shame in every possible way. Sadly "Alien?" is not comparable movie with it's precedes.Overall, "Alien?" is not a bad film, just don't even try to compare it to "Alien" or "Aliens", and it's not a bad flick. I even voted 9/10 just for the love of this masterful franchise, which is probably my favorite ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compared To Alien &amp; Aliens, It's An Atrocity. As A Standalone Feature, It's Not That Bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien? often gets a lot of criticism from most fans of the first two chapters of Alien franchise &amp; in a way it deserves that. In its very opening moments, this film makes a huge mistake of killing all the characters who survived in the last film, leaving behind only Ripley &amp; thus taking the whole premise back to square one. Compared to Ridley Scott's Alien &amp; James Cameron's Aliens, Alien? is an atrocity. As a standalone feature however, it's not too shabby.Alien? opens with the shot of escape pod carrying the survivors of the last film crash-landing on a prison-run refinery planet, killing all but Ellen Ripley. However, on researching about what caused the crash, she finds out that an alien organism was on board with them all the time. As the new-born alien matures &amp; begins its killing spree, Ripley tries to warn the inhabitants about the grave situation they are in &amp; eventually discovers a deeply disturbing secret about herself.Directed by David Fincher, the film marks his feature film debut but was a harrowing experience for him. Troubled production, numerous rewrites, shooting without a finished script, constant interruptions by the producers, creative differences &amp; then a complete dismantling of the director's version by the studio &amp; reworking the plot for its theatrical release, it's no wonder why Fincher left the project before production ended &amp; still hates it more than anyone else.Despite having more budget than the previous two chapters combined, Alien? is still a huge downgrade in every filmmaking department. There is less suspense, less action, no real sense of direction &amp; it's far more predictable than expected. The sets do provide an inhospitable look to the film but there is nothing impressive about it. Camera-work isn't that bad while editing is fine considering that it's the pathetic screenplay that's the main culprit here.Coming to the performances, apart from the characters of Ellen Ripley &amp; a couple more planet's inhabitants, the rest are present in the film as death fodders only. And although Sigourney Weaver chips in nicely as Ripley, others are found hamming like crazy in their given roles. The alien creature itself is given a new design but it's so poorly rendered that it never really looks like a part of the picture but a highly artificial entity superimposed on the screen.On an overall scale, Alien? manages to work in bits n pieces and as a standalone film is slowly gaining a cult following of lately. It is quite entertaining, some sequences are excellently filmed, Weaver manages to impress again but the negatives far outweighs the positives this time as it really makes you wonder where the hell all its budget was spent on considering its poor visual effects, not-so-impressive set designs &amp; shoddily rendered alien. It's best to approach this film without expecting anything like its predecessors or else you're destined to hate it.P.S. Make sure you grab the Assembly Cut instead of the Theatrical version for the former is little bit close to the rough vision David Fincher had in mind while crafting this feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a trick to getting something out of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, let me get off my chest that I loved 'Alien' and 'Aliens,' therefore, I was one of the legions of fanboys who eagerly awaited the next instalment of the franchise. And, like so many others, I was left severely disappointed at what I got.Alien 3 continues the story, but just wasn't what the - numerous - fans were after. You can look up online as to the many problems the production went through. To this day the director has still disowned it.I hated it. People were basically expecting 'Aliens Part II' and they got this. They say a sequel should be 'everything good about the original and more.' Aliens is one of the few films where (some) people claim it is actually an improvement on the original. Whether you agree with that or not, it does offer 'the same and more' of its predecessor. Alien 3 didn't just take one step back, but TWO. It's less tense than Alien and not as action-packed with such memorable characters as Aliens.So, it was pretty much despised by all. However, I still watch it from time to time (mainly the extended 2003 edition - you don't want to bother with the original cut) and, begrudgingly, it does have its merits - not many, but a few. The trick to enjoying it is to simply not consider it a part of the Alien franchise. Don't think of it as the sequel to Aliens, but just a horror/sci-fi movie. To me the saga ended with Aliens. I watch this for something different. It is well-directed, with its distinct own look. Plus it succeeds in creating a very bleak atmosphere and vision of the future (in stark contrast to the upbeat ending of Aliens). The sets are nice, too.Overall, it's not the travesty that so many - including me - once made it out to be. It'll never be Alien or Aliens, but let it be what it is - a stand-alone effort which dares to try and explore new territory (albeit with mixed results).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most underestimated movie, unfortunately! Before the set, the idea was to complete the series of Ripley's journey to this rough life and i think David Fincher did this work well, if we will take into account that producer's was not satisfied by Fincher's vision of the story.Some one will say that Ripley is acting a tad strange in this movie, that she was a very smart woman in the other two films and what happened in this one? This question is for those who not seen previous series. She acting like she tired of all this - her daughter is dead, as we know from the Alien's, and Amanda is dead now too. The atmosphere of screenplay show's that everything Ripley does is doomed! In the end she find's the only way to finish with all this by suicide. What else you expected from this? The Happy end? Its the greatest movie i every seen. The screenplay is an extraordinary - you will not find like this one anywhere. Every time i watch it, especially the Director's Cut version, i found something new for my self. The beast can be not only in the Alien but in a human species also - the most dangered in the world!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Action, Less Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Alien 3" follows the character Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) into an action again as she falls deeper into the the world of the aliens she has grown so familiar with. She begins to become more militant and less like her old self because of everything she has gone through (see the first two films). Ripley's inner strength is stronger than ever and her determination is more powerful in the third installment of the franchise."Alien 3" is a good movie I do like it - yet, for me, the movie franchise has grown more in the direction of action and less in focus on the storyline. It's a great film for action movie lovers but not so great for those of us wanting more mystery added to this story and the entire franchise. *In reference to the first film of the series "Alien".7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling and claustrophobic third installment in which the alien regenerates and causes wreak havoc on an isolated planet prison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ripley continues to be stalked by a savage alien, after her escape pod crashes on a prison planet inhabited by fanatic inmates (a British cast formed by Paul McGann , Brian Glover , Ralph Brown , Danny Webb , Pete Postlethwaite and Charles Dance as a doctor) led by Dillon (Charles S Dutton) , the leader of a religious cult . This is a visually impressive and exciting Sci/Fi following though mostly dark with plenty of thrills , action , chills and many other things . Ripley must continue her war against the Aliens . As Aliens escape and then the prisoners Earthlings have a hard time figuring out the whereabout of the heinous beings that are running amok . Spectacular sequel with twisted intrigue , disgusting special effects and lots of blood and gore . This horrifying as well as heart-pounding movie contains shocks , stomach-churning violence , chills , profanity , thrills and results to be pretty entertaining . This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and good acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s , 80s and 90s. The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters .The concept by Vincent Ward based on which the movie was green-lighted involved an artificially constructed wooden planetoid and a group of monks who thought they were living in post-apocalyptic dark ages, and had a middle-ages lifestyle ; the group refused all kinds of modern technology, and when Ripley and the Alien crash-land on it, they would blame Ripley for the Alien attacks. Spectacular as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creatures , originally created by the artist HR Giger . The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien and with breathtaking scenes that took various weeks to film . The original budget was $45 million which included Sigourney Weaver's fee of $5.5 million , the budget soon spiraled however, with first Renny Harlin and then Vincent Ward both leaving the project before novice feature film director David Fincher came on board . Sigourney Weaver had a clause in her contract specifying that Walter Hill and David Giler would write the final shooting script. Weaver has said that she considers Ripley a very difficult character to write, and, with the exception of James Cameron, only Giler and Hill have really ever written the character correctly. The picture packs an original music by Elliot Goldenthal , plenty of frightening and moving sounds . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Alex Thomson , this cinematographer replaced Jordan Cronenweth after only two weeks of filming, after he began to suffer the onset of Parkinson's Disease . Sets were toned down in scale and a more claustrophobic shooting approach with a lot of close-ups to characters' faces was taken . On the set at Pinewood Studios, a giant lead foundry took 12 weeks to construct and put the production way behind . In wide shots, most of the refinery is actually made of cardboard . The motion picture was professionally directed by David Fincher and spent over a year in editing . Although this was first-time director David Fincher disowned the film, citing constant studio interference and actually walked out of production before editing began. Because of continuing troubles with the film, Fox halted production in Pinewood Studios in England in late 1991 ; the crew returned to LA, and an initial screening identified the missing parts of the film. A major part yet to be shot included killing of the alien in the lead pool .The gaps between the four Alien films steadily decreased. There was seven years between the release of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), six between Aliens and Alien 3 (1992), and five between Alien? and Alien resurrection (1997). The original and the best was Alien by Ridley Scott , it was starred by Weaver , John Hurt, Lance Henriksen , Ian Holm , Tom Skerrit , Harry Dean Stanton , Ian Holm , John Hurt ; it is followed by Aliens , also visually astounding by James Cameron with Paul Reiser , Bill Paxton , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen ; and this Alien . All of them starred by the great Sigourney Weaver who performed one of the best female leads created in years . Furthermore, Alien vs. Predator (2004) by Paul Anderson with Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Lance Henriksen , Colin Salmon , Tommy Flannagan and Aliens vs. Predator 2 (2007) by Strause Brothers with Steven Pasquale , Reiko Aylesworth , John Ortiz , Johnny Lewis and Robert Joy .</fullReview>

She then kills herself in an effort to keep the government from taking her and the alien inside of her and creating military-grade weapons out of them. First off, this film ain't as bad as everybody make it out to be. This film is quite charming when you look at how the story fits somewhat into the rest of the franchise and its exquisite use of hybrid aliens. I would have to say that this is maybe the worst of the franchise, BUT the franchise itself is excellent and there haven't been a bonafide flops.

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Mess: Alien 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years I've kind of felt like this movie's Attorney, I recently noticed the long stretch of negative reviews from here to youtube treating this movie like an STD or something so I thought I'd come to its rescue because it is Far from a bad movie and it does Far more right than it does wrong. So where do I begin...Alien 3 is what we call a beautiful mess, its beautiful but its a mess.So let me attempt appeal to the jury of haters by shedding light on this movie's hellish production. The movie was abused at the birth of its concept to the adolescence of its choppy final edit. Fox studios went off on a node cycling and terminating through eight directors, pitching stupid concepts and premises from cow aliens to armies of queen aliens fighting armies of powerloaders. Huge sets were built and torn down when the script changed. Since Fox officials and producers couldn't settle their creative differences on a decent plot they ordered filming commence without a script even being composed, probably one the most insane filmmaking decisions in history. David Fincher (Se7en,Fight Club, Girl With the dragon tattoo remake, the social network) yea that talented guy, this was his film debut as a movie director and Fox had him writing the script while filming. The list of doomings goes on. The insanity of making the film and fighting with Giler at Pinewood must have been traumatic for Fincher because he refuses to talk about the experience and has since isolated himself from having anything to do with the project, one can only speculate what kind of antics Fox kept him from disclosing, in the end it was Fox who treated the film as an article of commerce prior its release. The movie was edited with a few deep abrasions after going millions over budget (the team behind the assembly cut had said how they had found whole entire rooms full of discarded alien 3 footage from script rewrites and filmmaking insanity.)The controversy of what's good and bad with the film is nauseating and for the most part the opinions are mixed, either you absolutely love this film or infinitely hate the seed that spawned its existence. The film has quite a few continuity errors starting right in the very beginning, pointing out "the magic egg," a bad screen writer put it there, it honestly appears on the sulacco for no reason. The movie also makes a (debatably)brave move to arbitrarily kill Newt, and Hicks off screen and recycle Bishop, the reason why a lot of attached Aliens fans curse this movie. Alien 3 is dark, beautifully dark, from the twin sunned trashy refinery wasteland that is the prison complex to the golden brown tunnels, low camera angles, and Elliot Goldenthal's beautiful score is all part of Fincher's style that aesthetically and artistically is done so well, its a void of embellished depression. The scene where Ripley discovers the alien queen on the cat scan was a truly amazing scene Sigourney Weaver's acting was superb and so was Charles Dutton and the rest of the cast. Bald Ripley was interesting to see, a kind of a cancer/aids metaphor. The killing of Newt and Hicks (though I'd like to imagine them in this movie alive) tones out the mood of the film and adds some hard hitting drama, I guess people must have forget that the entire chemistry of the first alien is dark as hell why complain about that here. It goes back to the essence of the first film. Aside from the guy in the suit the alien is composed of some rod puppetry optically composited into the film not cgi, a few scenes in particular just look awesome but I do admit one or two of alien effects didn't look so great in the Pete Postlewaite chase scene. I recall this got an Oscar nomination for best visuals, yet everyone ironically complains about them? For some Alien 3 just puts you in a place you really don't want to be in, having the disturbing opportunity to actually see an alien eat a guys chest out or being reminded that rusty prisons in deep space make cancer metaphors suck even more. But for others its cinematically awesome especially if you're an alien fan. For me this one is a love hate relationship, I absolutely love the movie and everything that it is, but I absolutely hate the fact that its production left it unfinished and Newt, Hicks and Bishop not being present but yet I love how their deaths tone out the film, but then I think of the atrocity it spawned after that was alien resurrection. Many people who watch the assembly cut end up liking it better but really the special edition just drags on and is notably spliced with old footage filled with unfinished affects, and a dead bull."If we failed to do one thing in this film, and we failed to do many things, it was to take people out of their everyday lives. It's not a scary scare movie but a queasy scare movie and I think people resent that. Actually, my dentist, as he was drilling my teeth, was giving me his thesis on the things wrong with this film and he said, 'When you go out of this movie you haven't gotten away from Aids, you haven't gotten away from race riots, you haven't gotten away from fear of other cultures.' We tried to make a movie about now and I just think in terms of the world box office we may have chosen wrong ? You know, if I make 10 shitty movies, I'll deserve the flak and if I go on to make 10 great ones, this'll probably be looked upon as my first bungled masterpiece." David Fincher, The Independent, 1992.Ironic right. The film just sits on a weird fulcrum of emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien? ? Gritty, down and dirty fight to the finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien? is, to me, the unloved child of the Alien series. If not as good as the other two preceding it, David Fincher's attempt was a successful one nonetheless. It came full circle by going back to "weaponless" confrontation with the beast. I think that, combined with a revolting dirty low-tech environment, rebuffed most watchers.The good. Imaginative environment. Tight scenario with many chills and thrills. Captivating story. Great photography. Excellent costume and dialogs. Simple and touching relation between Ripley and the doctor. Very interesting characters. Excellent cast.The actors. Sigourney Weaver outdid herself with this evolution of her heroic persona, a truly great performance. Charles Dance seems to be the true complement to our female lead and played it to perfection. The whole lot of convicts and jailers was astonishingly good, I'll just give special mentions to Paul McGann, Christopher Fairbank, and Charles S. Dutton.The bad. Unfortunately, the alien's CG effects are starting to show their age, and it can be distracting at time.The ugly. The intro. It's not logical. There can be no eggs there. The queen had lost her egg producing sac. That's probably what turned off most hardcore Alien fans. It did me. It took me a while to go past that and see the quality of this film. Since this blatant mistake was the basis of the whole scenario, it left very few advocators.The result. A great sci-fi thriller. Should be seen with an open mind if you like the first two installments of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grim return</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aliens left the series on a high note, and it was a difficult task to follow up to it. This film doesn't really even try -- instead it just wipes the board clean and does its own thing. It follows the mood of the first film rather closely, completely ignoring what James Cameron's sequel brought to the franchise. The beginning of Alien 3 is rather rage-inducing, but if you try not to think about the previous film and just enjoy Alien 3 as what it is, you'll enjoy a dark and harsh action/horror experience.Interestingly, this is David Fincher's debut film and it shows his familiar style. There is strong characterization, a surprising twist halfway through and a joyless ending. In this film life comes cheap and violence is shocking and always present. The visuals are bleak and colorless. The CGI has aged rather poorly, making the xenomorph monster scariest in the scenes where they used animatronics.The ending leaves no possible room for a sequel, yet there is one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 does what all good final installments should do: it keeps us guessing while building upon the franchise. One could argue that Alien 3 DIDN'T build upon the franchise, in which I would argue that in a reductive way it certainly builds upon Aliens. It takes us to the next level, connecting in tone with the original, yet taking us even further down into the depths of darkness. It was very fitting for an Alien film, complete with surprises, grimness, acid and blood. The Alien franchise didn't begin upbeat, so why should it end upbeat? Directed with the same uncomfortable close-ups, fast-edits and colour-tints Fincher-fans would be familiar with from Fight Club, Alien 3 is packed full of interesting characters, symbolism and highly engaging sets. The atmosphere of the shaved convicts preaching faith while chasing the 'dragon' with fire is so fitting yet unpredictable for this franchise, that I encourage people to watch it with an open mind. Forget Fincher's qualms with this film, forget your emotional attachment to Aliens and watch Alien 3 for what it is: a film with balls. More films should be like this, and unless we want nothing but predictable sequels for the rest of our days, I suggest you rate this movie highly so we can get the score UP and writers into their next project with the encouragement to get creative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amateur Review: Alien 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gets a lot of bad rap from people who highly favor the first two. And for good reason. The people that bash this movie had a right and they are entitled to their opinions because when this movie compared to the first two....it sadly does not stand very well. Let's take a step back for a minute.Alien was a revolutionary horror movie for its time. It had the right mix of Horror and Suspense put in. As well as a terrific since of claustrophobia. The feeling of being cut off from the world and that anything could pop out from around the corner. The acting was terrific the characters were lovable and heck you could even connect with a lot of them. There was real terror in the air.Aliens was also a big surprise to the movie going audience because it was just as good as the original (in my opinion). It took a whole different turn with things. It was just simply a horror flick anymore it was a awesome action movie. Guns and gore galore!! With super awesome characters with likable personality (and yes to an extent even Bill Paxton's character). It had a lot of issues being dealt with especially by Ripley...big issue most notably of course is Motherhood. This movie is definitely a watch if you haven't seen it...anyways on to the main movie.Alien 3 had a lot on its shoulders to begin with just right off the bat. How can one still be able to keep the audience interested after two magnificent films? Well, lets quickly look at the negative aspect of it. It's the beginning. It starts off with the ship containing Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop and it crash lands on to a "prison planet". This is all due to the cause of one alien egg that was on board. First question...how the heck did it get there? Well the movie doesn't really offer and explanation to how it happened we are just suppose to go with it really. And with this happening it makes "Aliens" pointless. Guess Ripley didn't have to go back for Newt..she was just gonna die anyways. As well as helping out Bishop and Hicks. Bishop is in the film but only for a short while and he doesn't really offer much to the movie but still it is nice to see him. The second problem is some of the characters. The first two movies have memorable characters that had personality and depth. This movie has characters that for the most part go unnamed and right i can't tell you the names simply because i don't remember. I remember the main black guy...the one bald guy that survives...the a''hole leader....and the leader of Weyland Inc. oh yeah and Ripley of course. But that is the only things i cant truly find wrong with the film that really bug me. Other than that i throughly enjoy the film. The atmosphere is dark and gritty. I really feel sheltered off from the world and the total lack of technology really sets in as you get a great perspective of the world around you. The acting (again my opinion) is pretty good. Especially from Ripley herself. The music also sets a pretty eerie tone for the movie as well...most of it being choir music especially the opening scene which sets the mood immediately. This movie was also the first theatrical directorial debut of David Fincher. A Director way ahead of his time and who goes to make such great movies like Fight Club, Seven, Panic Room, Social Network, and of course the most recent remake of Girl with The Dragon Tattoo. Anyways the point I get at is that this film is definitely worth watching and deserves a higher rating than it has currently that is why i give it an eight outta ten. Oh yes and the finale of this movie is fantastic and is where the series should have ended but sadly continued on to make...gulp...Alien resurrection....which plainly sucks...a lot...anyways that's my amateur review of Alien 3...hoped it help ya some...this Amateur Reviewer...signing off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the Alien saga and its storyline. With that being said, the order of greatness is Aliens, Alien, Alien 3 and the much less 4th one. Many reviewers here on IMDb have lambasted Alien 3 for killing off some of the survivors from Aliens. They say that these characters were much loved and deserved more story. HERE is the thing: this movie was made like 6 years later. You can't have the same actors in a movie this late if one is a pre-adolescent kid growing up. So here we begin with a story where Ripley is the only survivor of Aliens and crash lands on a prison planet. Long story short, Weaver was excellent as usual, Charles Dutton and Charles Dance were both great. The other actors all tended to blend in together, however. Yes, David Fincher did walk out on this movie before it entered editing but he still directed it. The directors cut is a little bit longer and does more to flesh out the story. I especially liked the strange camera angles that were used while I disliked the thankfully limited use of CGI in the movie. Overall, the story was dark and dreary as was the tone. Not the greatest movie but it still holds up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A depressing end for Ripley............ Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thats right, good!. As much as I like Aliens and as good and fresh an entry it was to the series, James Cameron was treading on dangerous ground. The franchise was at risk of becoming just another comic-book "adventures of" kind of series with Ripley and her "old gang" from Aliens as recurring central figures.Alien 3 was to be the continuation of that formula, thankfully it wasn't. It's plainly clear from the style and tone of the original Alien movie and even Aliens that this series was a dark and lonely tale of a strong and resilient woman trying to survive a horrific journey through space. Even though she encounters a variety of characters along the way, the journey is hers and hers alone. She becomes an unwilling transient through space, the settings change and so do the characters around her. To experience so much loss through all three movies and still remain fighting strong, this is what made Ripley such a powerful character a deviation towards comic book adventure would surely weaken the intensity of her character and the journey she has been on.Sigourney Weaver herself agreed with this and it is why she supported in killing off her Aliens counterparts and facilitating her solitary status in the series, so far as to being a producer of the movie.So thats why I am thankful that Alien 3 was made this way. It's true that Alien 3 has its share of faults, as many reviews here point out, but the movie does provide a new setting with new and different characters a good dark atmosphere and a new challenge for Ripley. In my opinion the movie is allot less worse than it could of been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assembly Cut is Definitely the Way to Go!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2003 version of the film is an excellent change of pace from the theatrical version. It added a lot of the ominous feeling of the first, while keeping the action of the second. I believe the theatrical cut was a little to contrite;basically get on the roller-coaster and push to the end credits. This version of the film is more of an experience, you enjoy and experience the film. The only negative I would say is the lack of depth in Weaver's portrayal of Ripley. Making of Alien 3 is an excellent disc included in the set. It's amazing that such a great cut was presented to Twentieth Century Fox in 1991, and was adjusted for logistical reasons, playtime, etc. The original film was truly perfect, not bad for a first time director with his first major motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly underrated but still somewhat enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After crashing on a prison planet, the lone woman there joins forces with the few male prisoners left to battle the voracious alien creature accidentally brought along with her that's them off one-by-one.This wasn't all that bad of an entry and is a surprisingly underrated effort. One of the better efforts here is that it's got some really decent stalking scenes among the prison set, including the fabulous set-ups in the ventilator shaft after finding skin on the ground before being attacked, a pretty tense altercation in the infirmary before an attack and a real rousing sequence where it escapes a trap and starts a massive chain reaction of explosions and fireballs through the facility that takes out most of the group being among the highlights here. Also helped along is a series of good stalking scenes, nicely done from the start through the intimidating, foreboding locations in the prison and the final plan to deal with the creature is great fun, with the corridor chases through the alien viewpoints, great kills and tense confrontations that are highly enjoyable, despite the few flaws present. The CGI for the alien is really embarrassing and makes no sense to be included, the prisoners are made so unknown they're barely worth remembering and their inclusion into the fighting stages in the second half is rather weak. The main weakness, though, comes from the fact that, against the others before it, it's really weak and doesn't really hold up with them. Still, overall, this one isn't bad if it's not measured up against the others.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just don't get it...not the movie - the reviews. So this is rather an attempt to do some justice to the movie. Maybe here in SVK we could experience a different cut (*SPOILER*...the one where Ripley gives "birth" to a baby alien when falling down *SPOILER END*) but even the other one is not really that bad. I loved the different atmosphere in every single movie in the series. The first one was a great sci-fi horror movie, the second one was a great action movie and the third one (exactly the point where the series should have ended) was more psychological horror. The atmosphere in the movie is just heavy (tehre's no better word for that), very sad and frightening. I love that it is very different from the previous movies, I love the ending, I love the plot which is very similar yet still different. And I still don't get how someone could rate it with 1/10...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragic yet powerful conclusion to the Alien trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I say anything, you must watch the Assembly Cut of Alien 3. That's the cut I prefer and the cut I base my score on for the film.Anyways, this isn't a very bad film like almost everyone claims it to be. Of course, in comparison to the first two films in the series, it doesn't exactly live up to their quality but still considering the hell that David Fincher went though while making this, it's a damn worthy effort.It is true that it lacks a little bit in the story department but what I'm sure most fans know is that they started filming this before they had even finished the script! So, essentially Fincher had to work with what he had and from what it seemed, improvise. Pretty impressive what he did, it being his first film and all.It comes across kind of slow at parts and that's probably one of the few gripes I have with it, but in the end it's strangely uplifting and beautiful at times.So, with all things considered, the good outweighs the bad. It's not perfect by any means, but still, give it a shot. Alien 3 is a criminally underrated film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A harshly treated, honest sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien's success led to three sequels; Aliens, Alien3 and Alien Resurrection. Of course, the only one that ever came close to moving out from under the original's shadow was Cameron's Aliens, the most hate still seems to remain directed at Alien3 followed closely by Alien Resurrection. James Cameron's sequel is truly one of the best sequels ever made to a film, it upped the ante with an entire colony of the aliens as opposed to just one, a queen alien, a child, soldiers, guns and explosions. James Cameron was able to make a sequel that drew comparison with the original but ultimately devalued the aliens' terrifying image by including hundreds and making them far easier to kill by including weapons.I see Fincher's Alien 3 as an attempt to reconnect with something that was lost in "Aliens." I love watching each film because there's a watermark left from each director's style: Alien has Ridley Scott's pacing, tension and flawless direction. Aliens had James Cameron's funny satire of American soldiers and it's own brand of humor, before it was diluted into something far less enjoyable with Avatar. It also has his a happy (yet not artificially sweet) ending that makes the film-goer leave the cinema satisfied.Alien 3 has Fincher's bleak outlook. The opening sequence is still one of the best opening sequences that I've seen, it captures the mood of the whole film. It is a dark, allegorical tale for an adult taste about redemption in the sh*thole of the universe. A group of convicts are able to group together valiantly to destroy the most horrifying creature in existence. Gone is the optimism of Aliens, enter the nihilism of David Fincher. The deaths of Newt, Bishop and Hicks were necessary to Fincher's vision by removing the optimism of Cameron's sequel. The alien itself has also changed, to a dog-like sprinter.Fincher's film was plagued by rewrites, development hell and critical failure. This is the prelude to Fight Club and Se7en, it was an exercise for Fincher to distinguish his own style. The film retains little of the other films, while remaining more true to the bleak outlook of the original than Aliens. It's a polarizing film that will divide fans of the first two entirely but is a must-see. But it's rarely seen for what it truly is. It also has the best motivational line for a certainty-of-death situation: "You're all gonna die. The only question is how you check out. Do you want it on your feet? Or on your f*ckin' knees... begging? I ain't much for begging! Nobody ever gave me nothing!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the Alien series. Alien was great and Aliens was a master piece. As expected a lot of pressure was put on Alien 3, and sadly it didn't deliver. But then again I didn't expect it to. How many movie series have had three hits in a row? Star Wars pops to mind, but not a whole lot more.So let's talk about what the film did right. For starters Alien 3 succeeds in presenting a very dark and depressing mood. It introduces a new type of alien which looks cool and creative and helps keep the movie feeling fresh. The acting is also top notch.It did do a few things wrong. For starters the majority of characters are forgettable and for the most part not very like able. The CGI effects are awful. The aliens color will change and its movements don't look realistic at all. Luckily you'll mostly get close ups of it so it won't be CGI.In conclusion it's the best in the alien series, but still succeeds in providing a few good scares. I give the theatrical cut a 7/10 and the extended cut a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part Three... Still Going Strong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crashes on a planet populated entirely by prisoners. Her crew is dead, and she must now take up residence among rapists and murderers until a rescue ship arrives. Unfortunately, she is not the only living thing that survived the crash.The question you have to first ask is this: can first-time director David Fincher adequately handle the directing ability after such great films from James Cameron and Ridley Scott? A third film could have easily crashed and burned, but Fincher is a man to be reckoned with and admirably keeps this one afloat. Perhaps not the best in the series, but respectably good by "part three" standards.Starting from scratch (the crew is dead and the scenery is new), Fincher is free to create his own little world, and he does. This film is less claustrophobic than the first two, but more dystopian in many ways. Also, perhaps more importantly, it is the transition point in the series from science fiction to horror. (The whole series falls into both, but with the levels of blood and gore exponentially larger here, there's no question of this story's genre).Perhaps the only thing that could have been improved was the utilization of the prisoners. There is one minor "attack" scene, but overall the people could have been any sort of breed and the story would not change. What would have aided this film is a full-scale riot or jailbreak. Imagine Batman having to face everyone in Arkham Asylum -- here it would be Ripley against scores of killers while simultaneously trying to stop an alien infestation! Howard Maxford calls the film "imperfectly scripted" and Mike Mayo points out his opinion that it "went through several writers and directors and emerged as a fairly unintelligible mess." Could it be better? Yes. But I think looking back now, it's not as bad as made out to be.While the theme and feel of the film is not spot-on with the first two, it still is a decent incarnation in the "Alien" story, and having Lance Henriksen briefly appear kept the continuity strong. You cannot have an "Alien" film without Sigourney Weaver, but the more you invite back, the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 cuts back from the larger and more action-driven approach of Aliens in order to show a movie that's more down-to-earth and back-to-roots horror film. The film succeeds in a way but unfortunately loses a bit of its appeal in the process.Visually the film stands out from the rest of the Alien films with its grimy industrial look. The prison setting gives the film a feeling of isolation akin to the first movie. There's only one alien, just as in the first movie, and the humans this time are all but defenseless against it, as in the first movie. However, after being exposed to numerous aliens in the last movie the threat feels underwhelming and the concept a little bit of a rehash.However, Alien 3 has a distinctly reflective feel to it and the acting performances are far more memorable than in the first movie and the film also has a bit more entertainment value. Still, the final confrontation with the creature lacks the impact of the other movies. Thankfully the iconic final scene of the film salvages the rather underwhelming ending to some degree.Alien 3 is definitely on par with the first film of the series but lacks a lot of the entertainment value that would make it surpass the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Alien 3' suffers if it suffers from anything from being in the shadow of 'Aliens'. It is a vastly different picture and I say all the power to it. 'Alien 3' matches the thematic feel of the original film far more effectively than 'Aliens' does. Instead of following Cameron's blueprint for the material we go back to the bleak horror of the original. 'Aliens' was a fun popcorn masterpiece with horrific elements but 'Alien' was a horror film and so is 'Alien 3'. Instead of a 'Return of the Jedi' end to the trilogy we get a last act of a grim Shakespearean tragedy. This is bold and far more original than anything else we might have seen. It is a natural end point to Ripley and her demonic parasites.'Alien 3' is a Fincher film through and through. It looks and feels like the 'Seven' era Fincher. This is high praise considering how many legends exist about this film being taken from him. It features the classic Fincher themes about hopelessness and obsession. This Ripley is in that mold. Visually the picture also has Fincher's eye. The film has a beautiful bleakness to it. We see that same emphasis on decay that we see in the streets of 'Seven' or 'Zodiac'. Aside from that iconography It's a wonderful looking Sci-Fi picture. It captures perfectly that space opera feel that the original 'Alien' or 'Star Wars' did. In fact in rewatching the picture it only cemented my belief that Fincher was the best choice to visit that franchise. It's a futuristic world but it's an unglamorous depressing rotting futuristic world that the characters are unimpressed and just live in. That's what made the worlds in 'Star Wars' and 'Alien' feel so real. They had been worked in. If I have a complaint it's that the characters aside from the main three are generic. One thing 'Alien' and 'Aliens' did extraordinarily well was create fleshed out characters who didn't feel like just pieces waiting to be dispatched. In this regard 'Alien 3' is a mere monster movie. It's a shame too because so much of the background and world is really well imagined and realized. The story about the prisoners and their fanatical religion is interesting and serves as a great starting off point to build character arches off of. The characters that are explored with any depth are very interesting and poignant. Clemens who is masterfully played by Charles Dance is as good as any character appearing in the previous two films. More work on the script was necessary. Perhaps cutting the cast down a bit might have worked well. I think my greatest praise for the film is how it does deal with the character of Ripley and her tragic and yet poetic end. Ripley needs to be alone without Hicks or Newt for this film to work. She truly is at her most heroic here and her supreme sacrifice at the end proves it. It is so satisfying seeing her destroy herself and the Alien queen inside her in the face of the greedy company who has caused so much misery over the course of the series. It is the only way to be rid of the real parasites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Sophisticated to the average Alien viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion this is a great Alien installment, commonly underrated because it's more dense and dark comparing to its precedents. Aliens (1986) was pretty much like Rambo, and Alien (1979) is a little bit dated, so Aliens 3 has succeeded to find the right tone: dark, gore, with a multitude of troubled characters. I believe it has commercially flopped in America because it's too sophisticated for the masses. Visually, the movie is beautifully photographed, with a great ambiance. The monastery metaphor is brilliant, and there's a subtle questioning towards religions and society in the plot. The "Assembly cut" is even better, and unveils the real concept of the film. If you're a hater, please reconsider it.</fullReview>

Alien 3 lacks in plot , effects and why not good taste . They made a movie who killed the stories by Ridley Scott and James Cameron , it's almost like saying to the audience that all those characters you love and cheer up for mean nothing , killing Newt was an obscenity for sure . Sigourney Weaver made such a big deal about not wanting guns in the movie but killing a Young girl was OK for her , i blame FOX , Vincent Ward ( he was the one who gave the idea of killing Newt and Hicks ) and Sigourney Weaver herself for being a co producer of this sad excuse for a movie ( she did the same on Resurrection ) For me there 's only two movies on the Alien franchise , Alien and Aliens all the rest is disposable .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started my IMDb account to review this film, and to through some positive air into the mix.Alien 3 is not the action-packed sequel that was "Aliens". It's a return to the thriller/horror genre that was the first film.I can't understand why people don't like this film. The acting is excellent, the sets are perfect to a T, the rod puppetry that brigs the Alien to life is superb. Even the plot, which could be better, is interesting.Besides, while it isn't as good as the first two films, it is better than all following installments in the franchise (Alien Resurrection, Alien vs Predator 1+2.) This movie is given a lot less credit than it deserves, and is a fitting ending to the Alien series. (This is the ending. Resurretion was a hallucination had by fans of the series.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the negative reviews "Alien 3" was getting my expectations were very low.To my surprise,I thought the movie was good,sure there are flaws,but the general idea was very nice-different then the first movie and "Aliens".The fact that this film takes the franchise in a new direction means this wasn't a cash-in sequel-effort was put into it.So,what makes the third installment different then the previous.Well,the film creates a rather sad and depressing atmosphere.I think this is one of the reasons people hate "Alien 3" so much,it ruins the happy ending of "Aliens".And sure,the way it kills of Hicks and Newt is a little cheap,but necessary for the sad tone of the film and it also prevents further overflow of characters.That brings us to the next complaint a lot of people have-too many characters.I think the characters that needed to be developed-Clemens,Dillon and Ripley get adequate character development.The romance between Ripley and Clemens does seem unnatural and kinda forced and it's one of the things I didn't like about the film.Although "Alien 3" doesn't have the constant suspense of the first film or the thrilling scenes of "Aliens" it manages to create a feeling of helplessness and constant dread.Think about it,"Alien" took place on a space ship,which is isolated and far away from help,but you can get on an escape pod and blow the ship up anytime you want(which they did)."Aliens" takes place on a remote colony,but they had weapons and a ship in orbit."Alien 3" takes place in a prison in the a** end of space and they have no weapons.Sure,the alien itself,may not be very shocking.In some scenes it's CG(I think that's because I watched the assembly cut,I'm not sure how it was in the original).I think people are being to harsh on "Alien 3".The movie is not that bad and it's worth taking a look at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The machinery of collapse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the Alien franchise, it is quite possibly one of the most interesting journeys out there, the drifting of gas clouds from the giant collapse of the first Dune to the formation of new spaceworlds (one of them being Star Wars), and their eventual deterioration as Jodorowsky's fluid vision was swallowed into the Hollywood machine. It's really cool. You can follow the thread of Moebius from Bladerunner to how he affected Cameron and how that affects the current state of visual imagination. Or more easily, you can chart it through the Alien quadrilogy.In Alien, the space was composed from different kinds of fabric, logic was dissonant, the alien was an abstract malignancy, transforming with the fabric, the journey collaborative to retrieve new vision.The journey shifts in Aliens to one of practical logic and obsessively getting a job done, tension goes from an abstract fabric to machines (include the aliens), there is clean narrative, a single flow and workspace.Now here's the deal on this notorious trainwreck that made the rabid Alien fanbase mad.It really is a mess. It is not the much protested killing of Newt and Hicks that hurts it, this adds to your own disorientation and entering this alone, without familiar ground. The sex scene is just poorly handled, minor quibble there. The gaping plot hole of a new alien egg is a problem, but you would be able to make excuses if the thing swept you to excitement, logic always finds a way to presentably dress feeling. And it does in a small way expand the cosmology with Bishop II.The problem is deep in the fabric of it, so even in its 'assembly' cut it's still a failure. The problem is that of the original Alien team, the only ones left were producers Hill and Giler, who may have contributed significant parts to the Alien universe, most notably the presence of droids, but they were money leeches, the farthest thing from visionaries. They came up with the prison planet idea. The film briefly passed through the Vince Ward phase of a wooden monastery-planet, of which they scraped everything except the theme of a millenarian religion, which they simply snowballed on top of their prison planet.Giger was initially contracted, but eventually shafted in favor of inexpensive nobodies who repurposed much of his preparatory work. His concept for a new alien included translucent heads and aquatic xenomorphs, no doubt inspired by his friend Moebius' awesome work on Cameron's The Abyss.Scott was contacted in the early stages, but wanted to effectively make Prometheus, there are statements to that effect as early as promotional interviews for the first Alien. So, a 28 year old guy was brought in to direct - smart choice, since previous films worked because they had passionate young blood working in them. Fincher had ambition, but no experience with designing narrative on the deep end and no one to really help him as Scott had.You can read elsewhere on the truly hellish shoot, the endless rewrites, the $7m worth of unused sets. In simple terms, what happened is this. You have a volatile world on page, in a constant state of (mostly poor) rewrite.Fincher who feels insecure in this environment, and without narrative experience for overall vision, attacks each segment with as much short-term visual aggression as he can. He assembles but does not orchestrate.You have an elegant design for the alien after Cameron's critters, but cheaply animated and blended in the environment, it is remarkable how little these guys accomplished with much superior technology.And you have simply nondescript extrapolation into cinematic space, all these vast industrial locations, the labyrinth of tunnels and vents, the foundry, but they're all revealed in the same unexciting light. None of it feels lived, merely decorated.And this translates in the actual film; the initial point is that disharmony has inexplicably stolen into a world of forced purity, the analogy being extended to the presence of Ripley among religious celibates. This has a lot of potential, for instance to expose purity as the vessel that conceals the real beast, but is forgotten in lieu of the obligation to visit different sets and parts of a loosely connected story. We simply have different focal points of view and aimless energy spent running from one to the next; this is the most clear in the improvised chase through corridors near the finale, the gliding camera is superb, but it's a baffling new dimension.It feels like we're tuning in and out of different episodes of a season of big-budget sci-fi TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given the embryonic state of the film throughout its life, it is a mischievous masterpiece because of the fight between the original ideas of the director,the screenplay and "fox". Reagardless of the squabbles,somehow they managed it. The director's cut especially. The film continues the Ripley saga and for the most part, she is without fault. The script dictates the actors sometimes. The script, the bleakness and simplicity of the locations only heightened the feeling of claustrophobia apparent in the production. Mostly English, mostly miserable actors who excel at this type of work. Charles Dance deserves a particular mention as the doctor, who convinces at all times. And without forgetting the lady herself... Ripley. Sigourney plays Ripley as only she can. The only criticism I have is the inclusion of Fu.... Bloo... CGI.I mean, why? It demeans the film. If CGI doesn't look better than the traditional methods, don't use it. Simple. Excellent film with a few foibles :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The two previous films in the Alien paradigm set a very high bar for any sequels that may have followed them. It is true, to a certain extent, that Alien 3 is the weakest of the four films in the canon. It lacks weaponry, it's visually bleak, some of the visual effects are a little dated now (although no more than Aliens - that film was just edited a lot better)....... but it gets around these difficulties by creating a huge, chilling, cathedral-like atmosphere in the remote prison complex. The Alien is as terrifying as ever, with some new neat touches not seen in any of the other films, the cast are superb and suitably horrible, and the way they get around having no weaponry is ingenious and very thrilling to watch. This is the only film in the whole canon where you get to see through the Alien's "eyes", it's worth seeing for that alone. And Sigourney Weaver is superb, just like in the other three films. Her performance and delivery is memorable and admirable. I suspect most of the ill-feeling for this film comes from American viewers, and I can understand that. Most of the cast are British, and the film even feels British - there's something very Victorian and more-tea-anyone about this film which is surprising and rather hard to get used to, when you've seen the others. Considering the total chaos that went on during the making of the film, it's frankly amazing that it's even watchable. A very good film that only suffers from being the black sheep of its family, as it is so different to them all.</fullReview>

Everyone is miserable and angry (even though they have the right to be miserable and angry in this movie); it wouldn't hurt to see a smile. there were moments of humor and hope in Alien and Aliens, but that's all gone in 3. Note: Dog lovers should not see original version. See the reedited version. Instead of a conscious dog, it's an unconscious ox. On a positive note, it's interesting to compare the standard alien to the one in this movie. Also, because this alien was supposed to be incredibly fast, there were a lot of cool CGI moments. Still, it's a very sad movie, seeing how the last survivor was a prisoner so he ends up going back to jail. Also, this is the reason people didn't like the 4th movie. And what kind of prison has no weapons? The beginning's a bummer, the ending's a bummer, but the middle is cool, except Ripley looks weird without her hair.</fullReview>

It loses half the tension of the previous two films as you learn through the film that Ripley is basically untouchable to the aliens. This is because she has a queen alien inside her and the aliens want the queen alive. However, the film redeems some tension through the other characters. There are some good special effects and bloody deaths, all the usuals from the alien quadrilogy. Ripley supports a shaved head in the film in order to keep the horny male prisoners back making her look very tough and adds a different look to the film. A good ending resulting in the death of Ripley but hey, who cares she comes back! Definitely worth watching in a dark room for the first viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third movie in the Alien series wasn't as disappointing as I imagined it would be. I had heard a lot of bad critics about it and I guess that's why I was 'surprised' after seeing it. I'm not saying it is a masterpiece, but it could have been a lot worse.This time the movie starts with Ripley and what is left of her crew in "Aliens", trying to escape in a spaceship. But an embryonic alien has infiltrated the ship and when they crash on a desolated prison planet, peopled by a religious cult composed of former murderers and rapists, everything starts all over again. In the meanwhile, the alien has managed to grow into a new and deadly form and starts attacking the weaponless prisoners. But Ripley soon discovers that her battle with the Alien will be more personal that it has ever been before...What I liked about this movie was that the acting was more than OK and that it has plenty of good action to offer. Especially at the end of the movie there isn't any lack of action. But there were also things that bothered me. One of those things is the story. The story on its own isn't very innovative. Of course there is a new environment in which it all happens, but in the end it still looked very much like the previous ones. My next point of criticism is the Alien. It wasn't the same as always anymore. This was the first digitally created monster in the series and I must say that I preferred the older ones. They just looked a lot more slimy and threatening than this one ever did.Even though not everything convinced me, I must say that I still had a good time watching it. I give it a 7/10, perhaps a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My vote of 8 is for the Assembly Cut from the Quadrilogy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien3, theatrical version, was not a good follow-up to my favorite film of all time, Aliens. However, if you buy the Alien: Quadrilogy, box set, and watch the Assembly Cut which adds almost an hour to the movie as well as changes some of the other aspects, Alien3 becomes an entirely different movie---and a much much better one. You get more history of the prison, more history of the prisoners, and overall more plot development. Also, SPOILER!!!--the alien doesn't come from a dog, it comes from another animal. The only bad thing about Alien3: Assembly is that the Alien is still blue-screened. I don't understand why they couldn't have used stunt actors dressed up in the suits to make it more realistic. If they had done that, I would almost rank this movie as good as ALIENS. But, without a doubt, "ALIENS" is the best sequel ever made!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, we'll never know *quite* what Vincent Ward might have come up with: "Rumour Control! Wooden Spaceship! THE NAME OF THE ROSE in space!" as Brian Glover might have put it... But the recently released Special Edition of ALIEN3 is quite good enough to warrant a full-scale reappraisal of this dark, haunted, regret-filled little movie. If you thought it was the runt of the litter, think again - the thirty extra minutes of restored footage put it second only to ALIEN in the quadrilogy. Watch it, and you'll surely agree it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Fincher's later, stronger work. Highly recommended - now I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with Jeunet's ALIEN:RESURRECTION... more Joss Whedon, less cyberpunk maybe?</fullReview>

Lots and lots of closeups of Joan's/Ripley's face 3. Being surrounded by bald, angry men 4. Death by fireAnd notice that Ripley first wakes up in a place that could easily be the cell of a monastery (what in the world are stained glass windows doing in a prison colony anyway?) and the abundance of crossed-shaped objects.As for the AIDS thing, I didn't quite see that, but my roommate commented that the entire Aliens series seemed to be playing on the fear of pregnancy.

		<shortDescription>Entitled opinions, simple observations...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Alien 3 in theaters on opening night back in '92, and I can still remember the sickening "grip" it had on me. The kind of grimy/feverish/dirty feel the set and production design induced on the audience - as well as the droll music score (heavy in dark reverberations). At first, I hated it for that, but soon I realized that's exactly what it was supposed to do. Film-making (no matter what genre) is meant to "tap" the sensitive side to a person's mind. Between Ripley's ongoing agony of feeling physically sick &amp; her personal battle against the race of aliens, the almost inhumane conditions of Fury 161, and most of all the threat of the dog-bread alien who instills constant fear, though we hardly see him - these elements compose a lot of what was seen in the original. I'm a student filmmaker and writer; I'm guessing that there's a lot more out there. I wouldn't dare say you guys are wrong in anyway if you didn't like Alien 3; I've read your reviews, you're all well spoken - criticizing fellow critics is childish. Film Aesthetics doesn't allow that kind of behavior. Remember, we're writing to the IMDb to examine the concept of the films we see. I think it's fair to say though: keep more of an open mind, and instead of focusing on the negativity of the story (and yes, there is some of that in this film) just sit down some night when there's nothing else to do and watch it again. Make an outline of the story. The major focal points of the script. The drives of the characters &amp; most importantly the setting. Not to dictate (I'm no authority), just realize this: the film has almost no gunfire and minimal explosions. 'Aliens' WAS LOADED with this. Guys, come on, don't forget the logic in it: firing 10,000 rounds of ammo and burning the world are cop-outs to movie-making. IF OVER USED, they do nothing but waste screen time; time in which the writer could think of nothing else better to put to his pen. The true path to action or suspense lies in what the general audience can relate to, which is not having an RPG fired at your face. None of us know that thrill, but almost all of us know what it's like to fall off something high or be endangered by something, or maybe be cornered somewhere - instilling claustrophobia. From the 1st film we ALL KNOW that Ripley began as a central character who became the lead protagonist through default. From the 2nd film, more of a shoot-'em-up than an masterpiece, we understand Ripley is willing to sacrifice to gain. From a simple FNG POV I realized that Ripley had become a virtual "prisoner" to her own commitments. Good recent examples of giving all you have, how 'bout 'Schindler's List' or 'Sling Blade?' Drawing examples of the strength of Ripley's character is just my way of (I guess you could say) "defending" the 3rd film. The elements of the story existed and were defined well. Metaphorically, how could the situation be anymore worked out? And last but not least, admit to yourselves, the film was a far better entry than 'Resurrection.' I guess the only other thing I can fit in is this: David Fincher wasn't trying to top Ridley or Cameron for their films - not at his status in Hollywood. He simply interpreted the film the way he thought the story should be told. Interpretation is all it is. Screenwriters are told: you can't make a good movie from a bad script, but you can make a bad movie from a good script. 'Alien 3' has very keen dialogue, direct to its premise - but, sure, I'll admit it's got a few lines that are like a butch-90's flare of bad jokes or tough-guy one-liners. Wait a sec, 'Aliens' does, so does 'Alien'. 'Resurrection' is loaded with it. That's ironic. I'm still not quite sure what it is. I view 'Alien 3' as a solid *** film, intense and suspenseful. I only hope to one day get a clear solid answer as to where all the negativity comes from for it? Making a feature film like this is extremely technical, sometimes the makers lose concentration of that 50/50 balance they need to accomplish. The film isn't an atrocity. Could it of used some help... sure. I still wonder: if 'Alien 3' wasn't the third film but was just the first one (like a one-and-only) would we have thought differently about it? Keep your minds open guys, it's all interpretation, and we're all just trying to entertain. -Chris J. nlappos chris@redbug</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film that is sadly overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I must say that I consider myself a "hardcore Alien fan." I have seen the four movies in the Alien series more than any other. Too often, Alien 3 is criticized very harshly simply because it didn't turn out to be "Aliens 2." This is not an action film, and isn't particularly Sci-fi either. There are no guns, no marines and no exploding ships. This is, however, a masterful drama. Ripley finally has a chance to come to terms with the emotions that have been building up ever since she first encountered the alien. She is isolated, alone and in despair--and that is what this movie centers on. Anyone that went to see this expecting a "feel-good" action movie, went away with a churning stomach. The acting is superb, particularly by Weaver (Ripley), Charles Dutton (Dillon), and Ralph Brown (Aaron). David Fincher creates a beautifully sick setting with the Fiorina 161, and each set is a testament to the wonderful [utilitarian] imagination of the art directors. This movie WILL depress you, but understand this is not a bad thing. The final sacrifice, where Ripley dies to keep a queen alien away from the *true* enemy, the Weylad-Yutani company, is sheer heroism. It inspired the satisfaction in me that Ripley has died for a greater cause--one that she fought for all along: not to destroy one alien, but rather end the inhumanity that Weyland-Yutani has inflicted on hundreds of innocent people. Her death is truly sad, but this kind of raw emotion is what Alien 3 excels at and propels it much further than just sci-fi action. Don't see this movie if you want guns and explosions. Watch it only if you want a truly moving cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 is my favorite of the Alien films. It has the dark, unwelcome feel as the original had, but the sense of isolation is beefed up 10 fold. The story matched the former films, and the ending was an excellent and acceptable pay-off. 'Aliens' relied too much on the creatures to tell the story. And the point of the soldiers was to only have a few good skirmishes with the Aliens. No thought involved. Alien 3 had the human edge. We can fight and defeat this thing with our brains, not with guns. This movie shows us courage where we least expect it. Where faith and comradery is the only thing you have left. And Ripley's sacrifice is the final step in saving humanity from the Alien. This movie is a triumph, a perfect ending in a tragic story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passively brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed. This was further boosted by less than brilliant reviews from numerous sources. But as I watched it more, I began to realise how good this film actually is. This was helped by seeing two other films directed by the brilliant David Fincher which were "Seven" and "The Game". More of a drama than a action movie, Alien 3 puts us in the mind of Ellen Ripley, and continues to show us how the Alien has wrecked her life ever since she set down on LV426 in "Alien". One of her quotes is very memorable when she tries to confront the alien for herself. She says that all she can remember is the alien, and really depicts how the monster has gotten to her over the course of the three films. Another great thing about this film are the settings. The art direction in the movie is superb, with the dirty and grubby sets being echoed by the prisoners that inhabit the complex. Fincher has a real talent for creating such atmospheres that are dark, filthy and full of death. (See his later films). For me, the best part of the movie, as for many, was the ending. but it wasn't the Alein chasing around the refreshingly English prisoners in the labarinth tunnels of the complex, but the appearance of the true monster from the Alien saga, the people from Weyland Yutani, "The Company". by this time, everyone knows what the alien looks like and does, but this is the first appearance of the company and it really does liven up a diminishing end to the film. And the introduction of Bishops creator really does boost the story to new heights. Like Ripley says in "Aliens", "I dont know who's worse. you don't see them f***ing each other over for a god damn percentage"-them being the company.In conclusion then, Alien 3 is an average film when viewed on its own, with hidden wonders that have to be found by a eager viewer. As and end to the trilogy of alien films, it is just quite fantastic, and I would recommend it to anyone who has seen the two prequels as this film reveals things in a much more subtle and successful way about Ripley than its poorer sequel, Alein Resurrection.Rich</fullReview>

I actually enjoyed this more then Aliens, which may shock people, but to me Aliens had too many "funny" moments in it, and was too "formulamatic". I thought that this movie with it's very bleak atmosphere, and the great looking alien effects, not to mention the tense acting by Charles Dutton and the other prisoners. You can just feel the sexual tension and borderline criminal feelings of some of the cast towards Ripley. Action, sure the second movie had more action than any, but this was more like the first movie, with excellent pulse pounding chase scenes, and much like the first, you just didn't know where that slimy .. was going to strike next. Say what you will, but Alien 3 in my book is the second best of the series.</fullReview>

I love Finchers work and don't blame him I blame the writer.I think that Scott and Cameron would go back and do something different. like the Alien getting back to earth or something like that...I mean even the stories in the comics seem like a good place to start...even if their plots are paper thin.lol. Maybe its not a good idea and I don't know the ins and outs of Hollywood...but I'm betting if two BIG directors like them got together. Weaver, Beihn and anyone else would definitely be willing to do another...I mean its almost impossible to get as bad as alien resurrection.

		<fullReview>Yeah okay, it was really good as a drama film but sucked as an Alien film. I must say that I was very disappointed when I first saw this film, actually I have not rented Alien 3 or Resurrection since I first saw them. First off they killed Hicks and Newt. How could they ****ing do that? Especially to Newt? We knew right at the end of Aliens, should there have been sequel, that they were going to continue the surrogate mother-daughter relationship b/w Newt &amp; Ripley. And we would see another relationship with Hicks. So What do they do? They kill our favorite Aliens characters off. I hate to say it, but even if Fincher stuck with the original script, we would still see the deaths of Newt and Hicks. Secondly, there was no character development at ALL. NOTHING. All we know is everyone (besides Ripley) is a rapist/murderer/etc. You don't really seem to give damn about the characters. The only character development I see is with Clemens, but he gets killed off too. For those of you who like Alien 3 or feel sorry for it, I've read the same reviews you have. The original director left the project like two months in, and David Fincher I believe had very little time to develop a good script resulting in the lack of character depth. However, did it ever occur to them that there was a reason James Cameron left Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop alive? The main purpose for almost all of the prisoners was to just get killed by the Alien. Third off, what the **** was with the autopsy? Who the **** put that in the script? I don't know you, but that was just plain SICK. The whole thing with the dog getting impregnated was also kind of sick (although I understand in the Special Edition re-release changed it to a cow for something like that). And also how the hell does Fincher expect to end the series with such a **** up movie? Come on! And fourth, they could've at least made the freakin movie actually take place ON Earth, if not, then what the hell is with their damn tagline? Overall a REAL Disappointment. I'm sorry to those like this movie. I have not seen the re-released version, but I understand it's much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is movie might be a little underrated, but still, it doesn't deserve a lot of thumbs up...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**1/2 out of ****How do I start writing a review about a movie so complex like this? Let's see. Seeing the other two alien movies, which are much, much better than this one, we may say this one is not that great, but it's not bad also. Alien3 continues the story of Lt. Ellen Ripley (played all the time, perfectly by Sigourney Weaver... until the fourth movie, which is pure crap), always the only survivor from the killing done by the nasty creatures of the saga. In every sequel of the saga, she's the only one from the entire crew, whether they're marine soldiers, ex-criminal prisoners or just crew members of a commercial spaceship, to survive. A lot of people complained about Hicks and Newt's death in the third movie, two characters from the second movie. Even James Cameron disagreed with the idea of having those two "great characters" pass away. Well, considering all the pain, suffering, courage, fight and sweat from Ripley in Aliens (1986) in an attempt (at the time, successful) to save her comrades and most of all, Newt, it may be a little sad to see the last remaining characters from the last movie, to just die, out of nowhere, most of all, by unknown causes of causes of less priority, but hey! What, in fact, is the true essence of the alien movies? Isn't Ripley, always the lone survivor? Just like Mel Gibson in the Mad Max series. I find that idea quite interesting.Getting past Hicks and Newt's death, which is not a negative star for this movie, let's check on the new plot. Considering that, this movie should have never been made. The second installment, I guess, was made in an attempt to wipe out all the aliens from the face of the universe. Considering they're a major threat for the future days to come, specially if they're, somewhat, brought back to Earth, they really must be destroyed. But that doesn't happen in that exact way. In fact, they're only to be taken away, when the space station, which monitored the Weyland Yutani company crew members, find out that no signal is coming as a sign of communication. So, they send the marines, along with Ripley in a mission to do what couldn't have been done in the first movie. The first movie was the discovery. The second one was the solution to that. But what is Alien3? In Aliens, the planet is totally destroyed and even the alien queen, which comes back to the Sulaco is banished to deep space. The aliens are wiped out! But no. They write a completely different story, developing that the alien queen in fact was able to lay one last egg. OK, despite that, the rest is good.In the original threathical release, the new alien is born from a dog. The face hugger which came from the egg of the Sulaco attacks the dog and new alien is born from it. This was a great idea! Now the new creature can run faster and eat its victims like they're really some kind of a single meat. Once again, some people complained about that. Come on! What do you expect from a horror / science fiction movie, which has a nasty creature as the deadly monster to be the center of the story? For me, I guess, as long as there's plenty of blood, gore and everything and all, in that, at least, a horror movie succeeds.Characters? Not so good as the first two movies. We don't really care that much for them, since they're almost all crazy, criminals and all. Unlike criminals from movies like Pulp Fiction, who are characters who have great personality and style, people from Alien3 are really scum. Sometimes, it's even funny to see them dying in this movie. And, believe me, that's not nice for Alien movies. My only regret was the death of Clemens (Charles Dance), a great character, and when he was developing himself, he gets killed so suddenly. And the death of Aaron (Ralph Brown), another character who really should survive, but he's killed so unfair... Ripley's death? Well, it's nice too see an Alien movie end sad. The first two had happy endings, but with tons of portions of sadness. Alien3 just enhanced that feeling. And the final speech from the audio of the last lines of the first movie were great too. Just to remember how Ripley was. A fighter till the end. And Alien3 delivers that message well. "Til the end".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very underrated and misunderstood movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 is a very underrated and misunderstood movie, as my title suggests. The problem with this movie was editing and studio involvement. From commentaries seen in the DVD, the director (Fincher) has disowned the movie and would not help with the Quadrilogy. The original cut of the movie was considerably shorter than the assembly cut, which was far superior. It tells the story of Ellen Riply, hero of the series, as she crashes on a prison planet inhabited by a group of "double y" males, all convicted for brutal crimes. But oh no, this does not stop Ripley from creating her own style of havoc and unrest between the prisoners, not to mention the alien showing up. The assembly cut, being much longer, and having changed many scenes entirely, goes deeper into characters, includes an entire side plot that is quite interesting, and makes the movie loads better. Sure, some of the effects are poorly done, but what it lacks in certain computer generated imagery, it gains by telling the story of a lone woman trying to cope with the dangers of this creature, and more importantly, trying to cope with being alone in this struggle, for the aliens have taken her life from her. First by taking her friends and co-workers in alien, then as a result of blowing up her ship, cryo-sleeping through her life, then when we think all is well, the aliens take away Dwane Hicks and Newt when her EEV crashes on the planet. Yet she lives on. The underlying theme is loneliness and perseverance, which was missed by most audiences. It is very well done even if it is not the scariest movie ever, and i think alien 3 is definitely better than most gave it credit for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A widely underrated movie.. - spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most filmgoers and critics bashed this movie mainly because of the way it was breaking from the overall climax of Cameron's Aliens. There are no space Marines that get trapped and killed one by one, no big spaceships and we're being only served one single Alien monster, which is just a boring "male" one, instead being of the scary mother of the last film. But seeing this movie in comparison with its predecessor, many years after it was made, reminded me that what makes an horror flick (in this case a space horror flick) effective is not a mountain of gore and big budget effects, but the intimate and realistic atmosphere of true terror. That's why after 17 years, Aliens looks more like an average sci-fi action movie with horror elements, in the likes of Predator, than the great horror film Alien was. Alien 3 reprised the same idea that was so great with the first film of the series (the greatest of all the bunch, as it was a truly original achievement): a bunch of almost ordinary people left on their own, billions of light years away from their home, bound to DEFEND themselves against an evil they can't understand. Their loneliness into an harsh, foreign universe, and their lack of ability to defend their lives against the creature was creating an eerie and tense atmosphere that was truly terrorizing. Both movies were VERY pessimistic overall, in a dark way, and that's the main reason why they were effective. Whenever if its into the cargo freighter of in the abandoned detention facility, you just don't hope that something like an alien appears, 'cause the people that are there are all but prepared for such danger... They can't even handle their own problems, so how can they face a threat from outer space??? With a pro-military perspective in Aliens, where the intelligent warmhearted, soldier survives all along with Ripley, and the aliens get annihilated by a nuclear explosion, the pessimism was somewhat watered down for a more family-friendly plot with good feelings and hidden chauvinism. Of course, on the visual effects side, Alien 3 was not the best of the bunch, but it was a more intelligent horror film in many ways than its predecessor, and that's where David Fincher drew his first landmarks as a master of dark and pessimistic films, by using schizophrenic lighting and photography, dramatic soundtrack, and grotesque, barbaric characters that were adding much to the depressive atmosphere of the whole film.And about the ending, it seems that some people just did'nt get it, and its a shame. It gives a brillant reflection on the odd fate of Ripley, as someone who's hellbent on always having to face an evil that only she can really survive, and now that she finds its actually inside of her, that's obvious that the only good way she can end this madness is by "going to hell" with it. There's this nice symbolism implying that this whole alien thing might just be the result of her own sickness, after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main reason why this movie sucked were the so called "special effects", which are so bad that the movie would be better off without them. Believe me, even without the alien creature this movie would be more believable. But the story's OK. It's dark and depressive but if you liked the first two you should be able to watch this one. When I first saw it I thought it was terrible, but later on I got to appreciate the movie as a whole, without the lame special effects of course, but it's still far from its predecessors.A nice prison movie though. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why Alien 3 is just as good if not better than Alien and Aleins and all three should be considered one.(Spoiler alert for all three) In Alien you know the Alien species isn't from Planet Lv 426 and the corporation told them to go in and BAM "Alien".(Major spoiler for Aliens and Alien) In Aliens The company finds Lt.Riply's evac pod and hears about what happened on the ship(they already know from Alien) They send in the Corporate Colonial Marines under the guise to destroy the Aliens, but really they want to obtain the Species.Here comes Alien 3... The acting is top notch and the story goes right with the rest of the movies. But what you learn from Alien 3 is what the Alien can do. Haha the (Spoiler) the Alien as a parasite takes the shape of its victim, which you see later in Alein Resurrection.All in the Alien franchise should be consider one epic Saga of Lt. Ripley and they all are 8.5+ Alien 3 got bad rap I think its the best one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Underrated Alien Sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ripley has crashed landed in Fiorina 161, a bleak planet inhabited by former inmates of a maximum security prison. Her escape pod is destroyed. Hicks and Newt (The Survivors of Aliens) have died in the escape pod. Ripley discovers that it might be a alien have destroyed her escape pod and the prison have no advanced technology or modern weapons. When the inmates finally see the alien, they have no choice to help Ripley to kill it but the biggest shock is yet to come.Directed by David Fincher (The Game, Panic Room, Se7en) made an brilliant near perfect sci-fi/thriller that is absolutely unique. Fincher actually disowned this film, because Fincher never got his final cut on his directorial debut. This is the hardest Alien film to make. Weaver gives one of her best performances in her career. The film has some solid supporting performances by Charles S. Dutton (Who was once a prison inmate for manslaughter), Charles Dance, Brian Glover, Danny Webb &amp; Paul McGann. The Special Edition of Alien 3 is the most complete version with 30 minutes of additional footage. Fincher didn't have any part of this better extended cut. Editor:Terry Rawlings (Alien, Legend) edited the film somewhat closer to Fincher's vision.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an interesting commentary track by Cinematographer:Alex Thomson B.S.C., Editor:Terry Rawlings, Alien Effects Designers:Alex Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr., Visual Effects Producer:Richard Edlund and Actor:Paul McGann. DVD also contains the original theatrical version.Disc 2 on the DVD contains over 2 hours and 40 minutes documentary on Alien 3. The Production Team, Producers and Actors talks about the Pre-Production, Production and Post-Production of this much troubled film. Disc 2 also contains photo galleries. This was a Box Office disappointment. Alien 3 went on to be a well respected sequel over the years. Some might dislike the extended cut but you have to admit, the scene deleted are interesting. Judge it for yourself. Story by Vincent Ward (What Dreams May Come). Screenplay by David Giler (The Money Pit), Walter Will (The Warriors) and Larry Ferguson (Highlander). Co-Produced by Weaver. (*** ?/***** for the theatrical cut) (**** ?/***** for the extended cut). Oscar-Nominated for Best Visual Effects. Panavision. Followed by Alien Resurrection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am here to give my intake in one of the most under appreciated movies i have ever heard,and i have yet to find a good reason for that. The story begins with a fire on board the cryogenic unit of the sulaco ship. After killing the alien queen on aliens,an egg,somehow managed to appear in the ceiling,somehow hidden,and the facehugger activates the emergency system of the sulaco. The EEV crashes into Fury 161,a prison planet. Ripley is the only survivor. I have heard many comments stating how the egg got into the sulaco,and i can point several possibilities,all of them acceptable according to the events on aliens. Bishop could have planted them there. He goes way with the ship when he said he would wait for Ripley,and he could say a bogus story telling why he went away for a few seconds (when Ripley connects the remains of bishop in alien 3,she asks if there was movement on the ship,on which he answers "yes",and "...he was with us all along..." therefore we can assume how it got there.). The alien queen was on board of the sulaco,so it is possible that she laid an egg. Maybe this was done on purpose,to let us guess just how the egg got there. The movie is quite good. The settings are Gothic,and absolutely stunning,and the alien creature is different from the others in previous movies. It has suspense,blood and even some frightening scenes,true to the alien heritage. Newcomer director David Fincher,starts to prove why he would become a great director,with excellent camera work,showing off just how well the settings were constructed. It is a good alien movie,with a good plot,decent characters(although they wont grow on you like newt did on aliens) and the best acting work by Sigourney Weaver. If you like the Alien movies,or a good suspense with a bit of action movie,give this movie a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's interesting to see that this film has had so many comments posted about it, behind the scenes it's still the most interesting of the Alien films. I have to admit to not wanting to watch this film again after seeing it at the cinema. I read the novelisation by Dean Foster (I think?) It was apparent that the studio had really messed about with the story. I was most angry that they had cut the whole plot stream of poor Golic thinking this creature was the messiah and freeing it from it's containment chamber. It just made a mess of the whole middle section of the film. It's a shame they had so little faith in Fincher, but now that this film has been re-edited it's my favourite of the sequels, in that it's much closer in tone to Alien. I love that it's so bleak, none of the Arnie-esquire witty one liners of the fourth. In this film we see that she has really lost everything from her past, present and future, even down to her clothes and hair!. I still think the acting is a bit wobbly, "they think we're crud", oh dear, but on the whole a fitting end to the franchise (if only that were so).</fullReview>

I thank David Fincher for deciding NOT to make another Aliens when he was doing Alien 3.

		<fullReview>After a surprising beginning to central characters in the previous film, the main character Ripley is thrust onto a planet run by prisoners. As a huge fan of David Fincher, seen almost all his movies, it's pretty safe to say Alien 3 is at the basement of his list. It's pretty obvious executives were in the way of what probably could have been a really good movie if Fincher had total reign on the script and finances. After a surprising beginning to central characters in the previous film, the main character Ripley is thrust onto a planet run by prisoners. Some of the characters on this planet were annoying and unlikeable while others that had potential seemed to bite the dust pretty fast. Alien 3 does have loyalty to the franchise but the film pales in comparison to its predecessors. The ending couldn't roll around fast enough knowing that the predictable sacrificial twist was about to occur and it should have put a lid on the franchise (it doesn't). It is a shame, David Fincher, a filmmaking genius, wasn't even good enough to save the franchise, and it was bound for Alien to start going downhill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the Alien saga was nearly ruined...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher was clearly overwhelmed by his task as a director (why this music video maker became chief of a doomed non-scripted major film is beyond me) of this overheated, under-written, and overlong entry in the "Alien" film franchise, a series of films that clearly showed itself to be walking upon shaky treads as it squirmed ahead. The picture does look great, however, what with the lighting and design work done by Jordan Cronenweth, A.S.C. (who was in ill health throughout the production) and a crack team of visual specialists (mostly British) who worked tirelessly in their attempts to save the picture. But looking at a bald Ripley is unattractive to me, the alien is too little seen here (and in Fincher's "assembly cut" there is more footage that nervous executives excised for good reasons really, but it is a more complete version of the film if you like the way that it looks). Outstanding camera-work and powerful visual themes are significantly better (and more dramatic) than this film deserved to be, and really it's not an "action" movie in the genuine American sense, but I did enjoy the fact that Biehn's character (and the Newt character) were killed early on because I could see no purpose that they would serve in the movie. Then again, there was no reason for Ripley to come back, or the Alien itself, or... well, you get the idea.Although, this is my least favorite among the trilogy (I do not consider Resurrection a part of the series), I definitely think that the Runner, or Dog Alien, is probably the best alien in all the movies. Unbelievably vicious and just, to quote superintendent Andrews, 'Generally Unpleasant', the beast has a mean streak and often toys with the prisoners, making this the darkest and most violent of the trilogy. The bad parts about the movie are obvious. After seeing the Colonial marines in action, it is tough to see the events of this movie. You will miss the marines. Another very troubling aspect is the deaths of Hicks and Newt, whom Ripley had strives so very hard to rescue in the last movie, only to have their lives sorrowfully taken from them. Seeing Hicks die, as my favorite character from Aliens, was upsetting. The acting isn't exactly top notch, but you will grow to like a few of the prisoners, namely Morse and Dillon. Not the best in the trilogy, but it definitely brings a good closure to the series.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Really That Bad, Just Very Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 is directed by David Fincher and is a direct continuation of Aliens (1986). In this installment, Ripley, Newt, and Hicks have crash landed on Fiorina 161, a planet with nothing but prisoners on it. However, things take a dark twist when they find that an alien was aboard their ship when they landed, and it's now on the planet with them.Most people hate Alien 3, but I actually enjoyed it overall. It had issues, yes, but they weren't completely abundant, and it had a lot of good aspects to it as well. Alien 3 isn't as good as it's previous installments, but it isn't bad either. The script and acting were both really good, and most characters were likable. Even the ones that weren't likable were written that way, so it didn't affect the film negatively.The acting all throughout Alien 3 was actually really good. Sigourney Weaver once again kills it as Ellen Ripley, the awesome alien survivor. Charles S. Dutton was actually really good as Dillon, the preacher with a bad past. His character was very well rounded, and the script portrayed him as a peacekeeper, which Dutton played very nicely. Charles Dance was pretty good as Clemens, the nice guy out of all of the prisoners. He was the only character with a soft side to him, and Dance showed this very well through his acting abilities.The direction, by David Fincher, is good, but also bad in a sense. Although no quick cuts or shaky cam is present, and the overall direction is good, the film is very dark, and depressing, much like most Fincher films. Although Alien 3's direction isn't necessarily bad, the overall tone of the film was more of a David Fincher feel than an Alien feel. At times, I would use the word boring to describe the tone of the movie. The entire planet is dark, and disgusting, and I just wanted out of it.The script is very well written. All of the dialogue was written and performed very nicely, and brought a great aspect to Alien 3. All of the actors performed their lines very well, and no bad acting was to be found. The pacing of Alien 3 is also pretty strong. Although the grimness of the film is slightly boring, once the story picks up, it really picks up. There were moments when I was on the edge of my seat, and was afraid for the characters' lives, which is a great job on the flimmakers' parts. The eerie direction may have taken away from this feel a little bit, but not enough to ruin an overall good film.Now, my main problem with Alien 3 is the special effects. When practical effects are used, it's mostly just up close, and it looks great, just like the prior two Alien films. The grotesque alien faces are well crafted, and look perfectly fine. However, the CGI is awful. Alien 3 honestly contains some of the worst CGI I've ever seen in a movie. Every shot of a CG alien crawling along the walls, or on the ceiling, looks horrible, and almost as if a middle schooler used a cheap camera and editing software to create the effects.Overall, Alien 3 is a pretty good movie. The characters are likable with good actors behind them, and the script is great as well. Gloomy direction and terrible CGI definitely weren't enough to drag this pretty good film down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quickie Review: Alien 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listen?when you hear about the production problems behind Alien Cubed (which started well before filming even began) you have to credit the team for even being able to release a finished film. Still, the final product is what a movie is always going to be judged on, and it is here that audiences everywhere were treated to a massive kick in the privates through the off-screen and pre-credit deaths of two characters, Hicks and Newt (oh?um, spoilers), who had so much time and characterization pumped into them in the movie's predecessor, Aliens. From then on it only gets worse, as the film takes place on a prison planet full of unlikable cockney rapists, murderers and thieves and film downgrades from the previous instalment to just one Xenomorph. The special effects present are some of the poorest in the whole series, with the killer alien looking laughably cartoonish at times. Not to mention the MASSIVE PLOTHOLE that the movie's whole existence rests on. It's no wonder why Fincher wants nothing to do with his debut feature.There are some positives however - the aura of dread in the previous two instalments is present here, and the lack of weapons means the Xenomorph seems almost as powerful as in the original Alien. Ripley's death, though unwanted, was clearly treated with respect. And the Alien franchise is one of those where an instalment will come out that is so bad that it makes the movies that came before it look fairly decent. And each film in the franchise after the first two gradually got worse. That, and the release of the Assembly Cut of Alien 3, makes the movie not too hurtful in the grand scheme of things. After all, this is the same series that has AVP: Requiem. Best Scene: Morse (Danny Webb) delivers one of the funniest F bombs I've heard in a rare moment of comedy in the movie. It's the part just after where the warden is carried off by the alien. Everything about it, from the delivery to the timing, makes the moment hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Alien 3, not in a "so bad, it's good" way but in a "This is one of the best Sci-fi films of the 90s" I've heard people complain Alien 3 is "depressing" but with a concept of "a monster brutally killing people" could you honestly expect a light tone version of that? Alien 3 has some truly great characters supporting characters such as Aaron, Dillon and Golic. The prisoners are a little hard to tell apart but the ones who stick and shine really do shine.The movie is very tense, enforcing the "anyone can die" rule to the max, when the supposed tough guy has a greater risk of dying then the totally nuts prisoner it really helps build tension and pulls you into the movie.There are several defenses of Alien 3 on the internet which I highly recommend reading, they all highlight the exceptional things that Alien 3 does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated, but it still has problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone in the Alien fan base seems to dislike this movie. I personally disagree, it's a fine movie. It still has problems, though. So here are my thoughts.Story-There's really nothing wrong with it. It's basically about Ripley's experience on a prison planet. There's a new alien called a "Runner", which is born from a dog. The tone in this movie is even more hopeless and dark than the first Alien. This time, there is no flamethrowers, no pulse rifles, no spaceships, no escape pod, no weapons. They have one chance to kill the Xenomorph. This movie was very scary and intense, just like Alien 1. They did a good job at playing up the suspense and creepy atmosphere in this one. Unfortunately, the two favourites (Hicks and Newt) have an untimely demise. But this only makes the film scarier.Characters: Ripley returns, but this time she's angrier. She is INTENT on killing the Alien. After all, it's killed her new family.There's a new love interest. He's intelligent and likable, overall a great new addition.Charles Ditton plays a man named Dillon. A heroic man who acts as a mentor for the other prisoners.Aside from that most characters are just bald and British men who say "f*ck" a lot.Soundtrack: While not as memorable as the first two movies' scores, Alien3's soundtrack is intense and fits the movie's tone.Special effects: The effects constantly drop and rise in quality. Stan Winston's former team at ADI (known for movies such as Tremors) did the effects for Alien3, and they do a good job with the suit and animatronics. It's just that they used a rod puppet on a blue screen for like, 75% of the movie. The blue screen does not mesh well with the footage, thought the rod puppet itself is very impressive.Overall, Alien3 is a great sequel to Aliens, it's not as good though. It's really underrated, which is sad because David Fincher put a lot of effort into Alien3. I feel the reason it was a bit of a let down was because of Fox putting too much pressure on the cast and crew to make this movie. That, and the fact that this movie had to live up to Alien and Aliens, two of the greatest movies ever.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien3 Assembly Cut (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a lot of discussion regarding the Alien franchise lately due to news that Neill Blomkamp and Sigourney Weaver will be reviving the series. Apparently the new film will take place after the second movie and ignore Alien 3 and 4, to the delight of many Alien fans. I have fond memories of the goofy, fun and bizarre Alien Resurrection, but referencing the convoluting events of that film would be tedious. Alien 3 has many, many problems and would be hard to include in further canonical instalments, but is worth revisiting.The messy plot begins with Ripley's ship, with a face hugger in tow, crash landing on an all male planet of murderers and rapists. Corporal Hicks and the 12 year old Newt, whom Ripley had spent all of the previous film struggling to save, are killed off screen in the first few minutes.The production and script problems are famous and impossible to ignore. The worst part of the movie is the titular Xenomorph itself. The special effect of the creature superimposed into scenes are ugly and destroy the suspension of disbelief. It is also confusing how sometimes the creature looks like a small animal, and other times looks like the traditional Alien as seen in the previous films. The slasher horror scenes are tedious and often interrupt the few plot lines that actually have potential. There are at least two moments where a character gives a glimmer of a reason for viewers to care for or take interest in them only to be then cut off and killed. This is a common horror clich that seems to be misunderstood by the filmmakers and is executed poorly.The only positive aspects of the film are original ideas never explored before in the Alien franchise, but all of these thoughts are either abandoned or fall flat in execution. There are religious overtones throughout the film that sometimes hint at Ripley being the "saviour" to the den of sinners and the Xenomorph acting as the wrath of God. This subplot is actually pulled off well and begins to make sense until it is frustratingly set aside about halfway through. There is also a subplot about Ripley hooking up with Clemens, the prison's medical officer, and the secrets they keep from each other. Ripley's secret is that there could possibly (or, most definitely) be an Alien inside the prison encampment. Clemens' secret is hinted at being something that would disturb Ripley and destroy the relationship between the two, but is eventually revealed to be something that she easily shrugs off. There is so much tension in this movie with no satisfying release for any of it.Despite being an overwhelming mess, there are thematic and visual elements that make Alien 3 a movie that won't be easily forgotten, even after the future films make a point of disregarding it.</fullReview>

Of course different director and crew and they ruined the story. A basic slap in the face after Aliens. from roller coaster to stopped at the gates. Bumping off Hicks, Newt and for the most part Bishop just to have Ripley deal with things by herself was such a copout and i cant even go into plot holes. The dull grainy setting of a prison planet and having Weaver shave her head just brings this movie even further down. There are no genuine scares , it basically is like a version of The Thing with boring scenes of dialog and bad acting. They really needed to toss the script in the garbage and start over. They didn't need to bump off Hicks or Newt. Total waste of their characters. Of course Carrie Henn was too old but another young actress could have played her. Lousy as was Alien Resurrection. If they do another sequel they need a better story and director. Weaver said shed do it if they would do a good script. Otherwise , after that mess Prometheus they need to leave the franchise alone for awhile until someone who knows what they are doing can make a good movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fall From Grace That Should End Here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can just about get away with this movie. "Alien3", is sadly the result of a lot of production problems on set. It is the first time feature movie for David Fincher, who pretty much had to work with a movie already half complete and pretty much had no final say in any aspect of production. I do request you look into this online, as it is pretty fascinating to see how far problems went to reach a result such as this.However, I really do enjoy the new "Dog" Alien design. I especially liked that they went back to the formula of the first movie, with even less ways of defending themselves from such a threat and on a prison planet no less. After the intense finale of "Aliens" (1986), Ripley is again thrusted into a world of monsters and further emotional turmoil (survivors guilt perhaps?). Stuck on a prison planet full of men and unfortunately the monsters have also followed her here, can she pull a hat trick?A lot of the inmates can be interesting characters, but most of them are without a doubt dull. I didn't care for them like I did the marines of "Aliens", and it all feels like a stupid joke compared to how great the first two movies managed to do well with even less. Surprisingly what I do like in this film is how run down everything looks, the prison has aged and been left to rot with the trash inhabiting it. All of this makes for some surprisingly good POV shots from the Alien and when implemented for the first time, it's very effective.Final Verdict: Funny enough, it's not skimpy women running from a killer and I apologise for keep referring to the previous movies. But this clearly should have been the last in the series, given the problems behind it. 5/10. Even scoring it now, I'm torn about how many times I could re-watch this before ultimately switching off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I honestly don't think it's as bad as other critics say it is - but at the same time, it's nothing special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien3 wasn't a huge disappointment. However, it was far from perfect. Alien and Aliens are much better films - and Alien: Resurrection is better than it too. But I do like the film. It had good camera angles, good cinematography in general, decent dialogue and good acting - even if Sigourney Weaver is different in the film, as Ripley More lifeless and stiff. It's not that bad. It's quite gruesome. And all in all, it's much different from its predecessors. This one's set in a completely different place - a prison. Nonetheless, it's enjoyable and intriguing to watch; but it's not great. I rate Alien3 a 7.3 out of 10. It definitely deserves that; but nothing more. One horrific, and gruesome scene is the scene in which the Alien bursts out of the dead prison dog, as Newt and Turk (Hicks) bodies are being cremated, sadly.7.3/10. 3 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!This is one of my favorite movies ever, if not my favorite. Sure its not the action spectacular like the previous film, but it brings the classic alien horror back. The sets may not have looked the best, but with the amount of trouble this movie had with the directors, it was lucky they had anything. And the effects done in this movie aren't cheap CGI effects, its fantastic rod puppetry. After this movie the director made movies like SE7EN and Fight Club, Alien 3 gave him his start. The deep dark feeling and gory effects, it definitely belongs to the Alien saga. The depressing end(I'm not giving away) makes you think "this is the end of the series". That is all I can say without giving away the whole movie. I hope you enjoyed this review, and I hope it changed the way you think about this wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie was a bit too painful to watch. It felt like an alien ripping out of my chest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie felt a bit too nihilistic and depressing to watch. Still, it wasn't the worst movie. I'll give that to 1997's Alien Resurrection. Alien 3 was a very hard movie to get through, as it didn't had the same scares of the first horror movie, Ridley Scott's 1979's Alien or the adventure thrill of the sequel 'Aliens' directed by James Cameron. Directed by David Fincher, the movie continues after the events of the sequel. Aliens left off on a hopeful note of no more bad dreams until Alien 3 came along and injected its own nightmare. Everything that people love about Aliens was rip away from the opening shots of Alien 3 when the escape pod from the Colonial Marine spaceship Sulaco crash-lands on a prison-run refinery planet, killing everyone aboard except Lieutenant Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). By doing this, Alien 3 takes away every character, Cameron help established about the series and cause a sour-taste for the fans of Aliens, in the first few minutes, by killing off three beloved side-characters in the first three minutes. Certain fans, in particular, regarded the decision to kill off the characters as a slap in the face. I thought the director did show some courage by killing off the characters from the second movie, but the way, they die wasn't going make the fans happy to have their heroes die so brutality, without any attempt of establishing them in the third movie. Unknown to the prison population, an Alien organism was also aboard the escape pod, which then begins a killing spree on the planet as Ripley must once again is forced to stop it. Alien 3 had a difficult production, with various screenwriters and directors getting involved in the project, with multiply ideas. Some of these ideas for the third movie were pretty outlandish, ranging from aliens infecting technology, aliens coming back to Earth, Ripley going to the mother planet of the aliens, and others. The production start filming before a screenplay was even finish. The director had to re-shoot and rewrite the script simultaneously while fitting in sets that had already been built, so filming was already plagued. It didn't help when incessant creative interference from studio executives also came into play. Fincher has since disowned the film, citing the aforementioned reasons. I have to give David Fincher, some praise for even getting this movie out there. Since this movie, David Fincher has gone to bigger and better success. Just to note, the film has two versions of the film. One is the Assembly Cut, which was released in 2003 and the other is the original version from 1992. There is a few different, between the two, as Assembly Cut tends to be the better version as it establish more of the themes of Alien 3 and gives more screen time for the prison characters. One of the biggest different between the two, was the animal that the alien morph from. People tend to complain when living animals, especially dogs are killed, so in the assembly cut, the movie has the alien come from already dead, Ox. In my opinion, it doesn't make much sense. The alien in the movie tend to be fast, and move like a predator because of the traits it got from its host. An ox wouldn't have these types of traits. A lot of people complain how fake the CGI alien looks like, but it's not CGI, at all. It was a scale puppet operated by sticks on a blue screen. It was so poorly lighted and rot scoped that looks like cheap early CGI. Another complain about the movie is the lack of action. After watching an action full sequel, this movie seems dull as the prisoners lack guns or proper guards. Most of the prisoners are pretty unlikeable and unsympathetic as they were just brutal ex-criminals who found religion. There is misandry's tone of the movie. The movie is filled with male characters who exhibit only the worst male characteristics. None of the great male virtues are nowhere to be shown. It didn't help that the prisoners were all bald, and talk with a cockney accent. None of them really stand out. Even Ripley seems completely out of character. Two movies, two subtle love interests, no sexual relationship and then in this one she meets a dude for five minutes and wants to get down. So awful. The movie seem to have some weird sexual metaphor. A lot of theorist think the movie is really about AIDS, with aliens representing AIDS. Other thinks it is about religionists dogma as one of the early story draft had Ripley come across a religious planet that has rejected technology. I like how the film was trying to get back to the horror concept of the first movie, but I miss the suspense and claustrophobic feeling. The movie ruin the suspense, by showing us that there was alien from the beginning of the film, but they try to add a surprise to Ripley's character, but it doesn't make any sense since there was only one alien. Without spoiling it, too much, there was no way that Ripley could had impregnated. It just not logically. Even the Christ-figure ending was a bit hokey. I can do without all the religionists overtones as it was already too dogma depressing for me. Overall: the pacing is slow, the editing is very choppy, the visuals are murky, and the story is weak. One early draft of the script focused almost entirely the Aliens characters returning home would serve better than this film, only to find out a rival faction of planet has use the Aliens as a bio-weapon to conquer Earth would be better. While, the latter was used somewhat in Aliens: Colonial Marines video game. I still, haven't saw a good version of that plot. I would pay to see that movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien3 marks the point at which the series began to go somewhat downhill. It is a definite love-or-loathe film, but it's a film that has improved over time, and while it's not on the same level as the first two, it remains a decent entry in the series, certainly far better than the depths the series would later sink into.It sets it's tone right from the start with a neat play on the 20th Century Fox opening, with the familiar theme suddenly segueing into something creepy. The opening sequence alienated - if you pardon the pun - many fans. There's no getting round the fact, the sudden appearance of an alien egg on the Sulaco makes no sense, and no explanation is ever given for it. The callous killing off of Newt and Hicks had fans raging instantly - this callous attitude perhaps reaches a nadir when an autopsy is performed on Newt to determine she has no alien inside.IF you can get past that downer of an opener, and you can forgive some bad dialogue, and not-all-great performances, Alien 3 provides an intriguing direction coming after the action-fuelled Aliens. This is a dark, brooding film, full of Gothic visuals, and steeped in fatalism, mirroring our heroine's emotional state. Sigourney Weaver is perfect as always, and helps hold the film together. While strong on atmosphere, the gore is taken to higher levels, so that should please gorehounds.For a richer, alternate experience, check out the Assembly Cut, which helps fill out gaps which resulted from reckless cutting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good ending for the series, but could have been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though is not the best one of the trilogy (I don't want to count the fourth), I believe it was a good way to end the series. If things were not bad enough for Ripley in the previous one, now she founds herself stranded in a space prison, with no technology, infected and surrounded by a bunch a bold creepy prisoners.Ripley and the alien stories have been so intertwined throughout the series that is almost impossible for one to exist without the other, and I think this movie portrays this feeling perfectly, leading to the final sacrifice at the end.A lot of the complaints about the movie arouse from the fact that Newt and Hicks are out at the beginning of the movie (during the credits), and I was disappointed too! However, i think it was necessary to portray how much the creature has affected Ripley's life (although I feel the autopsy scene was unnecessary). I also do not think Hicks and Newt would have fit in the prison story.What I liked: The chase scenes from the alien point of view.The yellow color used throughout the movie, portrays the prison prison as a sad and depressing environment.What I didn't like: As everybody says, the way the alien was animated (specially on the running scenes) is probably the weakest of all the series (they should have gone to previous techniques).You can feel they were working without a script (it affected the director and the franchise). The story feels disconnected at times.Score (6)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not surprising that the fans of the first two films hate this one and the haters of the first two films love this one.It is a dark, brooding, ugly, depressingly good film on its own. It has very little in common stylistically and thematically for that matter with either Alien or Aliens. Yes the Xenomorph is the monstrous villain, but here it is just a demon. It is the prison planet that orbits in Hell that is the focus of the story and we are the voyeuristic visitors. When the devil arrives everything is destroyed and everyone has to honor their contract with the Prince of Darkness. Although Ripley will be resurrected since she was the sacrificial lamb.This is not an audience friendly film, it is an exercise in Gothic Antichrist behaviorism and grotesques.

		<fullReview>David Fincher must have very exacting standards, given how emphatically he's scrubbed this from his CV. Yes, it brings something different to the table and yes, it won't be to everyone's tastes. But then again, "Aliens" took the series in a different direction to the original and I don't recall hearing too many complaints. Trouble is, this film does have its flaws whereas the earlier two had very little wrong with them.The film opens with the crash landing of an escape pod, containing the bodies of Newt, Hicks and Bishop and the barely-alive form of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). The pod has landed on an isolated prison planet which is populated by a group of shaven-headed villainy led by warden Andrews (Brian Glover) and doctor Clemens (Charles Dance), who takes Ripley under his wing. But it soon appears that Ripley's paranoia about her colleagues deaths is justified when an alien stowaway begins to make their presence felt. As the inmates begin to get picked off and with help still some time away, what hope do the remaining inhabitants have when they have no means to defend themselves? "Alien 3" has atmosphere and set-design to dazzle but sadly, a plot to depress. It has a unrelenting misery to it that doesn't do it any favours - a bit like the story which turns the whole thing into a sci-fi slasher-type movie but with a nasty alien instead of a knife-wielding maniac. The alien itself also suffers from some ropey CG (understandable given the age) and too much screen time - the terror of the unknown that made "Alien" so good is all-but-gone. Performances are adequate but largely lost in the chaos, gore and smoke. Thinking about it, is there anything to praise? It's a difficult film to love and certainly nothing like as good as its predecessors but "Alien 3" still offers the usual mix of crawling through pipes, sudden and violent deaths and Ripley leading the fightback. But that's it - nothing surprising or actually terrifying which is a shame. It does look like a decent sci-fi with detailed model-shots of great spaceships orbiting planets in front of a blazing sun. The effects are also very good - the alien puppet is particularly horrible with goo dripping of the shiny banana-shaped head of the thing. But because it will naturally be compared to the two earlier films, it was going to hard to prove itself against two certified classics. After all, how many good third films can you think of and especially from a rookie director? It's OK, Fincher - we forgive you this because of "Fight Club". Move on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoy the Alien series, but what I disliked most about this one was when Ripley had the alien in her body it took a long while for it to burst from her chest. And in other movies, it was pretty much as soon as you awoke from you "coma." That kind of irked me. I'm sure they just tried hard to make it drag out, because she was one of the main characters, but still I thought that was unfitting. And another thing, when it finally did pop out of her chest, it didn't fight to break through her ribcage it just popped out! And she was still alive!!!! Are you kidding me?! And I read the synopsis and it said the Queen came out of her chest. How exactly do you know it was the Queen? It's head wasn't large and all that jazz.

		<shortDescription>A Thought-Provoking Slasher ?! Think Not !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Alien was horror with some ideas about the human vs. the unknown. The second Alien was action / horror with no ideas but making everything as very big and very hot. Now the third Alien tries to mix the first with the second to lose the best of both ! Here's a fine ground for one of a kind genre movie. A prison of only-men criminals, whom became mostly religiously fanatic. After a long time in which they didn't meet a woman, and decided to refuse the whole female race, they meet Ripley, and more than that; they have to "join" her to terminate the new-hybrid Alien. Undoubtedly it has a dramatic and metaphoric potential. It could have been unprecedented woman-movie about an educated one being trapped in ignorant whole-masculine society / prison that despises her, so how about their developed common necessity to be both hand-in-hand to destroy one danger. It could evoke too the human vs. the animalistic sides' conflict, with the woman as the sole rational soul amongst a world of barbaric men. But Alas for that or else.Everything sounds chop-off. Nothing is complete. At one moment the doctor; a sympathetic with the heroine and a possible lover for her, dies while telling the story of his guilt (??). The head of criminals / nut priest befriends with the heroine pretty fast; so what was the meaning of the hate (as a drama, or pure thrill ?!). Yes, the matter of Ripley being pregnant with Alien's Junior was wild and surprising, but I couldn't get to understand how it happened. The movie doesn't disappoint the intellectual core, whatever it might have been, that promises of only, it even harms the attempt of ordinary viewing for a solid Hollywood fare.Speaking about the "fare" side, David Fincher, who came from the music videos and TV commercials, doesn't offer much in his debut as a cinema director. The movie is too dark for its own good sometimes. The action isn't so dazzling, I don't know how to do that right after what James Cameron did in the second (explosive is the word!). And as a horror, you know that you've seen better. The one fulfilled and complete good idea in this movie was the matter of having no guns or weapons. That was so ambitious and creative. On one side it gives the instant question "how they're going to face the monster?", and, on the other, it gives the opportunity to watch different kinds of improvised weapons. Other than that, nothing was really "going on" !The thing is the movie suffered a long-term of rewriting, re-shooting and reediting (over a year was spent in the editing process apart). That's why many points looked eventually strange or incomplete. Though, I believe it was a good cinematic exercise for Fincher in making movies, and in dealing with the Hollywood masters (read : the producers), who can play with any movie in any way they want. His born as a master director himself would be postponed till (Seven ? 1995) and (Fight Club ? 1999). Therefore see him revenges, or says what he originally wanted to say, in (Alien? : The Assembly Cut), released on DVD in 2003.I totally ignore the debate around "was Bishop II human or android?", because seriously, it's crap ! What would be gained out of that, since the whole thing ended up as another slasher movie yet set in the space, with many important points left incomplete ! P.S : in 1992, the movie's star and executive producer (Sigourney Weaver) said "I am sure there will eventually be an Alien 4, it just wont have me in it." Nevertheless, she did Alien 4: Resurrection (1997). Maybe to make more money ? Or maybe.. to apologize for this sequel !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 is a much better film than many seem to think IMO.It seems that a mainly US audience didn't like it initially but the European audience apparently did. I can't figure out why that should be, but if it's just that the US saw only the theatrical release which was re-edited by the studio before release and not the original Assembly (or Directors) cut version which shows us what Fincher's and Weaver's vision actually were, maybe that's more understandable. It can't hold a candle to the first two movies but overall it's not bad at all. Moody, atmospheric and with fantastic settings and camera-work. I liked the story and the sub plots, most of which were lost or watered down in the theatrical release including Golic releasing the creature from captivity (an entire section which bizarrely disappears in the theatrical release) and the subtle clean ending of the extended version where the Queen does not emerge from the suicidal Ripley at the last moment. Alien 3 in retrospect works well in the series and if you take the version the Director intended you to see and watch it again you may see it in a different light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Cameron stole this franchise from Ridley Scott; David Fincher is stealing it back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original film was a well-made, claustrophobic, dark, pessimistic horror film directed by Ridley Scott. It was James Cameron whose 'Aliens' played more like an action film, complete with a happy ending - the nuclear family going on to a bright future at the end. Cameron himself and his fans looked at the opening 10 minutes - killing off the would-be husband and child of Ripley - as a slap in the face. Of course they would - Alien 3 is a claustrophobic, dark, and pessimistic - like a horror film should be. In any case, the franchise never belonged to Cameron.SPOILER ALERT: I like Fincher's directorial point of view in this film - it is amenable to the genre. The performances first-rate as well. Even the concept of a new alien (i.e., born of a four-legged animal) was interesting. It's too bad Fincher was hampered by the producers to salvage a bad situation (as the third director, with sets built for a subsequently rejected concept, without even a complete script). Certainly, it is far better than the attempt at dark comedy in 'Alien Resurrection.' That said, the film does have some serious flaws. The CGI of the alien is a definite weak point. Then there's at least one problem with the script - particularly, why the queen alien takes so much longer to gestate than the alien that threatened the prisoners. And arguably the biggest flaw is that it really does hit many of the same beats that the first film hit.Almost two decades later, Fincher proved to be a far more artistic director, with his own distinct voice, going on to make darker thought-provoking films of his own ('Se7en', 'Fight Club', 'The Social Network'), while Cameron went on to make big, bloated popcorn movies, with really strong special effect and really weak scripts ('Titanic', 'Avatar').</fullReview>

However the film wasn't all perfect because if it was, i would have give it higher than a seven.i thought that Ripley's reaction to seeing Newt dead could have been more shocking because she didn't seem very emotionally disturbed by it, and Hicks' death went nearly unnoticed, i'm not against killing Hicks because even though i liked his character i felt that it ultimately made everything harder on Ripley adding to the suspense because if Hicks was there then they would have killed the alien easier and ultimately would have felt like a let down.All in all, its not the best of the franchise and made for a good finale, unfortunately resurrection came along, which wasn't terrible, but wasn't good either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all this film is not a 1 star movie, not buy a long shot... The fact is there are quite a few negative reviews of this film because of the First 2 Alien movies!! Alien &amp; Aliens Were both fantastic groundbreaking films in their own right and unfortunately this movie just cant live upto them. It doesn't make it a bad film i actually think Alien3 is pretty good - it has some good ideas = Ripley crash lands on a refinery/prison planet full of male prisoners (there is a lice problem on the planet so no one has any hair (apparently the working title was"Skinheads in space" lol)) The survivors at the end of Aliens all died in the crash apart from Ripley, So she is alone on a planet full of hairless horny hate filled convicts who seem to have embraced Christianity in an almost military fashion(No doubt fed thro the Prison warden the brilliant - Brian Glover) , she manages to find a friend in the prison doctor (Charles Dance)and starts trying to unravel the mystery of what went wrong and why she ended up here, during these events we see one of the prison sniffer dogs with strange new lacerations round its mouth become ill....(you get the picture). There is a great sort of moody claustrophobic feel to this picture, its a shame David Fincher had so many problems with the Studio when making Alien3 because i truly believe that this good film could have been a great film if it had the right sort of time and support that it should have had(apparently the studio kept messing fincher about, and made him start shooting before the script was even finished) So....its not the masterpiece of the first two but (ignore the naysayers) it still has its moments, and the fact that this has a lower IMDb score than Alien Resurrection is an absolute travesty, that was the movie that ruined the alien series for me (i like jeunet films but there's no way he was the right guy to do that sort of movie, i really wanted to like it but.... how long are they under water for without breathing in that underwater scene!???!)</fullReview>

Its dark, bleak, depressing stuff. Looking more like a proper sequel to Alien than Aliens! The film has flaws all over, but it also has its moments, not to mention the best tag-line for an Alien film, 'THE BITCH IS BACK'! For me the series went downhill from Alien: Resurrection, with Alien 3 holding its own up against two classic films. Its not my favourite, but after Cameron's sequel, I think Alien 3 is up there with the original. Dismiss it, but don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shocked. Surprised. Not exactly elated though. Nonetheless, the Assembly Cut, which puts back in 33 minutes of critical filming done by David Fincher (regardless of whether he sanctioned the Assembly Cut), radically transforms the commercial release into a much more coherent and much less annoying outing. This film hearkens back to the first Alien movie in tonality, though with a resolute grimness. It's not exactly pleasant or fun. Additionally, you have the many problematic plot issues assuming that Alien 3 is supposed to follow Aliens... And the killing off of key characters doesn't make any sense unless somehow they refused to participate in the sequel. Actually, the entire setup for this sequel doesn't make any sense... Who the heck sanctioned such obvious plot violations? Still, I'm giving this a 6/10 because the movie shows a believable and unique consistent vision, however dour, and there's much fine acting to be had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** spoilers ***Although not as good as the first part, it is still entertaining. Let's begin with the good. The good is it darkness, the gore is okay and the acting is not bad.While its been said that movies must always end "good". The hero arises triumphant and his bad counterpart is either dead or in jail. I do not agree with this. There are quite a few opera's out there that are works of sheer brilliance but end with the hero being dragged to hell or just being murdered, the most notable being Don Giovanni by Mozart. And Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back doesn't end too cheerful either but still is a very good movie. This also applies to Alien3. It ends pretty dark with the death of both the new queen and Ripley, but the ending completely suits the movie being the final piece of the series. Showing a bunch of former prisoners who found God in a corner of space in an area where nothing works, with the sole exception for the lead casting machine. The gore is, well, gory. The thing I wished to be more explicit was the autopsy of Newt, but the guts of the former inmates that splatter all over the walls were adequate. The acting was also okay, the former prisoners behave like people who aren't exactly the heroes the marines were in Aliens.Now the bad of this movie. Well, I think the writers should have given Newt and Hicks a more heroic death, other than just die in a crash in the opening minutes of the movie. Second is the mysterious egg in the first seconds, where the heck did it came from? I thought the queen lost her egg-laying capability with the ending of Aliens! And although I don't exactly mind the dark ending, the ending itself could have been more dramatic and noteworthy. Jumping into a very large oven isn't exactly exciting. Then there is the creature itself, coming from a dog this time, in stead of a human being and having four legs for speed. While of course an original departure from the human form it could have been worked out much better, in stead of just being "Oh noes! It's different from the others!11!!1!!1" And why didn't the men who tried to convince Ripley to come with them to steal the alien queen just stunned her in stead of starting a meaningless conversation?But I think overall the good remains triumphant over the bad things in this movie. This movie just isn't the disaster some claim it to be. Entertaining? Yeah. A masterpiece? No.7 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien vs Studio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read some heavy criticism of this movie before I had seen it. When I did see it, I was not particularly impressed. I had Alien and Aliens on videotape and somehow they got stolen.So when the Quadology became available reduced from ?70 to ?15 with the Theatrical Releases as well as the Directors cut versions and all the making of documentaries I thought what a bargain.I feel sorry for the first time director on this movie as the whole plot of the third movie sounded ridiculous in the first place and sounded more a like a comic-book short story.The studio constantly wanting and making changes to the script on a daily basis and interfering with the shoot itself, would and could not let Mr Fincher direct the film the way he wanted to.After repeated watching, the final version of the film if it were not a sequel would, I feel not stand up as film on it's own. It's too dark and slow moving and the other "monsters", i.e. the prisoners you really only just start to know them when they start dying.Give it whirl though. You might enjoy it like Marmite or Vegamite, I say yuk, you may say yummy.Men in Suits eh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not as bad as id heard.... but poor compared to the first 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw this movie for the first time a few weeks ago, id heard many dismal comments and reviews on it (including here on IMDb) and was not exactly jumping in anticipation. First of all, its fair to say i think, that the first 2 are classics.... Ridley Scott's masterful original and James Cameron's very different but equally enthralling sequel... fast forward 5 years and the concept of another one crops up. Why? In movie history hardly any of 3rd sequels better the originals... terminator, godfather,Halloween, nightmare on elm street, superman, batman,spiderman,scream, shrek, (the only example i can think of is lord of the rings : return of the king, which may well be the best in the series, only because the story came to a phenomenal conclusion), so there would be no reason to suggest that the alien Franchise would or should be continued... but therein says it all... alien and aliens were both very profitable so another one would surely bring em in... and whilst it did just that, the movie itself had so much to live up to it was never going to be on a par with its predecessors. David Fincher is a fine director( seven, curious case of Benjamin button) but the mistakes that were made has lead fincher to virtually disown the movie. so what exactly is wrong with it? by my reckoning, fincher had realised that to make an alien movie to similar to the first or second was not what the fans or even he wanted; so his choice to attempt to do something different from Scott and Cameron was ultimately( as well as the successes of the previous instalments) to blame for the movie not being all that good. killing off 2 major characters right in the beginning was his first mistake,and setting the movie with people you don't really give s damn about, well thats also a error. bar one or 2, we cant really get animated about such unlovely people. 3rdly, a very poor CGI monster which sadly (see first 2 movies for real monsters)takes ALL the suspense out of it, its so obviously fake looking its laughable. combine these three flaws with a dull, leggy (fincher probably wanted atmospheric)direction and lack of suspense or pace and towards the end we actually want it to be over... something you could never say about the first 2. we must forgive fincher his mistakes, he was young and inexperienced.he has matured into an excellent director, instead blame the greedy film company who couldn't resist another chance to make a quick buck and destroying a great horror series in the process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien 3 tried to be more like the first film, but it failed for a few reasons...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher is known for making many famous films such as Seven and Fight Club, but this was his first feature length film. Alien 3 tried to be more like the first film in the series but it didn't have that feeling about one Alien on a spaceship hunting seven people down. Instead, Ripely is left on a prison planet where there are loads more people and the Alien is stronger. I didn't like the film for a few reasons, and one was because too many people died too early into the film, which I found annoying. Also you are desperately waiting for Ripely to tell everyone about the Alien on the planet, so that the film can properly, but instead there is just more talking which gets boring. We also see the Alien too easily because you see it up front, but in the first and second one you could barley see it sometimes. Finally, near the end with the door part I got really confused and hated the upside-down camera shot, even though it is meant to be the Alien's eyes. My review gives the film a 5 star rating, but many people give it a 1 star, which I think is too low because there are some good things about the film. I thought the acting was pretty good in the film and some of the special effects were great, although they had made Terminator 2 a year before it so many people at the time may have thought it wasn't anything special. I loved how many ideas they could use to make the Alien kill someone, but I won't mention anything. And some people say the ending was stupid but it wasn't and I will not say anything about it. Overall I would give it a go but only if you have seen Alien and Aliens. I have never seen Alien Resurrection but I may see it soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They could have left it at Alien. Then, they could have left it at Aliens. But no - here it is, Alien 3 (or is it Alien Cubed). Was it worth it? Should they have done this? Well, yes I suppose it doesn't hurt. However, if it wasn't for Sigourney Weaver playing as Ripley (A role I feel she has been designed for) this movie would fall flat on its face. The other characters lack (umm) character. We know they are all going to die and it's hard to care. Perhaps a bit of humour would have helped.The setting is quite good though. In a way it re-creates the claustrophobic atmosphere of the original - though not, perhaps, to the same degree. It is dark and moody, creating quite good suspence in places. The Alien has many crevices in which to hide and Riply's means of disposing the Alien is limited. Also this movie writes out - without any shadow of doubt - the possibility of a fourth enstalment of the Alien trilogy...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rotten Tomates, reviewers all over the world and even David Fincher hated it, I know all that. Well, I LOVE it! David Fincher has since grown into my favourite director of today, but that's beside the point.Just because a film is not what people expected doesn't mean it isn't a great film. I think Alien? is severely misunderstood. One should see it for what it is: a third Alien film, which - just like the sequel - aims to be something entirely different than the other two. This is a "Where am I? And where is that thing that's scaring me shitless? Who's gonna be next?"-film.I really loved the cinema version, but the Assembly Cut is absolutely fabulous! SO atmospheric and so full of little details. I love the atmosphere of this film. I love how it's set. I love the plot! I love how once again they try to make a completely different Alien film, just like the second was so much different from the first one. I like how they mainly used British actors to show that they have a different accent on a far away planet like this. I love how the intro is cut. I love the lighting. I love Charles Dance - the duke of cool. I love Brian Glover as the warden. I love Ralph Brown as Mr. "85" Aaron. I love the way you never know where you are, just as it was intended. I love all the extended footage from the 2003 Assembly Cut. And I love the ending, even though I was of course appalled the first time I saw it.No, I just don't get all the negative reviews. I absolutely love this film. Yes, Aliens (the second one) was the best of the lot, but I think Alien? is every bit as good as Alien. It is the 4th one in the series that is an embarrassment. Houw, talk about a shameless, dogshit attempt at milking a great story for more money! But that's a different story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a counter weight vote, to even out the hate reviews. This third installation does have everything a movie needs. Characters, awesome suspension, awesome movie set. Sure there is no deep story. But was there one with "Alien 2"?The third part is similar to the first. There is one alien, hunting them all down, one by one. Some consider the characters to be poor. But I liked them. I even liked the flat dialogs. In fact Danny Webb as Morse was awesome. A scoundrel with a big mouth. Great.I disliked the way the alien died. This did not seem to be very realistic. And I disliked, that Ripley did not check with Bishop in the first place.... but ...well...shit happens I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story full of pain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You've been in my life so long, I can't remember anything else."This line perfectly captures Ripley's character in this movie. She is alone. Again, and probably forever. Her sense of survival and bravery got her to the point where there is no escape. Loosing everyone in the beginning of the film is Alien's way of revenge for what she did to the species. And making her a bearer of their future is the ultimate retribution. Alien 3 is very dark and depressing movie. Very heavy for weaker minds. But very beautiful at the same time. Returning to the spirit of horror created by Ridley Scott was a right move. Fincher added emotion and humanity. Philosophical questions concerning faith and destiny of people fighting for the greater good but paying for it. The structure and atmosphere of the movie is very unexpected after the second film. Unexpected and welcomed. Every entry in the franchise was given to the hands of directors with very distinct visions. In my eyes THAT is what makes this franchise unique. Ripley is at her lowest point. Haunted by nightmares. Pain. Her actions in the past made her the archenemy of Alien. And she has to pay for it. Alien took everything away from her so that IT is the only thing she has left. This connection is very fascinating and terrifying. The route this movie chose was not what fans were expecting after Aliens. And that may be the reason why this movie is not so loved like the previous pictures.Sigourney Weaver gives her best performance as Ripley. And in my opinion best performance of her life. She created the greatest female heroine of all time. Intelligent, strong and yet vulnerable. Very human and believable. She was born to play her. Fincher's direction is very strong. What he created with what he had to work with is astounding. Although very dark and depressing he made very beautiful film. Visually and artistically.Supporting cast is amazing. Only in thetrical version audience cannot make any emotional connections with most of the characters.Music by Goldenthall is one of my favourite scores as well.My only problem with this film is the hell the studio unleashed on it's creators. It is unforgivable and unprofessional to say the least.Assembly cut is the only way how to get closest to Fincher's vision. I cannot blame him for stepping away from the project at the very end. Story of the production of this movie is as dark as movie itself...As a final chapter in trilogy I think this movie did amazing job of closing Ripley's story. In a very realistic way.Let's hope studios like Fox learn from their mistakes but it's very unlikely.What we ended up getting is amazing when knowing what Fox was doing and it's all thanks to the talented people that worked on it...Till this day my most favourite of the franchise</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Assembly Cut reveals Alien? to be quite good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Six years after the success of Aliens, Alien 3 reared its head. Directed by no one less than newcomer David Fincher, the result was altogether quite?peculiar. And one need only inquire a little about the film's production to see why.After a nice manipulation of the 20th Century Fox logo by composer Elliot Goldenthal, the film immediately kicks you in the balls. The escape vessel carrying Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop crashes on a prison planet in the ass end of nowhere. Ripley is found unconscious on the beach, but Newt, Hicks and Bishop have all died. If you want reason no. 1 why some viewers like to pretend Ripley's story ended with Aliens, there you have it. The prison is home to inmates who are trying to find God. Needless to say, some find the presence of a woman most unsettling. Ripley discovers what happened from a friendly inmate played by Charles Dance and now has to learn to cope with life in the prison facility while waiting for a rescue ship. What nobody realizes however, is that our friendly neighborhood alien queen left a little surprise for them before she died at the end of Aliens.Alien 3 is a strange film to review. It shares a lot of elements with its predecessors: there's a single alien wreaking havoc on the inmates; Ripley has to slowly assume a position of authority and get everyone to work together, etc. But there's something decidedly different about this third outing and I think it's mostly to do with the humor, which is of the gallows variety. Make no mistake, the story is very dramatic. (spoilers) Ripley discovers her fellow passengers (including potential love interest and surrogate daughter) have died; she's forced to shave her hair due to lice issues in the prison; she discovers there's an alien inside her, the list goes on. And yet, there are times I'd label this film a comedy, albeit a very dark Fincher-ian one. It's mostly because of the inmates; whether it's the spiritual Dillon (Charles S. Dutton) giving speeches or some of the inmates acting crazy, it's a very funny film at times. Consider the scene where the warden is killed. He's always seen carrying a small black ball. When he's dragged up into the ceiling by the alien to everyone's surprise, the same ball drops to the floor moments later and one of the inmates carrying a chair appropriately responds with a resounding "Fuck!"Also, the film's definitely got its own style and themes. Even if you consider Alien 3 to be overall inferior to its predecessors?which I do?at least the final product's something that has got its own feel. Whether it's the dark humor or its many religious overtones, it's clear that they tried to do something new rather than rehashing ideas or turning the series into a boring formula and milking it for all its worth. (We'd have to wait until the Alien vs Predator movies for that?) While the troubled production (many writers, countless script revisions, Fincher complaining about studio interference, etc.) ensured the film itself was also troubled, a revised version dubbed the Assembly Cut changed and clarified a lot of things. The consensus is now that this is the version to watch. Needless to say, it's the version I've seen prior to this review and I imagine I would've disliked Alien 3 quite a bit had I seen the theatrical cut first. One of the more noteworthy changes has to do with the ending: apparently, in the original version, while Ripley falls into the lava, the alien bursts out of her chest, but Ripley holds on to it to ensure they both die. This however completely negates the difficult choice Ripley faces before when talking to Bishop: have the alien taken out in an operation after which Ripley will live on or sacrifice herself. She doesn't trust the company. She fears they'll keep the alien alive for research purposes instead of killing it. However, if she agrees to the operation, chances are she'll still be able to live a happy life. Finally, she refuses and decides she'd rather die knowing for certain the alien threat would die with her. Having the alien burst out of her while she's falling only indicates that she made the right choice as she was moments away from death. Had she accepted Bishop's offer, she'd still have died and the alien would be in the company's hands. The ending in the Assembly Cut is definitely more bittersweet as the alien does not pop out of her chest, indicating that she might have lived happily ever after. Not to mention the fact her Christ-like pose as she falls befits Alien 3's religious vibe.All in all, I definitely like this film. Despite it not being as tightly woven as its predecessors, there's still a lot to appreciate. Whether it's the great acting, the religious themes or the gallows humor, you're bound to like some aspect of Alien 3. Just make sure you're watching the Assembly Cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Too Bloody Dark!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two ALIEN movies struck gold, so it was inevitable that a third movie would be made. Unfortunately, in this case, third time is NOT a charm. Now rumor has it that ALIEN 3 went through a long and horrible process called "Production Hell." In Production Hell, studios try to get a movie made, but they keep running into problems. ALIEN 3 was originally supposed to be made by another director. But somewhere along the way, the director and writers had a falling out, and left the project. I don't how many directors the film went through, but it eventually was given to David Fincher (director of THE GAME, SEVEN, and the Netflix series HOUSE OF CARDS.) And what you see on screen (if you dare to watch the monstrosity) is simply awful. Ripley has crash-landed on a prison planet, the lone survivor yet again. However, an alien has also followed her... Do I REALLY need to tell you what happens next?! The main problem with the film is that none of the characters (apart from Ripley) are interesting at all. You'd think that with a cast of prisoners turned monks, they'd have at least a few, but no. And why oh why did they have Ripley shave off her hair and adopt a Susan Powter look? Also, most of the film is too bloody dark! Considering they're in a prison, you'd think there'd be more lighting. I know, I know, it makes everything appear scary. However, even the scares are lackluster. Halfway into the movie, I don't think the film had a script at all, because every actor just runs around in the dark, screaming at the top of his (or her) lungs. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the ending is blatantly ripped off from TERMINATOR 2. Sheesh, skip this fiasco and move directly onto ALIEN RESURRECTION.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always being a fan of Alien and Aliens.Both films masterpieces in their own right.The first,a slow-burn horror in space,tense atmosphere and a phenomenal creature design. The second,directed by James Cameron a pulse pounding action film,very much 1980s at it's core.Both very different from each other,both superb of what tried to do. After the 1986 super hit,the studio decided to make a third film. However hiring a "newbie" in a commercial maker David Fincher would prove to be a risky design for both the studio and the director.Constantly mending in his work on an unfinished script,the studio really hurt it's own chances of producing a worthy follower of the previous two films. The special edition of the film containing additional scenes,that apparently had made the movie a bit too long and were chopped out,really flesh out some of the characters and add a lot to the overall product. What Fincher did in his first motion picture was an unsafe,unHollywood,no punches being pulled grotesque. Had the special edition retained the dog bursting scene(instead of soulless dead bull),you could of had a movie on par with the first two,but again in a very different way. A dark,gritty and violent piece of film making that ends a spectacular trilogy in the most fitting way.A problem ridden film,maybe for numerous reasons,but a terrific,merciless addition also. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently I decided to watch the Alien films with my room mate in chronological story order (Prometheus first and not including the Predator franchise). I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this film as much as I did Alien and Prometheus. It is different, it is dark and it represents loss so bitterly well.The most controversial parts of this film are actually what I liked about them. I didn't care very much for the characters they kill off at the beginning of the film and for me Ripley's reaction to the loss of them held so much more emotional weight, so much more impact than their characters ever could provide for me alive in Aliens.As for the death of Ripley? I really liked how it was set up. Before this happens, human Bishop tries to convince Ripley that her chance to live was to come with them; She could go home and "make babies" (because, yes Bishop...that is how women define themselves). Ripley's response with an Alien Queen baby inside of her that threatens the very life of the universe is essentially...'Screw you, I'm jumping.' In those last moments the alien bursts out of her while she holds it in her hands in an almost strangling position into the hot lava like substance. Ripley sacrificed herself to save humanity. She felt there was no way for her to survive anyhow, so why not take that parasite of an Alien down with her? It's not just an alien inside of her...it's a Queen.(I know that so many have a problem with HOW she gets impregnated, because it's so loosely explained...yes I can agree with that point, it's a flaw.) Also, I really loved Clemens, because... well... Charles Dance. Brilliant Actor. The characters were well developed and deep. For me, this film was suspenseful and the darkness of it gives this film character. Perhaps some day more people will look back on this movie and give it another chance.Not every movie can end happy, some just tear your heart out.</fullReview>

Why? then an alien appears out of nowhere and the same thing happens as the last two. it takes out the crew one by one until Ripley and a couple of others are left. its not even as suspenseful as the others. its quite boring. so the alien is killed and then they find out that Ripley has a mother of the aliens growing inside her... wait, What??? okay, and then she kills herself. yeah, to stop the alien from destroying the world. they should have just left it with aliens or made another story which will actually please the fans? in summary, don't bother with this film.</fullReview>

Isn't it better to have lesser Alien movie than no Alien movie? This is David Fincher's first real movie. He builds on this and goes on to give us Seven and Fight Club. Celebrate this movie in its imperfection for what it is, decent entertainment from a rising director/producer.

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as some say it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 is obviously the most divisive entry in the sacred Alien series, some people love it, some hate it. I lean more towards the first one, I think its a good movie, but not a great one like it should've been. Alien 3 picks up some time after where Aliens left off. An alien egg has somehow managed to get on board the Sulaco (How it got there, I don't have a goddamn clue.) A fire breaks out and all the cryopods are ejected into space and crash land on the barren desert prison planet Fiorina 161. Ripley is once again the only survivor... the only human survivor that is, if you know what I mean. Alien 3 has its problems, chief among them being the killing of Hicks and Newt. It is so cheap and overall stupid it makes you angry that they killed them in THAT way. There are way too many characters, like 50 inmates I think, and most of them look alike. Ripley acts out of character several times, and it makes her seem... off. Also I don't like the part where they kill the dog, it just seemed pointless to me.. they could have done that off screen. However, Alien 3's pros help outweigh its cons. While the killing of Newt and Hicks is a slap in the face, it does help set the dark mood of the film. The cinematography looks so dark, bleak... and gorgeous. It is truly creative in its set design and also memorable. While most of the characters don't get enough screen time and development, those that do are actually fascinating. Like that guy who is a former rapist, well now in the prison he is a preacher for the prison's religion. Alien 3 is also very psychology ambitious, themes like religion, forgiveness, hate, and revenge are all brought to the forefront here and are handled very well. The acting in Alien 3 is really good, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, as is the script and most of the dialogue (several cheesy lines aside). The alien (yes, there is only one this time again) is a hit or miss. It is a hit in that it is a new fascinating variant of the xenomorph that we haven't seen before and I find that scary. It's a miss in that it looks really bad in some parts, like it looks cgi though it actually isn't. Alien 3 is a good movie in my eyes, while it has its flaws I still view it as a worthy entry into the Alien saga, and this is where the series should've ended. But no... Hollywood had to milk it with the next installment... and oh boy is it a doozy.</fullReview>

The egg develops INSIDE the ovipositor. And again, you're talking about at least 3 eggs!- Bishop brought the eggs?The eggs open when someone is nearby. They would have attacked Hicks in the shuttle.- The eggs were not found before hypersleep?No, and they would not open unless someone approached them. Which is hard to do when you're in a cryo chamber.- Facehuggers crawled into the shuttle?Without attacking Hicks? Or Ripley? Or Newt? And how exactly did the eggs open and they ran all the way up from the processing station to the shuttle?I cannot condone or forgive the existence of a movie which makes a mockery of the ending of two of my favorite films ever. It's as if Darth Vader came back from the dead with no explanation, in order to kill Solo, Leia and Chewbacca. The Aliens were creatures. Intelligent ones, sure.

The extended edition is a "must have" - those 31 minutes in plus make the difference. For me, it is much better than the second of the sequel ("Aliens") - there were too many creatures (Sigourney Weaver thinks that too). My only regret is the divergences between the theatrical and the extended version.

		<shortDescription>The Final Chapter In The Alien Series And The End Of Lt. Ellen Ripley.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher gives us back the same horror we felt in Ridley Scott's Alien.The plot, special effects and acting are outstanding. The casting is superb and this is what lifts the film. Full Plot: Following the events in Aliens, the Colonial Marine spaceship Sulaco experiences an onboard fire and launches an escape pod containing Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Newt, Hicks, and the damaged android Bishop who are all in cryonic stasis. During the launch, the ship's medical scans of the crew's cryotubes show an Alien facehugger attached to one of the crewmembers. The pod then crashes on Fiorina 'Fury' 161, a foundry facility and penal colony inhabited by all-male inmates with "double-Y" chromosome patterns and histories of physical and sexual violence. After some inmates recover the pod and its passengers, an Alien facehugger is seen approaching the prison dog. Ripley is taken in and awakened by Clemens (Charles Dance), the prison doctor, and is told she is the only survivor of the crash. Many of the ex-inmates have embraced an apocalyptic, millenarian version of Christianity, and Ripley is warned by the prison warden, Harold Andrews, (Brian Glover) that her presence among them may have extremely disruptive effects.Suspicious of what caused the escape pod to jettison and what killed her companions, Ripley requests that Clemens perform an autopsy on Newt. She fears that Newt may be carrying an Alien embryo in her body, though she does not share this information. Despite protests from the warden and his assistant, Aaron (Ralph Brown), the autopsy is conducted and no embryo is found in Newt's body, and Clemens proclaims she simply died in the crash. Meanwhile, Ripley's unusual behavior begins to frustrate the warden and is agitating the prisoners.A funeral is performed for Newt and Hicks in which their bodies are cremated in the facility's enormous furnace. In another section of the facility, the prison dog enters convulsions, and an Alien bursts from its body. The Alien soon begins to attack members of the colony, killing several and returning an outcast prisoner Golic (Paul McGann) to his former deranged state. To get answers, Ripley recovers and reactivates the damaged android Bishop, who confirms that there was an Alien on the Sulaco and it came with them to Fiorina in the escape pod. She then informs Andrews of her previous encounters with the Aliens and suggests everyone work together to hunt it down and kill it. Andrews does not believe her story and explains that the facility has no weapons. Their only hope of protection is the rescue ship being sent for Ripley by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.Back in the prison infirmary, while talking to Ripley about the situation, Clemens is killed by the Alien, which then approaches Ripley but does not attempt to kill her. She runs to the mess hall to warn the others, only to see the Alien kill the warden. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour highly flammable toxic waste, which is stored at the facility, into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the creature. An explosion is caused by the creature's premature intervention, resulting in several deaths. Using the medical equipment onboard the Sulaco escape pod, Ripley scans herself and discovers the embryo of an Alien Queen growing inside her. She also finds out that the Corporation truly wants the Queen embryo and the adult Alien, hoping to turn them into biological weapons. Deducing that the mature alien will not kill her because of the embryo she carries, Ripley begs Dillon (Charles S. Dutton), the religious leader of the inmates, to kill her, who agrees to do so only if she helps the inmates kill the adult creature first. They form a plan to lure it into the foundry's molding facility and drown it in molten lead by trapping it by closing a series of doors. The bait-and-chase style plan results in the death of Dillon and all the remaining prisoners, except Morse (Danny Webb), who pours the lead. The Alien, covered in molten metal, escapes the mold and is killed by Ripley when she turns on fire sprinklers and sprays the beast with water, causing its exoskeleton to cool rapidly and shatter via thermal shock.While Ripley battles the Alien, the Weyland-Yutani team arrives, including a man named Michael Bishop who looks identical to the Bishop android, claiming to be its creator. He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the Queen embryo, which he claims will be destroyed. Ripley refuses and steps back onto a mobile platform, which Morse positions over the furnace. The company men shoot Morse in the leg, and Aaron picks up a large wrench and strikes Bishop over the head with it, believing him to be an android. Aaron is shot dead and Bishop and his men show their true intentions, begging Ripley to let them have the "magnificent specimen". Ripley defies them by throwing herself into the gigantic furnace, just as the alien Queen begins to erupt from her chest. However, as she is dying from the wound, Ripley grabs the creature and holds on to it as she falls into the fire.The film ends with a sequence showing the facility being closed down, the last surviving inmate, Morse, being led away, and a shot of the Sulaco escape pod as the sound recording of Ripley's final lines from the original Alien film is heard.Notable Actors:Charles S. Dutton as inmate Dillon, the spiritual and de facto leader amongst the prisoners.Charles Dance as Jonathan Clemens, the facility's doctor. Brian Glover as Harold Andrews, the prison warden. Ralph Brown as Aaron, the assistant of Superintendent Andrews. Danny Webb as inmate Morse. Morse is the only survivor of the entire incident.Lance Henriksen as Michael Bishop.Conclusion: 10/10. Buy and watch this superb film on your home theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Finest and Dramatic Films of the Alien Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can it get any better? No, because Alien 3 goes all the way to all lengths. Alien 3 is set on a planet nicknamed Fury 16, where the Sulaco is attacked by a Facehugger hitchhiker who's acid blood causes the ship to presume a fire has broken out, and so fires it's crew out in an EEV, as well as the Facehugger stray. Alien 3 has a superb story, and is much more darker and crude than the others of it's series, with brilliant beginnings and shows more about the Xenomorph than we could ever learn. Without this film, we'd have no PredAlien! The film is dramatic, intense and creepy, with a more sinister and aggressive Xenomorph variant in - the Runner, or "Dog-Born Warrior". The most dramatic scene is possibly the ending, warning, spoilers ahead! Ripley commits suicide as she falls dramatically, in slow motion, down into the flames of a boiler as the Queen attempts to escape. Alien 3 is amazing and intense, maybe the best of the Alien series, but in no way superior to Aliens, in my personal opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(BTW, I'm 13) I had seen the first two (thought no. 1 was a quite slow) and enjoyed them. I read reviews of Alien3 and got the idea it was crap. In my opinion, it is better than the first two, and is a brilliant film on any scale. And I read reviews that said "it didn't have the suspense or horror of 'Aliens', and that the plot was bad". WTF??? Alien3 was way more suspenseful and scary. The plot was great, as well as the acting, and you cared about the character more than you did in 'Aliens' (like those stupid Marines). I have not yet seen Alien Resurrection, but have ordered the 'Alien Quadtrilliogy' box set. I think Alien3 is the most underrated film ever, and can't understand why people hate it. I just can't figure out how Alien fans could fail to like it. Weird. Anyway, if you haven't seen it, have you expectations low, because for some reason, people don't like it.</fullReview>

I know your gripes the story the "special" effects and the overly lame deaths. But please remember this is not Alien or Aliens this is Alien3, it is the same thing with Mad Max 3 if you go into it with the mindset of the first 2 films you will hate the third film (of either trilogy). Also for the record I found my self not caring what happened to any of characters the except: Ripley, Dillion and 85, mostly because there was almost no development for any one else. So please just enjoy it for what it is "special" effects and all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never got a chance to see the first 2 Alien movies.I've seen some parts, but that's about it.'Alien 3' takes our hero, Ridley, and puts her on an unknown planet that's really a prison.In the first two movies, she was forced into action by these ugly aliens that had acid for blood.Soon she finds out that an alien may be in the prison, but nobody believes her until somebody is killed by the alien.There are no weapons on the prison and the prisoners and Ridley are surrounded by the alien.What can they possibly do? You'll have to find out for yourselves.In short, 'Alien 3' is violent, gory, and slightly entertaining.It's not 'Alien Vs Predator', but it's still a good movie.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it at least a 6.6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great beginning, terrible end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts off really well, with some great suspense built up, but it soon degenerates into a mindless action flick with some really bad effects. I don't know what happened between Aliens and this, but somehow the visual effects managed to get worse. Every scene of the alien running down the hallway looks terrible fake; somehow, though, the close-ups of the Alien look fine. I'd say this is the darkest of the Alien films - it's quite grim and much more like the first than the second. The first hour is quite good, the last hour is not. Everything just degenerates, from the story to the acting to the direction. I don't know what happened. The ending, while well-intentioned, is terribly executed. That said, it's not a terrible film, as the great beginning redeems it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isolated and original but not bad at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie just never felt right. It had 2 great movies to build on and the biggest blemish for me is that it got started on the wrong foot. And to just wipe out the heroics of Ripley and make everything meaningless, what happened on lv46 is a downer. I truly think there could have been a way to save Newt. As a movie it has still grown on me and it is still a worthy sequel to the alien movies, but not more. I just think the story is too dark and somehow isolated. At least no one survived only to be killed in an eventual sequel... But the ending put forth a much more challenging task for creators of a 4th installment, whereas the the 2 1st movies almost encouraged a sequel this one surely don't. The acting is still on a high level and the story, though dark, pretty good on its own merits. I still would have liked a few more aliens but it was not a necessity. I'll give a weak 7 but it could have been higher if not for the out of place start to me anyways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving but flawed third movie (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third entry into the "Alien" series is not quite as bad as many have many have made out. As hinted by the title, the film returns to the original's central idea of a single creature against a team of motley humans. New director David Fincher has created an atmospheric and ultimately quite moving ending to what was thought to be a trilogy at the time. However, the film does not expand on the themes of the first two and leaves quite a few gaping holes in it's plot.The opening sequence (which uncomfortably jumbles the opening credits in with the action) Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her fellow survivors from "Aliens" forced to crash-land on prison planet after an alien egg and incumbent face-hugger sets fire to their ship. Ripley awakes to find she is, yet again, the sole survivor in the most unfriendly company of the prisoners. The face-hugger also survives and impregnates a prisoner's pet dog. Before long, a new alien is born and proceeds to decimate the prisoners. As well this, Ripley discovers that she, too, is carrying an alien inside her....The story for this one is not terrible, as it maintains momentum and keeps the viewer interested, but on reflection leaves one or two unanswered questions. It is never sufficiently explained how the alien egg got on board the ship, and how the same face-hugger could infect both Ripley and the prisoner's dog is never explained at all. Some plot strands, such as what happens to demented prisoner Golic (Paul McGann), are left unexplored (like all the films so far, inclusion of deleted material could have helped this alot.) The greatest victim of the plot is, ironically, the alien of the title. The first two films took great care in creating a creature whose motivation for killing people was to reproduce. All of that is thrown out of the window here, the alien reduced to a mere killing machine that randomly attacks anyone and everyone (except the impregnated Ripley) with no rhyme or reason to its actions.In spite of this inherent flaws, the script does deliver a strong main thread with Ripley's conflict with the creature, her pregnancy giving her situation a strangely ambiguous twist that is resolved in the film's moving finale. There are also quite a few distinctive characters amongst a cast of mainly cardboard cut-outs.Weaver maintains a strong lead as Ripley and she is in the fine company of the mainly British actors playing the prisoners. Charles Dance is excellent as the prison's doctor, forming a touching if brief romance with Ripley. The late Brian Glover is well-cast as the surly supervisor, and Ralph Brown is also good as his simpleton assistant. Charles S. Dutton makes a striking impression as Dillon, a prisoner who has used religion as a means to guide both himself and his fellow inmates.As with "Alien", the set design here is superb. While the prison environment (including, among other things, an ore refinery) is too expansive to be claustrophic, it looks great with its shades of brown, black and red creating the right feel of griminess and imminent doom.While Fincher doesn't quite have Cameron's touch with the action scenes, there are some good set-pieces in the prison's tunnels as well as the finale in the refinery.Overall, a good if slightly muddled effort that would have made a good ending to this series of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why it gets panned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ive just watched alien3, and read a lot of the comments here. a lot are very scathing while some very complimentary - mine is one of the latter.originally, when i had first seen this film i was disappointed. i expected a sequel to Aliens more than a sequel to Alien, which is what we got instead, but that was because i was only 13 years old and unable to appreciate a film for what it is. so for all those who wanted aliens2, here is my suggestion: get Fincher to re-shoot the opening scenes to include a big shoot-out so that you feel that you are watching aliens again, then when they crash-land, perhaps some imagery of empty guns being left behind so that we realise that it will be a thoughtful and inventive film rather than a bullet-fest.my personal thoughts on the series is that i disagree with what a few of the comments have said - i believe that this is not really a set of two films, not a trilogy, but a complete set of four that display a progression. we have, in the first, a scared and inexperienced Ripley who sees her colleagues slaughtered and begins to fight back. then we have a more confident Ripley in Aliens, where she learns to fight the aliens with courage. Alien3 gives us more progression as Ripley is now in control of the alien as it cannot harm her, she knows how to beat it, and she is becoming mother to an alien. in Resurrection, she has been reborn and has alien qualities, while the alien has some of her qualities. as someone said, ripley IS alien and alien IS ripley, something that cannot be more true in Resurrection.there can surely be no fifth, as Ripley would have to be either all alien (gives Sigourney a rest, at least!) or she would have to be in control of the aliens. perhaps to continue this progression, we have to have a similar plot to one of the books, where the aliens species that created the ship on LV426 is even more beligerent than the aliens we know and hate, and we need the Aliens as our only effective weapon against them.who knows. but everyone knows how Hollywood doesn't sniff at the guaranteed income sequels bring</fullReview>

As if she didn't have enough problems trying to get these guys off her back, she soon finds out that an army of flesh eating alien predators have survived the crash as well. It gets worse. Ripley eventually learns that she will soon give birth to an alien offspring. The usual, not for all tastes levels of sci-fi gore take up much of the film which still manages to be a little entertaining. Its predecessor, "Aliens" is better, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film....BUT!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caution: A spoiler or two!I thought Alien 3 was good way to end the series. Some people might not like this film because it's not so action packed like ALIENS and their some periods where the movie is a bit slow plus Hicks and Newt are killed off right in the middle of the beginning credits. What really URKS me though is the way Newt died. In the movie, she drowns in her cryotube...okay..sure that can happen! But if that's how she died, then, how in the world did Ripley manage to survive the crash into the ocean when we see a big gapping hole on her face plate during the opening credits(if you take a good look during the opening credits you'll see that the part of the glass of her cryotube is shattered where her face is) before the big plunge. Ripley should have drowned too dying with the others...heh, end of Alien 3 after 2 minutes, LOL! Anyway, the only explanations I could think of were, one, very very BAD editing, or two, the directors were THAT desperate to get Newt out of the picture and made a cheap shot at it! I really did like Alien 3. However, Newt dying from cryotube malfunctions would have made much more sence and probobly would have been a little more excepted by viewers. Alien 3 is a great tragic film showing how the alien has effected Ripley's life, taking away everyone she loves. But parts of the beginning are not balanced and I'm surpised the directors didn't catch this glitch before releasing the film. So what did Ripley do while under water...hold her breath?????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**POSSIBLE SPOILER**The link between this film and Aliens is really, really weak. An egg 'somehow' just manages to make it past everyone's attention and get Ripley (don't know if that's a spoiler or not). How in God's green Earth did the queen alien lay an egg there after Ripley blew the sod clean out of the egg sac in Aliens? Besides, I thought facehuggers died after they got their victims, rather than go get another one. This film makes Aliens seem like an awful, or should I say great big, waste of time, in that Hicks and Newt cop it at the start. Why? Another thing I've noticed in these films is that EVERY one has to have an alien exploding from something's chest, and EVERY one has to have an android in it. Not bad, necessarily, but unoriginal. Aside from these comments, I thought Alien 3 was a mediocre film. Easily comparable to the original, it's horror is darker and more 'Apocalyptic' than it's predecessors. The best thing about this film, I thought, was that it had the perfect ending for a trilogy, then those stupid people had to bring her back for Resurrection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This much maligned film is far better than most people think. David Fincher adds a wonderful well suited visual style. The production design is unbelievable, the script is very serious and incredibly well-acted by Weaver, Dutton, and Dance. Understandably not liked by people expecting another action film like Aliens, if this movie was not related to the Alien series and didn't have the former films to live up to it would be regarded as a film classic. There is truly nothing bad in this movie, everything works well together and comes to an emotional climax. If you see this movie see it in widescreen, it is far better that way as is for all movies.Note: There is actually about 20 minutes of extra footage which was cut from the film which Fox will hopefully add on DVD or tape. It would add alot more tension and action to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Alien was a dog!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely adored the first two Alien films. Alien creates a dense atmosphere of paranoia, claustrophobia and sheer terror. Aliens was a fantastic continuation of the story, adding a great adrenaline rush as well as an amazing character study. After watching these two masterpieces, I was a bit uneasy about watching Alien3, mainly because of the low scores it had received. I gave it a spin anyway, and was sorely disappointed.The film is much darker than the previous ones, and opens with most of the larger roles of Aliens being killed in a crash. All right, it might still work. Ripley is held on a prison planet where the inmates have found religion. Odd, but all right. An Alien survived the crash and is now loose in the prison. Ah, the plot thickens! In the prison, there are quite a few interesting personalities, such as the insane Golic (Withnail &amp; I actor Paul McGann) and Dillon, the spiritual leader of the inmates. The most interesting one is the doctor of the place, Clemens. We get a glimpse of his story and his life, but he is eaten by what has become a grotesque hybrid between the world's worst killer machine and a vicious chihuahua before his story reaches a conclusion.And this is the problem with the film. The most interesting characters are killed off at the beginning, Ripley just wanders around, trying to stay alive, without any real motive. In Alien, the crew wanted to get home. In Aliens, Ripley wanted to protect Newt. In Alien3, she just doesn't want to die. Sure, the whole Alien Queen thing was interesting, but it wasn't enough for the character, and so I think it ended on a sour note.The inmates are the worst, however. Where Ripley just lacks depth, these attempt to preserve a hard-boiled street style, throwing foul language and punches around meaninglessly. The whole religion-thing just seems tacked on and is largely forgotten by the end of the film (which was, by the way, far from satisfactory).And the Alien itself is just horrible as well. I like the idea of it changing with every film, but here it more resembles a dog than it does the fearsome killer we saw in the previous films. Come on, this is Alien, not Cujo! The terror of the first film is completely forgotten here, and we're supposed to be entertained by an adrenaline rush. I certainly wasn't.Alien: Resurrection wasn't a good film. But at least it had a proper ending, and decent characters. Alien3 was just a misfire, and I don't think of it as canon in the Alien storyline. David Fincher is a fantastic director, and he has created some absolute masterpieces. But Alien3 isn't one of them. It could have been great, there were many interesting elements, but overall, it should never have happened. 6/10 is being extremely generous.</fullReview>

They land on a planet that seems like it's been at least 100 years since that time and of course, everybody dies except for Ripley, otherwise Alien 3 wouldn't work. What surprises me was that Alien puts the Gothic Horror back in this movie that was left out of Aliens and combines it with action. However the movie ends to quickly. When we actually get into the mood and the tradition of Alien 3, the ending credits roll. Now the Special Assembly Cut Edition does give you time to enjoy the film. The studio should have released that version of the film instead of the version that is floating around which take less than two hours. The movie does try to get it right but its only a few things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take My Advice: Watch The Special Edition, You Won't Be Disappointed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few movies have gotten the controversy and attention that Alien 3 has gotten. Mixed views on the film have and continue to surface. Some love it for its focus put back towards the horror genre. Others find it disappointing by seeing it as a movie that doesn't do anything new with the series as they see it as a bit of throwback to Alien. Judging from the stars I'm sure you can figure out which camp I'm in.Let me be clear on one thing though, if you really want to get the best experience out of Alien 3 watch the special edition. While I enjoyed the theatrical release it was just so easy to tell how people didn't like it, as it's the more boring version. The special edition of Alien 3 actually catches your attention and gets you interested in the outcome of the movie. So if you didn't like Alien 3 and are reading my review thinking I'm just another person liking it because it's an Alien film watch the special edition yourself, you'll see why so many love it.Alien 3 takes place on Florina 161, a planet with an unstable atmosphere. Because of the harsh conditions on Florina 161, the few inhabitants have to stay underground most of the time. They also have to keep their heads shaved due to a lice outbreak on the planet. Ripley's ship crash-lands on this planet and she finds herself among the prisoner inhabitants of Florina 161, who are made up of rapists, serial killers and psychopaths. Conflicts brew upon Ripley's arrival and the arrival of a new, faster and more agile alien.So, why is Alien 3 such a great film you ask? Well, even though it's not an original twist to the franchise after the first Alien film, I'm actually glad that it's not an action film. While was the real trump card of Aliens, it was mostly because it was a different take for the movies. Alien 3 goes for a grittier and more suspenseful take compared to the in-your-face action and it works surprisingly well. While Alien 3 won't scare it'll still have you interested in what happens throughout the film till the end.As a master of suspenseful and thematic thrillers, David Fincher's touch to the gritty and dirty tone for Alien 3 shows very nicely. I'll also admit for a movie that didn't have a script when production began, the plot and flow of the movie goes very smoothly. One thing that might surprise you in Alien 3 is that it actually has a sense of humor even though it's a pretty serious and religious film. While the movie won't make you do much more than chuckle a bit in these areas it does help the film escape some moments that may seem a bit too serious.Alien 3 also has some strong performances to help the movie flow better. Weaver is once again Ripley but even after getting her head shaved you can still easily tell it's her. You've also got actors playing the prisoners of Florina 161 that help to compliment the serious tone. The viewer will even start to grow a connection with these deranged serial killers because of the situation they are in with the alien hunting them down. This effect works very well and makes Alien 3 arguably as good as Aliens, if not better.Against what seems like impossible odds towards being a good movie, Alien 3 actually comes out as a great movie. Every time I watch Alien 3 I love it even more than before, and the ending (which should've really ended the series) remains as touching as ever. If David Fincher is reading this then he must know that he has nothing to be ashamed of in this movie, it's excellent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third time isn't the charm for either Ripley, Newt, or Hicks. Their ship crash lands on Fury 161, a maximum security prison located at the end of space. Newt and Hicks are killed off quickly at the start of the movie, However Alien3 is still entertaining and refreshing. Its dark and artistic with one of the best musical score ever for a sci-fi film.Again Secourney Weaver is the main character, a magnificent performance by her, Charles Dance, and Charles S. Dutton, top notch acting no complaints here. But the real star here is the atmosphere created by the director David Fincher, absolutely brilliant moods sets, Alien3 production design is the best of all four movies, Aliens is still a better film, how ever alien3 stand up to the test of time. Alien3 improves on each new viewing, it has aged well compared to the other four films.Alien3 is not without faults, lame CGI alien graphics, a bit slow at times, weak sub characters as in the prisoners and a intro that raised too many questions. Recommended viewing for Weaver's performance and excellent cinematography and a very under rated musical score.If there was an award for title screen/intro this movie would be the the one that all should be compared to, great looking intro.Overall , not as good as aliens or alien but alien3 holds it own, should be seen by any true sci-fi fan...8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most underrated film in the franchise. ***** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of this film since it's release in '92. I'm totally aware of the conflict between the director and the studio and all of the various different stories to do with this film. Not too many films with that kind of history can turn out quite like this one. Somehow a very good entry in the series was born amongst all of the stuff that was going on. All of the acting is excellent. Elliot Goldenthal scored one of my favorite film scores ever. Weaver looks like a real bad ass with a shaved head. And the Dog Alien is the scariest creature in any of the 'Alien' films. You see, this one can run on all fours. The atmosphere here is very industrial and bleak. Personally, I'm not too sure why it has gained all of the critical lambasting it has, but I think it was a perfect way to end the Alien Trilogy. Of course Alien Resurrection come around and continued the story of Ellen Ripley... but that's another story.The DVD version contains a different cut of the film, which is quite interesting. I especially liked how some of the characters were given a lot more screen time but some of these scenes have to be played with subtitles because they never went through the dubbing stage of production and it can be hard to hear the characters speak over loud background noises. You would have thought somehow they could have been dubbed over for the DVD release. Still, they're good to see. I thought the alternate alien birth was quite neat. The special effects in this sequence were great. However, if the alien was born from an ox, I think it would have been best had they put horns on the alien. Still this alternate scene isn't as dramatic as the theatrical version. I personally prefer the dog birth scene since it's a lot harder to watch because you can tell that the poor dog is in a lot of pain. Perhaps the most disappointing moment in the alternate cut is the ending. The queen alien no longer pops out of Ripley's chest. There are major cuts here, and the music shifts gears, sounding obviously tampered with. Overall though, this version is an interesting alternative but I still prefer the theatrical version.I highly recommend this film regardless of what the director and all the nay-sayers say. It's good stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I can remember being really quite disappointed - it seemed to be incoherent, not very scary and definitely not worthy compared to the previous movies. Now I know why - the director was clearly overruled by the money men and his film wasn't the one released in 1992. Oh yes, it was the same actors and he shot the scenes, but someone took an axe into the cutting room. The directors cut doesn't just add a couple of extra scenes, its a completely different movie with real tension, grit and true horror befitting the Alien franchise. This movie has now gone from being the worst of the four to equal second. Thank god for DVD!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie of the Series (just)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly if you have only seen the theatrical release of this then I urge you to see the Directors cut. It adds a lot more to the film in terms of characters and even has a different host for the Alien.The opening to the movie is a visual treat. It shows of the bleak setting wonderfully and I wonder why it wasn't included in the actual release. It also reaffirms what I thought about the theatre release, that this isn't a film about the Alien. In fact an early script would have had no Alien appearing at all. It delves into the psyche of murderers and rapists who are left to rot on a planet with only god to guide. The sense of isolation and meagre existence led by the prisoners captivated me. The Alien is the devil of the film come to grab them back to their previous lives of 'evil'.The acting is first class, and probably the best of any sci-fi I can think of. Reactions to the monster are correct showing genuine fear rather than the masochism shown in Aliens, Resurrection and AVP. This out of all others in the story attempts to show of the loneliness of space exploration and look into the lives of those that inhabit the universe. If you are a fan of sci-fi then this I feel is the best of the bunch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst in the series!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The underrated Alien3 is underrated, and for a great reason, too. It takes place after the second alien film, Aliens. Ripley's ship has crashed, killing the remaining crew and Newt, and while they were sleeping, the alien had got into Ripley's stomach. Ripley finds herself on a planet completely inhabited by prisoners, and another alien is accidentally unleashed on the planet. The bodies of the people on deck are burned to rid the planet of an alien, yet one still runs amok on the planet, and starts killing the prisoners. Tragically, there are no weapons, and a rescue ship won't arrive for weeks. Alien3 was weak, first of all, because it killed off Newt, and the end was a tie between dramatic and annoying. Also, in some scenes of CGI, the alien looked fake. If you want to see some good alien movies, stick to the first two, and maybe the fourthGrade: 5/10MPAA Rating: RMy Rating: Ages 15 and up (mature themes, violence, gore, strong language)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The conclusion of a great trilogy (we don't talk about Alien Resurrection in our house)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vastly underrated, even in its theatrical form, Alien 3 is probably the least of the original three movies but still well worth a viewing. One of the problems with the project was the choice of Director (or DirectorS as there were several that passed through the revolving door before the movie was released.I haven't yet seen the alternative DVD version but it's on my to-do list. From what I can tell it expands on some of the characterisations and is apparently the preferred version among Alien buffs. I have also heard of a 4-hour completely uncut version that would make fascinating viewing.This theatrical release though deserves more credit than it generally gets. It dares to dampen audience expectations by killing off two of the main characters from Aliens more or less during the opening credits, even showing an autopsy being performed on one of them. Ripley is reduced to a shaven, dirty, initially frightened and unwelcome addition to the steel-works cum prison where she crashes, although once it becomes clear that there's another alien running around then Sigourney Weaver changes her character and Ripley assumes unofficial command as the prisoners attempt to survive.Americans proably don't like this movie as much as the first two, mainly due to the casting of mostly British actors who therefore would be unrecognisable to our friends across the pond. Among the exceptions is Charles Dance who gives a very good, restrained performance as the prison doctor, although he is also an inmate. He and Ripley become intimate in an understandable kind of way and Dance's exit from the movie again slightly unsettles audiences expectations. He is, after all, a heart-throb (so I'm told) so this movie definitely doesn't follow the script where "popular" characters save the day.Charles Dutton gives a good performance as the kind-of head preacher and he is initially reluctant to get involved with Ripley because he fears that her presence will interfere with the normal everyday running of the prison. However Brian Glover as the Prison governor is less convincing in his role.A good film, nonetheless. 7/10</fullReview>

David Ficher's directing was brilliant, Elliot Goldenthal's score was magnificent, the acting was great and had probably some of the best scenes in the whole series. I understand that the fans might have been annoyed by the abscence of the two characters from the 2nd installment, but please, that's what distracted them from enjoying this movie. This movie doesn't deserve a 6.0, it deserves at least a seven. The ending on the contrary was the perfect way to end the series.

		<shortDescription>Good but weakest of the saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been awhile since I've been reviewing so now here I go again reviewing another Alien movie in the saga. Alien 3 has always been good yet a confusing and melodramatic entry in the series. Some things I felt didn't add up in the series. The directing, acting, and some special effects were pretty good. I think this time it was the script that kinda needed some adjusting I mean its not bad but it wasn't that god plus the plot needed some explaining. The movie opens up with a few shots of the ship SULACO and reveals an alien on aboard causing the ship to catch on fire, last remaining survivors sent in a shuttle and then causing the ship to be destroyed. They crash land on a prison planet filled with nothing but men. Unfortunately Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) ends up only being the only survivor and the rest dead. When Newt is dead she suspects something about her death like an Alien may have killed her but Dr. Clemons (Charles Dance) dosen't think so. However later on a dog ends up being impreganted and Alien emerges and is ready to kill once again. While dealing with her case Ripley is ordered to shave her hair because of a lice problem on the planet and also engages in a relationship with Clemons who is more then willing to help her if he could. However Superintendent Andrews (Brain Glover), wants this woman to be rid of since she's considered a high priority and since the system dosen't really allow women. The prisoners don't really care about it that much Dillion (Charles Dutton) even tolerates the intolerable. But soon enough they realize that the Alien is killing several people and the prisoners begin to question how to kill it since the prison has no weapons of any kind. Alien 3 in my opinion trys to be a really stylish film it comes close to working but fails in retrospect. Like It should have fleshed out the characters, Clemons and Ripley's relationship could have been a developed more as well as the others prisoners it seemed liked the edited the wrong scenes. Oh and how did an Alien get there in the first place was Bishop in on it could be but to me Bishop seemed like an ok android but you never know. Burke could had more aliens but it would seem impossible so that to isn't proven. Plus I mentioned some of the special effects were good the movements of the Alien running around and all that stuff weren't that good they kinda looked fake in some spots but they did whatever they could. Plus the ending was sad I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it but those who have you already understand. I didn't hate Alien 3 I think the actors did a pretty good job (especially Weaver, Dutton and Dance and Henriksen last appearance). The directing was good for David Fincher as a first time director (who will make the successful Seven). Alien 3 is too melodramatic and poorly edited but as it stands on it's own its a good movie to watch none the less. Regular Scale- 3/5: 1-10 Scale- 7/10. NOTE: I think in order for the film to be better they need to reinstate some scenes that were ultimately cut out that further explained the story and fleshed out the characters. I think the Quadrilogy set will have this so in the end Alien 3 could become a classic that never was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The critics need to take another look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*minor spoilers*"Alien 3" has proven to be the most hotly debated entry in the legendary science fiction series. When it was first released, the response from both critics and the public was hostile--the film killed off the remaining survivors from the previous film ("Aliens"), leaving Ripley, the series' female protagonist, on her own again. After its action-packed predecessor, viewers were also disappointed to find that this new film went back to the basics; instead of an action movie it was a gothic, existentialist drama. To boot, it was a dark, gloomy film where absolutely nothing went right for any of the characters. It's somber and sober throughout, with barely a ray of hope to be seen. Creatively, the film had a troubled production history, with various writers and directors being attached to the project, but quitting. Finally, music video director David Fincher (known for his work with Madonna) was hired, but his efforts were hampered by studio interference; the frequent rewrites and subsequent postproduction edits made for an uneven film. Yet, looking back on it after a good decade, I find that most people were much too hard on it. It has numerous flaws, but its dramatic and artistic qualities still deserve to be acknowledged.As Ripley, Sigourney Weaver has proven to be the true backbone of the Alien trilogy. Here, she accepts her fate and even looks forward to her inevitable end. Her eventual demise is absolutely logical in the context of the series; cloning her in the next film was nothing more than an act of shameless commercialism in a movie that will never have the durability of its predecessors. Here, she allows her character to express the emotional toll the aliens have inflicted on her for what seems like an eternity. She loses everyone she has ever cared about, and her grief is so genuine it scarcely feels like acting. She shines in one powerful, brutal scene where Newt (see the previous film) is dead and autopsied--it is so painful some viewers will wish to turn away.While many of the supporting characters are not very well-defined, there are still some standouts. As the leader of the prisoners, Charles S. Dutton is the most complex supporting character, one who has discovered his faith and become a new person, even after the terrible crimes he's committed in the past. I liked Charles Dance as the out-of-luck doctor who befriends Ripley, though is character is killed off a bit too early--their chemistry could have helped the film a bit more. Brian Glover does well as the bitter warden who refuses to believe what is happening around him, until he discovers the truth all too late. Ralph Brown is sympathetic as the slow-headed but well-meaning administrative assistant, one of the few characters who don't immediately emote hostility towards Ripley. There is not a single bad performance, despite the characterization problems.I admit I have been inconsistent in my own views of "Alien 3." The first time I watched it, I felt let down, but upon subsequent viewings, its merits have become more clear to me. Visually, the film is nothing less than stunning at times. Set on a nearly abandoned prison colony, the film creates an atmosphere of despair and decay. The dominant color scheme consists of rust browns and oranges. The cinematography is stylish; the most immediately apparent visual trick is the alien POV shots. There is a brilliantly directed funeral scene, intercut with the newly gestated alien. The effect is simultaneously melancholy, disturbing and moving. David Fincher's direction helps sustain the film despite its formulaic structure, creating memorable images and shot compositions. The set designers have spared no expense at making the film look as authentic as possible; so convincing is their work that one finds it difficult to believe that it was filmed right here on earth. In fact, this may point out one of the biggest problems people had with the film: it could never truly qualify as escapism. This is not a film to be watched casually--it is genuinely depressing at times, enough to generate a pang of sorrow in the heart. As a science fiction film, this is as close to realistic plausibility as the genre ever comes. Like Ridley Scott's original, "Alien 3" takes place in the actual universe we inhabit. In the coming years, it will hopefully earn the respect it deserves, despite its flaws.*** (out of ****)Released by Twentieth Century Fox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the "Directors Cut/Extended Version"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this again recently for the first time in fifteen years. Like many, I was so infuriated by the killing off of Newt and Hicks that I refused really to acknowledge what was happening in this film. However, I was always aware of how good it looked, its atmosphere and general tone and when I realised it was David Fincher that directed it I thought perhaps that maybe I should give this another try.Mellowed with age (!) I decided to give the film a second chance, and knowing of the controversies with the script and editing etc etc I finally gave it another go, but this time the newer extended version. While still not exactly Fincher's "Directors Cut" (he wasn't allowed to film things he wanted to do I gather) this is for all intents and purposes his version and the one that should have been released. I watched it on a rainy Saturday afternoon and was frankly stunned. It was absolutely superb, not just standing up to the previous two classics but perhaps even having the edge on them in terms of style and content. Once you grasp the main moral theme of the story it really does grab you. Apart from the fact that it is so terribly and genuinely sad, it offers some interesting metaphysical points (sorry...big word, didn't want to sound that pretentious...really) about the Alien being in a way "Death" and how mankind can defeat it by accepting it (death that is not the monster). Someone else on IMDb described the film as like a fine wine that matures with age. I agree, and I can't recommend this version enough (simply don't bother with the theatrical release...it's OK don't get me wrong but it's not a classic like this one)especially if like me you're one of these people that was so angered by it after seeing Aliens. Actually when you realise that it was one of the original scripts that killed off Hicks and Newt I can even more forgive Mr Fincher. Also, and I'm sure proper film fans won't be, the effects are stilted at times especially with the alien. This is because the original idea had the alien coming out of an ox and therefore was supposed to be fairly large when in the theatrical release it came out of a dog. Link this with the aliens "growth", editing and adding effects later in the day partially explains why the alien doesn't seem quite right at times. Either way - you MUST see this version, easily a nine out of ten to the original releases 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original cut many years ago when one my friends brought it over. I was bored and frankly, felt the film was pretty weak. I was never a horror fan and I felt this just didn't make me care at all. However last summer, my friend brought over his directors' cut copy of this movie and begged for me to give it another chance so I did.I was blown away at how much better this movie was. I actually cared about the characters and was blown away at how much better the movie was. I did not want this movie to end because i felt they really had a good handle on this one. It felt a lot like the first one. More suspense and less action. Now mind you, my favorite of the series is Aliens because of the action, but this movie really grabbed a hold on me and did not let go. Do not let the length shy you off because you won't feel it by the end. The movie has so much more emotion in it and after viewing this the second time became a favorite of mine which will sit in my library. 8 out of 10 and it ever so deserves it. why the studio cut it down so much in the first place, I'll never understand.

		<shortDescription>Unfairly maligned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a franchise which owes so much to atmosphere, Alien3 is often unfairly overlooked. The penal colony sets are a triumph of mood and environment and make a perfect mold for the cast, the script and the movie as a whole.The cast is uniformly excellent. Weaver is at her most vulnerable and human, providing an introspective window (especially in her interactions with Clemens) for which there was no room in previous movies. And the chiefly British supporting cast is superb. Considering that this movie was originally to be the swan song of an Alien trilogy, the English dramatic sensibility gives it a perfectly dark, somber tone.The cinematography and directing are wonderful. The imagery is striking, oppressive, foreboding and most of all consistent--everything an Alien movie should be, and maybe a better realization of Ridley Scott's original vision than anything else.The creature itself is just the silent menace it should be. It's up to its old tricks, emerging in fast takes to thin the cast one at a time. And the final combined effort to defeat it is tense and climactic. (Charles S. Dutton has a ferocious screen presence.)All this, its radical departure from the previous installment, is probably why this film is so dismissed. Unfortunately, people really do hate an unhappy ending, and people seem to value continuity over a movie with a refined vision that stands on its own. What most of them don't realize is that in Weyland-Yutani's bleak future, Ripley's sacrifice is a happy ending, and the last image of her vanishing into the fire to the swelling adagio is poetic. (Goldsmith's score is transporting. When I first saw the movie in theaters, the one image that stuck with me the most was the final montage, the triumph of the orchestra contrasting with the desolation of the colony.)It isn't an action movie. It is an Alien movie, much more than Alien Resurrection, which views like a comic book transplanted onto the screen. (Alarmingly many people are willing to mention the latter in the same breath with the first and second as the "true" Alien films.) Watch this with an unjaundiced eye and you'll find a surprisingly well-made movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien meets its maker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the continuing saga of the Alien series ALIEN 3 gives the saga a heart, a spirit, and a reason for doubt. A troubled production and many script re-writes gave final director David Fincher a rather difficult task. How do you follow a progression that requires either an alien apocalypse or a radical re-definment of a repulsive villain which has become a de-facto hero?H.R. Geigers alien is an enduring work of art. Long after these movies have been forgotten the "alien" will remain. Fincher decided here to give some spiritual dimension to this phenomenon of cinema. We have the "new life" sermon at the furnace, the first scene in the 3 movies where we see Ripley relate to another human being as something more than xenomorph fodder. We see the poor inmates, playing scenes as if the alien were some sort of divine retribution for their sins. And doing it in a morbidly realistic way.Most Alien Fans hate A3 because it is a stark, dark movie. The human characters have dimension, awareness and believability. Nobody wins. The Alien least of all. The main protagonist dies, and so does the supporting cast. The only people to emerge from the slaughter and befuddled war, are overly-equipped Japanese mercenaries and of course, the head of the "company". This message - no salvation - no victory - is of course anathema to those who cheered on the "grunts" of aliens. And it is because of this that audiences and critics gave this movie the thumbs down when it came out.In the Alien Pantheon, it is the odd one out. In the David Fincher pantheon it is the touchstone. Alien 3 with it's new take on alien DNA (a dog birth makes it look slightly like a dog) gives the series a credible extension, mired in tragedy.Don't see it on your own. You won't be frightened - you'll be depressed.So... do you trust me with a needle?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies in the history of motion pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is among the 5 best movies in the history of Cinema. I can watch it for 100 times, I never get tired of watching it again, and each time I find a new gem in it. It is simply a masterpiece. The last scene, when Ripley dives into the melting pot, has been etched in my memory forever. The music combines so well with the scene. Everything is perfect, not many scenes in the history of cinema could match it. When the little alien breaks out through her chest, she is exactly like a mother, giving birth to a monster. For a woman that has never given birth, this is her first and last child. She catches it in her hand, for a moment it looks like she loves this newborn, and then both of them die forever.The colony is so bizarre. The personalities, how they interact are perfect. The scene where they are sending the corpse to her fiery grave, where the black man starts to talk about life and death, combined with the birth of the alien, is another masterpiece.The doctor character is also interesting. I only wish they could have left him alive a bit more. He could add a lot more to the later scenes.The scenes of carnage by the alien in the dark tunnels, the photography is amazing and magnificent. When it chases the inmates and they run away, the camera work, how it runs through the corridors, is great.The scene where she brings back the humanoid to life and talks to him is one of the most horrible and at the same time heart breaking scenes I have ever seen.To put it in a nutshell, the photography is splendid, the music combines superbly, the story about these quasi-monks and criminals is strong and thrilling. I rank it among the 5 best movies in the history of cinema and always astounded why it is so under-rated. it is a forgotten gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holding your own with other aliens.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you too want to direct an Alien film. Best thing to do is not follow Ridley Scott and/or James Cameron. If this cannot be avoided (and hello! it can't) proceed with being creative, because it won't matter anyway.I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise. Alien was my favorite show when I was a kid, I don't mean when I was 15 more like when I was 5. So back in '92 when this installment bombed at the box office, I was sad. I never went to see it because of what others told me, like Ripley dies and we are again limited to one Alien. So what's the point?I did not see this until a year ago. Oh it is oh, so cool. So good. It didn't see until after I saw "Fight Club" and realizing what a great man David Fincher was. It is one of those times when you just need to ignore other's negative comments.I cannot comment enough on everything that makes it a perfect ending to the series. The reversal of being trapped with the beast again. The doom that lines ahead that we know so much of. Ripley becomes more of a character as the only female on the planet. It is quite the thriller to the end. The continuation of the weapons department valuing something so ugly and vile or humanity. It was great as far as filmmaking. Aliens was great as far as entertainment. See the difference? Anyways, don't be thrown off. Give it more than a chance. It is deviant, but holds it's own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminally overrated sequel, pathetic monster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm very tired of hearing so much hype about Alien 3. The movie is criminally overrated; here's why....First, the writers failed to go a different direction with this plot. After James Cameron's brilliant first sequel where Ripley and crew had every weapon imaginable at their disposable, it is a very tiresome move that Ripley would be now be stuck to fight the Alien creature again with no weapons at all (Alien, anyone?). This is the direction this epic saga should never have taken. In order for a series to evolve, it needs to make progress and break new ground. Alien 3 failed to do so.Sigourney Weaver puts in the worst performance of the series as Ripley. Charles S. Dutton ruins this movie with his constant overacting. His speeches are terrible! In fact, I think all the actors did a below average job in their roles. The dialogue is awful and basically consists of f-words. Some credit goes to Fincher, who at least tried to give this movie decent cinematography and art direction. On the other hand his approach is often too heavy-handed and his ultra-dark atmosphere does not fit to a survival horror series.The special effects are pathetic... how this movie was nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects is beyond me.In short, an abysmal script, bad actors playing one-dimensional characters, facing an all too well-known enemy, worst special effects ever and a lame alien creature that cannot hold a candle to the truly terrifying Alien Queen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******Spoilers******when i first saw alien 3 i was a little disappointed but only because it was not as good as alien and aliens, i thought it was a good movie if you didn't compared it to the first two. i bought the alien box est (which if you are an alien fan i inst you bi)the box set has all films in special edition. The special edition to alien 3 is awesome it is such a better movie, it has a different creature to spawn the new alien and some other great scenes. i know think it is better then the first two.the only part of the special edition that let me down was at the end were Ripley through herself into the furnace, the alien doesn't pop out of her, that disappointed me because i always thought it was a very powerful moment but because the special edition was made in 2003 I'm assuming it was to help with the continuity with alien resurrection. The reason why this version is so great is because it includes a lot of things that David Fincher wanted but that were cut and i love David Fincher, its better because the mood and style is much stronger and more both emotional and exciting! if you are not a huge alien fan but liked them and rely want to see the special edition i would still encourage you to bi the box set for just this special edition it rely is money well spent a brilliant piece of film that sadly will be always under ratted because this special edition will not ever be theoretically released. This version is pure Fincher 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that people dismiss this film way too quickly. When you watch it once, the film seems bad. But like most films, you need to see it again to fully understand it.It wasn't directed badly: read the script, it sucks. It's slapped together by three different people. If you blame anything, blame the script. The characters aren't written to their full potential, and Ripley seemed to be there to die.But if you look past that bad script, it's still a pretty good film. Though the events in it are messed, the plot and story are still there. Sigourny Weaver even wanted to end the films here. It was getting tired and ready to end.So, if you watch it over, you'll see that the film isn't too bad. Considering it was rushed, had six scripts and the director walked out before editing, the film still meets the lowest standard of Alien film.Don't hate it because others stuffed up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For starters: SPoilers found below!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Now that that is all out of the way: Alien 3 was not a big hit, and I admit, the killing of Hicks and Newt straight out almost killed it for me the first time I saw it, but by the end i was so pumped at seeing more Alien that i didnt care.They were very good characters that deserved MUCH more than this, but let's face it. Aliens came out in '87. Alien3 didnt come out until '92. Newt was in second grade, and Carrie Henn was about 10 or 11 when the movie was made. That would have made her about 14 or 15 when Alien3 was made. Explain that diescepancy without doing another "57 years in hypersleep"....They could pull some tricks with Michael Biehn, but I imagine he was off doing other things. So 2 of 4 remaining lead actors are unavailable. Do you replace them? NO. I would have been outraged had they just replaced Henn and Biehn.So what else could they do? They wanted Ripley. So they had to kill off the other two. I wanted another Alien, so I accepted the sacrifice.I read something somwhere that said that since the characters were almost all criminals, we felt nothing for them. Okay, so they were criminals, and dressed the part. However, with the exception of descriptions of their crimes, and the attempted rape of Ripley, we see very little to suggest that these people ever did anything wrong. Hell, i always had a hard time buying that Pete Postalwaithe's character was there for any crime. He seemed to likeable.On to the performances.Charles Dance was great. For the first part of the movie, until he gets killed, he stole the show. I was almost offended to find out he was Sardo Nussebaum and that happy-face-contact guy from the LAst Action Hero. Those roles were beneath him. He was convincing and damn likeable as Clemmens.Charles S Dutton. Okay, if I want to gush about him, I'll go over to his profile and comment there. This man is just great. When he and Ripley are convining the convicts to fight, wow. That is the most rousing speach i have ever heard.Ripley is great as always. Sigourney Weaver managed to portray her as the exact same woman in 3 movies. Ripley is easily one of the greatest cinematic characters ever. period. Hard to imagine that she was set up to be the "most likely to die" character in Alien. Yep, Ridley Scott wanted the audience to think she would die. Not bad, huh?I'll end with Morse, because otherwise, i would go after the whole cast, and space does not permit. The whole movie is bvasically split into 3 parts: Ripley and Clemmens Ripley and Dillon Ripley and MorseEach act has it's own person paired up with Ripley (Arguably, there is a 4th one in there with Aaron, but he is an idiot), and each part manages to feel natural with that person as her partner. More props for miss Weaver.Morse is great, because you get to see him grow from lazy rebel to active, getting-shot-for-the-cause semi-hero. He was SUCH an ass, it is hard to not like him. Plus, my sister thinks he's cute. As she puts it, "not cute-cute, but monkey-cute". Not since Bluto Blutarsky has there been such a loveable foul-mouth.In the end, if you love the end of Aliens to the point where you cant bear to see the characters gone, leave the series as Alien and Aliens. If you are willing to accept their loss for the greater story, then enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That one line alone, uttered by Dillon near the climax of the film blows ALIEN RESURRECTION out of the water.Greatly underestimated and misunderstood film (even by me intitally). The problem with ALIEN 3 is that it IS so different from the first two movies, not worse....just different! Dark, sombre, even gothic. It places Ripley in a prison colony on an isolated planet at the ass-end of the universe, her ship having crash-landed following its long journey at the conclusion of ALIENS.Audiences were understandably ill at ease from the outset, having Corporal Hicks, the Bishop Droid and little Newt killed off before the film even got going, but Ripley's performance is the key to the movie here. She is an awesome figure of resolve and stoic bravery. The plethora of English accents didn't help either (it WAS a British production, backed by Murdoch's NEWS Limited corporation). Extremely good script, just talky and with few action sequences. Problem was that following Cameron's huge adrenalin-rush with ALIENS, audiences were expecting more of the same and it wasn't to be. Many were disappointed also that there was only one alien, as in the original.Charles Dance as the colony's doctor and Charles Dutton as the prisoner's leader and unofficial spokesman ("You're all gonna die, the question is - do you want it on your knees or on your bellies?") are superb. Many top characterizations littered throughout the movie. Picks up the pace towards the end and the "herding" of the alien into the leadworks is excellent.Few movies have ended with such poignancy, emotional resolve and beautifully choreographed deliberation. Absolutely great musical score here too. If you WERE one of those bitterly disappointed by ALIEN 3, give it another go. With a different mind-set you may see it differently, after all, ALIENS was totally left field of the original. The three are a great trilogy. ALIEN RESURRECTION was simply an aberration....forget it, don't even THINK about watching it! It doesn't BELONG!I once gave Alien 3 a rating of 5/10. I was wrong, it is a 7.5!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah yes, the notorious ALIEN 3. It pains me that even after so many years people are still complaining about this movie. Now, I can understand fans being a bit disappointed back in 1992. I mean hell, James Cameron's ALIENS was an utter triumph. It basically broke the curse dooming sequels into being nothing more than inferior insults.Nevertheless, it is wholly unfair to judge ALIEN 3 against its successful predecessor. So many viewers walked away saying "No guns? Blah! You can't have an ALIEN film without guns." Now please, that is just ridiculous. Cameron's sequel introduced guns into the equation. The original (and widely popular) ALIEN was a science fiction fright flick with no guns.The problem that Cameron created with making a great sequel is that now how is another film going to top it? Perhaps it can be done, just look at the challenges Cameron himself faced when he first announced he wanted to make a sequel to ALIEN. Everyone told him 'no' and that it would end his career. Hmm.Nonetheless, Cameron made it remarkably difficult for a new film and director to step up to the plate. On top of that, the studio (FOX) made the equation damn-near impossible. There were literally hundreds of scripts and treatments for a third ALIEN film. Ideas and plots eventually snow-balled into a conglomerate mess as production started. There were even teaser trailers released indicating the aliens reaching earth (an early version of the script) which ultimately contradicts the film that was made.Enter a talented young man named David Fincher, perhaps best known for his background in music videos. Fincher takes the job as his feature film debut, most likely with high hopes. Production starts as no "official" script is completed and later filming begins even as new rewrites are being added. Fincher eventually abandons the film (before completion) citing studio interference and officially disowns it. What's left of the disaster is edited together (complete with even more reshooting) and released to an already skeptical fanbase.I only learned of the production debacle years later and began to understand why Fincher would ignore the film completely. It must be a bizarre fluke that the film turned out as well as it did. I can only assume the film's integrity stems from Fincher's involvement. ALIEN 3 made me take notice of this director's name and sure enough he soon did receive the success he deserved with his next film SEVEN (1995).Now, with all of this in mind one might dismiss ALIEN 3 as utter sh**. I disagree. I saw the film opening weekend in the summer of 1992 and loved it. And it still today is my favorite entry in the series.ALIEN 3 departs from the previous two films by creating a dark, violent, philosophical drama of mythological proportions. This film introduces a new aesthetic, beautiful in all its stygian richness. Gone are the grim air ducts and technological trappings of the first two films. Instead, Ripley awakens in an inescapable hell deep in the nothingness of space - a labyrinth world of golden light, thick escaping steam, and lost souls. She's crash landed (with the xenomorph onboard) into an abandoned prison planet inhabited by an all-male population of murderers and rapists.The plot is incredibly rich with drama in that Ripley finds herself with no hope. She is inescapably attached to this alien and it will forever destroy her life. And it is here, in this purgatory of sorts, where she finds the courage to finish it once and for all. Of course, Elliot Goldenthal's magnificent score helps as does Fincher's visual metaphors (most notably the funeral scene) and overall style. The film results in a provocative tale of faith and human emotion set against the absolution of death. A theme that, I feel, far outweighs the significance of any other ALIEN film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fitting end to a great sci-fi series !!! (Resurrection doesn't exist in my world)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Alien?' is the 3rd film in the Alien film franchise and undoubtedly the one which is hated by fans the most. It is directed by David Fincher and the screenplay written by David Giler, Walter Hill and Larry Ferguson is based on a story idea by Vincent Ward. After escaping from LV-426, the escape vessel carrying Ripley crashes onto a remote ore refinery named Fiorina "Fury" 161 which is also a penal colony. It is soon established that the reason for the crash of the escape vehicle could be an alien stowaway which could have landed with her on this colony. The prisoners on this colony who embraced an apocalyptic, millenarian version of Christianity initially are cold towards Ripley, but gradually they grasp the danger that confronts them and they start working with Ripley for surviving.After watching Alien?, I have come to the conclusion that the only reason why fans and some critics criticised and hated this film so much was because after Cameron's 'Aliens', they were expecting more of the same and weren't ready for something so bleak, so nihilistic and so radically different. I am aware that the production for this film was chaotic and it was so stressful for David Fincher, that he ended up walking away after the shooting ended without supervising the post-production and he has in the subsequent years disowned the film citing reasons of unrestricted studio interference. But even after acknowledging all that, I was really impressed by this film. Yes it has some flaws with the plot, but overall it is my 2nd favourite in the series after Scott's original.My review will be entirely based on the Assembly Cut. The first and foremost thing that I noticed was that this was a throwback to the smaller,more contained filmmaking of the first film departing from the bigger, grander, blockbuster elements employed by Cameron. We again revert back to one single Xenomorph and the element of claustrophobia instead of the army and war elements of 'Aliens'. This is not an action film, instead it is atmospheric horror with clear and apparent biblical themes and Fincher successfully managed to distinguish this from earlier films. The great aspect of the entire Alien series is that every film distinguishes itself from the other and creates its own identity instead of wallowing in repetition like so many other fan-loved film franchises are guilty of.The film instantly kills off Newt and Hicks and introduces us to ragged, dirty prisoners and criminals in a penal colony and these reasons have been upheld by many fans to justify their hate for the film. But I admire the fact that they decided to go for such a risky move which could have easily annoyed the fans which it clearly did in the end. I like this story decision because another film with Ripley, Newt and Hicks at the forefront would have only led to more of the same and we would have had another shoot em'up Aliens-esque blockbuster. Instead we got something more. The film has religious themes at its backbone. 'Alien?' in a way is about the second coming of Christ. The film is about redemption. All the prisoners on Fiorina "Fury" 161 are murderers and rapists who have embraced religion and they're waiting for God's judgement, redemption and a new beginning. Ripley comes into this prison and gradually becomes the person that allows the prisoners achieve some sort of redemption. She becomes the Christ figure in the prison. I think this is the film in the series where Sigourney Weaver gives her best performance as Ripley. She is at her absolute lowest here and conveys the mental struggle perfectly through her expressions as well as her physical appearance. Ripley's death in the end was I believe the last nail in the coffin which completely alienated 'Alien?' from most of the fan base. But for me it is the perfect end for a fantastic, strong character. In a true Christ-like way she sacrifices herself to save humanity from evil and from humanity's own sins of greed. All the actors in the film give great performances alongside Sigourney Weaver, but I'll give a special mention to Charles S. Dutton and Charles Dance. Although this was Fincher's first film, but you can clearly see his stamp and his artistic vision all over the film. He creates this brilliantly dark and bleak atmosphere. I noticed his trademark fast editing strategies which always makes his films extremely fast paced even when they are very long. The film looks fantastic just like every other David Fincher film. There certainly are some flaws here. I thought the screenplay once or twice went into clich territory and became a little unreasonable. I also thought the CGI used for the wide angle shots of the Xenomorph did not work at all. But even after considering these flaws, I was still impressed by 'Alien?' and for me this film marks the spiritual ending of Ripley's amazing story. 'Alien:Resurrection' for me is an unnecessary film that was made just to earn some money. I conclude by saying 'Alien?' is a very impressive film with great themes and great characters and in my opinion it gets hated and panned by fans and critics for all the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler's Ahead:I must state at the outset I am an existentialist so of course the philosophy of the film being congruent with my own gives me a bias towards it. The meaningless of the natural world being defined by choice the world's meaninglessness paralleled by its hostility. I will not bore readers; as a simple review the film is dreadful apart from its philosophical underpinnings which Dillion usually enunciates; nothing is certain and to God why are the innocent punished? Why the suffering? Why the pain? There are answers but this in not the venue. As a film it is dark sadistic, a little girl's autopsy, shots of her dead screaming with mouth open was that necessary? It is also boring as other people have stated the camera work is dreadful the alien view silly repetitive and it removes all suspense from the movie. The scene with the torches being blown out is as close as this comes to beings scary. I concur with a great earlier review about running bald wa##$@# interchangeable it is funny sorry. This alien does resemble a large doggie. The only real human connection in the film of any interest between Ripley and the Dr. fincher wipes out early in the picture. This is my point of view what ruins the picture is the interchangeability of unsympathetic bald criminals being chased and killed WHO CARES? Even the loathsome desk pushing bureaucrat Clemmons gets wiped out halfway through and we are left with many immoral bald men 85 and Dillion. Dutton carries this picture it is a real bright spot without him it would be much much worse. I am a.philosopher but is this the place for deep lectures on the suffering and meaningless of life? Did people who were contemplating buying tickets say to each other hey you want to learn a 3rd grade version of existentialism instead of an exciting action picture? Fincher did the same with PANIC ROOM and FIGHT CLUB. Yes it gives the movie depth but forgive my misanthropy; DO MOST ACTION MOVIE FANS LOOK LIKE PHILOSOPHERS TO YOU FINCHER?To the other 95% of human beings the non-philosophers the film is like a coma. Ugly cruel dark boring and not scary. Yes some of those things were necessary for him to communicate his philosophical point of view but this is not Kubrick. People came out of ALIENS and they are expecting some action and scares not a depressing boring lecture on how life is full of suffering empty of meaning cruel short and brutal. He sounds like Hobbes my least favorite philosopher. To everyone who is not into philosophy, AVOID THIS FILM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great sadness of Alien 3, and a point missed in the previous review, is that David Fincher was the RIGHT man for the job.This film had the potential to match the original in mood, tension and impact. A great script, a solid cast, a stellar, Wunderkind of a director. What it did not have was a studio with the heart and the balls to see the project through.Fincher has proved himself time and again since Alien 3. The film he could have made was hinted at in Panic Room. Weaver and Dance do their best, delivering gritty performances. The soupcon of romance eked out of the lice-infested grime of Fury is fragile and fleeting, yet shows where this film may have gone had Fox not pulled the plug. Fincher's bravery, drowning Cameron's darlings in the opening seconds, is breath-taking.Instead, with budget panic rising, the bean-counters sent in the heavy mob. Fincher's baby was wrestled from him, sliced, diced and stapled together to deliver the confused, nonsensical mishmash we see today. Fincher, brutally scarred, has vowed never to revisit the piece, so no Director's cut for us. Instead, we have a re-hashed hybrid of out-takes and re-assembled footage in the most recent Blu Ray compendium.The back-screen/ FX shots are dated, the mainly British B-list cast hammy and, it seems, having a whale of a time. Brian Glover gives an untypically less-than-convincing performance, which adds to the feeling that this was made by a bunch of acting school mates at the end of term.Oh how I would love to have seen the film this might have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In addition to being a quite terrible movie Alien? also manages to completely undercut the legacy of the previous films in the series. If you liked Aliens, and were happy with the way that film ended, you certainly won't want to watch Alien?. The very first thing this movie does is completely ruin the ending of Aliens. Whose bright idea was that? Heaven only knows whose idea that really was as there were so many people who had a hand in producing this awful film. With so much studio interference director David Fincher never had a chance. This film was always going to be a mess. No wonder Fincher would ultimately disown the film. It's not his film. It's nobody's film. It's just a bunch of disparate ideas, most of them terrible, slapped together to produce two hours of misery.Since I was not particularly a fan of the first two Alien films I don't find this one as much of an insult as I imagine fans of the series would. You don't really have to take in the whole scope of the Alien series to understand just how awful this movie really is though. Taken on its own merits...well, actually it has no merits. There is really nothing good to say about this movie. Maybe if you're being generous you could say it provides a decent resolution to Ripley's story arc. But what a painful slog it is in getting to that resolution. No excitement, no drama. The story is weak, the dialogue is laughably bad, the performances are by and large terrible. Sigourney Weaver again has some nice presence to her as she reprises the famous role of Ripley. But everything which surrounds her disappoints. The flimsy story sees Ripley land on a penal colony inhabited by all-male inmates with a history of extreme physical and sexual violence. Not a great place for a woman then. But wait, these prisoners have been redeemed! Sort of. They're following some kooky, made-up quasi-religion. One inmate, Dillon, is more or less the leader. His preaching keeps the guys in line but that preaching comes across as much more corny than powerful. Anyhow, turns out Ripley brought an Alien with her because of course she did. Chaos ensues, we get a bunch of largely incoherent action sequences with a bunch of bald guys we can't tell apart running around willy-nilly. And eventually the movie ends. There's really not much more to it than that. The whole thing has more than a touch of incoherence to it. It's really quite a mess. But when you understand the behind the scenes shenanigans that were going on you realize there was never any way it was going to be anything but a mess. With the weak material he had Fincher was never going to be able to fashion a good movie here. But left to his own devices he surely could have come up with something at least marginally better than this. As it is Alien? is just an awful, awful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 is not a dreadful film. It has a few good moments. But it also has a whole lot of bad moments. Moments that are badly paced or that have incomplete cgi effects. After expectations were risen so high by the previous two films, this one was certain to be a big let down. It starts just after the events of Aliens. The ship crashes on a prison planet of around 20 convicts. Ripley is the only survivor and begins to realise that it was one of the Xenomorphs that sabotaged the ship. It quickly becomes a fight for survival as Ripley works with the prisoners to destroy the monster. It's not a bad story (even if the logic of putting 20 prisoners alone on a planet is questionable) but I would question the decision to kill off the rest of the survivors in the last film. They were very likable personalities and wouldn't have needed any exposition to build their characters. Instead we're left with 20 characters who we never learn much about and none of whom are memorable. I could go years without watching Aliens and remember all of those crew members. I've only just watched Alien 3 and feel like I've already forgotten most of the characters. But whilst the prisoners may be forgettable, luckily we do still get Ripley. Whilst the character isn't really expanded on, Weaver does bring an great performance to the role. This time she shows a true sense of anguish. The feeling that there is no hope. She shows total despair knowing that she has lost everything. But she never gives up. She refuses to back down and keeps fighting no matter what demonstrating a very real and grounded sense of bravery. She's one of the few reason that this film was in any way worth watching.But unfortunately the film does screw up the Xenomorph. Largely because we see too much of him. In the previous two films then the Alien barely even gets any screen time, with our image of the alien being built up through quick glimpses to create a more mysterious and threatening creature. Here he appears on screen far more and we see too much of him. He's less imposing and seems more like a run of the mill monster than anything else. .On top of this the decision to use computer generated effects to make the monster was a bad one. This was before effects could create a realistic figure and because of that when the alien does appear through cgi it never looks like it's really there. Worse yet many of these cgi shots were incomplete or done badly, causing many shots of the alien in the final chase to be extremely green or have a weird colour scheme. It's particularly unfortunate as when practical effects are used in the film they do seem genuinely impressive. What's annoying about this film is that it does have some brilliant elements to it. It could have been a decent film with the claustrophobic prison scenery and returning to the simplistic survival horror of the original Alien movie. But it's mixed with the likes of slow paced action scenes and the entire prison population having either underdeveloped or uninteresting characters. Probably this comes down to studio interference as Fincher cited it as the reason he left the film during editing as it did not let him achieve his vision of the franchise. He even believed it was so bad that he has since disowned the film. It does still have some enjoyable moments, even if they are few in number. Just don't expect it to live up to either of the previous films in the franchise.</fullReview>

I believe the intention was to try to create an atmospheric tense experience as we saw in the first film. The problem is that Alien 3 not only failed in this respect, but it also failed in nearly every other area important to good film making. I'll attempt to explain the problems one by one;Firstly, the very fact that Ripley ends up being held on a prison planet which is filled with murderers and rapists automatically makes it difficult to fully invest in the characters or their causes. The one aspect that made Alien &amp; Aliens work is that you always felt that there was an element of teamwork. Alien with Ripley and the salvage crew and Aliens with Ripley and the marines. The very fact that Ripley works with good people in both films makes it easier to root for her causes and to care about the characters. There were a number of characters in Alien 3 that were vile towards Ripley and towards each other. As a result of this I just found myself becoming more and more detached from the film. Aside from this I found the characters annoying in this film and at times I felt like throwing something at the TV. The fact that the scriptwriters chose to kill off Charles Dance's character (who was arguably the only character who was fairly likable) seemed strange especially as a bit of effort had been made to establish him as a likable character. Brian Glover who portrayed prison governor Andrews is a good actor (he'll be well known to UK audiences for his portrayal as dim witted prison inmate Heslop in UK sitcom Porridge). To me, his performance in Alien 3 at times felt a bit 'hammy' and over the top. He was good, but I suppose I expected more from a talented actor such as Glover.One thing I did like was Fincher's direction and this is something that I've appreciated in every film of his that I've seen. The shots where the Alien is chasing the prisoners towards the end were particularly impressive. It's just a shame that the script was somewhat 'patchy'.Alien 3 was clearly trying to emulate Alien in terms of approach, but it feels very much like a poor man's version. The problem is that it's too similar in approach to the first film - the set up with the Alien picking them off one by one was identical to the first film. The only 'hook' with this film is how they are going to beat the Alien. Alien 3 is generally devoid of tension, boring for the most part with a lot of despicable characters thrown in the mix. The final 15-20 minutes were fairly good, but for me it was too little too late. All in all, an underwhelming experience that I simply cannot recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A downgrade from the heart-pounding Aliens.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second sequel to the sci-fi epic, Alien, the story starts when the ship carrying Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crashes onto a remote island inhabited by inmates, who later discovers that an alien stowaway caused the crash. Once again, Ripley finds herself facing the Alien, and also faces the untold plans of the company who employed her.What resulted from Alien 3 is a downgrade from the exciting, thrilling and heart-pounding Aliens. While the special and visual effects were good and realistic, especially the execution of the Alien creatures, and the acting was decent (Weaver carried the movie mostly), the story itself is depressing, making it seem that all the things Ripley fought for from the first two movies became redundant. Her world gets darker as she must deal with unruly inmates on the island and the devious plans of the company who employed her.Director David Fincher didn't capture the intrigue and horror of the previous movie, and instead created a movie just full of darkness and chaos. Overall, what we got was what I think the weakest of the Alien movies.Grade D+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His firm hand of creative direction is not there as the actors visibly struggle. Sigourney Weaver is okay but doesn't mesh well with a cast that just doesn't cradle her character; they have no idea what she has been through in the first two films and how tough she is. For some reason too she is very cryptic about her past, and reveals little information about the alien situation. Why wouldn't she just tell them the truth?The relationships she does form with the cast are shaky and forced. Almost every character ends up dead, but it doesn't matter because we didn't know them anyway.As Fincher's first major feature film, the style of Alien 3 bears the least resemblance to his other films. It is his most inexpertly made film. AKA, his worst film, technically anyway. I still prefer Aliens 3 to The Social Network any day, but after investigating the production of this film I came to realize that Fincher was not totally responsible for the lackluster film that made it to theatres.When David Fincher was brought into direct Alien 3, it was after another director had already begun production, and was fired. There was not even a finished script. As one contributor wrote in the IMDb Alien 3 FAQs about, Fincher "was forced to effectively write, shoot, and edit the film, all at the same time. There were millions of dollars worth of sets built and many takes and scenes had already been shot. Twentieth Century Fox insisted Fincher incorporate these into his production to save money. The shadows of the masterminds behind the first two Alien films, Ridley Scott and James Cameron, must have been looming over the production, because as Fincher completed a rough cut of film, Twentieth Century Fox panicked. They began started dictating that certain things were going to have to be re-shot in certain ways, essentially stripping Fincher of all creative control. He would eventually walk away from the film. The version that was released in theatres was his rough draft, completed by a new crew in LA.In 2003 editor David Crowther took up the task of assembling what was of the original draft, and re-edited it in a way he though was most likely the way the Fincher version would have turned out. This release was called the Assembly Cut (I have yet to see it).All that drama of the film's production aside, the story had real potential. Even following Cameron's greatness on Aliens (1986), enough time has past that Cameron's production was no longer fresh, and this third installment could have made a significant contribution to the series. The idea of a pod crashing on a giant prison planet bringing with it an alien that threatens to wipe out all life there, and possibly even all mankind is a cool idea, right? What would have become of this rough draft had studio execs not meddled? All we'll ever have is the Assembly Cut.The most modern incarnation of the Alien series lives on in the amazing contemporary film Prometheus directed by Ridley Scott, and on November 27th, 2015 the second installment of the Prometheus series is set be released with both Ridely Scott and Jack Pagen, the man who wrote Prometheus 1 involved. This is a film I'm counting down the days for. Get more Fincher and more everything at getthebonsaw.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie which could achieve more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am really very surprised with all the hate.I find it a very good movie actually and if i was to complain about something that would be that it didn't exploit all these different layers that the script provided.The cinematography,the direction,the acting were very good.The atmosphere was very intriguing and the whole industrial setting surely helped to achieve the dread and neutral at the same time feeling which made the characters look even more helpless and alone.A prison which didn't held its prisoners behind the bars and instead the prisoners choose to convert to a faith which essentially became their true prison,a thin hierarchy(i am referring to the wardens) that no one in reality acknowledged yet it still existed,the real human Bishop who was rejected by Ridley in contrast to how she befriended the android Bishop(a reference to the corruption of humanity).All of the above and more that i didn't mentioned, haven't be explored at their fullest yet they could.What i didn't like was the tragic past of the doctor(or at least the way it was presented) and his unnecessary romance with Ridley and also the fact that all prisoners were so fearful and respectful of Dillon,it seemed very convenient.Concluding I think that it was way better than alien 1 and aliens ,which were very predictable and followed very standard plot lines.Also alien1 wasn't in no way using new and innovative narration or ideas even in its time and is very overrated.Surely it helped popularize the sci-fi genre but this is the point where all the praise should stop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downward But Onward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It happens so often. A really good movie is made, and then come the inevitable sequels that eventually start to leave a bad taste in your mouth about the entire series, no matter how good the original was. Alien 3 is the second sequel in the series. The original "Alien" (directed by Ridley Scott) was quite good, tense and suspenseful. I didn't think James Cameron did a good job at all with "Aliens," and here David Fincher has failed with "Alien 3."There are times when this is mildly tense, but generally speaking I was bored for most of its run time. Part of the problem here is the setting - the movie is set on some sort of prison planet, where Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) crashlands after the events of "Aliens." She's the only survivor, and she wakes up in a medical unit, surrounded by a motley (to say the least) crew of thugs thieves and rapists and child molesters (as they describe themselves.) What this means is that, automatically, aside from Ripley there's nobody here to care about. Seriously - who cares about these guys for even a moment? The alien creature is, of course, back and wreaks havoc among the inmates. The alien has morphed yet again. In the first movie we saw little of the creature. In the second, it was more front and centre. This time we get a really good look at it, and to me it came across as a bit of a cross between a giant octopus and a raptor such as you'd see in "Jurassic Park." There's no particular reason to be frightened by it - we know what it's going to do. Fincher goes for a lot of blood in this - but blood isn't scary. It's even pretty easy to figure out how this is going to end. It's hardly worth the effort involved in watching.I rated "Aliens" as a 3/10. I'll give this the same. It's a little weaker even than its predecessor, but it's close enough to get the same rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, don't hate me for this, but I enjoyed Alien 3 more than Alien Resurrection. There's something I about this one that makes me enjoy it more over Alien 4, but I don't even know what it is. Either way, Alien 3 was still a disappointment, but at least it HAD an alien in it. Alien 4's "aliens" weren't aliens, they were cloned monsters. That's not what the franchise was made for. Alien 3 showed the "what if" alien, as in, what if the Xenos came out of a different animal instead of a human being. I thought it was a smart change. This new Xenos had a more "killer instinct" then the ones from Aliens. However, Alien and Aliens will always be on the top of the board. 1) Aliens. 2) Alien. 3) Alien 3. 4) Alien Resurrection. That's how I see it. This one is still bad, but I would rather watch this over Resurrection.</fullReview>

I mean we do not get any sympathy from the characters(which are all criminals) and when you do find someone for who you have sympathy(Doctor) they just kill him in the twenty minutes that follow. Also the storyline is very dull until it gets to the near end. The only good thing I can say from this movie is that the special effects weren't bad.I think that they shouldn't have done this movie as two Alien movies would have been enough!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why everyone completely hated this alien sequel. I liked it though not as much as the first and second. The acting is good and there's some new twists and turns in the story which is good I think because the second one did not do much for story.This one follows Ellen Ripley after her escape ship she ended with in the second movie crashes into a prison. She finds out her friends in the ship are dead and since it is a very isolated prison she is stuck there.This one is not as good as the first or second but it is still a solid movie I liked it. If your a fan of the alien movies you will like this the only bad thing is the computer animation is terrible because the movie is so old. They should have just stuck with robotics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first time watching the second and third movies, and only watching the first movie twice, I'm obviously not a die-hard super fan like others reviewing this movie.I quite liked it, the acting was pretty good, the concept was good. It was pretty slow paced with a few exciting scenes mixed in every so often. One thing that really annoyed me about it was the actual Alien itself. It looked just terrible, the first movie got it right so I don't see why they felt the need to add a CGI one in instead.Also, Hicks and Newt - for Ripley to do all of that at the end of Aliens and then just have them die right at the start of Alien 3, well it was annoying, but I also understood that it pretty much could have ended up being Aliens all over again if the writers had kept them alive, I don't really see how they would have survived or fit in with the story.I'm no expert on these movies, but I'm still going to say that Alien is the better out of the three.</fullReview>

They land on a prison planet inhabited by a bunch of convicts who found religion.Meanwhile, one of the aliens is slowly picking people off while another grows inside Ripley.We have some overwrought chase scenes, and the movie is made more confusing by the plot devise that the planet is lice-infested and everyone has to shave their heads. Which means all the characters kind of look the same and they have very little individual personality. I think Ripley was the one with the breasts.Special guest start. Paul McGann (Doctor Who #8) as one of the convicts. YOu won't recognize him. He's in a bit role even though he gets something like fourth or fifth billing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak Plot Makes the Movie Silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While neither Alien or Aliens, the commercially successful predecessors, stand up to scrutiny, they had enough to give audiences all the requirements of an action, science fiction monster movie. Alien 3 begins with the question: How did the Alien eggs get on the ship? By not answering, the producers expect the audience to shrug along with Ripley and turn the brain off.Somehow two eggs get onto the ship from Aliens. The organism laying parasites spew acid that causes an electrical fire. Even though these ships put the crews to sleep for journeys that can last weeks and months, what has to be an extremely sophisticated computer system cannot: 1) Detect alien organisms running amok on the ship; 2) cannot put out the fire at the first hint; 3) cannot isolate the fire (or the organisms) so that it stays in the hold area where it had to have started; 4) can only eject the sleeping crew (instead of waking them to deal with the fire); 5) the life boats are just hunks of metal that do not have auto pilot capabilities.\You are also expected to believe that the egg denizens must be free ranging because the eggs only open when a likely subject is near. It's almost as if the producers, writers, director were unaware there were two movies before this one.Ripley is the only one to survive the crash onto a planet that is a prison colony for extra chromosome criminals. Granted, she's been through a lot, but she immediately adopts a "I'm going to do what I want, when I want so f*** you" attitude and disobeys the warden's order to stay in sick bay. She is then surprised when no one does whatever she tells them to do.From start to finish, Alien 3 is a weak, poorly constructed rip off of the earlier two movies. It was designed as a payday and nothing more. There is absolutely no need to watch this movie to understand Alien 4: Resurrection (better than this one, but not by much) so it should just be avoided. Alien 3 isn't even bad enough to laugh at while watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Successor to Alien and Aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was younger, Alien 3 was my favorite entry in the Alien series. Its grim tone and religious symbolism struck my adolescent mind as deep, while its ending provided a fitting conclusion to the series. Seeing it recently, I found that while the film offered early insight into the talent of David Fincher, it is ultimately deeply flawed. . The third Alien film finds Sigourney Weaver stranded on a prison planet after a mysterious fire on the Sulaco. Her suspicions are soon confirmed when a xenomorph begins slaughtering the prisoners. However, an even graver threat lurks on the planet, far closer than Ripley can imagine.The film has a number of flaws in both the pacing and characterization. Ripley's behavior in the first thirty to forty-five minutes of the film is inexplicable, as she refuses to tell anyone of her concern that an alien is on the planet. Instead, she makes bizarre requests of the prison staff, wanders around dangerous inmates obliviously, and acts shocked when the prison staff concludes she is nuts. This contradicts the resourceful, intelligent Ripley of previous films, and causes the first half of the film to drag.Furthermore, Ripley goes through several sidekicks in the course of the film, with the end result that none of them are adequately fleshed out. Although the actors playing them, particularly Charles Dutton, do well, they have very little to work with. Even the special effects are lacking. Although the Alien suit and puppetry effects work as well as they did in earlier films, Alien 3 adds in computer effects that have dated badly over the past twenty years. (The Special Edition available on DVD is even worse, with bargain basement computer animation added in for deleted scenes.)The film does have some good points. Sigourney Weaver maintains her strong characterization of Ripley, while the supporting cast largely does well with their roles. Also, the film maintains a strikingly grim feel for a big budget studio picture, an early sign of David Fincher's distinctive vision. The soundtrack is also good, giving the film an almost operatic feel. However, these good points are undermined by the film's glaring flaws.</fullReview>

I think he did fairly well for working with several unfinished scripts.Although alien 3 although not the expected shoot em' up that Aliens had set it up for still has a fine story and plenty of action. The casting was great as all characters felt believable and you could slightly empathize with some characters.Although killing off Newt and Hicks which for some people killed the movie, Alien 3 manages to please those who will take the time to look at it not a the bastard successor to Aliens but a smart, dark and beautiful movie of survival and the (at the time) ending of a fantastic series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher's Troubled Debut and an Inferior Sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You've been in my life so long, I can't remember anything else." - Ripley Following the events of James Cameron's "Aliens," "Alien?" virtually nulls the events of the previous film, and instead finds Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash landing alone on a prison planet, surrounded by murderers and rapists. When she discovers some unwanted cargo, things only go from bad to worse, in true "Alien" fashion."Alien?" is as undoubtedly famous for being director David Fincher's (Fight Club) first film, but also for its troubled production that resulted in a compromised and ultimately messy film. After a gaggle of directors and writers had their way with the material, Fincher was ushered in on the project at the last minute. Without a script in hand, the first-time feature-film director did the best he could with what he was given. Unfortunately, all the talent in the world can't save a film from a lack of structure and too many cooks in the kitchen.To be fair, Fincher does about as well as anyone could have expected. The film has an undeniably murky tone that clashes with that of the suspenseful "Alien" and action packed "Aliens," making it an entity all its own. The opening of the film sets the mood beautifully, and despite rubbing fans of the franchise the wrong way, is a bold way to go. Fincher's unique eye, while put to much better use in later films, is what ultimately carries the film and helps it rise above its lack of cohesive story. While you may not understand or care about everything going on, you'll certainly be engaged by the visual show at hand.Unfortunately, though, the film never reaches the greatness of its predecessors, making it an inferior sequel. In the years following its release, Fincher has all but disowned it and it has become a black sheep of sorts in its own franchise -- a franchise which has never truly recovered from this mis-step. Truth be told, there's some juice to this installment, and Fincher fans will be delighted to see his touch put to use in this sci-fi element, but in the end, "Alien?" is what happens when an over-bearing studio and careless producers tamper with the creative process.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie by far is the worst movie from the 4 movies. The characters are not interesting what so ever, and the character that doesn't seem like cardboard gets killed off fairly early in the movie. I don't know why David Fincher decided to go this direction, cause it doesn't add anything by getting rid of a character that stands out the most from a group of convicted skin heads. It also disappoints the fans of "Aliens" cause it shows everything that Ripley worked for adds up to nothing, by the beginning and the end of this movie. They tried to make Ripley seem like a Christ figure somewhat, but that all goes down the drain cause this time she is the one that starts the whole mess, and the convict that gets angry at her for that reason has every right to get angry. In the previous 2 movies Ripley was the hero and you root for her cause she is fighting some other idiot's mess, but this time she is the one that starts the whole thing and cause of what she went through in the previous movie, which might irritate some audiences. Also most of the characters are convicts and that being said, just about all of them are like cardboard and you just don't care if they die or survive. Most of the story is just about Ripley going around investigating what went wrong after the cryogenic sleep, which is pretty boring, but she also goes about stupid ways of doing it. I thought the atmosphere was pretty cool and gritty, but it all comes down to one by one getting snatched up and killed, the deaths are really quick too.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How about a director's cut, Mr. Finscher?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Alien movies have always been about their characters, with the creatures themselves taking back seat to the human reaction to them. In "Alien" (****), there was animosity on the ship as the seven astronauts were initially torn between their job and their desire to go home. They had to put their differences aside in order to fight their common enemy: the alien creature bent on eating them. In "Aliens" (****), the military must overcome hysteria, deception, and clausterphobia in order to escape from an entire army of alien creatures. These films are classics for a reason--the strong characters are what take center stage and manage to balance logos with ethos, making for very powerful character studies within a sci-fi/horror premise.When "Alien" 3 came out, none of that character chemistry was present. While I can name you nine prominent characters, besides the continuing character Ripley, that were effectively created to stand out from the second film (off the top of my head: Hicks, Hudson, Bishop, Vasquez, Gorman, Newt, Burke, Drake, Apone) only three characters come off with any depth in number three, one of which who is inappropriately killed just as his character development was beginning to pay off. As a result, despite impressive visuals, great direction, and powerful performances by the leads, the film lumbers when it should have soared. Given the quality of the other films in the series (even the fourth film that followed, "Alien: Resurrection" (***), which restored the rich characters), I couldn't help but wonder just what in the world happened during filming that undermined the characters of this film. Then I get wind of the twenty or so minutes that were cut out of the final version. For a complete listing of the scenes, look on the alternate versions page. After reading the script for Alien 3, I must confess that these scenes, when restored, not only bring the film up to greater heights than it achieved in its final version, but it was the best, darkest film in the series. Why on earth these brilliant scenes of character development and thematic discussions were cut is beyond me. They shape the film to have a very good theme and the characters are the most intruiging of the series. Great scenes explaining the motivations of Morse, Golic, Junior and others were lost on the cutting room floor. These scenes weren't only important for character development, but they were also necessary to shape the story and give it a rounder and broader thematic purpose.With the success David Finscher has had in his recent films (deservedly so--"Fight Club" remains one of the most powerful cinematic experiences of my life, and let me tell you, I've had quite a few), I hope that he is able to restore "Alien 3" with a director's cut. If he reissues scenes to restore the fluency missing in the plot and characters, he would recreate a film which not only would become the best film in the alien series, but also one of the finest horror thrillers ever made! I can only hope that he find time and motivation to take on such a project, as it would be the most effective director's cut since "Blade Runner."Final cut: ** out of **** With restored scenes: **** out of ****</fullReview>

The film does have a few good scares and the cinematography is cool. But the film is very slowly paced. I give this one ** out of ****. They need to release a directors cut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong Alien is a very scary movie. But Alien 3 scarier. What is scarier then Alien 3 is Aliens. Alien resurrection is also scarier. People are to quick to point out what they did wrong and yes they did make some mistakes. James Cameron directed the best Alien movie. And they did not respect is vision. That is not a good thing. But lest talk more about the good things about this movie. There probably where some better scripts that got put aside. The thing his thou my second favorite Alien movie is Alien resurrection. I do not know if that movie ever would have been made. If this movie had not been made. I know ever one think fist one his better. Because they did not show the Alien was mush. Alien is good move and not showing the Alien very mush is not the wrong to do it. It is just a way to do it. It works if have hire the write actors and the write writers. They did that. Alien 3 is better because they showed more of the Alien. That made the scary parts longer. That made it faster past and better. And Alien resurrection was good tempt to be as great as Aliens. And they came very close. That movie would never have been made if this movie had not been made. I think the people who worked on this one are bigger fans of the first one then the second. Because it looked and felt more like fist which fine. I think the people who worked on the forth one are bigger fans of the second. Which fine to. I think people have bad habit to think what ever come fist in a franchise has to the better one. Even if it really is not. All the Alien movie are great. There are some of the best science fiction movies ever. This movie has a great script. This movie also has great acting. This movie also has great special effects. You like scary movies. Then see this movie. It is very intense. All the Alien movies are most sees.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's the main problem with this film. Oh sure, it comes across really half-baked, really stupid at times, really over-the-top and an emphasis on action in a way that doesn't suit the character development at all. But because the action comes with no importance, no bearing, no significance, there's just no added effect there, nothing else to latch unto as far as introspection and analyzing the film goes. Sigourney Weaver is particularly strong, but again, there's so much she can do. It's not an awful film though, and I'm sure it's enjoyable enough to some people but coming off a great and a very good film, a huge downer. So not exactly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately they killed Hicks and Bishop in the process.This film is just, simply, a piece of crap. It has nothing going for it.It fails as an Alien film. It fails as drama. It fails as action. It simply fails as a story.And the biggest sin of all - it wrecks the Alien canon forever, and marks the down-turning point where it all sank into oblivion, never to recover.With Riddley Scott's god-awful 'Prometheus', at least this particular abortion has been knocked back *out* of canon again (taking everything else post with it). But it's a Pyrrhic victory - Prometheus is only marginally more watchable than A-3.There was a script, which I have read about half of, proposed by William Gibson, that would have made a fantastic film. He preserved Hicks (I can't remember whether he got rid of the snot child or not), gave Bishop a bigger role, gave Weyland Yutani a bigger role, and gave the Alien a few more bio-tricks to have up its sleeve.But the producers were too busy snorting coke and slamming each others' genitalia in the door, while their paid sycophants told them how great they were.All I can say is the pseudo-feminist crap-token that infected the 2nd film gets put down with a big splash at the start in this sequel.But the whole story gets put down in the same splash.Baby, meet bathwater, meet disastrous film nobody likes.- -- ---</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 3rd installment of the Alien franchise is the least entertaining by far. The beginning scenes hold some promise with the effects work, especially in the capsule. The nasty condition in the ship is convincing and believable. However, Ripely's character looses too much of her engaging characteristics after the scene at Newt's autopsy. I wanted the girl to survive and continue the mother/daughter type scenario. The story line is so weak it is difficult to pay attention. Sigorney Weaver's Ripley is the only character that is of any interest at all. Her scene with the Bishop android is one of the only ones I was at all interested in as it represented continuity between Aliens and this film. Of the three films, Aliens was by far the best. John Cameron knows how to tell a tale with action, suspense and great story elements. This film is a hot mess and easily forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers! : Now i don't believe anyone reading this will not already know the story. But this movie begins superbly and dispenses of the annoying characters left over from the gun-fest that was Aliens. That, for me, was the most inspired move ever. Except that single act alienated (!!) most of the fans and they were immediately out for blood. I'll admit at times, this movie, is a bit all over the place due to edits/re-edits/sound issues - BUT it is still a cracking story. See the Assembly cut for the best version available. Its bleak, its tense and its an underrated classic. I absolutely loved it and the end was perfect for an end to the series (if only). People are warming to this movie now and it is becoming a bot of a classic. Don't believe the hype/don't assume its crap - if you haven't seen it yet you might just love it. I did and still do. My favorite of all 4 movies. 5 if you include Prometheus (which I haven't)and always forget the AVP nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far one of the worst movies I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: This review contains a lot of spoilers for people who haven't seen any Alien film. Continue with caution.I've seen some bad movies in my time. Yeah, most of them are bad. But most that bad movies that I know of are so bad that they're entertaining. But this is actually BAD. Not so bad it's good, but SO BAD IT'S CANCER TO YOUR BRAIN. I thoroughly regret watching this piece of crap, and let me tell you why. I am a big fan of the Alien movies. Alien was great, Aliens was even greater, BUT THEN SUDDENLY THE SERIES TAKES A RIDE STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL WITH ALIEN 3. The story line is just plain stupid, you know I like to think Aliens had a good happy ending, but this movie just ruins everything and made the series ultra depressing.So basically after the events of Aliens, when they all safely go home, a facehugger is found on board. Due to this emergency, they get ejected from the ship and crash on earth (I think could be any planet.)Newt is dead, the last colonial marine is dead and even Weyland gets disconnected. (Not exactly DEAD since he is an android.) This is just sad. So basically a bunch of prisoners find the crashed ship thing and check for survivors. Ripley, of course being the only survivor comes out fine. But a facehugger has come with them! So basically it lays its egg in a dog and we'll get to what happens later. Ripley cries over Newt's dead body, now the fact Newt died just seemed so lazy. Could they not get the proper actor? Eh, whatever. She is dead now. Ripley sees the acid burns on the side of Newt's tube and is convinced that there is probably an alien inside of her. So a doctor performs an autopsy (rather disturbing scene) and there is no sign of an alien. Ripley, on the other hand is still convinced that it probably is still inside her, even though they performed an autopsy. So basically the film goes on, they say goodbye to the dead bodies and Ripley tries to fit in with the sexist prisoners, but they mock her for being a woman. I also forgot to mention, that the doctor guy who performed the autopsy on Newt is the love interest for the story. And for some unexplained reason he shaves Ripley's hair off and she is partially bold now. I really wish it was explained why, but it's not.As they say goodbye to the dead bodies, an alien begins to burst out of the dog's chest. This is an extremely hard to watch and disturbing scene. The alien that arrives out of the dog's chest is not a normal Xenomorph, but a slightly different looking one. Don't exactly know why, but let's just say it's because it was a dog and not a human it came out of.So the alien starts to kill off a few people, first one having acid in his face then falling into a metal fan and being graphically chopped up. Ripley sees doctor love interest guy get killed by an alien, and as she tries to warn everyone, of course, they don't believe her until one asshole guy gets taken by the alien. Ripley performs an x-ray and notices the alien is inside her. So basically she doesn't very much care that she dies or not. So as they EVENTUALLY kill the alien after a very stretched and long scene of the alien chasing them and then eventually them burning it to death, that's over. Also, I forgot to mention that the prisoners have no firearm what so ever. So they just use what they got.In the end, Weyland (the real Weyland, not the android) comes in with a bunch of soldiers and tries to tell Ripley that they can get rid of the Alien inside of her. Ripley doesn't believe that, so she jumps backwards into lava as the alien pops out of her chest as she then dies.So that's it. That was stupid. Considering most of the movie isn't about the alien but about the prison. If that sounded enjoyable to you at all, believe me it was painful to watch. It was absolutely horrid. One of the worst movies I've ever watched in my life. Only one Alien too, no other ones. So in the end, it was a stupid movie that sucked. Even Alien Resurrection is better than this rubbish. So, thanks for reading and don't watch the movie. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overstretched, Unnecessary Continuation of the Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic case of too many cooks spoiling the stew, Alien? isn't necessarily a bad movie, nor is it devoid of potential direction. If anything, it tries to do too much: when Ripley crash lands on a sparsely-populated prison planet, she stumbles into no less than a dozen unique plot points and divergent story lines. Paired with the natural hide-and-seek drama surrounding the alien itself, a closer look at one or two of those may have resulted in a textured, interesting picture. Instead, first-time director David Fincher tries to delve into the lot of them, which often shuffles the alien to the backburner and discovers - after the fact - that they each didn't deserve such a microscopic analysis. That leads to a film with neither a distinct personality nor a purpose which is, often, inconceivably dull. By the time it gets around to wrapping things up, in an admittedly sharp, ballsy climax, the moment is already tarnished and wasted. Even the alien effects, which were so convincing and outstanding in the first two pictures, seem like a watered down afterthought in this chapter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable, but doesn't match up to the other 3 movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I didn't agree with any Alien sequel. For me, they should have done the first one, and stop. I never really liked this one or Aliens. I did like Resurrection though. But this is by far the worst of all sequels.It's not so bad that you'll turn it off, but it's just pointless. You cannot even tell whether it's horror, action or drama. For example, the first one was mostly horror, the second and forth were mostly action, but this is unclear of what type of movie it is. In my opinion, that's the thing that decides whether a movie is good or not. Since this one fails in doing so, it's difficult to like.The first disappointment that this movie has, is the tagline. When you see it you'll think that it's gonna happen in New York or something. It is disappointing when you find out that it's just a prison planet with a single building. The second one, is the cover. From the looks of it, it looks really cool and creepy, when it's none of that. Now I agree with the proverb: 'Don't judge a book by its cover'. My third disappointment was the different Bishop. I mean, what was that all about? Bishop II? Please! I don't want to ruin it for you by telling you what my forth disappointment was, but if you saw how Aliens ended, you'll be as disappointed as I was.For me, this is an excuse for an Alien movie. They obviously wanted to create something different than the other movies. They did manage, of course, but an dog-like alien doesn't exactly make it great. Plus, the deaths aren't cool like in Aliens or Resurrection.The only reason I'm giving it a 3, is the ending. It shows the strength in Ripley's character and how she's willing to do anything to eliminate the species once and for all. I'd suggest you just watch Alien and stop. Resurrection is OK, but it doesn't make sense without watching this. So it's really up to you, just don't expect to love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing about Alien 3 is that it's OK. Is it outstanding? no. Is it bad? Not really. The reason this movie got such bad reviews is that we were expecting more, but we didn't get it. I loved the first two movies. Alien had a great sense of panic and uncertainty built around it. Of course, after you know everything you can't really repeat it, which is why Aliens, probably my favorite of the series, was so great. It took what we already knew from the first movie and expanded on it. It didn't try to create uncertainty around something we already knew about. It took what we knew and built upon it, resulting in a great movie. Alien 3 however just tried to repeat the uncertainty from the first one, which is hard to do when you've already had that aspect played out. We already know all about the alien. It didn't bring anything new resulting in an average movie. It's not as bad as some say, but it's not as good as the other alien movies, although it is far better than alien resurrection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being the only survivor of the ship SULACO, Lt. RIPLEY is rescued after crash landing on FIORINA 161, a prison planet containing some of the most depraved criminals to ever live. However many have joined a monastic order, making Ripley not a welcome sight to the other prisoners, since she is seen as a stumbling block to their vows of celibacy. Ripley herself doesn't care for being on the planet either, since she runs the risk of being violently raped by the other felons. However the felons soon become the least of her worries &amp; whatever they done in the past is going to pale in comparison to what they are soon to run into, when they all meet the most dangerous felon to ever enter the walls of the prison: The acid spitting, nasty tempered &amp; vicious Alien, that has ripped itself out of the only dog on the prison planet &amp; that goes about hiding in the air shafts, before making it's presence known by bumping the felons off one by one. Things only get worse when Ripley discovers that not only are there no weapons to combat the beast with as in before, but she is also carrying an Alien embryo inside her. Ripley realizes that in order to avoid a horrible fate of spawning another one of these nightmares, she may not only have to kill the beast but herself as well.Ah yes, ALIEN 3, one of the most controversial film sequels in the history &amp; of horror &amp; sci-fi. Despite all the years it has been beaten upon, I am going to be honest &amp; say I personally I never found ALIEN 3 to be really all that bad, I mean true it's a major fall off when compared to the first two films, but I don't agree that the film is complete garbage &amp; unwatchable as many are saying. In fact, I kind of enjoyed the film for what it was. The kills were pretty cool, I liked the Alien POV shots, the acting was good &amp; despite having never shot a feature film before this, I thought David Fincher did all right on his first directing assignment. The film also has many memorable moments, such as Ripley confronting the creature in a darkened room &amp; saying: You have been in my life so long I can't remember anything else &amp; her death at the end manages to provoke some emotional sadness for the viewer, who has followed her character all the way up to this point. The set design was well articulated &amp; crafted. Director Fincher goes for a much more drab, but life like look to his picture &amp; lights the night time scenes with an candle light texture. The Alien monster suit &amp; CGI shots were impressive as well &amp; speaking of the Alien suit, ALIEN 3 discards James Cameron's Alien designs &amp; instead returns to the look of H.R. Giger's Alien creature design, with the dome shaped head &amp; six fingers.On the downside I will agree that ALIEN 3 could have been done a whole lot better, yet I'm not surprised that the film wound up as somewhat of a clunker as it did, considering it's nightmarish six year production history of script rewrites &amp; hiring &amp; firing of crew members writers &amp; directors. To be sure, ALIEN 3 was rushed &amp; the numerous drafts of the scripts that were rejected were no doubt better written, scary &amp; action packed than what we wound up with. The characters are all basically interchangeable with one another &amp; none to likable either. True in other ALIEN films you had characters you didn't think to much of, but here practically every character around will have the audience members begging to see them offed, since they are nothing more than spiteful, rapists, child molesters, serial killers &amp; thieves, we have no one but Ripley this time to cheer for. A potential love story that occurs between her &amp; a prison doctor is not fully developed &amp; only serves to really bring the film down since it just seems out of place. Director Fincher also mistakenly films a shot of an Alien bursting out of a dogs stomach, but shoots it at an awkward angle, making the creature look like it's full sized. One can also see a patch work of ideas in the film that are both under developed &amp; quiet frankly unneeded. The hassles that occurred during film, makes it no surprise to learn that director Fincher walked out before editing could be completed. Apart from that, ALIEN 3 merely comes off as a rip-off/remake of the original ALIEN, but contains none of that films tension, suspense or brooding dark &amp; creepy atmosphere. Ripley spends most of the movie walking around with a bald head &amp; looking burnt out (although after dealing with acid spitting aliens twice one really can't fault her for that.) &amp; isn't that much fun this time around.All in all, if only they had taken the time out to carefully groom the script &amp; make it better, instead of rushing it out there to make some more cash, ALIEN 3 may have turned out to be a very interesting instalment in the series. I'm not a huge fan of it, since like I already said it's a major fall off from where the first two films are. But personally I didn't see where it was anywhere near as bad as others are saying it is (although I'm pretty certain considering the negative reviews on this site, that I'm in the minority yet again). True while ALIEN 3 has it's flaws, I still found the film to be entertaining enough to be worth a look for non demanding fans. LANCE HENRIKSEN shows up in a cameo appearance.

		<fullReview>Let's start off with saying that I was barely around during the promotion of the film so I wasn't expecting a giant action-oriented picture that took place on Earth (that some of the promotions intended). So when I took a look at the movie on the Quadrilogy, I wasn't sure what to expect.To my pleasant surprise the film looked and felt somewhat like the original Alien, and it didn't have the slightly over-the-top feel of Aliens. It was incredibly dark and moody, and it was dripping with atmosphere. It was chock full of really cool shots and effects. I felt the acting was superb, especially from Sigourney Weaver. Plus, the set design was amazing.On the other hand... Some of the pacing was pretty poor. I sort of lost interest at parts, but it picked up again toward the end. The costume design was, well, less than stellar. It looked like they stole the costumes off of homeless people in the street. What I liked least would be the constantly whispered voices (well, almost constant).Overall, I think a little more action would have done the film a bit of good to help the pacing, but other than that it was fantastic. And remember, this is coming from someone who had no idea what to expect.8/10</fullReview>

Since this movie was not very popular, why was there yet another Alien film? Alien vs. Predator was a very interesting film and I always like to see Lance Henriksen at work, but Alien Resurrection was a little too much like Jason X. The Alien design was an interesting evolution, as always. I agree with other postings, that this movie is under-rated, but after the adrenaline rush of Aliens, slowing the pace back down to that of Alien was a bit of a letdown. I would always pay to see Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley - a truly terrific character. If you have only seen this movie once, give it another shot. Maybe two. It definitely needs more than one viewing, if only to catch all the dialog, as some of the accents are not easy to pick up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality in this series didn't rise exponentially, like the titles, but this one is still worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just about everyone I talk to about the Alien movies always says the same thing, that you only need to watch the first two because the Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are both terrible. Having just watched Alien 3 again recently for the first time in probably ten years, I'm surprised that people think it is such a terrible. My theory is that since the first Alien was a groundbreaking science fiction film and the second one knocked people over backwards because many people thought it was even BETTER than the first one, there was expectation that this one would be better than them both.And when you look at the titles, it's not hard to see where that expectation came from, even beyond the unexpected rise in quality from the first to the second film. The first film was about an alien, the second film was plural, and this one is Alien Cubed, for crying out loud. The movie takes place in a distant prison outpost for what you might call the "lost cause criminals," which results in an odd combination of rapists, murderers, child molesters and?religion. What? It is indeed odd that when Ripley inadvertently finds herself there, the only woman these men have seen in years, they struggle to remain composed, having sworn an oath of celibacy.This all takes place early in the movie and I was completely convinced that it was all downhill from there, but gradually I found the movie more and more interesting (or maybe I was just in a mood to be entertained rather than to look for things to complain about, which is another mood in which I often find myself). After all, I've never been to prison and I do not adhere to any particular religion, so I'm willing to grant that this is just beyond my understanding. It is, after all, a moving explanation that the men have been able to escape temptation at this outpost and look to spiritual means as sort of a way to cleanse themselves of their sins and prevent themselves from committing any more.Once on the island, Ripley is made to shave her head because they "have a problem with lice there," which results in the shaved mug of Ripley which has become the iconographic image of this film. The scene where the alien first approaches her is a great scene. She's pressed against a wall, terrified, and we get a close of up her face, turned to the side toward the camera as the alien pushes its gigantic head against her cheek, which is another of the most famous images from the movie. The alien retracts without harming her, almost as though it recognizes her. To me that doesn't say "I recognize you so I'll let you go," it says "I'm back, and I'm saving you for last." Open your mind and you have to love this stuff!Ripley has crash landed on Fury 161, the prison outpost, and is the only survivor. The little girl, Newt, from the last film was killed and Ripley begins to raise eyebrows when she insists on an autopsy to ensure that there is not an alien incubating inside her. Again, she has much difficulty getting people to believe her until they start turning into greasy spots on the hull. The image of the film is completely different from the first two movies, Ripley is not only completely unarmed because she's on a prison outpost, but she doesn't even have any hair. She has nothing but the most basic human resources, which I think justifies this sequel, which could have fallen easily had it tried to take the firepower in the other direction. Not as great as the first two, obviously, but David Fincher made his feature film directing debut with something that is certainly worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action and suspense, but poor script and acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To see this film, its likely you've seen the previous 2 films, which were very good. Horror fans wouldn't be disappointed with this film, but the acting and script lets it down. Alien 3 has never lived up to its previous films to some people, including me. The director of Alien 3 - David Fincher, unfortunately tries to make the film more modern than its predecessors. This is were the film goes wrong. We are used to the excellent directing delivered to us in the previous films, but the only good piece of directing in this film are the camera angles, which shows us the aliens nicely and some great 'running away' scenes which we see when the characters try to trap an alien, cleverly in one small area. The best of use of cameras in this film is the quiet scene in which Ripley finds the mother alien sneaking up on her.The film is set on a distant planet that holds some insane characters in a prison. Ripley, in her escape pod from the previous film, lands onto the planet. Here, we meet many strange and different characters of all types. We have our typical American psychopath who keeps on shouting out "F**k you man!". Its a shame really, the first film done well without guys like this. I'm not saying actors shouldn't swear - what do you expect with an alien hunting you down, but I get the impression they are saying it for the hell of it. Then we get some dumb geezers who apparently haven't seen a woman in years - believable, but if you class Ripley as a woman by the end of this film, you belong with these guys! Our other characters thankfully try to act and remain calm...most of the time.After an alien is swallowed by the riggers dog, he (spoiler) gets frisky and gives birth to an alien, but because the dog ate the egg, we see an alien mutated into a dog. A clever idea from our novice director, and a realistic scene when we see the dogs stomach explode. The other special effects aren't too bad either. We see CGI (computer generated images) of aliens, running around the corridors that maybe perhaps could have done with more effort.It is Ripleys change in personality that sets this film away from the previous 2. Its harsh , but (spoiler) when Ripley gets her hair shaved off to avoid lice, she does become very mannish. It is the truth, but its shows the development in Ripleys character. She is no longer the woman with plenty of femininity, but now a more woman who's ready to kick some ass.The good thing about this film is the amount of action we are treated to! There's plenty of 'run away' scenes and aliens, and the realism is great - most scenes use puppets of aliens, and the use of the early CGI is minimal, so don't worry about that too much.If your looking for a realistic action film, than try Alien 3. it has its flaws - bad script, lack of outer space, and constant arguments between the characters that gets tedious. But this film has been designed for action, and director David Fincher does a good job of that, and the puppet realism as well. But avoid this if you don't like lots of blood, aliens, or the flaws listed above.Overall, an experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 follows on from a great film Aliens and i think that Fincher has done an above average Job with this one.It was always going to be difficult to follow on from a movie like aliens but this film lacks the action shown from Aliens. It was a bit frustrating at the fact that Hicks and Newt were dead and Bishop was virtually destroyed after they went through all the struggle of surviving, and I'm still wondering how the Queen Alien Managed to lay that egg in the ship of Aliens.I think that Fincher should have thought better about this before beginning to film.But thats it as far as the criticising goes, I think that the new breed of Alien he has introduced looked impressive and once again there is a good cast of actors which the Alien films never fails to bring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now don't get me wrong, but I liked this movie better than the first and the second. The first was entertaining. I liked the second. This movie was scary ride with action and gore. You see, someone's got to have their opinion to see if a movie's good or not and I'm the only one. I hear about what you people say about this movie. Sure it's not the best, but at least it was entertaining. for me, it is. Now on to the review. I wasn't expecting there would be a third, but guess I was wrong. I rented it and I was entertained. It had a good story, some decent action scenes and well made gore. The cgi for the alien was pretty good. I hear that it looked fake. Oh well. It was your choice so....thats it. Overall, one of the better alien films to come out in movie history. Scary, thrilling and entertaining. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that the story was crafted best of the three alien films. The vacant prison premise sets the stage for a very dark and creepy atmosphere. The drama slowly builds the tension up to the inevitable climax when The rescue arrives and Ripley makes her sacrifice. The conflict between the new found religion and the heinous background of the inmates add to the irony of Riply's situation. Good acting all around and Believable sets, costumes and make up support the storyline. A great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The SE Treatment Really Brings This Film TO Life at Last!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Alien 3 was first released, it was plagued by studio politics, idiot preview audiences who said 'there's too many bald English blokes in it' and execs who really did not know what they where doing.The end result was a film that the Director refused to have anything to do with and I cannot blame him! The huge gaping holes in the plot where plain to see and the true spirit of the Alien franchise that had so characterised the first two instalments was lost or at least heavily diluted.Thankfully sense has prevailed and the new Special Edition puts the film as near as possible back the way it should have been. Don't get me wrong, its still not as good as the all out Directors Edition of Aliens and it still drags a little in places but it is still a darn sight better and well worth the investment. Once seen, you will never want to see the now dreadful original version ever again.Its just a pity that this treatment did not manage the same kind of transformation on Alien Resurrection!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review relates to the special edition on the Quadrilogy box set**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS BELOW** SPOILERS**SPOILERSWhat can i say, i love this film. Right from the beginning you know that it's going to be nothing like Aliens, it feels like more of a sequel then Aliens in spirit and atmosphere. Everything has been stripped right down and is almost raw. Ripley has been stripped of anything that gave her comfort, hicks, newt, bishop, the film even goes so far to take her hair. She looks sick, like a patient suffering a terminal illness, and as the film progresses we find out that it is terminal and the alien queen grows inside like a cancer. She is the only one left, Hicks and Newt are long dead, even their names have slipped away as they become simply the child and the man.Reversing Ripleys decay is the birth of a new alien, perversely bursting from a dead ox. The alien is different now, moving on all fours, even more animal like and further removed from anything human. As the films progress through the series the connection between Ripley and the alien becomes stronger and stronger. In this film she carries part of it with her and now in a reverse of what has gone before she is not at risk from the outside threat, only that which is growing inside herThis film was clearly a difficult birth and this anguish and difficulty is all up on the screen. Here's a film which began shooting with no concrete script having been greenlighted on a different concept. It's only the skill of the director Fincher and the excellent cast which hold it together. The film is infused with the dark grimy view that became famous in Se7en, The Game and fightclub. Only here it was years ahead of its time and unacceptable to audiences after the whizz-bang wow factor of Aliens with its gung hung macho chestbeating. The accusation that it's just a bunch of identical looking bald british blokes running round in the dark is one made out of the great ignorance. The film may have been made without a clear script but Finchers visual style still gives it structure and substance. An excellent score underpins the emotional content of the film.This film is unforgiving, there is nothing to uplift you or give you hope. Ripley seems doomed from the moment the film begins and the ending seems a perfect full stop to the trilogy, spoilt by the horrendous and unforgivable Alien Resurrection. Watch the DVD extras on the other disc, it gives an insight about what Fincher was trying to do and what the fox executives were trying to do. The ignorance of the two execs that give interviews is astounding and their defence of their 'creative decisions' makes for good watching. If you saw this film on its cinema release and hated it nows the time to give it another go, it might surprise you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very big downer, but...Check Out The Assembly Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-------SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! I'M SERIOUS!!!!------When I saw this movie in 1992, I was depressed for a long time. For a while, I was angry at the way that the series had ended (That was, of course, before "Alien Resurrection"). Over the years, however, my tune has changed.For a long time, I could not watch "Aliens" because those that survived that film (Hicks, Newt and Bishop, as well as Ripley), were killed at the beginning of "Alien 3." Ripley ends up on on a maximum security prison, populated by male prisoners. None of the men, who are some of the worst criminals (Rapists, murderers, child molesters), are happy to see Ripley. However, she's the least of their problems when an alien pops up on the planet. Seems that the alien hitched a ride on Ripley's EEV. It also seems that one of her worst nightmares have come to light, when she finds that she has been impregnated by the alien.This is not as bad a film as first thought. Poor David Fincher, who has practically disowned the film, has been given a bad rap. The film's core message is about loss. Ripley has lost much since the first film: She lost her friends, daughter (See "Aliens" Special Edition for info on this),surrogate daughter(Newt),years and even Jones (The cat). Plus, her worst fears have come to light. She knows that she's going to die, to lose her life. The question becomes this: If you are going to die, what are you going to do with what time you have left? Will you give up or go out fighting? The film basically establishes the well-known stages of death by Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Ripley goes through these emotions in such a quick space of time that one barely notices.I recently saw "The Assembly Cut" of "Alien 3," and I must admit that it improves on the original in many ways. Loose threads were tired up in this version (Such as the fate of Golic, who seemed to have simply disappeared without any real explanation) and more character development (The prisoners prayer meetings). The fate of Ripley in this version was slightly less painful than in the theatrical version. You can see what Fincher's vision was, and if the studios didn't butt in, who knows what would have happened with his career. Would "Seven," "Fight Club" or "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" have been made if this film was a success? You may never know the question, but this is still a good film to watch. Watch the "Assembly Cut" and "Theatrical Version" back to back and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extended Workprint DVD Edition - Definite improvement...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot Spoilers Ahoy!!I've just watched the workprint edition of Alien 3 on the Alien Quadrilogy - and I'd have to say that it makes it a much better film than the original release. It expands on things which were not crystal clear as in the original version including Ripley's affair with Clemens and Gollic's obsession with the "dragon". Also - I much prefer this ending rather than the original ending - in the original - the alien bursts out of Ripley's stomach - giving a sense that the alien had finally beat Ripley. Whereas in the new version - Ripley just jumps into the molten lead - beating both the alien and the company/Bishop. A LOT more satisfying than the original movie - and it doesn't leave you disappointed. Another aspect which the extended version is far superior is that it gives you more empathy for all of the prisoners by providing more of an insight into them - which gives much more impact to their downfall than the original.This movie isn't up to the extremely high standard of the first two films - but definitely - it is worth checking out the new DVD version of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most movies that are made into trilogies without being written as such in the first place usually degenerate into crap, no matter how good the idea was to start out with. Take the Terminator trilogy for instance (though it must be admitted that the second one was pretty cool). Alien, however, is not one of those trilogies. The first and the second are different enough that the movies each remain interesting. And the third one, amazingly enough, does the same thing. Unlike most of the movie series put out by Hollywood, there is enough to do with the Alien storyline that there can conceivably be more than one movie. Alien 3 is an often underrated sci-fi film, as it hearkens back to the first one. However, it also does several things the first two do not in terms of character embellishment and suspense. In addition, it provides beautiful visual effects (if the word 'beautiful' can be connected to a sci-fi/horror monster). The acting isn't incredible, but it's not bad, and the ending ties things up nicely, finishing the series in a satisfactory way. If only the producers had recognized that before they made the fourth one, which is tripe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Special Edition DVD - causes a rethink - SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just watched the special edition DVD, that comes with the Quadrilogy, I have to conclude that I need to re-evaluate my opinions on this film.Yes, I was aware of the problems that Fincher had with the film during its filming, but when I went to the cinema to see the film on its release, I came away feeling let down (as a fan of the two previous films) and more importantly confused.Now (although without Fincher's blessing) we can have a clearer idea of the vision that he was driving for. Whilst this DVD is not the classic many had hoped for, the inclusion of more character detail, storyline depth and the motivations of Golick and the company have made the whole experience not only more comprehensive, but far more compelling if not that much more scary.So for those of you who have an interest in the series I recommend another view of the film in its SE status. With its far more developed religious themes and Ripley characterisation and personally think most of you will be very pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

The composition is nothing spectacular, the characters are about as deep as a puddle, and the active and suspenseful elements forged in the first two don't carry over at all. However, I can say that the story never really slows down, and when it hesitates, its to good effect. So good effort, poor movie.</fullReview>

The film gets a bad rap because two loved charachters, Hicks and Newt, are killed off instantly. But this film has a lot going for it. It is smart, exciting, and it has great cinematography, as to be expected with any of the Alien movies. I was very pleased with the script. I have never seen a Hollywood movie that has had such a blatant disregard for main charachters than this one. That is a plus, especially in this day and age, where main charachters, by some miracle, always get lucky and never die. Watching this movie, for the first time, if you are able to guess who will be alive at the end...then you should win a prize.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."Alien3" is the most underrated movie of all time (well...maybe). I can't believe people's excuses for not liking this film. Just a few days ago a friend said he didn't like it because "the good guys had no weapons". Nevermind that the characters in the first "Alien" also had no weapons. In fact, "Alien3" is one of the few third installments that still keeps the series alive.The story focuses on our hero, Lt. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) landing on a remote planet that doubles as a prison. There she befriends doctor Clemens (Charles Dance) and inmate Dillon (Charles S. Dutton). Clemens helps her come to realize that there was an alien on board her escape pod before he is killed off (a little too early, I have to say). After Clemens is killed, Ripley, Dillon and the other inmates devise a plan to help kill the alien.This a very scary movie. Director Fincher made his film debut with "Alien3" and established himself as one of the greatest mystery/horror directors of our time. The climax involves the inmates running throughout the maze that is a prison, trying to lure the alien into a trap, creating some of the most suspenseful chase scenes that I've seen."Alien3" is a fun, cool, exciting movie that is highly underrated, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third instalment of the Alien 'Trilogy' sees Ripley survive and land on a prison ship where all the inmates, who have been previously convicted of murder and rape and suchlike, have turned to religion. If this sounds unlikely, then the flat characterisations, the continuos obscenities and the pummelling repetitions of people telling each other to shut up won't help.The biblical comparisons are made almost too obvious, and the lack of a referral to the Alien as an Alien, but simply as a beast or a monster, give it devilish credentials, but there is almost too much in common with the gospels that it watches like The New Testament in Space.The only characters that deserve any serious consideration are Ripley and Clarence, yet there interaction is completely uninspiring.Sadly, the ending is by far the best part of the film, but the build up to the ending lacks any feel of intensity and slightly confused me.All in all, the film is poor, and as an act to follow the two previous films, certainly can't stand the heat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's interesting in that when I first went to see Alien3 at the cinema on the year of its release I couldn't help fill disappointed after seeing the film. There was so much weight to carry after the horror action combo of the first two films, that this was always going to be a hard act to follow.However, as time has passed and re-watching the film without the expectations that were first placed upon it, its makes for interesting viewing. Indeed, the somber story and brown-green visuals that pervades the films will never endear it to a large audience. Yet there is much to admire about the film. It's wonderfully stylish, has some really key performances from some of the leads, and is very brave with its story.Watching it makes me yearn to see the Directors Cut (at least another 40 minutes of character driven footage was excised from the film just prior to its release by the studio). Alas, only time will tell if Fincher and Fox will put their differences behind them, and let us enjoy the original vision of a young and talented director who was so obviously working under constraint at the time.And for those of you who haven't seen the film - or dismissed it - I implore you to watch again with fresh eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-crafted addition to series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's exciting about watching the quaternary "Alien" films is each one reflects the director's proclivities. "Alien 2," many people's favorite, is typical of the "blast-first-ask-questions-later" mentality of James Cameron. (A director I loathe.) What I appreciate about "Alien 3," and certainly I'm in the minority here, is how it rethinks the genre. Ripley crashes on a penal colony where there are no weapons and all the inmates have "found God." Unfortunately the alien also finds its way there and is ready to begin harvesting. With no weapons at their disposal, the inmates have to pull together and find another way to conquer this "unstoppable" foe. It's so obvious to rely on fire power, the bigger the gun the better, that anymore it's almost boring. So to take on this kind of enemy WITHOUT rounds of ammo is creative thinking at its highest. How this film got made is anyone's guess. While four writers are credited with the script, the story belongs to New Zealander Vincent Ward, a true visionary filmmaker who created "Vigil," "Navigator" and "What Dreams May Come." (I wish he'd work on another project already.) True genius! I also enjoy the atmospherics of this film. It's very claustrophobic, with a pervasive undercurrent of menace. Here's a woman surrounded by rapists and murderers who operate under a thin veneer of civility and she has to rely on them. It creates a very tense situation indeed. Sigourney Weaver shaved her head for the role, very bold in a "you'll get the job if you're a pinup" industry. And here she's got balls of brass. Her costars, most of whom are British, are top notch, particularly the always wonderful Pete Postlethwaithe, Charles Dance and Brian Glover. Charles S. Dutton is also quite good. And the cinematography by Alex Thomson, the man behind "Excalibur," is moody and atmospheric. In my mind, you can never make a film too dark. (It would have been interesting to see how Dharius Khondji, the cinematographer on "Se7en," would have done.) For me, David Fincher is a real hit and miss director, but he's still one of the most visually exciting. He's done some truly brilliant work and I consider "Se7en," "Fight Club" and "Alien 3" some of the most impressive films of all time. (Although "The Game" and "Panic Room" were stylistically fascinating, they are crap when it comes to plot.) Those who seem to admire "Alien 3" are formalists; they appreciate style over function. Those who hate this film belong to the "shoot 'em up" club; if you have to think about your sci-fi, you might as well not bother. I say more of the former, fewer of the latter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremendously Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When anyone sets out to make a sequel, it seems that most people make up their minds to hate it before they even sit down to view it for the first time. I think that Aliens (James Cameron's sequel to Alien) dodged this bullet because it was so over-the-top good and different (and because expectations for it weren't that high). So, all the pre-decided venom to hate a sequel was reserved for David Fincher's Alien3 and most people never even gave it a chance. Now, granted, overall the film is not as ground-breaking as the original or as tautly fun as the second, but it's still a great film. First, it gave us a tasty sample of the kinds of visuals that we've now come to expect from David Fincher, probably the only director who can rival the Scott brothers (Ridley and Tony) for dark beauty. The flash images during the title sequence alone scared the hell out of me. Second, the performances are excellent. I would argue that Weaver should have been nominated for an Oscar for this film rather than for Aliens. Running around and shouting like a macho action hero is great, as she did in 2, but here in 3 she displays a much broader range of emotions with depth, subtley, and real sadness. Charles Dance is also amazing. And last, the guts and originality of the story are impressive, given what had come before in 2 and 3. The easy road would have been to make 3 even bigger: more aliens, coming back to earth, some stupid path like that. Instead, they chose to scale it back down again, really focusing this time on Ripley as an individual (more than in any of the other films). Isolating her and her relationship with the Alien(s) is a courageous and dramatically effective move, especially considering the unpredictability of how she becomes so isolated - just when she's making connections with people in her new environment, something happens to cut her off again. The storyline has been lambasted by many because it's not very warm and fuzzy. Excuse me, we're talking about one of the finest sci-fi horror franchises in contemporary cinema history, yes? Warm and fuzzy isn't what I go to these movies for. Even more than in 2, Alien 3 brings the sadness back to horror. It's not just stupid, empty thrills with characters you don't care anything about (paging Wes Craven) - these are real people who have to face real danger and make heroic decisions. And, in fact, the heroism of Ripley's character in this film is what makes it the perfect ending to what should have been a trilogy (all apologies to the great Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who directed Alien 4). SPOILER (If you haven't seen this film and plan to, you probably shouldn't read any further): I was truly moved when Ripley finds herself carrying a Queen - it's the culmination of the worst fear she's carried since the beginning of the series and her solution is the perfect counterpoint to the `crew being expendable' sentiment voiced by the Company in the first film. Rather than being told that it's okay if they die by someone else, here we have the main character deciding to die because she's internalized the battle with the Alien(s) (no pun intended) - no matter what the Company says or what they offer her, she takes on the final responsibility to make sure the Alien(s) are wiped out - that's true heroism and it's every bit as moving as Ripley's `decision to go back in' from 2. I think that people just didn't warm to it because Weaver, with her shaved head, isn't as cuddly as Newt from 2, but it makes me wonder why these people walked into the theatre playing Alien3 in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly have no idea why people dislike this movie so much. True, it's not the best in the series (in my opinion, the quality of the films run in chronological order), but in my opinion it's the best directed. Dark, disturbing and full of symbolism. David Fincher (also one of my favourite directors) did a great job with an impossible situation. And believe me, "Alien 3" was an absolute nightmare to put together. Only days after the release of "Aliens," Twentieth Century Fox ordered for a third Alien film to go into production. Six years, several directors and ten scripts later, they got "Alien 3." Production was an absolute mess, with trailers being released while production was barely off the ground, and according to David Fincher, they were being faxed more pages of the script on set and were forced to shoot those scenes the same day.Anyhow, on a different note, it's interesting to note that "Pitch Black" was originally slated to be the third Alien film, but the director, David N. Twohy, was fired from production. However, he decided to go off and make the movie anyway. There was a little tweaking in the script of course, but the basic outline is still there (spaceship crash lands on a planet full of very Alien-like aliens, the main character is a woman, there's a child involved, the woman dies at the end, etc.).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A first glimpse of Fincher's genius, this movie gets better with each viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Alien 3, I was disappointed. The second time I saw it, I was strangely fascinated. The third time I saw it, I absolutely adored it - and it gets better with each viewing! I didn't know about Fincher then, but a few movies later (The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room) I now know what it was - a first glimpse of a coming genius. If you've liked any of Fincher's later movies, you might want to check this one out - disappointment, fascination, terror and beauty all in one! Not bad for a big-screen debut, not bad at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The more 'Artsy' sci-fi horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, I'm assuming everyone here has seen this 10-year old movie, but if you haven't please read someone else's review.The first time I watched this film I have to admit, I was a bit let down - no real action scenes, pretty standard special effects and my biggest beef was who really cares what happens to all these murderers on prisoner island anyway?Then a few years later, I re-watched it in film class, and have to admit - from a cinematography standpoint it became my favorite.The graphic close ups that catch you off guard, the creepy symbolisms in many of the violent scenes (The death by fan scene is my fave, both graphically and symbolically.Mandalas rock!)The story is pure mythology - the religious allusions alone make this film a melting pot of interpretation - just think of the many ways you can equate Ripley to Jesus. I'm not religious, but I really love symbolisms.In short - if you want people blowing up aliens and running through tunnels rent Aliens or Resurrection (although the identity issues in Resurrection make it quite fun to interpret too) I you want horror with a more philosophical bite to it try Alien 3 out, but remember it's an acquired taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Bleak, Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a huge fan of this series, and I, for one, love the diversity of the great directors that have marked each film in the series. This film has suffered great injustice at the hands of critics and the public, so much so it nearly drove a great director (Fincher) out of the business. Now, as often is the case, this film has been eternally compared to the previous film in the series, Aliens, directed by James Cameron. Why this film has taken so much heat is the "trained" moviegoer has been conditioned to "need" certain things from a film: the innocent vs. guilty, good vs. evil, clear rules of engagement, and the hero winning out in the end and returning to some "normal" or "great" life beyond the story of the film. Well, this movie delivers no of those. Only Ripley is truly innocent, good and evil are skewed, and there are no rules. The protagonists, the hero Ripley excluded, are derelicts and sociopaths with shaved heads. When you consider what Fincher created here, it is the complete antithesis of what you are "supposed" to want, and that's what makes it great. He creates a broken, reluctant hero down to her last gasp (yes, I know he didn't "create" Ellen Ripley but he had to make his own version of her for this film) against the most horrific of foes (fast, lethal, hideous, and kills for the sake of killing) in a dark, defective, claustrophobic environment (probably what space would really be like) with only a group of the worst humanity has to offer as her help.The film begins with a cool sequence where the Alien is "reborn" as the heroes and survivors of Aliens (Ripley, Hicks, Newt, and Bishop) are in kryostasis. As they sleep, one of them, we are not sure who, is "impregnated" by the Alien as the ship begins to blow up. We are shown this sequence in flashes, as the scenes alternate between the movie and the credits against the backdrop of space all while a chilling opera soliloquy is played. I know many people hated the fact that Hicks, Newt, and Bishop are given the unceremonious boot, but what else would you do with them? They weren't Fincher's characters, the were Cameron's, and the only character Fincher needed was Ripley. The point of them dying is to show the last people (Newt especially) that Ripley cared about are now gone. She has nothing left. As soon as she befriends Clemons, guess what? It is a point. They ended is spectacular. For many, it ruined the movie. For me, I think it couldn't have been anymore heroic. Alien 3 definitely has a modernist feel to it, and some people can't handle that apparently. Ripley's speech to the convicts before the head out to lock horns with the alien is great and humorous in a dark way.The part that summarized the mood and tone of the movie was classic modernist sequence was near the end when the furnace burns out, everything goes dark, we then get a shot of a sun rising over the planet's horizon to reveal a bleak, dead, wasteland of a world, and then we see the doors being sealed for the last time. We then hear Ripley's recording from the original Alien (where that came from I don't know, since it was recorded on a pod from the Nostromo and this pod was from the Sulaco) while a computer screen displays a paragraph with perhaps the bleakest statement to finish a movie.Great performances from Sigourney Weaver and Charles Dance, while Charles S. Dutton was awesome as Dillon, the hard-core defacto leader of the convicts who realizes he is a monster, but acts as a hero nonetheless. Also, Eliot Goldenthal's score is dark and chilling, but excellent and perfectly matched.This film is a dark, bleak, representation of how a film that breaks from the traditional conflict good vs. evil can be warped into something unique and really, truly make it work. It shows that sometimes victory doesn't always come in the ways we hope and that the hero doesn't always have to win or that the hero even CAN win. It couldn't be any more anti-Jim Cameron. Some great scenes, some great dialogue, an eerily cool environment and atmosphere, and a terrifically unique and powerful ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Alien 3," David Fincher's directorial debut, had its moments. It had its ups and downs, its good and its bad, the usual, but David Fincher's camera work helped it from being a failure. The movie isn't what I would call excellent ("Alien," "Aliens," and "Alien: Resurrection" were good), but it was good. Sigourney Weaver's performance was extraordinary. Once again, she fights an alien, but, this time, it's at a prison that's for men. There were strong violence and lots of language. I consider "Alien 3" to be David Fincher's failure, but, his next 4 films ("Se7en," "The Game," "Fight Club," and "Panic Room") will help bring him to fame and stardom. I'll recommend it if you enjoyed the "Alien" series.B **** (out of ****** stars) 9/13</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely underrated sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people hate this film because it's not like the first two, it kills off all the people we care about (including Ripley), and doesn't have that much action. Is this the best reason people can think of as to why they hate it?! Sorry, but that's not enough to make me think this was a bad movie. Besides, each Alien film (if you look at it as a trilogy, ignoring the horrible Alien 4) was quite different from each other. Alien was more dark and scary. Aliens was more action-packed. Alien 3 is a darker approach to the series displaying the realization of how Ripley will have to deal with this thing till the day she dies. Also, Alien 3 has a more realistic and real-life feel to it. It doesn't go how we want to go and never turns out perfect. I liked this approach because it made me feel more sad for Ripley and her dying friends. Also, even though this movie has some paper-thin characters, they still have something unique to all of them. But here comes my first complaint. Why did the studios have to pull out the machete and slice the character development into tidbits? Over a half-hour of footage involving character development is cut! But besides this, it's very interesting and the movie jerks us around whenever it kills off characters we loved. It's a nice way to keep me pinned in because this movie has the balls to actually be mean and violent to the viewer. It pulled me in. I didn't know what would happen next. Exactly who would live? Also, the movie is visually stunning. It has lots of darkness to it and throws in some crazy camera angles (especially those from the alien's viewpoint). Fincher really shines when it comes to the style. He also knows how to work with substance, character-wise. But if only the studios would've left in that character development so this movie could pull me in more! But it still does since this movie revolves around Ripley. It's her movie and it she gives a great performance. Her character really evolved over the movies. At points, you feel sorry for her since there's no way for her to get around this nightmare she has to face. But don't worry, she still has that badass feel to her and presents it at the right moments. The only other things I have to gripe about is the CGI they used at times for the alien. I utterly hate CGI because at those moments, the alien looked fake. But besides that, I thought it was very creepy and I'm glad they kept it in the shadows so it still had it's scary quality (unlike Alien 4 which almost makes the aliens look like the heroes!). But besides this, this was a very good and underrated movie and the series should've ended here. But the fans had to gripe over Ripley's desmise and made the studios get big dollar signs in their eyes, and thus, Alien: Resurrection which totally whizzes all over the series. I'm sorry, but people have to grow up some. I was 7 when I first saw this and I was very satisfied with how it ended. Ripley's journey was finally over and her time to rest. I'm sorry but are there only a few people out there that didn't realize this? Besides, like I said before, the movie would've been better if the studios left in the extra footage. But overall, Alien 3 is actually a pleasant surprise and a nice way to end the series as a "trilogy." 8/10</fullReview>

Her fateful, unfortunate relation to the Alien was not that convincing in any other part of the Alien saga. This is it, what keeps this movie alive, and makes it a worthy conclusion of the first Alien Saga. ( The end of the Saga, because I DISGUST the fouth part! )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a devoted fan to the Alien saga. I do think the first one in the series is by far the better one and it really holds up well today. Aliens hasn't stod the test of time that well, much of the dialogue and characters feel very 80's to me. But it has a tremendous drive and action and can not be ignored. Alien 3 was hated upon its arrival, and David Fincher had endless fights with 20th Century Fox over the storyline (the script wasn't finished and new pages arrived daily to the set). Considering this turbulence, and that he had to change DP midway through it due to Fox's impatience with the slow shooting style from original cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth, Fincher delivered a masterpiece. It really holds up very well, and is perhaps the most character driven entry of the whole series. There's even a hinted love story in there. This film needs to be re-discovered by Alien fans. Few films deserve it more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and thoughtful instalment to the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Alien 3 a lot, I know I'm one of the few who does, but that doesn't matter... Most people refuse to like this film, because it's not Aliens (1986) - and nor should it be... The thing I like most about this franchise is that every film is different, mainly down to the use of a different Director with a different style for each film. Alien 3 marked the film debut of commercials wiz-kid David Fincher -another reason people don't like this film (but I discussed that more in-depth in my review of Se7en).Alien 3 is the most beautiful, thoughtful and yes, darker Alien film... Alex Thomson's gold tinted photography creates a gothic and haunting look and atmosphere to the prison colony, (what with this film and Se7en I would say Fincher has seen Lars Von Trier's The Element of Crime (1983) one too many times). This also takes the franchise back into a more adult area, the character are more human, not the caricatured hero's we saw in Aliens, these are tortured people with dark pasts, we only get small hints as to why they are there, but that's enough. Fincher has an obsession with the darker side of man, it's apparent in all of his films right up to the more recent Fight Club (1999) - but with Alien 3, he takes one of cinema's most well thought of, and well loved characters (Weaver's Ellen Ripley) and strips away the "tough cookie" exterior that surrounded her in Cameron's predecessor. Here we see the torture she has endured in the previous instalments, what she's lost - she no-longer feels human, she has more connection with the alien... And her ultimate sacrifice that she makes in order to finish what was started back on the Nostromo is one of the most haunting scenes you could ever see in a mainstream film.I personally think Alien 3 is the best film it could be (maybe even better if Fox hadn't decided to re-edit it), and it has it's own identity - it's not just a lame Aliens rip-off... It's the kind of film people will have reactions to, and that's what makes Alien 3 such a great film... Good or bad, 30 years from now, people will still be talking about it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Alien series is unique in several aspects - all parts have different directors, each director among the best in the world, and - most important - the producers allowed them to implement their unique styles on the films. And that's the reason the quality of the series stayed almost at a constant level - in opposition to almost all other sequels in movie history.Part one introduced the terrific idea and part two is a perfect action movie. Fortunately they didn't try to copy one of these in part three (it could only have become worse). Instead Alien 3 puts more emphasis on the characters and the (depressive) mood. The visual style is awesome and the great collection of odd looking people is only surpassed by the cast of 'Der Name der Rose'. The movie has some lengths and some plot holes but nevertheless it impresses me a lot every time I see it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all the negative feedback that this movie received, I do consider it an excellent movie. I believe that the movie succeeded to capture "alien atmosphere" in its own unique manner. Dark and rusty mood, feel of desperation, empathy, horror and terror are all mixed in one great movie-making cocktail. There is no combat action like in the previous installment 'Aliens', that alone, was definitely the right decision to follow. The music score by Elliot Goldenthal is astonishing. In my opinion, the music score is like a second nature to this universe and Mr. Goldenthal definitely delivers a consistent yet unique accompaniment. To this day I do consider it as his best work. Bravo Maestro! The suspense in the film is rigid, the 'running in the tunnels' scenes are very chilling, with cast delivering first-rate performance. Special Effects are good and the ending; well what can I say not to spoil it. If the movie does not have a happy end it does not make it a bad movie.

		<shortDescription>Theatrical cut is miserable as hell, see the extended version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In regards to the version that was released in cinemas...miss it. That's for damn sure. This was the first film that David Fincher directed and it has that dark, smelly and grimy look that he is only capable of. After the highly exciting Aliens there is ZERO entertainment here and only one Alien. Very fake looking and largely unseen for most of the movie.Apparently the Alien Queen laid one last face hugger egg on the Marine ship (didn't she already detach herself from her birth tunnel thingy). The egg hatches and lays another Alien egg in Ripley, which just happens to be a queen. For a reason, which is unclear to us, the face hugger sprays acid on the ship, which catches fire and breaks off the cryo-tube section. This sends Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop crashing down onto a lice-infected prison planet called Furiona 161. Just for the hell of it (it seems) Newt, Hicks and Bishop are killed off because the film is deliberately miserable as it possibly can be. Weaver is the only female character in it and is very much indistinctive among the rest of the indistinctive cast as she is bald-headed (because of the Lice problem) with a bunch of bald-headed guys who all appear to be English and ugly. There is another face hugger (so the Queen laid 2 eggs before it died?) that the prisoners seem to miss as they rescue Ripley. It impregnates a dog and a new Alien is born in the form of a canine, giving us the impression that the beast mimics the form of the creature that became its host. We are supposed to observe this as it is never cleared up in dialogue.There are numerous scenes in which Ripley (or bald-headed prisoners?I can't tell) run down damp corridors (or perhaps the same one over and over) being chased by the Alien. But for budget reasons we don't actually SEE the Alien, just its point of vision. Characters are killed with no care, passion or meaning to their deaths and how the hell anyone believed that an audience of any kind would enjoy this film is beyond my great understanding.It is so bad that Fincher didn't get work for 3 years after this until he was called upon to direct Se7en. The only reason he got to do that is because it is a depressing and ugly film, much like this. The extended version featured on the Special Edition DVD is a far superior version of the film, though not a director's cut or without faults, it's the best version of the film you're likely to see. Characters are fleshed out, sense-making scenes are restored and the creature is born out of a dead ox instead of a dog. It doesn't sound like much but it almost changes it into a completely new and more satisfying film.Either 1/10 or 7/10 depending on the version you watch. 4/10 overall.</fullReview>

In my opinion, this film brought a new hope to horror films, as it brings much needed emotion deepness combined with a great suspense factor. The new alien design deviates slightly from the previous ones but turns out to be excellent on the main action scene, even if hampered a bit by primitive CG graphics. The work by amalgamated dynamics on the special effects however is brilliant showing us the most realistic live action alien yet. The score composed by Elliot Goldenthal is brilliant, quite similar to his work in "Interview with the vampire". See this movie, you wont regret it.</fullReview>

For instance, who wants to see or hear a little girls chest ripped open to search for an alien? And who wants to see an alien jump out of a dog's stomach?I suppose you should see this movie if you liked the other films. The only reason I say this is because it makes the series complete.

		<shortDescription>What could have been...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** Could contain what might be called 'spoilers,' but no moreso than anyone else's review. Consider thyself warned. **With just a few simple script edits-- made by anyone with at least half a brain-- "Alien 3" could have easily been one of THE greatest films EVER.As it stands, however, it's just an amazingly powerful film that leaves a few nagging uncertainties that could've easily been resolved had those individuals involved with its production not become so publicly frustrated with its progress. And I will stand resolutely in defense of "Alien 3" as the best of the four films in the series, despite its flaws."Alien 3" has met with so much resentment because of its "Babe: Pig in the City" factor-- those people who adored its predecessor were expecting a sequel that would simply EXPAND upon what they had come to know and to love. And, like "Babe: PitC," "Alien 3" demands MUCH more of its audience because of its complex elements of tone, symbolism, and theme-- which are beautifully developed to an extent that is rarely seen on film."Alien 3" takes the "Hey, we can take on these nasties!" premise of Cameron's overblown installment and slams it firmly through the desolate infrastructure of Fury 161. This movie is quite possibly the most complete example of cinematic nihilism ever commited to film, and, needless to say, that kind of undertone doesn't exactly fit well with the tone of "Aliens." The universe of Fury 161 is one in which there is no "Force," no "Mother," nor even a simple machine gun to which Ripley and the inmates can turn for defense against their hunter. And, unpleasant as the thought may be, that is the universe in which WE exist. "Alien 3" doesn't try to dress anything up in a neat little package-- it wants you to see things for the way they really are. That's why so much has been made for the "Alien as the AIDS virus" interpretation of this film-- there are numerous layers and various avenues of interpretation that exist within the subtext here, and NONE of them are particularly encouraging.A prime example (and I'll just give one; I could list countless more...) of the complexity of this film is the scene in which the newly-gestated dog-alien mouths "Amen" to Dillon's powerful elegy. Just TRY to find such symbolism or complex elements of theme in "Aliens." You can't, because they aren't there! "Aliens" is a great ESCAPIST movie-- but "Alien 3" comes close to being a truly GREAT movie.Ok. I could go on far beyond my 1000 word limit on the attributes of this gorgeous film. Let's get to the nit-picks that keep it from being a 'perfect movie':-Although it is completely necessary for the thematic development of the film, it still bites that Newt and Hicks get killed off. (I may be cynical, but I am still human...) The autopsy scene ALONE should have earned Sigourney another Oscar nod.-There are a couple of places where the dialogue just doesn't work. The most conspicuous being Ripley's address to the last surviving inmates: "They [the company]... they think we're CRUD." I honestly thought that was an EDIT for TV the first time I saw it. Then, when I bought the video, it turns out that she ACTUALLY says that. This is where a good script editor would've been nice.-At a couple of instances, the alien looks VERY fake. The alien f/x from both "Alien" and "Aliens" hold up very well-- these aren't going to do the same, unfortunately. But this only mars a few scenes, particularly in the tunnel-chases.-What exactly are we supposed to SEE on Ripley's CATScan? Because you can't see anything but a grainy, purplish blob that doesn't look like ANYTHING. But the effect is still established, so no major harm done.-It isn't exactly clear just WHAT was on the Sulaco with the four survivors-- an alien and an egg? Two eggs? An already-hatched facehugger and an egg? THIS is the serious grievance that takes away from the film's overall effect-- everything else is forgivable because it doesn't detract from the plot or the thematic development. Rating: 9 out of 10. Not perfect, but "Alien 3" comes DAMN close to it. By far the best of the series because it demands the most of its audience. Gorgeous. Brilliant acting and direction (particularly the opening sequence). One of the few justifiable cases for re-making a movie-- because this COULD have quite handily been THE best film ever made. I'm very critical of nearly everything-- so that's NOT an exaggeration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the euphoria of Aliens, many people felt let down by Alien3, due toa) most actors were British b) there was only 1 alien c) people wanted lots of aliensHowever I think this is a really atmospheric movie, far better than Alien Resurrection for example. It's also the most wince-inducing film, with some great killings, not to mention a post-mortem and scenes of needle injections. For those who haven't seen the movie I won't spoil it, but the basic premise is that an alien managed to stow away on board the spaceship at the end of Aliens, and when Ripley and co. crash on to the planet of Fury 161, the alien predictably wreaks havoc. There is also a twist in the tail regarding Ripley, which is fairly predictable from the first half hour or so, but it at least sets up the plot for Alien4. There are several well known British actors (well known to British people that is) such as Charles Dance and Brian Glover, and their broad, distinctive English swearing gives the film an added authenticity. Give the film the credit it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy finale to Alien Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ALIEN3 was a revelation. Despite the reaction from some, the well documented interference from the studio, this film succeeded. I was ambivalent about this installment, expecting another overblown, sub-par sequel, like ALIENS. If you had become an ALIEN fan, in 1979, there was no way that any sequel could be little more than a studio cash in. ALIEN3 changed this. It revealed the Trilogy. Fincher's vision is sublime. It is still locked into the spam-in-a-can plot, but everything else is new, and it returns to a more "ALIEN(1979)" feel. Technical aspects aside, the marvel of ALIEN3 is how it transformed the "franchise". Until A3, "Alien" had been the masterpiece that was the original, followed by a somewhat entertaining, but shameful rip off. With ALIEN3, the story suddenly clicked, and operated as a 3-act tragedy. ALIENS actually worked within this framework of a 3 part story arc. ALIEN3 is not a perfect movie. The weakest point of the theatrical release was a somewhat erratic narrative, some cons remained anonymous, and a couple of characters vanished from the story, midway through. Virtually the entire middle act of ALIEN3 was cut from the 1992 release. The recent "Special Edition" restores this, and much more. The cryotubes in A3 are a copy of A1, and do not match those from the Sulaco, in A2. This is an obvious error. Some of the "problems" with the story are due to Studio editing and rushed production. One should read the novel for the background. Like with ALIEN and ALIENS, Foster wrote the ALIEN3 novel during production, with the full, original story draft. Queens have the capacity to start new hives from scratch. When separated from the former hive, or exiled by a rival, the wandering Queen has 3x eggs inside an internal reserve sac, for recolonizing. Including 1x new Queen. These can be deposited very quickly. The eggs were laid in the dropship. The concept does not seem to track with the opening shots, but the Trilogy is not always perfectly logical (In A1 we hear thrusters in space, in A2 the marines are deployed "on shore", without retaining a single hand on board the main Vessel,etc). The EEV crashed on FURI-161, due to a malfunction caused by a collision with equipment that was ejected due to a blown hatch, in the cargo bay. This was not seen, unfortunately. The mix of American, British and Japanese characters was in keeping with the Military being all that the old USA has in the new order, and Weyland-Yutani a Japanese-British consortium, that relies on mostly American and British employees. If anything ALIENS is out of synch, with it's exclusive "American" characters, in the corporate and civilian sectors (not impossible, just less likely than in A1 and A3). Much of the vitriol directed at ALIEN3 came from ALIENS enthusiasts, expecting "ALIENS part-2". They resented the immediate deaths of Hicks and Newt (plus Bishop). The bald "unlovable" convicts. The lack of trigger time ("Let's rock!"). But ALIEN3 revealed that each chapter had it's own style, it's own identity. I don't understand the resentment of ALIENS fans. This movie actually strengthened ALIENS. Not because A3 was bad, but because it was good. ALIENS was epic. It was a fitting 2nd part. ALIEN3 was the final act, and is perfect as a concept in regards the whole, as a story arc. Fans of ALIENS wanted what Cameron saw for a future installment- "Heroic family vs Aliens". Cameron slanted ALIENS heavily towards the long term love interest of Hicks and Ripley, with Newt as "daughter". But this concept really is anathema to the ongoing "Alien" theme. "Crew expendable". Everyone dies. Anybody that Ripley gets to know, is killed, at inconvenient times. The "Alien story" isn't about fairy tales and relationships. It is about death. It is somehow fitting, that the lone survivor of the entire affair is Morse, a psychotic, hapless con. I saw ALIEN on it's initial run. I loved ALIEN3, and appreciated ALIENS more as a result. A3 is a bleak, emotional final act. It serves notice that nobody is "special". That any character, can, and likely will, be taken away, at any time. Even the "Hero". Rather than viewing the Alien story as individual, stand alone blockbuster movies, it ought to be considered a Trilogy. ALIEN in 1979 was incredible. ALIENS was the climax. ALIEN3 is the finale. The inevitable end to a horrifying, thrilling, but relentlessly depressing Tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ALIEN 3 was so badly killed by reviewers and critics when it was released, that word spread like fire. The film for me was an emotional experience unlike anything else cinema has ever given birth too. I am presently reading the novelization and I can visualize the movie so well, I am enjoying it even more than I did. David Fincher, the director, was under immense pressure from the studio, that its actually recorded in the ALIEN HISTORY. I feel that anything "bad" as most people call it, in this movie, was simply because of 20th Century Fox tormenting the director. David Fincher created a masterpiece, and he didn't receive a single piece of credit for it. Dam them all! I actually think that ALIEN 3 is second best in the series after ALIEN, and should not be pushed into the shadows. ALIEN 3 is a fantastic film. Don't let anyone tell you different. Thank you, and god bless. Daniel Hunter (Dannyfilmmaker123@yahoo.co.uk) 19th October 2006.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tried to love it but can only like it at times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Alien 3 many, many times now. The extended version too.When it came to theaters, I was sooo waiting for it, being an alien-fan. Well, I liked it, but some things always bothered me. My urge to love this film was so huge that only now I can try to review this film clearly.First of all, there isn't much thrilling suspense in this one. The environment is OK, and the jail complex just looks great. It's dark and it's huge - and very well done. The characters are OK, I like the British guys. Some of them are even remotely interesting. But then again, many of the interesting convicts seem to be just statists, as they run for 4 seconds and die. The film reaches a point where you're not sure that who died and who is still alive, and what's that guys name - pretty much all of the characters just lose their points.The story, it isn't bad you know. It's OK, and the overall "feel" of the film is kinda depressing. That's OK too, though it has an effect on you. The effect is that you're feeling kinda low all the time and reacting to the depressing environment, and the alien encounters or characters' deaths have little or no impact on you. Then again, I was always fascinated about the looks of the alien. How it's done, how it moves, and how it's just so damn cool. So the lack of suspense didn't bother me so much. In this film, alien does look great. The close-up shots, where only the upper torso of the alien is seen, are great, just great. It looks great and moves great. ....and now I'm getting to the biggest let-down. I'm not a guy who loves special effects over everything else, but the computer graphics are just UGLY. Sometimes the alien looks like a paper doll glued on a photograph. It looks so bad, and the movement is horrible. These are the scenes where the immersion totally goes away. In the directors' cut there are few scenes which would have been great, but the CG is just so bad it makes me sad. Pretty ironic...you have the best close-ups of the beast in Alien 3, and also the worst computer graphics. Wish the damn thing was done old-fashioned, like Alien or Aliens.Then again, bad CG doesn't change the fact that I have seen this film like 20 times. And that is a lot. There is a lot to enjoy, and the film is very serious. It is a worthy addition to the Alien series, but I hoped it could've been better.Fincher is one of my favorite directors. He was not given enough room or resources with this one, it's clear. My rating is 7 out of 10. A good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How does Ripley get face-hugged?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the introduction of the film we see that there is an alien egg behind a wall with a face-hugger coming out. Technically one face hugger means one alien, right? So how come that in the film we see Ripely discovers she has an alien inside her and the dog getting transformed into an alien, when there is only one egg on the pod.Because that in alien(1) Kane gets infected by the face-hugger and it dies after it implants the egg in his body. So surely this means there must be 2 eggs or 2 face-huggers aboard on the spacecraft, but we only see one. Also in Alien(2) we don't see the queen alien lay any eggs on the aircraft which saves Newt and Ripley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most underrated movie in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: David Fincher, Story: Vincent Ward, Script: David Giler(Producer), Walter Hill (producer), Larry Ferguson, Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Brian Glover, Charles Dance, Charles S. Dutton This film picks up where Aliens left off. This time her ship lands on a planet full of male prisoners. Over the coarse of their time spent on this penal colony, most of the prisoners have converted to some sort of religion and are living like celibate monks. Riply, being the only female on the planet, is a threat to their call for celibacy. One of the Aliens was also transported to the planet from the ship so Ripley tries to get the prisoners to help fight the Alien only for her to discover that she is caring an alien inside her.These Alien movies are kind of interesting to review because each one is so different and fans of the series all have their opinions as to what their favorite one is. Most people vouching for either the first or second. Based on feedback I have read on IMDb, this film doesn't seem to rate as high for most people which is why I had mixed expectations before I saw the film. I have read all the negative reviews but on the other hand David Fincher is a highly praised director. His films are known for being dark, creepy and mysterious with good visuals ie: Se7en. I must say, I was not disappointed. I actually prefer this film to Aliens, the previous. This film is less of on action film (unlike Aliens)and more of a sci-fi horror like the first Alien film. Fincher was able to bring back the horror and mystery that Ridley Scott was able to capture on the first. This film is probably the goriest in the series. Based on how this film ends, the series could have easily ended here. Although I like Alien Resurrection so I'm glad they brought Ripley back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awkward, but brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read reviews of this film that called it one of the worst films ever made. I have to disagree. Alien 3 had a troubled production and considering that the script wasn't even completed halfway through it's intense shoot, director David Fincher crafts a great film in his own original style, against commercial mass audience appeal. Exerything from swapping Director of photography in the middle of the shoot and meddling studio executives caused great stress for Fincher. Despite this, his feature film debut is a grueling, dark masterpiece that is stylish, terrifying and deeply moving. I love the ending, emotional, superb, and once again against audience expectation. A strong performance again from Weaver and supporting cast, i loved Charles Dances' sarcastic doctor, all the rest of the characters are generally undesirable I strongly urge that you view it again, naysayers, it might even grow on you, especially considering that audiences have become more accustomed to finishes dark style since SEVEN, FIGHT CLUB and even PANIC ROOM. Yet i do recommend the Directors cut over the Theatrical cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lot better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people give this movie a bad rating, which on one level I can understand and on another I can't. This movie had the right pace of tension and drama to suit this movie. Alien? was about character build-up, which it did with the first 40-60 minutes, where we learnt history of some of the convicts, doctor and the guys in charge. It's very late in the movie that the alien actually properly appears and starts killing.The acting was quite good with the likes of Charles S. Dutton and Pete Posthlewaite lending in good support, Sigourney Weaver had the chance to no longer have to act the hard-a**ed bitch and instead act more human, seemingly growing close to the Doctor. These help to make Ripley seem the most human I've seen in the series.David Fincher shows us his potential for future movies such as Se7en, The Game and especially Fight Club, all movies that I've enjoyed viewing. My favourite scene that showed his potential was early on when Ripley and the convicts are doing a funeral for Newt and Hicks which is beautiful and moving, contrasting to the inter-cuts of the birth of the alien, and Dutton's characters prayer of new life. Brilliant scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 is an internal experience. It is real life. The innocent die at the most inopportune moments. Where do you go when you have lost everything? It is a question many of us have to face. Ripley has come full circle and she is well aware of her fate. All those who lambast this movie are simply not intelligent enough, or have not lived enough, to grasp the inevitable demise of our heroine. Thats not to say the film does not have its flaws. The studio interference is painfully apparent. The assembly cut is better but it could have been so much more. A fitting end to Ripley.....the only end if we be honest with ourselves.</fullReview>

Aliens was released in 1986 then Alien 3 was released in 1992. In six years don't you think the studio could of came up with a better movie? Yes I know this movie has its fans but I for one am not a fan of long boring movies. There is so maney things wrong with this movie I could go on and on! To save time I will just tell you one of them! We see a fan blade in the background and so the audience knows someone is going to die in that blade! In 2003 FOX released the original cut on DVD of this movie and its just boring as the movie they released in 1992! Also FOX could of saved itself when ALien 4 came out! They could of have Ripley waking up from the nightmare and thus Alien 3 was just her dream! That way we could of had all the survivors form "ALiens" in "Alien 4". Yes I know that is too "Dallas" but Alien 4 wasn't much better than this! Yes David Fincher has gone on to make "Fight Club" "Seven" and "PANIC ROOM" but I think this was his "student movie" and therefore plays like it!</fullReview>

(giggle.) But, to get *to* this point, the viewers have to suffer through about, oh, 500 other scenes that are total crap, the off-camera, totally inconsequential deaths of Hicks and Newt, the shaved-head look for Ripley(conveniently *after* the "magic makeup" sex scene - one shot, they're about to kiss, no makeup, next shot, they're starting in, and *paf*, ripley gets a makeover!) ... enjoy if you can! &lt;/rant&gt;</fullReview>

But, holding courage in disdain, the writers decide to immediately kill of 3 of the 4 survivors of the previous film. As outrageous as this was, they also decide to have the alien "rape" Ripley in her cryo-sleep, thereby negating every victory won with such blood, sacrifice and difficulty in the previous film. From there on, it gets worse. Dark and depressing, this film should never have been written, let alone made. Do yourself a favor and end this series with #2. Alien 3 is one sick film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your ass is already on the line. The only question is, what're you gonna do about it? - Ripley Following the escape from the Alien planet, Ellen Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver - Ghostbusters II) ship comes crashing down on to a maximum security facility killing Newt, Hicks and Bishop leaving her as the sole survivor. Being the only women in an all male secure facility causes issues but nothing compared to when she learns that there was an Alien aboard her ship and that her crash on the planet may not be the accident she first thought. But that is not Ripley's only problem as she once more has to take battle to the Alien but this time without any weapons to use."Alien" was brilliant and "Aliens" was its equal if not better, bucking the trend of sequels usually being poor, but then came "Alien 3" and simply its a dark masterpiece that takes liberties and risks rather than make it more action blockbuster, it goes for a Gothic tone of pure darkness.it's a good movie and the acting is still first rate and in many ways is the best thing about this third Alien movie.Sigourney Weaver once more creates this powerful woman in Ripley but at the same time gives her insecurities making her fascinating to watch especially when she basically flips the switch and takes the battle to the Alien. And whilst Weaver is the star of "Alien 3" the supporting performances which includes Charles Dance, Charles S. Dutton, Brian Glover and Pete Postlethwaite do not disappoint, creating interesting characters that whilst may not get a lot of screen time are more than just cardboard cut outs.A iconic climax, all things considered, combining a clever plan, high action, an unexpected twist, and a couple of keen visuals. See the directors cut to appreciate its vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I know I'm bit of a "late bloomer," but I just started watching the Alien franchise. the first one, A lien, was fantastic. Definitely one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen. Or, at least I thought. The second one, Aliens was fantastic as well. If I may even go as far as saying, and being bold, better than the first one. So, to my delight then, I was very much looking forward to Alien 3. However, this was a different director than the first two, which both had different directors as well. So, I thought maybe this will still be a great movie. I was wrong. I literally got less than halfway through the movie and I turned it off. It had no storyline, no characters you care about (with the exception of Sigourney Weaver), and really nothing interesting going on. So, you've been warned. Watch the first two, skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has crashed landed on the penal colony. Sand roars around the prison as they take her, a little girl and a badly damaged android back to their habitat. Amongst the wreckage, something is scurrying around, it leaps on unsuspecting dog, and wraps itself around on breeding with the dog to create a new nearly stoppable alien. An alien that will take the prisoners out one by one.Alien 3 is infamous for having 6 scripts written and redrafted for it; the result is of all of those scripts Frankensteined together, and it's more than evident. The film feels aimless, if there was no Alien, nothing would have happened this entire 112 minutes. Also with having too many cooks, we left with these contrived predicaments. This is a penal colony without weapons? Clearly in an universe where Aliens like this exist wouldn't make sense to arm prisoners so that you don't lose out on your huge investment? Then the religious aspect mixed with the genetic syndrome of the men; like to make them all mentally hindered and give no exposition why they were sent to work for a corporation is frustrating. Also to have one non-XXY doctor adds to that bafflement. The conclusion is equally bewildering, I don't want to have a spoiler warning, but my God could they have come up with an easier way to bring the film to an end.David Fincher will hopefully never direct a film that is as ugly as this one. Brown close, brown sets, brown filters, brown terrain, brown, brown, brown. Also the CGI of the alien, and I am being literal here, makes it look like a turd. The lack of budget for the Alien itself means that the cast interact with the alien in B-movie style, almost comparable to a kids' show that throw a teddy at the presenter and have them wrestle with it. Editing is atrocious as well; cut to first person view alien, cut of over shoulder of prisoner, repeat, rinse, wash.Then there is the acting. You have this great cast that of character actors and a noticeable face beloved for the previous installments in the franchise, and they do nothing. Dialogue is boring and the delivery is clumsy to boot. fincher clearly doesn't give the actors context to the scene so they just deliver the script as is, also their reactions are hilarious, being attacked by the alien brings on some sort of relief like sensation followed by a twitch if I am not mistaken.The only thing that is redeemable, and this is really just for the nerds, is to watch the film and read the entire history of the project, see where bits and bobs of each previous rendition of this film were added and see if you can pick them out. I nerded out for the first hour but the last 50 minutes are so incomprehensible that I should have just turned it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad idea; this is a downer that's hard to shake off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By this point, Ripley's pretty much clinched the Can't-Catch-An-Effing-Break award. Terrorized in two different movies, misses out on motherhood, gets blamed for trashing company equipment, loses an adoptive daughter in a meaningless death . . . Thus begins "Alien?", for better or worse. I will say the killing off of Newt and Hicks - callous though it certainly was, regardless of script necessity - was a ballsy move. Takes cojones to spit on previous work like that. But in any case, all I'm able to see here is how much better the preceding movies are. Nevermind the plot hole with how the egg got onto the Sulaco in the first place, this is just an unbelievably dull movie. The drab color palette doesn't help, and Sigourney Weaver just sleepwalks through the entire thing. Fincher throws in some style with the camera angles, but with that thing growing inside our heroine, this movie's got nihilist written all over it. And not the fun kind. It's just a bad story and flies in the face of the series, thus far. This is awful.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes indeed it is. Quite how Jim got away with it I'm unsure. If you watch it and you can't see it then I suppose he did. Perhaps if you would imagine it as a cartoon then it will fall into place easier. Sure the special effects are amazing and the action is up to the usual Cameron standard (maybe not as edge of the seat as Aliens) but I found it predictable and clichd throughout. I suppose the hype surrounding its release helped it strike a chord with the general film goer and die hard sci-fi enthusiast like me. But I'd hazard a guess that most avid sci-fi readers found it a bit dull and long too. I do wish movie makers would take more care with the genre. 'Interstellar' is a good recent example of this caring attitude. In addition, there are so many wonderful sci-fi books that would make watchable and intellectual movies. Unfortunately most movie makers have turned the genre into an excuse to tear up and destroy just about every major city on earth, or blast off into space and proceed to exterminate the ugly aliens. Or in Avatars case, encourage us to ponder on the politically incorrect elimination of the 'indigenous' population. I certainly won't be spending 15 bucks to see Avatar II. Regardless, it will probably be a resounding hit with the weekly popcorn munchers anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Utterly wrongheaded, misconceived, poorly executed continuation of "Aliens" has Ripley's ship jettisoning her to, of all places, a penal colony of hardened criminals, where she is the only woman. Of course, an Alien has inexplicably(not only caused the destruction of the Sulaco) but survived there as well, and Ripley must convince the prisoners that they have to fight this menace, one last time...Trouble is, I was one of those who balked at how stupidly, callously, and heartlessly Newt and Hicks were dispatched, so that Ripley could be alone in such an unpleasant, foul-mouthed and soul-dead film as this; why did Sigourney Weaver sign on? Visually ugly and utterly contrived and pointless, it is only her sincere performance that saves the film from complete ruin...not the way I wanted to see Ellen Ripley sign off!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third 'alien' movie. The first one is a classic sci-fi horror movie. The second is a action movie with sci-fi. This is a sci-fi movie, and that's it. The story isn't taking us anywhere, and seems a way to close the trilogy, without any highlights. It's just a movie about Ripley, some inmates and a alien-dog. The twist is so obvious that some may get in the first flashes. The funny thing is that special effects on first movie (1979) still look great today, in this movie (1992) the use of a computerized alien-dog just seems B movie material nowadaysWatch to see a Alien movie, don't watch thinking about the quality of the first two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disappointment. Aliens 3 is a continuation of the original Aliens and Aliens 2.At the beginning of Aliens 3, it appears the story will easily continue from the prior Alien film. Ripley portrayed the character Ripley in a move timide fashion then the prior versions of the film. Sigourney Weaver perform her roll of Ripley like Alien and Alien 2 never existed. How can Ripley be so brave in the prior Alien films and present herself so clueless in Alien 3. I enjoyed the story however if anyone associated with the film reads this, remember Ripley survived because she fights the Alien then escapes. Why would the director in Aliens 3 make Ripley something other than a strong females soldier with first hand knowledge on how to kill the Alien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of ALL Alien movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as a movie releases a sequel then their makers are catering to fans of the previous film. Nothing wrong with that. Look at what Jim Cameron did in ALIENS, who many swear is the best part of the series (I slightly prefer the brooding original). ALIEN 3 picks up right after ALIENS ends; remember that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) survives the brutal attack of not only one Alien monster, but many of them, including their Alien Queen. Ripley goes through hell trying to save Newt, a ten year old girl who is the only survivor of a human colony on the alien planet and one that reminds her of her daughter. So ALIENS ends with Ripley saving the newt, Corporal Hicks and Bishop, an android. They enter into hyper sleep hoping some company ship will pick them up. When ALIEN 3 begins we see shuttle carrying Ripley and the rest of the survivors crashing down into a planet that serves as a prison for the worst scum earth has to offer. Dead are Hicks, Newt and Bishop, which is a bummer because it renders all the agony, pain and hell Ripley went through to save Newt and the crew in ALIENS pointless. So much for nothing! It's nice when a movie dares to be bleak and uncommercial, but like I said at the beginning of this review: if you're making a sequel you are catering to fans of previous films. While nicely made, ALIEN 3 is a throwback to ALIEN (the first movie) in the sense that director David Fincher tries to make a very claustrophobic atmosphere within the prison. As is to be expected, Ripley, who survives the crash, befriends the prison doctor but is not willing to tell him what terror her ship might have brought to the prison colony. As with the first movie, this time we only have one Alien creature. The last 30 minutes of the movie are a cross between the original Alien and Friday The 13th. To this day, I don't have the slightest idea why the Alien creature kills. It doesn't eat its prey (although one scene apparently wants to address this particular point), and none of the prisoners is taken to be cocooned. The FX of the Alien moving and running through the prison hallways have dated massively. It's obviously a CGI creature and a regular effect during the close ups.David Fincher did a good job considering what he had in his hands. ALIEN 3 went through development hell, hiring many writers and it shows. Despite Fincher's abilities, ALIEN 3 is neither the roller-coaster ride of Jim Cameron's ALIENS nor the brooding and immensely frightening Ridley Scott original. To make things worse, there is an alternate ending, although I much prefer the original theatrical release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ALIEN 3 Fails to Live Up to Franchise Standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to enjoy this movie more than I did. The original ALIEN remains one of my absolute favorite movies and the sequel, ALIENS, is still one of James Cameron's best films in my opinion. It's just a shame that the third installment couldn't continue with the same success. From everything I've read and seen, David Fincher's film was plagued with any and all possible obstacles that could possibly befall it, which contributed to the resulting mundane film. Multiple rewrites, budget issues, and crew changes nearly destroyed the film before it was ever completed, but credit is still due to David Fincher and his editor Terry Rawlings for creating a something cohesive out of all the trouble. The film begins at an undetermined amount of time after the events of ALIENS, in which an electrical fire aboard the Sulaco ejects Ripley's cryotube in an escape pod, stranding her on the planet Fiorina 161 (or Fury 161). The planet is a maximum security men's work correctional facility where the prisoners have accepted religion and are less than thrilled to have a woman wandering amongst them. Their differences are soon forgotten as Ripley discovers that an egg had stowed away aboard the escape pod and there is now an alien picking off the colony population one by one.I appreciate the fact the Fincher and the writers attempted to get back to the roots of the franchise, relying on suspenseful horror instead of action (not that Cameron's action approach was in any way unsatisfying, because it rocked). For whatever reason, this film just fell flat. The first half kept the pace with Ripley integrating into the prison population and investigating clues that she may have had a stowaway, then the arrival of the alien in it's usual gruesome manner. As soon as the initial attacks are over, the film slows to a crawl while the surviving prisoners frequently huddle together and plan how to capture or destroy the creature. Sadly, the final act suffers just as well when the prisoner's plan to kill the creature comes to fruition in a lengthy chase sequence.Sigourney Weaver, of course, reprises her role as Ellen Ripley and continues to grow stronger in the role. The best supporting cast are also, sadly, some of the shortest-lived: Charles Dance (as the colony's medical officer Clemens) and Brian Glover (as superintendent Andrews). The deaths of the characters were necessary to place the prisoners in a leader-less situation so I can understand why, but it still would've been nice to get some more of Charles Dance in the film. Unfortunately, with the exception of Charles S. Dutton, the rest of the cast blends together into a sea of shaved heads and it becomes incredibly difficult at points (particularly those of high action) to distinguish who is who. Despite it's flaws, the film has it's moments and the performances manage to keep it afloat. It's just sad that the end to the official Alien "trilogy" had to end on such a flat note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ALIEN 3 is bad, but had promising ideas...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien3, although a somewhat messy script, killing off Clemens (Charles Dance) far too early and the appalling cgi alien effects....I must say that this movie does have some soul and substance, however little... i loved the concept of the prison and the crazy prisoners seeking redemption at the 'ass end of space' as ripley puts it.The movie looks and feels very different to the previous two, having the sepia tint instead of the constant claustrophobic shadowy sets of the first two movies. Opening it up in what feels like much bigger set pieces.Dillon (played by Charles S. Dutton) was excellent, probably the only fully realised character in the whole movie, with some real emotion and depth.Ripley was very different, and inconsistent at times, one minute the fighting machine we know her to be, the next minute she's sexual and feminine. Don't know if the ripley in the previous 2 movies, after all shes endured would just hop into bed so quickly with the first guy who happens to be nice to her.Overall, I actually do like this movie, and obviously I'm sure that's due to the incredible talent that is David Fincher who had the impossible task of rescuing a doomed movie thanks to the money hungry producers Gordon Carroll, David Giler, Walter Hill who know NOTHING about ART?. They are the real reason why this movie ended up being such a mess. (watch the making of documentary on the special edition DVD and you'll see what I mean). May i also say i think it's disgusting how they treated Giger (the genius behind the design and look of the Alien and also the alien planet from the first movie). The Producers (who also wrote the crappy sequels that didn't work) at Fox are vile and are the sole reason the franchise has turned to 'crud'.To all those who hate Alien3, you should watch it again from a fresh perspective, if you think this is bad you should see Alien Resurrection and the Alien V Predator movies. So bad it hurts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 is the 3rd installment in the Alien series. The original, Alien, is one of the best sci fi/horror films ever made and its sequel, Aliens, although no where near the quality of the original, is a good film. Alien 3, however, is a bad film, a very bad one.Sigourney Weaver returns in her role as Ellen Ripley. This film starts where Aliens left off with Ripley, little girl Newt, Corporal Hicks, and Bishop the android in cryogenic stasis. The pod crashes on Fiorina 161 which is a mining facility and penal colony. Every criminal there is male and each one has "double-Y" chromosome patterns which supposedly accounts for their criminal behavior. Ripley is rescued but everyone else in the pod was killed. The inmates all believe in a religion that forbids sex and now Ripley, a woman, is suddenly thrown into their world. The facility's doctor warns that her presence may be disturbing to the men.An alien bursts out of dog's body and attacks the colony. Ripley leads the battle against the other aliens who soon appear.Supposedly, Weaver wanted nothing to do with the project and her lack of enthusiasm shows. Micheal Biehn, from Aliens, was so upset by this film that he demanded, and received, a huge amount of money to permit an image of him to be used in the film. Likewise, director James Cameron hated this film and was really upset by the ending.Supposedly director Fincher was called late into the project and there are rumors of studio meddling. Still, his name is on the film and he has to take responsibility for this mess.In the end, Alien 3 is just another lousy sequel made in order to cash in on the success of the original Alien film. Skip this film and see the original instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a worthy sequel... but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, the movie starts off with a few brief scenes on the Sulaco. There's an Alien egg there (what?! how?!). The facehugger which hatches cuts itself on glass (I thought even the facehuggers had a bit of intelligence!) leaks acid, and starts a fire. The Sulaco's computer doesn't even attempt any kind of fire-suppression (where are the sprinklers?) and quickly ejects the hypersleep pods in an emergency escape vehicle.The EEV, apparently without any means of propulsion, crash-lands on Fiorina "Fury" 161 (come on! It's an escape pod, but it should have *some* means of propusion or a way of making successful planetfall).Newt and Hicks are killed. Bishop is severely damaged. Barely ten minutes into the movie, and a huge chunk of "Aliens" (in particular, the rescue of Newt) has been effectively wiped away. Don't worry, by the end, the rest will be, too.With such a dismal beginning, the movie actually picks up. The premise, an all-male prison facility where the inmates have "found God", is weird, but workable.The Alien has to be there, of course. A facehugger impregnates a dog (or an ox, if you watch the Assembly Cut), which in itself is impossible, since it had already impregnated Ripley on the Sulaco, and hence should be dead. That, or there were *two* eggs on the Sulaco, which is twice as ridiculous as the idea that there were any at all.The rest of the movie basically deals with trying to capture/destroy the alien, and eliciting the wary prisoners' help to do so. All the while, communications from the Company indicate that they want the Alien and are coming as fast as possible to get it.Ripley has been impregnated with a queen embryo (how'd that happen, anyway?), and becomes resigned to her fate when she finds out.The latter portion of the movie works pretty well, although there are notable plot holes and problems with pacing (some of which are corrected in the Assembly Cut).(Mostly) good visuals, a few jokes, (way too many) motivational speeches, and good old-fashioned gore at the hands of the Alien keep the movie going.After the Alien is killed (after having survived being covered with molten lead? These things are tough, but come on!) Ripley must make the ultimate sacrifice. With Company personnel urging her to come with them, and (not all that convincing) promises that the Alien embryo will be removed and destroyed, and that Ripley can still have a life, she makes the choice to destroy the Alien... and herself along with it.This moment makes the movie worthwhile, though just barely.The movie itself is good. Not great, but good enough. It does not, however, fit in with the previous Alien movies. A huge chunk of "Aliens" (especially the rescue of Newt) is effectively erased to make this movie happen. And one can't deny that if Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop had all died back on LV-426 in the middle of "Aliens", we'd have essentially the same end result, minus a few deaths on Fury 161.The movie thus sets itself to be ultimately pointless. Ripley's final sacrifice doesn't carry the same impact when you realize that if she'd just died *earlier*, things would have actually been *better*.In my mind, there are only two true Alien movies, those being Ridley Scott's original and James Cameron's sequel."Alien 3" is perfectly enjoyable, if you don't consider it in terms of the series. It's paradoxical, since the movie *needs* the previous two as its set-up, but works much better if one doesn't think about them.I won't comment on the problems Fincher has with this movie, but I'll just say that out of that mess came something palatable. Don't think too much about the previous two movies when watching this one, and *certainly* don't think about this one when watching the previous two. If you can do that, you should be able to enjoy it."Good enough" is my rating, 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILERS - Some weak areas and some strong areas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People ventured into this movie expecting the same level of action as Aliens. Many were expecting multiple aliens and lots of surprises. Some were even expecting an adventure with the surviving cast of Aliens. The movie did not deliver on these expectations.It should be clearly stated that Alien, Aliens and Alien 3 are claustrophobic tales that make you feel incredibly uneasy, tense and scared throughout. Alien 3 does exactly that and it delivers. David did an amazing job putting this film together considering the circumstances around the production. He directed the characters very well and you suffer with Ripley when she jumps into the pit. The acting is powerful and stands up to the other two films!Weak areas: The alien in Alien 3 is a different type than that on the other two aliens. David Fincher should have put more effort into revealing the differences between the types of aliens. It is not very clear and because of this his movie bares too much of a similarity to the first film.The reason Aliens did so well is because Cameron made it an action movie rather than a horror movie. We all knew how 1 alien looked like from the first movie, so he threw in MANY aliens along with a scary surprise (The queen alien). The action in Alien 3 was somewhat limited compared to the second one. It did not have many surprises to share aside from the faster DOG alien. The Special Edition was excellent as it included an awesome alien birth sequence (from an OX). The sequence clearly shows how this monster is very different from the others. It also briefly reveals the Super Face Hugger for the first time. These elements should have been kept in and I don't know why it was left out.For those of you interested, I'll mention this now: I liked Aliens the most. Alien comes in a VERY close 2nd place. Alien 3 comes in at 3rd place and Alien Resurrection comes in at a very distant 4th place.</fullReview>

One of my favorite moments in film of all time was when the alien goes up to ripley and does nothing. Or when the Alien First attacks and boggs get covered with blood.

		<shortDescription>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Alien 3" is the third of four films based on the alien theme starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This one was filmed in the UK and was directed by David Fincher. At the close of "Aliens" (1986) Ripley escapes the alien attacks along with the little girl "Newt" and Cpl. Hicks and what's left of the android Bishop. "Alien 3" opens as the shuttle carrying them separates from the mother ship and lands on, of all places, a penal colony. Only Ripley survives and Bishop is relegated to the garbage. Ripley discovers that she is the only female on the colony. She is befriended and ultimately bedded by the colony doctor, Clemens (Charles Dance). She begins to suspect that there may have been a stowaway aboard her shuttle. She hooks up the remains of Bishop (Lance Henriksen) and learns that indeed one of the alien creatures had been aboard. Then the carnage starts. One by one the convicts begin to disappear. The rest organize under Dillon (Charles S. Dutton) and with Ripley set about to destroy the creature. And as luck would have it, there are no weapons in the colony. Blood and guts literally abound in this movie. Rather than build the suspense as the two previous films had done, this one is wall to wall violence. It's sort of a Friday the 13th in outer space. Mind you it is well done if you like gratuitous violence. Director Fincher does save a couple of surprises for us at the end. It's another of Ripley's Believe It or Not adventures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give it a chance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say you all should give this underrated film a chance. The saga goes something like this. Alien started the surival/sci-fi/horror genre. It got the genre on its feet and helped kick-start cinema away from zombie-horrors and killer-horrors. It should not be classed as sci-fi alone. Aliens started the sci-fi action. Absolutely no trace of horror is present. It used more aliens and a much more aggressive attribute. Now, on to Alien 3. Alien 3 used CGI. It may not have looked very good, but this was 1992. It was obviously meant to conclude the trilogy in one big swoop.It made this effect very well, but unfortunately was contradicted by Resurrection. For the sake of this review, please ignore resurrection completely! Alien 3 used a completely new style of presenting the Alien. And, although a few plot holes are pleasant, it was a feasible opening.===Warning, Spoilers Ahead!==&gt; An alien facehugger has stored itself on Ripley's ship. It wakes up, and causes technical difficulties on the ship, causing Ripley and friends to be ejected to destination unknown. Ripley finds herself here in a new surrounding. It is not immediately clear what is going to happen to her, until we learn more about where she is. Alien 3 studies more views of the Alien. Alien saw us watching a group of spacemen and a single bureaucratic company agent witnessing the horrors of the alien. Aliens saw the military witnessing, and taking actions against the alien. Alien 3 sees the reaction of civilians, or rather, prisoners. These prisoners have not seen much more than each other for a long time, and are doubtful of this interloper at first. Led by the strong 'Dillon', wonderfully played by Charles S. Dutton, they take on a fundamentalist religion. As the inmates are slowly killed off, they all become more doubtful of their religion and began to take more drastic measures to ensure their survival. This evolves into a wonderfully apocalyptic showdown between Ripley and the Alien, and, nearing the end we see a familiar shadow of government greed, adding another side to the film and it's implication.It's not a bad film, but Alien: Resurrection is. Believe in this film, and forget about resurrection.It'll make a lot more sense!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is beyond me why so many reviewers highly praise Cameron's Aliens and bash this one. I liked the set design of Aliens, but that is about it. Otherwise, it took away the most interesting premise of Alien, namely the fact that the creature is indestructible by conventional means and leaves everyone pit against it utterly hopeless. In Aliens a burst from a Marine's M16 (woo hoo, go USA) kills half a dozen of them. It felt like "Dumbed-down Alien meets Arnold Schwarzenegger". In Alien 3 we're back to the original idea of one single, nearly indestructible creature against the fears of a group of people. I much prefer this approach which allows for a type of heroism that doesn't look like a caricature of the Gulf War(s).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ALIEN 3 is difficult to explain, but I feel I should put in a good word for it. Being a highly visual person, I tend to veer towards pretty movies, instead of movies with character depth. Some might see this as shallow, but it's just the way I am. Not to say I don't care for Ripley or Newt or Hicks - they are GREAT characters. I consider ALIENS to be perfectly done (10/10).When I was young, I used to watch this movie all the time, and it was the first of the ALIEN series that I viewed. Since I've grown to undertand movies on a little bit of a deeper level now, it seems like ALIEN 3 still holds up. I consider ALIEN 3 to have the COOLEST OPENING CREDITS OF ALL TIME. So stylistic, so gothic, so sad. But COOL. The rest of the movie is pretty intense and will have you seeing orange the entire last half. I really don't think David Fincher could have done any better with this storyline. ALIEN 3 reminds us that even the greatest triumphs (Newt's rescue and the destruction of the Queen) always turn into the endless sadness that the universe is basically made of. Plus, it really does bring closure to the story by Ripley making the ultimate sacrifice in order to save thousands.7 / 10 for sure! A very decent effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much potential...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In light of the first 2 Alien movies (both of which are in IMDB's top 100), Alien 3 is a huge disapointment. The characters seem poorly developed, the action is stale, and in the end, our heroine plunges to her death, presumably killing the chance for any sequels (boy, they should have listened... "Alien: Resurrection" should have never been made). However, David Fincher, a director who's proved his potential with "Seven" and "Fight Club", knew exactly what kind of movie he was trying to make. Executives at Fox cut out nearly an hour of his final movie, so much so that he didn't even want his name attributed to the final project. The film had the potential to be great (check out the list of deleted scenes on the message board sometime) but due to studio interference, came out as less than mediocre. *** SPOILERS *** On the bright side, Sigourney Weaver's at her toughest, dealing with the loss of the girl she thought of as her daughter and the news that she's carrying the next alien queen in her chest (another slightly confusing aspect that the shortened film didn't address). Lawrence Fishborne gives a characteristically strong performance, and the alien looks better in this film than in any other movie of the series (the first 2 films showed very little of the creatures themselves; Resurrection's CGI often looked plain ridiculous). In the end, this is a film directed not by David Fincher, but by Fox. I can't wait to see the director's cut due out in June to see the potential that this film should have lived up to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's because this was the first 'Alien' movie I saw, and I saw in the cinema, but it's my favourite of the series. The music, the action, the direction and the acting are terrific. Ripley is tougher and she's more interesting as well. Her character really develops in this one.After this one, Alien is second best. I like Aliens least, contrary to popular opinion. Alien Resurrection is also terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piotr St. says: Pink Floyd - "Animals"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On March 24, 1973, Pink Floyd blew the roof off the dump with their greatest album to date, "The Dark Side Of The Moon", one of the most inspiring, powerful and classic albums of the whole rock history. On September 15, 1975, they did something no one expected: they came with an album, being almost exact continuation of Dark Side..., but with a few changes in style (long, constructed compositions as opposed to short songs from TDSOTM) "Wish You Were Here", also considered as classical. However, nothing happens twice, and their successor, "Animals", presented to the audience on January 23, 1977, was a good, solid album, but didn't stand comparison to its precedessors.OK, but what about Alien?It's almost the same story. In 1979, "Alien" blasted everybody right into Space: incredibly challenging meteor, still standing incredibly fresh even now. In 1986, a continuation appeared, James Cameron's "Aliens". Once again, this was not a direct continuation (it couldn't be! NOW we all knew how Alien exactly look like, so the suspense of the first one was gone; now there were the only unknown thing - when, where and how aliens attack; and we had dozens of monsters instead of one and a bunch of marines instead of simply workers), but was also good as f**k.But you can't have three masterpieces in a row, and Alien 3 simply couldn't outclass its precedessors, or even be equal to them. This might be caused by rather large changes the producers made to the original film (and mediocre level of "Animals" might be considered as a result of Roger Waters' autocratic domination on the Floyds). However, it stands pretty well, with its grimy, claustrophobic atmosphere and industrial settings. I have to admit I like this one, despite its faults (major bullshit: persons of YY chromosomes! An explanation: These are two types of human chromosomes, X and Y. Women have an XX combination, while men have XY. However, X chromosome is the only one that carries all features; Y doesn't carry anything, so the person having an YY couldn't exist because ovarium would ALWAYS give an X chromosome; and if even, by some very rare and strange mutation, such combination would appear, it would die immediately after conception).7/10 (The Floyd-Alien similarities end here; the next Floydian slip, "The Wall", was a masterpiece; the next movie doesn't.)</fullReview>

I'm sad to say that everyone who was on the crash died but Ripley. But, Ripley wasn't alone on the crash. Something followed her on the prison and is killing all the inmates. I think this movie receives way too much hate from critics. I didn't like the movie as much as the other two, but really, how can you compare with the other two? There aren't many 3rd films that are better than both the others, but you can't judge it by that. Overall a decent film, not as good as the others but who cares?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While many have villified this film for being disappointing after high expectations, personally I loved it. After Aliens took the saga in a high tech, shoot-em-up direction, Fincher decided to change it up and take it back to its roots where it was more human vs. alien instead of humans with huge guns vs. alot of aliens. I found this film to be much more personal and to me it translated very well from screen to audience. Fincher's aggressive style played well into the story, and its my personal favorite of the saga, well, maybe Alien is a little better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David's most underrated film......[Possible Spoilers]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien3 is a film both wonderful and maddening. Wonderful as it, being the third one in a very famous series and following its ''classic'' brothers, manages to entertain and has an intriguing quality to it as well. Maddening, in that it sometimes has awkward directorial flourishes and has flat scenes balanced with tremendously good ones that make you wonder if this could have been the best in the series. In my opinion, this is the second best in the series[after the original, which IS a masterpiece of the cinema] and the most moody. The alien is the most convincing in this entry[The fourth entries aliens didn't seem to movie in a lifelike manner and seemed blatantly CGI] and Weaver gives her best performance in the entire saga. You see the weariness in her eyes as she faces the creature for the third time and her pain of loss. The third has the best cinematography in the movie: some scenes are shot with this hellish-feeling amber hue that really gets the atmosphere across. The now-classic moment where the alien has Ripley against the wall in the infirmary and seems to nuzzle her is the most disturbing moment in the whole series because its reaction is not what we expect. David Finchers' take on the series is not what we expect either: instead of a guns'n'action movie like the second, or a masterful scare-fest like the first, we get a somber, thoughtful entry that must have been a surprise to some[too surprising in fact as the film was loathed upon release]. He paces the film like a death march[which is what it turns out to be] and has Ripley lose everything she held dear. Some people hated the movie for killing off Hicks and the girl, Newt but I think it is quite daring that Fincher dared to do this. This sets up Ripleys' anguish and allows Weaver to fully develop her character while preparing for the characters possible demise. The ending is very striking and and Elliot Goldenthals music is perfect for the scene, it tugs at your heartstrings. His dark, religious sounding score played over the opening credits really sets the tone. But the film isn't all perfection; the movie's characters seem to have a problem with the English language. They scream profanities at every oppurtunity. This separates us from their characters which are sometimes hard to identify with. Weavers' character swears the most in this one; she also likes to talk in metaphors[''It's like a lion, it likes to stay close to the zebras.'']. But her new character flourishes give the movie its intriguing quality, one quality that stays till the end. People take for granted what Fincher did for this movie. He went in a new direction and got shot down[happens a lot in Hollywood]. This is his most underrated film[after 'The Game' which is surely Finchers masterpiece] and one in the most need of rediscovery........Now............8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS I didn't really become the avid Alien fan that I am now until a year or so ago, when I finally went out and rented all four Alien movies and watched them in sequential order, one after the other. My initial reaction to the first was a stunned awe. The second, while not as good, was still a decent film. But when the credits rolled for the third Alien, I was left with mixed emotions. The art design for the movie is nice. The warm orange of the prison interiors are creepy and give a nice atmospheric effect. The design of the Alien is a nice change, the improvements much better than the changed Aliens in the second. The concept of the Alien inheriting some of the genetic traits of its host is very intriguing. Despite all of these attributes however, the movie is very hard to enjoy. The death of all of the surviving characters (minus Ripley, of course) in the very beginning of the movie immediately prejudiced my feelings towards the rest. My views on the movie didn't improve after watching the particularly gruesome scenes. Examples of these are Newt's autopsy (this scene isn't extremely gory, but the quick shots and disturbing sounds are plenty to feed an active imagination), a prisoner being diced by a giant fan, a character who had potential, Clemens, having his skull crushed with plenty of blood. Yuck. Many of the emotional scenes are not nearly as dramatic as they could have been, and the action scenes are too few and too short. The film is interesting to watch, and is definitely different from the first two, but the plot is too flawed and confusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminally Under-appreciated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where does one begin to defend a movie so loathed by the general populace? Even I initially despised this film for reasons i now consider somewhat ignorant and close-minded. For starters, Many viewed this film coming down from the non-stop adrenaline rush that was Jim Cameron's Aliens, a film very far removed from the original '79 classic. The biggest problem i had with Aliens was Cameron all but threw out the original ideas Ridley Scott and his crew had concieved, even turning H.R Gieger's elegant and terrifying creature into an armored war - machine, good only for quick scares and cannon fodder. On the other hand Cameron introduced some great supporting characters in the form of Hicks and Newt. Before Alien 3 was announced, an independant Comic Book publisher named Dark Horse Comics published a sequel to Cameron's "Aliens" in comic book form. In this story Hicks and Newt become the central characters, and the tone becomes much closer to that of the original film. Ripley's presence is felt in the form of a metaphorical ghost, while not directly appearing, the mystery of her whereabouts and circumstances of her dissapearence following the events of the film Aliens lend purpose to the characters of the book, which brings us at last to Alien 3. Fincher took the road least expected, bringing the series back to its roots following the success of the second film, this move alone damned the film as far as i'm concerned. The explosion and saturation of the second film into popular culture ensured that it would go down as a classic, while the first film remained a cult-status masterpiece, and thus the vast majority of film-goers were watching the third outing from the James Cameron perspective rather than the Ridley Scott one.Where Fincher succeeds is in the bleak, desolate imagining of Fury 151, a male penal colony located on a planet about as pleasant as hell on earth. The pacing, mood, atmosphere and even simple things like Fincher's use of sound in the film add to the frightening nature, the opening alone, with it's dead quiet-sudden rush of flame-dead quiet-sudden alarm etc. sets a frightening note to start on, leaving us in bewilderment as to what's actually going on, quick little glimpses and the voice of a computer are used so effectively in evoking panic. This tactic works well throughout the film, even in it's slow moments, oftentimes tricking or manipulating the viewer, sometimes with false alarms, sometimes not. Fincher also digs a little deeper than even Ridley Scott did into the drama inherent in the Ripley character, the tradgedy surrounding her, and how she and the alien share a bond in a sense, much to her dismay. The tension and drama all add up to an incredible sequence near the end when the inmates struggle to lure the Alien into a lead press. The frenetic pacing, after such a slow build up, works very effectively.Where Fincher et al go wrong, is in their use of characters, for reasons i figure had more to do with executive politics and the availability of certain actors than with plot or storyline, Hicks and Newt are mercilessly killed off during the opening sequence. This reeks to me of "Michael Bihen is unavailable." or "'fill in the blank' doesnt want Michael or Carrie back again... lets off 'em" rather than "Lets make it even more tragic, lets have Ripley lose those she cares most for". To be fair, Lance Henrikson does make an appearance as the ruined android Bishop, as well as a poorly concieved and poorly handled appearance as the company scientist on whom "Bishop" was based. If George Lucas ever went ahead and did Star Wars 7, and un-ceremoniuosly killed off Han and Leia in the opening sequence, you get the equivalent of Alien 3. I think it's this 'detachment' from the second film which really ruins it for many and not so much the return to a darker, moodier setting. This series was not about Ripley at one point, sure she was a survivor and all, but she was a piece of the whole, and this film strips away some of her charm by elevating her to 'sole character' status, which also kills a lot of her likeability as far as i'm concerned. Alien: Ressurection proved this even further in my opinion, completely destroying the character created by Scott, and expanded upon by Cameron and even Fincher. The other inmates of the prison should have been given a tighter focus, and the most interesting of the lot (the doctor) should not have been one of the first to be killed off.In all Fincher assembles a noble film every bit as good as its predecessors, however it is a film which must be viewed on it's own merits, one must put Cameron's Aliens as far back into his mind as possible. I would wonder how much better recieved this film would have been if only Ripley and Bishop had made it onto the Sulaco at the end of Aliens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come on guys - it's quite a good film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the original 'Alien', Cameron had a hell of a job to try and better Scott. He did it though. So, newcomer David Fincher faced the most impossible task ever - to try and better 'Aliens'.It was, and still is, hated by critics and fans alike when it was released. To be fair, I was one of them, but, in hindsight, I don't think enough credit is payed towards this film. I actually quite like it.Lets take the original - a cast of 7, huuuuuuuge spaceship, and very limited, if any, weapons, and 1 Alien.2nd film - massive cast so there's enough prey for the Aliens, confined spaces, LOADS of weapons, and MILLIONS of Aliens (including the Queen!)The 3rd? it borrows the massive cast from the 2nd. throws them all together in a huuuuuuge facility, and due to the fact that it's a colony of prisoners that the action takes place in, there are no weapons really, and there's only one Alien.So do the math - 1 Alien in a huuuuuuge place with loadsa guys with no weapons? This is a good premise to a film. This situation throws everyone in off the deep end, and they all have to improvise with whatever they have to hunt and kill the Alien. Cunning, intelligence, team work etc.This film does the franchise justice, and to be quite frank, the franchise SHOULD have ended here!!! For God's sake, the ending was trying to end it here!!! It was a suitable epilogue for a great franchise.Ripley of course in this installment has crash-landed in a prison. ALL MALE POPULATED too I should add!!! Oh yes, AND, she's pregnant, but not by Hicks, (cos they never got it on! Shame really!) by a face hugger, which layed an egg in her and it just happens to be the 'bitch' herself - the Queen!! So add this factor to the math, and we have a time limit before Ripley's chest explodes and all hell breaks loose....Nice!! With all this in mind, Weaver develops Ripley's character even further, and I don't see what there's not to like... ...Of course, if you were to look at the pacing of the film, this is where it goes slightly wrong. It lacks the pace of the 2nd film, and maybe this is why people were thrown by this film.But you have to admit, for Fincher to have come out of nowhere and have a chance to direct this film, you have to give him some credit!!! look at the films he's gone on to make - Fight Club, Se7en - he obviously had a good vision for this 'episode'.He keeps the tone of the earlier films - it's moodily shot in the dark. The atmospheric oppression in the prison is very thick. Shadows everywhere. And there are some terrifying moments to be had. AND!!! This Alien is a slightly new breed due to the fact that it was created from a dog.So, I am defending this film. I think it could have been better yes, but it could have been a hell of a lot WORSE!!!6/10Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third installment is often refered to as the worst in the Alien franchise. The film is dark, serious, dramatic, and emotional. In other words, it lacks the wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am action of the second film, and it's missing the suspense and mystery of the first movie. But just because it's different does NOT mean it's bad. In fact, the dramatic tone of this film is exactly why I thought it was just as good, if not better than the first two. The only flaw with the film is that it kills off two of the survivors of Aliens right away. Anyone who goes from watching Aliens right into Alien3 will be upset that the people they came to care about in Aliens are suddenly dead--after living through the excitement of the last film. Once I was over my disappointment, however, I became enthralled with the tone and atmosphere of this movie. Directed by David Fincher (who later directed "The game" and "Fight Club,") the film is extremely moody. It's dark, somewhat amber-tinted, and very quiet. There are no guns and no aliens leaping around frantically.Is this such a bad thing? Did people expect to see Aliens2 instead of Alien 3? I liked the fact that there were no guns. I liked the fact that the alien had taken on some characteristics of a dog. And I liked the fact that Ripley wasn't the same "Get away from her, you bitch!" Rambo-type woman as she was in the second film. This was her big send off. The film is almost a tribute to her--and Weaver's performance is heartbreaking.As we all know, they filmed a fourth Alien film. Stay far, far away from Alien: Resurrection. Watch the first three films and you get a complete trilogy, with a beginning ("Alien" as the introduction), a middle (the excitement and action of the second), and an ending (Alien3 providing the resolution and conclusion).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than You Might Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that Alien3 was coming out, I was thrilled. The first two films had blown me away. The creeping terror of Alien and the slam-bang action of Aliens, together with the amazing humanity and depth of the Ripley character had me completely hooked and eager for much, much more. When Alien3 reached theaters, I was there opening night. When it was all over, though, I felt let down. I wasn't sure why - I just felt like something wasn't quite right. The effects were good, the sets were dark and ominous, and the acting was great, but for some reason, I just didn't get into it.A few years went by and I eventually was given a set of all three Alien films on VHS. After watching the first two (including the deleted scenes from Aliens), I decided to give Alien3 another chance. After watching it again, it was clear to me that I had missed something the first time through. As the guns-blazing style of Aliens had been a wild but satisfying departure from the relentless, helpless terror of Alien, Alien3 took off in a completely new direction and served to underscore the central themes of the series - the destruction of everything Ripley cares about by her accidental association with the monster, and the fact that the titular Aliens aren't evil - humans are. We're shown Ripley, who lost her daughter and everyone she ever knew at the beginning of Aliens but seemed to have found new hope with Hicks and Newt, once again losing it all in the first moments of the film. She had escaped once again, only to be plunged back into the darkness. After seeing Alien3, the scene in Alien in which she argues with Captain Dallas at the airlock becomes incredibly poignant - the moment Ash disobeys her order to quarantine Kain, Ripley's life is destroyed. Wherever she runs, it will find her. Whatever she loves, it will take.This leads to the second point, conveyed extremely well by Alien3. The aliens are not evil. They simply are. They kill to survive and to grow. They follow their biological imperatives. They adapt any environment they come in contact with to better suit them, and they survive. The evil in the Alien series has always been human. It is the Corporation, which ruthlessly and heartlessly sacrifices anything - equipment, facilities, lives - in order to make money. A group of murderers, rapists, and irretrievable criminal scum has more regard for the sanctity of life than the Corporation ever could.Alien3 is darker and slower than other Alien films, and is very different from those that proceeded it, but I believe it is in many ways, a more rewarding film than its counterparts in many ways. We see the humanity and fragility of Ripley more in this film than in others. We see the true extent of the horror and destruction wrought on her life by the Corporation's plotting. In the end, we see the sacrifice necessary to stop the evil from being spread. Ripley confronts her demons directly and by opposing, ends them. In this, we see how Alien3 is wonderfully different from the other films - Alien was horror/suspense. Aliens was action/thriller. Alien3 is tragedy, and a very well crafted one at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's wrong with it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Warning: bit of spoiler, for 'Aliens' too***I think this movie is severely underrated, probably due to the delusion of some guys which expected a sequel for Aliens, with lotsa action and Michael Bienh in the part of the hero. First of all let me say the presence of an egg in the Sulaco was not so inexplicable, in Aliens Ripley bothered the Queen while she was spawning, don't you remember the forcible snatch of the tube when she started following Newt and Ripley? She could have left an egg in the ship before coming out and engaging Ripley. Now our fearless and cute Lieutenant is the only survivor, once again, that's a kind of malediction but not so unbelievable, her death is after all a matter of hours. Besides, I liked it cause it has something different with the first two, a new kind of suspense and interesting characters, an use of dull colors and cold lights (but only in the beginning) that is not so bad as someone says, and a more human and vulnerable Ripley that makes love and could be eliminated by the alien at their first meeting, when in the infirmary she's put on the corner but not killed cause of the queen she's carrying in her chest. Above all, i appreciated the bad end as symbolizing an over-tired Ripley giving up in front of her 2 worst nightmares: the aliens and the Company; i know it's just a personal point of view but i love tragic ends and this movie gives me the impression of being an "end" in its entireness, the bitter end of the saga, told in a suitable way; you can dislike it but you can't say it doesn't fit with the first two. In my opinion it deserves a 7,5, that's not available, so i gave it 8, to compensate the current low average rating.</fullReview>

No, this film is not as good as the first or fourth in this series, (haven't seen the second) but it's not a bad movie. It could have used a few more sympathetic characters, though.

		<shortDescription>Very underrated, fantastic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, most people who have seen this film have seen the original two (great) movies, and are big fans of Aliens. But this movie is just too different for many of the ALIEN fans, especially after seeing the second one - it's as simple as not expecting a sequel to Aliens when you watch Alien3 - expect a different kind of Alien picture, and that's what I like so much about this sequel. So many sequels are rehashes of the original, are good movies in their own right, but with many of the same things as the movie that preceeded it, but Fincher has crafted a movie that is so different from Aliens, many people do not like this sequel. I don't think we need another Aliens movie, it's like Alien was more of a suspense horror movie, Aliens had more aliens and was more of an Action/Adventure, and now there's Alien3, more of a drama with suspense like the first. In conclusion, sometimes originality can take away in making a sequel (no wonder they make most sequels like the prequels!), which is why I think it shouldn't have been called Alien 3.As for the film itself, Ellen Ripley lands on a prison colony planet, and a xenomorph on her ship kills everyone but her, and the alien starts killing people and whatnot. There is great acting, and a fantastic end.In conclusion, expect Fincher, and not another ALIENS, and you could enjoy it very much.9 out of 10(P.S. The worst in the series is Alien Resurrection, but that one isn't so bad - but it's more like Aliens).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its really not that bad.There are 5 types of films:the superb,the excellent,the good,the reasonable,and the bad(maybe theres a sixth type in certain cases)this movie is a reasonable movie,it has only one alien like in the first,its passed on a prison planet,and it is very gory.The good thing about the film is that the alien is smart,agile,and fierce,he was born from a dog and therefore acuired his abilities,hes also a quadrupod(most aliens are bipedal when they are not climbing walls)and a real hunter.This film is also the one with the highest number of casualties.The bad about this film is that it has way too much drama,and everybody has the same haircut,wich is horrible(if u can call that a haircut)if this film had fallen in some other directors hand it would be a disaster,but since it fall in the hands of Fincher,its a reasonable film,and why not say a good one,its worth watching and should have been THE END of the alien saga,id give it a 7 like one of Finchers movie is called.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True, sequels are a regular source of disappointments. I feel this sequel, and it's successor, can't compare to the first two, especially the second. But I tried to look at this movie as just this: a movie, and not a sequel. Many movies would pale in comparison to Cameron's masterpiece. Alien? is the continuing saga of Ripley's battle against the malevolent Aliens. The movie's tone and mood are very dark, and I think that it's an excellent style for this section of the story line. The character Ripley loses everything dear to her, and her character is duly morose in this movie. Instead of trying to go against the Company, she is now fighting out of pure revenge. While many people were disappointed with the ending, I think it perfectly fits the main theme. While not the 'Aliens' blockbuster, I do think this movie does the saga justice. If you want a happy ending to the story, don't watch Alien? and Alien Resurrection. If you want a much darker and melancholy ending, finish out the story to it's conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who misses Hicks?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**contains spoilers**I am very interested in those reviewers who hint at what this moviecould have been with different editing. I think some of theconcepts are great--the prison planet with the strange religiousmovement could really work, but I felt like not enough was donewith it. I got the feeling that the director, the writer, or somebodywanted to make a really weird movie, but was told to cut to thechase. As usual, weirder would have been better.The movie starts with a shock: the deaths of Hicks and Newt. Yes, it's totally left unexplained how the alien managed to lay eggson the ship before getting kicked off at the end of the secondmovie, but then again, are we so sure that everything about thiscreature's physiology has been completely revealed in the first twofilms? In other words, it doesn't make much sense, but itshouldn't really bother us. As for the deaths, I didn't miss Hicks at all. He was just anotherone of those annoying commandos in Aliens. Newt, on the otherhand...after all the effort Ripley put into saving her in the previousmovie, to have her killed was really depressing. But I think it reallyworks for Ripley's character--as the series goes on she gets moreand more existential, and more and more she realizes her fate isintertwined with that of the alien. I don't think her decision to throwherself into the furnace at the end would have been as easy, or asconvincing, had Newt still been around to need her.Clement was a great character, and what a change to allow Ripleya romantic interest. His death, so early in the movie, was a bigshock, but in retrospect I think it was timed just about right. If hehad died at the end, after he and Ripley had fallen completely inlove, it would have made her sacrifice look like a love suicide; asis, they weren't yet in love--she was just beginning to trust him, andbang, he's gone. The tragedy is perhaps even greater becausethe potential in their relationship had not yet been fulfilled.That said, I think the movie does go downhill from there. None ofthe other characters are developed enough to make you careabout them. If the cult story had been developed more, Dillon'scharacter could have really been something (and the strangereligious elements of the first and fourth movies might have mademore sense), but as was he was basically just another commando type.The ending is spectacular, though: not only Ripley's memorabledeath, but her confrontation with the Company's men, who areeven more evil than the aliens. Like a lot of the action sequencesin the second half, this confrontation comes out pretty confused,though (I always found myself wondering in this movie who'd shotwho and why, who was running where and why).As usual the best thing about the movie is Weaver's performance. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have no trouble believing thatRipley would refuse to be confined to the infirmary and take herchances around the prisoners. By this time, she's faced the alienstwice--what has she got to fear from some puny double-y's? Eachfilm in the series sees her get tougher and tougher, but it's abelievable transformation. In the first two movies she was scaredbut smart; here she's lost so much that she has no energy to bescared. All in all, it's not a perfect film, but it's not bad, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bitch is back, but Hicks isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is certainly the worst of the saga, but it is not a bad film, and I believe it is harshly treated. I watched this movie a day after seeing ALIENS, and after the pleasing ending to ALIENS, was immediately depressed when I expected Michael Biehn's name to appear on screen and didn't. Even more so, when Hicks, along with Newt, are killed off within the first few minutes of the film. The absence of weapons should add to the suspense of the film, after all, the weapons in the 1st film are rarely handled, and still it was a success. The fact that we don't have Vasquez and Drake blasting the walls down, does not mean the film can't be enjoyable.Some excellent performances from the cast, British actors Brian Glover, Charles Dance, Ralph Brown and the unlucky Paul McGann, his character suffered huge editing and we fail to see what happens to his character in the film. Charles S Dutton gives us the American touch and is VERY good in his role. And of course, the superb Lance Henriksen, makes a welcome appearance as Bishop, and the sight of him softened the blow of having my hero Michael Biehn on the top of K2 at the time of this movie. Henriksen is excellent in this role and to date is the only actor (other than Weaver) to appear in more than 1 Alien film. Don't judge Alien3 so hard, the more you watch it, the more it can be appreciated, and it is as much a part of the Saga as any other of the movies. It is a good film, despite the amazing competition in the Saga, this film is severely under-rated!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SOME SPOILERS *** Dont let the comments index scare you, this third film in the Alien series is vastly underrated. Sure, its got its flaws, but so did Ridley Scotts original. Some films end on a real downer, this one also STARTS with one, with survivors from Aliens (Newt, Hicks and droid Bishop) killed off before the opening titles. Ripley survives, but lands on a grim prison planet, populated by convicted murderers and rapists, and a couple of seedy and semi-stupid guards and doctors. Sigourney Weaver, head shaved, fatigued but strongwilled, is excellent as Ripley, showing us new sides to her complex character. A supporting cast of mostly British actors (Brian Glover, Charles Dance, Ralph Brown and Paul McGann) range from hammy to good, and Charles Dutton is excellent as a reluctantly helpful convict. Lance Henriksen also makes a brief, but welcome return as Bishop and his creator.The force of the film is the mood and cinematography, supported by Elliott Goldenthals powerful score. David Fincher creates great atmosphere, some scares and a memorable ending, even though his original synopsis contained ideas for an actionpacked, BIG ending that could have made this rank proudly along its predecessors. Sadly, his budget got cut repeatedly, the original ending was dropped, thus resulting in the most debated threequel of all time. *** (of ****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 is not really that bad of a movie. Everone seems to say that it is the worst of the Alien movies but I think that it easily passes Alien Resurrection. It is a very interesting movie because in movies I like to see action, but for some reason I tend to like this movie. I think it is because I am an Alien fan all the way(except Resurrection). One thing I noticed is their use of profanity in this movie. I'm not one of those "OH, they said the "F" word" people but I think they go a little overboard with it, probably because they are prisoners and not very good people to begin with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last few scenes in this movie make up for a great deal. ALIEN 3 was not bad it just had the heck editied out of it. Things that could have enhanced the film. The last few scenes revolve around a conflict between Ripley and Bishop's creator and her descision to committ suicide by taking the "cinematic devil with her" and do a swa dive into a station furnace...or was it a artsy depiction of dantes inferno? ALIEN 3 went for the art houe look yet dissapointed most who liked ALIENS. ALIENS was a action packed rollercoaster ride. This film was fundamentally different.The VINCENT WARD version of this film has the SULACO crashing on a planet where a group of monks has a commune. Ripley Hicks and Newt all survive. MICHAEL BIEHN opted not to be in this movie as he didn't think they had much of a story. I think the decision to kill off NEWT and HICKS was a foolish one. (my opinion) Yet, ALIEN 3 does have good characters and a rather dark story. Not as good as ALIENS but it should be judged on a whole other par. it was a different type of movie. The VINCENT WARD vesion was adapted into a DARK HORSE graphic novel. Vincent Ward was the cinematic genius behind the NEW ZEELAND fantasy time travel film THE NAVIGATOR, which was a first class art fantasy film. He also did the equally great MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is, in my opinion (which I freely admit is unpopular), tied for second-best of the Alien films. The original is unquestionably the finest; "Aliens" is a good action flick but fails to capture anything of the mood of the original; "Alien: Resurrection" ties with "Alien 3" for second-best on sheer strength of mood, style, and premise.My favourite element of "Alien 3" is not even connected to the creature itself. The society on Fury 161 is brilliantly conceived, and Fincher's directing - this *is* the man who went on to make "Se7en," after all - brings it to gritty life. Ripley's reaction to this society of devoutly religious thugs begins in earnest the hardening process that begins in "Aliens," and gives her perhaps the strength to make the decision she must at the film's end.Kudos to the clever way in which Lance Henriksen reappears. Disappointing was the hackneyed way in which the alien was finally destroyed. All the cast members - like the original, mostly British character actors such as Pete Postlethwaite - did very well with their roles. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 was okay, but it lacked the suspense and thrills of the two before it. They tried the use of computer effects with not much great skill, so some special effects seem a little cheesy. Sigourney Weaver gives a great performance as Ripley. The ending is very good because it shows the sacrifice she must make in order to wipe out this species.Alien 3 gives a very different scenario, but everything is very confusing. The director didn't know what he was doing. The acting is good, but it didn't have as much action that made the other two so great. However, it's a good installment of the series, letting you feel the pain and emotion of Ripley as she loses everything she ever cared for. I recommend Alien 3, but I can't guarantee or think you'll like it better than Alien and Aliens.Rating: 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rich conceptual film lacking drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing David Fincher's subsequent effort, Seven, this film gains a lot. There's obviously a lot more going on conceptually in Alien3 than dramatically. What interests me is how Alien3 (much like the other films in the series, especially the second and fourth) explores ideas of aggression, sexuality, and motherhood.There are obvious connections made between the first two in Aliens. When Hicks offers Ripley a lesson in using a military weapon, the sexual overtones are heavy. "Show me everything," Ripley says suggestively. Their relationship never develops, as Hicks dies early in Alien3. Ripley winds up seducing Clemens, the doctor for the monastic base on Fury. Fincher suggests that the result of their contact is that Ripley is "pregnant" with an alien. Heavy stuff.There is plenty to work with here, but Fincher unnecessarily adds religion to the mix. The base, formerly a prison colony, has evolved into a monastery of sorts, with Charles Dutton as the pugilistic leader Dillon. If Fincher was trying to equate the alien with some sort of demonic being, he failed completely. Much of Dillon's religious exhortation seems woefully out of context.There is much to admire stylistically in Alien3. The opening credits interpose snapshots of action that effectively construct a longer, more complete sequence of events. The shots of the funeral for Hicks and Newt are intercut with shots of the new alien emerging explosively from a dog, as Dillon eulogizes how life emerges from death. The juxtaposition is truly effective.Fincher's style doesn't lend itself well to extended action sequences, and the climactic attempt by the base inhabitants to trap the alien feels rather devoid of energy. It's also hampered by the failings of his special effects; in most of the action scenes, the alien is an obvious add-in to the shot. The ending however, is challenging, and a real departure from what one would expect from Hollywood (as it was in Seven).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movies come in Thirds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Alien? while in Berlin, as I travelled across Europe on my motorbike during the summer of '92. The newer version that has come to light several years later is a marked improvement, not to say that the 1992 Cinema release was a poorer effort, it was not, far from it.With a fine and prestige's English cast that refines and catapults this third instalment to a higher level of quality, such as Charles Dance, the late Brian Glover, Pete Postlethwaite and Paul McGann, Danny Webb and Philip Davis. We have also the charismatic Charles S. Dutton to represent the American market here too, as well as David Fincher, whose work as directing, besides Alien? , on movies as, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, but on the miniature and optical effects unit here only, and Se7en, The Game, Fight Club, and Panic Room.This fresher version extends the plight and solitude of the twenty or so remaining low life prisoners that have remained behind on their prison planet that is Fiorina "Fury" 161, the Work Correctional Facility, and with Maximum Security status. There is no need for weapons, the CCTV has not worked in years, there is no supply of ice cream too, and with only one cargo visit per several months or so, the hope of escape and rescue is far and impossible.The characters here are given actual personalities, strong enough to work to a high degree of connection and understanding, and are hard not to sympathise with, toward the end of each, and eventual, demise. For they give off the sense of empathy and their esprit de corps is at least commendable, even for a collection of riffraff lifers.The acting is intelligent, clean, and sharp, at times humorous too, the love interest between Ripley and Clemens is a fine subplot. Alien? concentrates more on the development of the human issue of the family of destitute's, rather than an out and out gore fest. There is blood and horror, but not on the level of this horror sci-fi genre has become synonymous.With its realistic language and sensitive overtones, Alien? is a fine addition to the Alien saga if there ever was one.End of Transmission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The series should have ended here (spoilers throughout)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3, by and large, is considered a poor film. Most people see it as a lazy re-hash of the first instalment and most people hate the way that it dispensed with the other surviving characters of Aliens. Well, I can kind of see their point. Alien 3, like the first, does opt for the dark, claustrophobic atmosphere of the first and it does have the same stalk and slash mentality ? there are no big guns here. And, yes, it does rather ruthlessly kill off the characters of Aliens. But I can't really see it being any other way. The Alien series isn't about Hicks or Newt. It's about Ripley, and it's always been her alone against the alien. To have Hicks and Newt tagging along would feel like Aliens Revisited. It would just be, for the second time, Ripley fighting the alien to protect her surrogate daughter. At least here she gets to do something different. It isn't a fight for survival, or a fight to protect Newt. It's a fight to keep the alien away from The Company.One of the many things that annoyed and enraged me about Alien Resurrection (now there's an Alien film truly worthy of revulsion) was the way that they dispensed with the main villain of the piece, the mysterious, all-seeing company. That was one of the fun things in the series. You felt like there was something bigger and more important going on. And the filmmakers developed it superbly. In the first film it was only on the periphery. But in the second film, with Burke, it was brought to the front. So I like the way that Alien 3 develops it even further. The Company has an almost Orwellian presence. It seems to see everything. And so Ripley's fight to kill the alien before The Company can get it's hand on it seems entirely convincing. Indeed, there's a great scene ? one of those rabble-rousing moments you only see in films ? where she explains The Company's motivation to the prisoners. It's an excellent nod to the fans and one that gets you even more fully behind her cause. Don't trust those greedy capitalists, man.Of course, the company man in the film (Aaron) is a stupid sheep, but rather than ape what Cameron did with Burke ? and make him totally untrustworthy ? he's just a man trying to do his job and earn a living. And at the end, after lots of abuse from the prisoners, he actually grows a set and takes a swipe at one of the company men. Too bad, then, that this action gets him killed. I mean, during the final sequence, when all the prisoners are being chased by the alien in the maze, he finds a quiet room and sits it out. I thought, then, that this might show a new dawning of intelligence. But instead, after looking like he's been saved, he does something brave, but stupid, and gets himself killed. You've got to know when to pick your fights, Aaron.Another complaint that people seem to toss in the direction of Alien 3 is that the characters all look the same. Well, personally, I think the characters stand out pretty damn well. Sure they may all have shaved craniums, but I think that the writing and the acting are pretty damn strong. They all have distinct personalities ? which is a pretty good feat when you're dealing with rapists, murders and pederasts ? and it's only the ones that get killed in seconds that feel generic. Dillon stands out the most. He's the kind of hardnut that can kick your head in and say something poetic at the same time. Plus, he takes the alien on in hand-to-hand combat and insults the alien's fighting skills as he's being killed. How can you not dig a man like that? In fact, he's one of the best anti-heroes in a long time. Charles S. Dutton is excellent. I also think that Charles Dance is great. He gets killed off rather early, but he makes his scenes count. And he even gets to sleep with Ripley. Sure, in film tradition, this means that he has to die, but, hey, at least he went there. And Brian Glover, Ralph Brown, Pete Postlethwaite and Paul McGann are superb. Plus I like the way that one of the more peripheral characters survives.And the film is also quite poetic. The cremation scene in particular stands out. It has some great dialogue, a fantastic score and the alien birth is beautiful in a perverse way. And the final moments, too, are great.But what of the alien in this film? Well, aside from the occasional dodgy bit of effects work in the maze sequence ? it sometimes moves like its got piles ? it's pretty damn good. It's certainly better than the gloop covered monsters of Resurrection. And it gets some pretty good moments. The killing where the blood sprays over Paul McGann's face is nice, as is the amusing killing of Brain Glover. And I also like the bit where it meets Ripley face to face. Somehow, in the Jeunet film, the aliens were no longer threatening, but in Alien 3 it still has the right stuff. Perhaps the one miscue is giving the alien a POV shot ? I didn't think the alien had eyes ? but, hey, the shots work visually, so who cares? And I think the film would have been a fitting end to the series. Ripley finally meets The Company and she sacrifices herself to deny them and to save mankind. That's pretty good going in my book. And I wouldn't have thought the character would have anywhere to go if they somehow would have managed to bring her back to life. Well, when I first saw it, I had hopes for Resurrection, but unfortunately, I was proved right. The series should have ended here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 to me was over after the first fifteen minutes of it. The fact that Newt died rendered its predessor Aliens absolutely pointless.I find that this simple and terrible end could have been easily avoided.Now the reason for her death was never explained by the Writers Vincent Ward and Larry ferguson (I don't mean how she drowned or why). I am going to assume that the writers couldn't cast Carrie Henn as Newt again due to her age (about 15 years old or so).So why not have Newt injured and in a coma.Many would say because viewers could tell that it was a different actress. But what I had in mind was perhaps a latex doll with an exact reconstruction of Carrie Henn's face, and if not then have her face covered by an oxygen mask or a bandage of some sort. Don't go taking the easy way out. All in all the movie was great with the exception of that one setback.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the comments of people here, I find the same criticism of a lack of suspense. I suppose this is true but only because the movie is only marginally interested in it. Each Alien film represents a different type of filmmaking and Alien 3 has been labeled the bastard child of the franchise. This is an undeserved label. Alien 3 is about pain, hopelessness and loss and those are cinematic qualities that most people refuse to associate with or accept. People wanted Alien 3 to be another guns and ammo war fest and they were handed the equivalent of a moody and dark art house feature.SPOILER HERE. In my own humble opinion Ripley had to die. She had to lose everything. Otherwise Alien 3 would have been a standard issue sequel. This film takes Weaver's Ripley to a fitting conclusion. To have her live at the end would have not only betrayed the character but it would have been a complete sell-out that pandered to the audience. This film has guts and demands a lot from the audience. And those who criticize it for not having enough action should realize, such as Fincher probably did, that they couldn't have topped Aliens in that department. It's an action masterpiece and to try and duplicate it would have been foolish. I have always applauded Alien 3 for being a highly stylized and individual movie. If you saw it before and hated it, see it again and watch it for the movie it is. Don't hate it because its not a movie it never pretends to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly flawed and boring but does have an effective element of horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one compares Alien-3 to the likes of Alien Resurrection and a piece of feces called AVP, one would notice that Alien-3 does much more justice to the creature by portraying it very frighteningly. While the movie itself can drag, get very boring, the Alien comes out as a bigger threat than it ever was in the sequels. Having said that, one may have huge expectations after viewing Aliens/Alien-2 and those expectations will certainly not be fulfilled in this movie.Also, Alien-3 is no where as good as the first Alien movie which it tries to be. Even so, it puts the element of fright back into the series just like the first movie did which means that a followup movie on the line of Aliens could have fit the part as a sequel to Alien-3. Unfortunately, Alien Resurrection turned out to be a joke of sorts. While in purely terms of entertainment, Alien resurrection comes out better than Alien-3, it also destroys the value of creature once it concludes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's Cut Is A Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After getting the Alien Quadrilogy last Christmas, I must say that the actual Director's Cut version is incredibly good. The studio should have let David Fincher's version onto the screen. It's much scarier, makes more sense and is in every way superior to the theatrical release. The documentary on the making of this film is just incredible, you really get an inside view in the making of this film. From the conception, to the completion - battles with executives and producers.I think David Fincher was screwed by the studios, but still got an incredible film out eventually - check out the boxed set. I think you'll find your money well spent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>near-brilliant use of tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien3 has a great many detractors for a great many reasons. But let me offer just one example of how thoroughly effective this film is in terms of tone and atmosphere: the funeral sequence where the bodies of Newt and Hicks are thrown into the molten steel and the new alien is born from the dog. Look at all the layers Fincher successfully employs in the space of two minutes. The use of irony (Dutton's eulogy) and contrast (alien ripping its way out of the dog's chest), blending beauty and horror, together with an impending sense of doom (Riply's bloody nose) and loss (the death of loved ones), taking place in a physical environment of bitter cold and scorching heat. The scene is both cathartic and devastating, visually-stunning and unrelentingly morbid. To me, it's a near-perfect hybrid of Ridley Scott and James Cameron. And Fincher deserves a place right next to them. What other director, apart from the true masters, can evoke so many seamless transitions so efficiently?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of the Special Edition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's different?: In Europa ALIEN 3 is released both as a theatrical and a special edition. The theatrical was a bit disappointing, and lacked a lot of excitement, blood and horror, which the Special Edition truly compensates for. Here many scenes are different, and the entire movie is SO much bloodier.Both editions: The visuals are stunning, dark and claustrophobic. Sometimes when you follow the camera around you really ARE afraid of turning at the next corner. The action is top class, and I think it's bad that ALIEN 3 is so underrated, because it's really a blast! The acting is, once again, great. The stand out is Charles S. Dutton as the convict/preacher Dillon. His stand with the alien in the end, is one of the most intense and emotionally best scenes in the entire movie.So, if you can get your hands on the Special Edition of ALIEN 3, then do yourself a favor and give it another chance; It really is MUCH more recommendable than the theatrical release.</fullReview>

I thought the first was a decent movie, I don't think it great as it is made out to be.Aliens was okay sequel, when I re-watched it, I didn't enjoy it as much as the last time I watched it. Aliens, If you watch the series back to back, Soon as Alien 3 start its already lost some of th fans, as it's dose not make sense after second Alien movie. The plot was silly , I could not care about any of people in this movie,I actually hoped the Alien killed them of sooner, they were pain in the beep! The movie drags on for far to long and when Aliens scenes are far to apart, in this movie and even Alien scenes, it look a lot different in this movie then first two, it's didn't look as scary or creepy either. The deaths in scenes made me laugh out loud, there was so bad, the death were bloody but I still found it funny, I don't remember much blood from the first two movies. Some of the effects in this movie was really badly done as well, the acting was okay in tjos movie, I could really care less for one person in this movie.I was rooting for Alien. I was not to keen on how this movie ended, it was bit of a cop out 2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I feel like throwing up all i have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If for any reason other than watching the franchise preparing for Prometheus (2012), I will advice you skip this movie.I still have a bad after taste and a feeling throw up all I have seen. It may have been a big budget production, but what a waste it was. Imagine a movie that starts production without a complete script, the script itself went through 5 re-writes before starting. This to me is a sign that the movie itself didn't want to be made.But sadly to say in 1992 Alien 3 was produced and it was a mess, directed by first time movie director at that time David Fincher (alien 3 was his debut, although he has gone to direct hits after that some including Seven (1995), Fight Club (1999), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) and more), who did a job worth getting sidelined for.As usual, the pod heading for earth got delayed and an alien was onboard and killed most of the crew on board.Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) survived and she brought with her to the Fiorina 'Fury' 161, a foundry facility and penal colony inhabited by all-male inmates, the Alien.All hell breaks loose as usual people running here and there, death everywhere, chaos, pandemonium and something growing where it should not.My very candid thought on this movie is this: Although the action was there, the suspense was not, the horror genre gone and replaced with drama. The dialogues were too long and so much pause in-between, not evenly paced and the worst part is the story was out of place, ending unbelievably annoying.I regret seeing this movie, after seeing the Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986). Done by Ridley Scott and James Cameron respectively I expected something better.All in all, watch something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Begininning of the End of the Great Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this movie should never have been made. Firstly this movie lacked an emotional depth that both Alien and Aliens had and as such the journey of Ripley which in essence was her facing fears and growing into the powerful leader she was destined to become became muted. There were many problems during the production of this movie and Fincher, who is an excellent movie director struggled to put forward a film which could carry the emotion of Ripley's journey and the mysteries of the alien creature and it's origins.Alien played out our fears of loneliness in the vacuum of space and the played out a simple story in the most beautiful fashion that watching the movie can be the most unsettling experience but an unforgettable one.Aliens expanded the story of Ripley and was the perfect antidote to the helpless loneliness of the first movie. Cameron didn't try to emulate to first movie but did what any good director would do and created something bigger and upped the tempo. Ripley played the parent role in her relation to Newt after finding out her daughter had died of old age while she was in hyper sleep which gave her that protective role and also gave the platform to face her fears of the original movie on a bigger scale.Alien 3 would never have been able to top Aliens in terms of pace and action and going back to basics, which it did gave it direct comparison with the original Alien and it of course fails in its comparison.Firstly the story is depressing as Newt, Hicks and Bishop are killed off, though Bishop does make an appearance. Ripley is doomed from the word go as she is impregnated with an alien queen so all her previous heroics were essentially for nothing and I felt a sense of loss in the saga. The characters bar Dance and Glover are pretty forgettable and despite the attempts to create an atmosphere like the original movie this just doesn't work and instead I felt disappointed. The CGI effects are also just abysmal, why did they do that? They look fake and spoil an already dour movie.On a more positive note this movie in my eyes is a masterpiece when compared to the even more dreadful Alien Resurrection which is a cinematic disaster!! My advice is keep away from this movie as its the beginning of the decline of the saga which was so brilliantly enjoyable with Alien and Aliens. Fingers crossed Ridley Scott's Prometheus is another epic to add to the saga. If anybody can pull it off though it's Ridley Scott.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Despise This Film for Killing Off Newt and Hicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen Alien 3 only once. I have never seen any of the following films, nor will I. The Alien franchise is dead as far as I'm concerned. This film betrays the emotional investment of every audience member that ever saw Aliens. James Cameron makes a brilliant roller-coaster of a film with compelling characters, and how do they follow it up? Some hack screenwriter, for one reason or another (I don't know and I don't care), decides that Ripley and only Ripley should be the center of attention in Alien films and kills off Newt and Corporal Hicks. What follows is a great-looking but forgettable film which could have been amazing. What a huge missed opportunity. I loved the first two Alien films. Now I simply don't care. Congratulations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With a debut film as terrible as this, it's astounding that Fincher's career didn't get flushed down the toilet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien, along with it's sequel Aliens, set the bar for horror/suspense movies pretty damn high back when they got released. They were regarded as classics on the date they got released, and both of them are still regarded as such today. Alien relied more on atmosphere while Aliens was more rich on action. But overall, Both of them masterfully captured the look, touch and suspense of a real alien film, the kind of ingredients that Alien 3 was thoroughly lacking. Even Alien: Resurrection was better, as it did offer fast-paced action, but of course lacked the originality of the two first. The third installment didn't have a single redeeming value, except for the visual experience and one or two tense scenes. The prison world was so creative and well made, I couldn't help but wonder how good this movie could have been if Ridley Scott or James Cameron had returned to direct it.At least it's a relief when you think of all the wonders Fincher have given us after Alien 3. But how he could screw the project up that much, remains a mystery to this day. The film had stupid characters, bad film editing, cringe-worthy script and lame action sequences. I can't recall the last time I saw a film where the characters literally made me facepalm. Sure, people died in horrible ways, which in itself was a minor success. But I didn't care about any of them. Most of them were just in the background most of the time and had a few lines at the most. Also, the relationship between Ridley and the guy at the start were so painfully bad, probably the worst thing about the movie. So, why not kill off all the survivors the avid fans would love to see in this film while you're at it? In short, this movie got turned into a crapfest.The third installment is, without a doubt, a failure. But still, the big bad alien that kills people in horrible ways is always a pleasure watching, and then there's the beautiful prison setting. Yep, that's basically the only two reasons to see this movie if you ask me.Moose finds this film worthy of a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 25 Reasons to Avoid Alien?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. In 1992, no one heard you scream?in the theatre.2. They didn't learn from Alien? with Terminator 3, which ruined the notion of "No fate but what we make" set forth in Terminator 2. Alien? follows suit in just the first 10 minutes by tossing out all you cared about Aliens.3. Incredibly, I originally gave this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I was 18 then and 18 years later, I've grown up, opened my eyes and tried to remember what kinds of drugs I was inhaling back then.4. Mostly, I'll recommend the "Uncut/Unrated/Unclothed" Special Editions of movies. In Alien?, you must skip it at all costs. An additional 31 USELESS minutes were added and in this "special" edition, they mercilessly deleted the only thing the ending had going for it: the chest-burst.5. Speaking of useless minutes, in the so-called Special Edition there's a successful trap set for the alien. In one of the brainless ideas caught on screenplay paper, it's released. Thank God for editors for theatrical releases.6. While I thoroughly praised Aliens, I feel I was enormously harsh on the original Alien. After #3, I deserve to be shot for saying anything against the original.7. Ripley (Weaver) went from housewife to warrior with her G.I. Jane 'do...until?she bellied over in what appears to be PMS cramps for the other 90% of the movie. Yeah. That's both tough and appealing.8. Who cares if your previous installment makes $131 million worldwide ? which, by the way, was good for 1986?the suits will always try and tear down the budget for a part III by turning the realistic alien creatures into?cartoons??9. Alien? had flat out hilarious alien scenes (when they're chomping away or in the distance.) Today we would call it CGI, in 1992, it was called animated. And poorly.10. Weaver only saw green ($$) for Alien?. She obviously decided she was in it for the money. Joke's on her: this was the lowest grossing of the first three. Hell, it barely reached $55 million, which, by the way, was still bad in 1992.11. The original premise of Alien? was for it to be set on earth, and unbelievably, they released even teasers for that idea. Too bad they scrapped that better script for the "lovely" locale of a prison planet with zero-chemistry, zero-brains and zero-depth inmates. Talk about expendable characters (SEE: plot of #1 and #2.)12. And WTF was with the series first (and completely irrelevant) sex scene? You cannot tell me prisoners make Ripley hot.13. Charles Dutton's character "Dillon" was some kind of swearing, mean-spirited and rambling holy man. Sounds like someone had a Buddy Christ doll on his dashboard, hmmm?14. The poster reveals "3 times the suspense. 3 times the danger. 3 times the terror." Affirmative?if you're multiplying 3 by zero.15. Spoiler: while the character of Ripley was very good in Alien and excellent in Aliens, she certainly took a backseat to Charles Dance's "Clemens" who was the only redeeming character that had depth, one you rooted for, and?what did they do? Kill him off abruptly and without thought.16. Admittedly, it did have good sets (for what it was) and it contained one of the best scenes in any movie: the alien all but attempting to kiss Ripley. It would be too much of a spoiler to report why, but suffice to say that was the only great 10 seconds of 8700 seconds of footage.17. "The Company" is trying to get their paws on what they think are the last two aliens of the species. They need to Netflix part one again to remind them: there's a shitload of eggs still hanging out in a UFO on the original planet.18. Think what you will of Alien: Resurrection. That was the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade of apologies for Alien?.19. When a character professes to be human, and that character stated he created androids in his image, they shouldn't label him in the credits as "Bishop II" or any "II" when he's supposedly the original.20. Spoiler: It still boggles my mind that they deleted the Ripley line "For the last time" from the final product, and even the bloated special edition. Obviously, they wanted to leave this open for yet another sequel, but in reality, for fans of the series, we all know, it was, in fact, Ripley's last time.21. Thank God, this was only Director Fincher's first outing. Someone must've forgave him for Alien? to allow him to make the superior films: Se7en, The Game, The Social Network and Fight Club.22. I'm aware Great Britain pretty much had its run of the world at one time, but how they conquered other worlds, such as this boring prison planet, is beyond me. (Okay, not getting my point across? Just try and understand half the words the brits in the movie are saying.)23. Ripley's character is afraid people will think she's crazy if she tells them there might be an alien stalking them in the shadows. Seriously? People, you can breathe on other planets. Is it really that much of a stretch that other organisms can, as well?24. This movie should be viewed by only the curious of what happened after Part II. The series should've ended with Part II as Part III didn't add hardly anything fresh, interesting, topical or suspenseful.25. Allow me to amend that: Don't be curious. Just don't watch this movie. Would you be curious to see what it feels to get your hand snapped in a rat-trap, or your ankle in a bear-trap? It's just common sense to stay away from something that will cause such agony. Alien? is that kind of pain. Just avoid it.</fullReview>

I just have a problem with the movie because they use f*** over 112 times :( Another problem I have is that I that the movie takes place in 2650 which is a little to far in years.The whole story is just about Ripley crashing on a prison planet in 2650 and a Facehugger, or two of them were aboard Ripley's ship and one had gotten on her, the other on a, DOG! Yes the alien in this movie is the Dog Alien who just gave me a lot of stress during the movie. After a series of fake looking gunfire, Ripley kills the Dog Alien, the thing that seemed interesting to me is that guy from Alien vs. Predator; that guy who was sick and was killed eventually. Ripley kills herself because she knows there is an alien inside her, an Alien Queen. So Ripley dies, BAD WAY TO END THE SAGA WITH A MOVIE SO BAD! But wait we still have one last hope, Alien Resurrection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing, bleak...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...in comparison to the first two. As it's own movie this is a good concept and could have worked much better without the Alien franchise. The prison setting, these brutish characters and a sense of entrapment all lend well to a horror/thriller. But taking these established characters; Newt and Hick's, then dispensing of them in this film, was such a slap to the audience and renders Ripley's heroism pointless in Aliens! I understand they were trying for a different, bleaker tone; they succeeded, but it was just *too* bleak for me. The relationship set up between Ripley and Clemens was frankly all i could care about; (the other characters seemed so dislikeable I wanted them to end up as Alien fodder)and when Clemens is killed off barely an hour into the film I struggled to watch on. The struggle worsened when we learn that Ripley is carrying one of the Aliens herself, so how is an audience supposed to believe she can survive this, and how are we supposed to root for her survival when she is already condemned to death? By this point i was totally disengaged from all the characters so didn't care about the film at all. A few things that might appeal about this film though; it's got a grittiness that lacks perhaps in the former films. Some sort of realism that is successful and an atmosphere and lighting which does it's job well.I just get the feeling they were trying for an idea which failed in this film. It seems like it could have been something great, but wasn't. I would say go into this film without Alien and Aliens in mind, but that's entirely impossible and that's why it's such a disappointment to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its just an spoiled orphan, nothing else. It could not inherit any of the virtues from ancestors!When I got the movie, gave few rapid peeps into it, and I knew how disappointing it could get, but yet could not believe myself!Anyway, other reviewers have nothing left for me to write about, so I just wanna add few points: The story is so predictable...the characters, the plot - everything was so dull, so boring...but that could still be digested. What I cud not digest was - how the SFX guys also did such an awful job, just 1 YEAR PRIOR TO 'JURRASIC PARK'? Even the creature is so boring. I have an DivX version, even there I could clearly see strong, dark-green (sometimes green) borders of the superimposed alien model. More amusing : while it is moving fast, its body is blurred, but its outlines were still sharp - as if its a paper cut! While running, it looked rather like an exceptionally thin panther. No wonder Pete Postlethwaite (last 23rd min) called it "Kitty Kitty Kitty" :-)In the same scene, he thrown his torch to the alien. he torch passes by it lighting the creature and its background. Its ridiculous why those unskilled hands even planned such an complex scene. Pl. slow down and enjoy the scene! The lighting effect must had been created frame by frame by some amateur, the contrast, darkness levels of the alien did not match with background, plus, that strong border paper-cut effect again.Last but not least: Slow down the scene when the alien was smashed by one convict, by dropping a metal door on the alien, you can see the alien falls down before the door actually hits it!The Ripley jumping into furnace is also poor, looked like a fire / flame effect from Max Payne Game.Bottom line: They taught us how not to make a sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie pulled off the ultimate 180 degrees. Imagine a movie about the Titanic without a sinking ship. It's kinda like that.In a nutshell: Too many changes. All of them are for the worse.In detail....1. Religion as the basis for lots of aimless babble 2. British Accents out of frikin nowhere 3. Hicks and Newt Die 4. Goofy prisoner's clothing 5. Ripley shaves her head bald and lives with the inmates for no good reason 6. All-male prison filled with rapists and murderers who act unusually meek for their crimes. More importantly, they are all easily forgettable and serve no purpose other than to read corny dialogue and to be slaughtered. I was rooting for the alien to shut them all up. 7. Pompous/Grandiose soundtrack 8. Inferior set designs. Why the hell are there so many corridors in a prison? Where are the cells? 9. Romance between Ripley and medical doctor within minutes. Ripley didn't even get a watch from Hicks until the third Act of Aliens. I guess she had pipes to clean. 10. Bs dialogue and pompous soundtrack turned the film into a period drama set in space. 11. (I saved the best for last) No weapons at this maximum security prison. Unlike most people I don't hate Fincher for his direction. The shots are nicely laid out most of the time. The problem is that the script was truly a despicable piece of crap. The executive(s) at Fox who green lit this should get a facehugger for Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent stand-alone effort, but should not be in league with the 1st two.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Despite the anti-climatic opening, it's somewhat effective, especially under the wing of Weaver's tormented Ripley. I am completely unbiased with ALIEN 3, the third chapter of one of the most ambitious of science-fiction sagas. I loved ALIEN enough to call it a classic. ALIENS *is* a classic, no doubt about it. Being a big fan of this series, I know I should hate ALIEN 3, arguably the weakest link of this series, and then again why shouldn't I? The film totally ruined the entire second movie with one brief opening sequence that totally betrays the ending of the first movie. The movie hasn't even started and already did it have an anti-climax. I hated this opening sequence (save Elliot Goldenthal's fine score), which is too bad, because everything that follows is rather good, that is, viewing it as a stand-alone feature. ALIEN 3 is no good compared to its superior predecessors, but even with its hated existence, the movie is not as bad as reported. In this chapter, picking up the last events from "Aliens", Ripley crash lands in Fiorina 161, a high-complex correctional facility, maximum security and home to the universe's toughest crime-lords and rapists. Ripley wasn't the only thing surprising to the prisoners, there's a faster and more terrifying alien, built and ready to kill. But Ripley also discovers a terrifying realization, which she must stop herself.The film leaves some things unexplained. Like where did the alien egg come from, and how many are the eggs on the ship (if there's only one, what was the one attached on one of the passenger's face.). Worse still is how it's anti-climatic prologue gets into our nerves. But still, you have to admire the film's superiority and creativity. The suspense also builds up to terrifying and action-packed climax. The chase through those dark corridors are well shot and swiftly edited.Anyway, it's a decent underrated effort considering the fact that it's a sequel, but it still would totally sink if compared to the first two films. I think that if they could have bought a more decent writer (who won't kill the really good characters), it could have been better. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hated it, began to dug it... Now I freakin' love it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has, in no doubt, been discussed to death but what the hell, here's my 2 cents. I first saw Alien 3 on a dodgy VHS copy sometime in 1993 and totally hated it. I was an 11 year-old kid who had some vague idea of the cultural relevance of Alien and totally dug the kick ass marines of Aliens but Alien 3 seemed like a waste of time. Then a couple of years later I caught it again on a TV release and began to warm to it slightly. Since then I saw it a few more times and the characters began to make sense but then, and thank you Fox for the genius to release the set, I finally saw that genius Fincher at work properly on the extended version in the quadrillogy set. Awesome! OK, OK, so there are plot holes here and there - did it burst outta a dog or an ox? How come Golic changes accent so abruptly? Was Bishop 2 human or android? And of course where the hell did that egg come from? But IT REALLY DOESN"T MATTER! Now I can appreciate the characterisation, the fear, the weakness of the prisoners, and the vile planet for what it is. And gee's, the alien is the best yet, not to mention the incredible puppetry (I thought for years it was CGI it was so hot). So, OK, I wish the extended edish would have had the queen burst at the end as the theatrical version did, and without the dodgy falling effect, and also Fincher shoulda had the chance to truly make his vision, but if that's all I can pick at it now from going form totally hating it, I've gotta say that's a minor. All I can say is if you haven't seen this in a while go check it out, especially the extended edish - and for the love of God forget Resurrection or AVP. Alien 3 is the best of the lot and that's why it gets 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as some would have you believe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's well known that Alien 3 got unfavourable reviews when it was first released, and also well documented that their were numerous problems during production, but I think the movies unpopularity and Luke warm reception is in part due to the first two movies. Yes, you heard me right, in part due the first two movies.Alien is commonly considered a classic, and the sequel Aliens is probably one of the greatest sequels in movie history. Now, how on earth can you top both these movies, particularly when the movie going public after being treated to such a stupendous sequel expect something of similar quality. The answer in short is....you can't. Now, I wonder how Alien 3 would have been treated if it had been the first movie in the series. Probably a lot better in my opinion. Oh, I'll grant you it's a long way from being a classic movie, but nowhere near as bad as some people make out.Let's try a little experiment, get someone who's never seen any of the Alien movies, and get them to watch Alien 3 and comment on it, or you yourself refrain from watching any of the movies in the series for a few months, then watch Alien 3 again, perhaps try the Special Edition version. You might be pleasantly surprised, and may even reassess your opinion.PS View the 4th one in the series, that'll make anything look good!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth About Alien3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first this movie turned me off, but as I grew older I have learned to love this brilliant film.First off, the script was toned for Sigourney Weaver. As heard in the commentary of Aliens. Sigourney desired to make love to the alien, to not use weapons, and to die. All of which happened, well the first one didn't really happen (unless you accept the classic shot in which it looks like the alien is kissing Ripley).Many fans of the series, also get upset about the death of Newt. I always get annoyed with that statement, because Rebecca Jorden grew up and never acted again.Alien3 is also the most cerebral of the entire series, taking the feminist subtext to its reasonable point. To a female Christ figure. Fincher and the rest of the cast &amp; crew did an excellent job in having religious concepts spread throughout the film. Thus making the suicide of Ripley more powerful and giving it a larger purpose.A special thanks must be given to Fox for butchering Fincher's original cut. This weakened much of the character development and it lost Golic.Thank you Fox. But I recommend watching this film with an open mind. If you do so, you will enjoy a beautiful film that is the perfect dark end to the Alien Trilogy.For me the series is done after that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Review refers to the Assembly Cut of Alien 3 (possible spoilers within) I recently purchased the Alien Quadriolgy (19.99 at HMV, get it while you can) and watched the Assembly Cut of the film. This was the first of the series I was keen to re-watch. I did like the theatrical cut and thought it had good elements but lacked something that would allow itself to be immersed totally into the previous two films (forget Resurrection and its camp comic-book rubberyness) I also didn't care for many of the characters first time around. However, these elements can be found in the re-cut - as it was meant to be seen. The opener of Ripley being found on the beach and Clemens discovering her body on an alien, grey world where even the beach looked extraterrestrial and unwelcome set the mood perfectly. Characters that previously represented simple fodder for the Alien were fattened out like calves to the slaughter. A notable example of this is Golic (a superb Paul McGann) who as one of the more deranged prisoners, forms strange relationship with the Alien increasing its spookiness ten fold when it gives him a blood stained grin after killing two his comrades, suggesting to me that it might have exerted control over him. Why Fox decided to edit these scenes is beyond me, perhaps a lack of simple intelligence? There are also numerous cuts that lasted only seconds in length, but added welcome tension to certain scenes such as Clemens death. The foot stamping childishness of 'Aliens' fanboys (suspiciously under the 18 age certificate or R rating recommended) that moan about Hicks and Newt's death (Ripleys surrogate family) is simply tiresome. It was a shock they died indeed, but all the better for it. I want a horrific opener, I want grizzly out comings. The First Alien film was so Freudian in its approach that it was going to be hard to follow-up as a psychological horror flick. Nobody wanted multiple giant phalli, and vaginal like eggs that germinated body raping beasts en-mass in a retro-futuristic landscape. No, that would be excess. Instead we have Aliens en-mass except, you guessed it, with guns. Almost as though Cameron was so scared of the first film he decided to sleep with a revolver under his pillow for evermore, a truly American film. If you're scared of it... shoot it. However, I loved Aliens; it's certainly a film and a world that draws you in. It encapsulates the horror of what the Alien was (despite removing the more pshycho sexual elements to its design) but also imbues with it with a childish sense that all things can be solved with firearms. This not having necessarily the same sense of vulnerability and possible fear of invasion that the first and third represented.Dillons' character is fleshed out more with added room allowed for his religious ranting and the redemptive piousness of the convicts (Does one of the convicts sacrifice himself out of guilt for his attempted rape of Ripley?) It only serves to underline the analogy of the Alien with Death and Sexuality. Whether this is intended at all or not might be moot. Or it could just be about a monster with a head shaped like a penis and creatures that impregnate people who die when they give birth The re-cut splits the firestorm scene into two parts as in the original they manage to capture the Alien. Indeed, There are some dubious effects shots, but this is forgiven, as they are not often and limited in length. The cinematography is gorgeous, comparable to Derek Vanlint's/Scott's' in Alien. Whilst less of a genre leap than Cameron was willing to attmempt, the pshychological undertones of the first Alien are developed upon here with a religious, sacrificial or Messianic emphasis placed upon certain characters. The score of Alien3 is poignant in all the right places, especially in Ripley's suicide (also better cut here than the theatrical release), though it might be a little harsh to say slightly overblown in its sudden key changes in some sequences.All in all Alien was only a B-film in the hands of ingenious and highly creative people, but it did present us with a side to our imagination that was pure horror, stuff of nightmares and good literature. This tradition has since sorely been trampled by the 'Alien vs Predator' film and, to some extent, 'Alien Resurrection'. Fincher's effort was a brave attempt/success to regain that sense of horror and fear that the first film captured so beautifully.It's a shame Fincher has lost his enthusiasm for the film after his battle with Fox Fincher, be proud!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an odd third installment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the third installment in the alien series, Ripley (Weaver) crash-lands on a planet where dangerous convicts (among them are rapists) live in an abandoned mining facility. And of course an alien managed to arrive there also.This movie is certainly not as good as ALIEN or ALIENS but it resembles more like ALIEN. In Fincher's (Se7en, Fight Club) directorial debut, ALIEN ? was given a grimy and depressing aspect; perfect for and ALIEN film. Thee sets are well built and impressive. The action is, in a way, original. Though the special effects are so-so. The characters are okay but they don't get to develop much. Although it's not received well, you have to understand that when Fincher arrived on the project, he had no script but he had to shoot and he was under pressure AND it was his first movie to direct. I highly recommend to see the "Assembly Cut" of the movie, since it's usually considered better in many different ways than the theatrical release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the movie that jumps so far from the original two movies that you wonder if it is the same movie.The movie begins pretty well (and a little disturbing), but turns into an action movie without a lot of action. But, then ends perfectly. The middle isn't as bad as it sounds. Don't listen to the others. It's a good movie, just not really an alien movie. It sorta fits, but the first two movies were connected by memories of the planet and stuff, but this one is connected with Bishop, the alien, and the people in the beginning.Good movie, but not classic good like the other two.

		<fullReview>'Alien?' had so much potential, yet so much to live up to. The first film in the series helped define a whole new way to give a mass audience science fiction on a grand scale, while the second film managed to provide even more thrills and spills than a sequel had ever done. How on earth was a third movie, all those years later, supposed to live upto its predeccessors?It appears this movie was cursed from day one. The script was written, rewritten and rewritten time and time again, and the director, who has since gone on to prove his incredible talent with the likes of 'Fight Club' and 'Se7en', was effectively fired from the project and not allowed the reshoots he needed from a studio that attempted to control his every shot.What was originally released in 1992 was a confused mess. It showed obvious potential, but lacked any sense of direction and purpose. Sub plots started and were abandoned, and entire scenes appeared disjointed.As it stands, the theatrical version is by far not the worst film I've ever seen, and I enjoyed it from time to time, but on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd have given it no more than a 5 - a sort of mindless popcorn fodder to pass two hours every few years.The new 'special edition', released in the 'Alien Quadrilogy' boxed set, and now on dvd, restores a great number of scenes, finishes off some of the abandoned effects shots, and fleshes out a previously hollow film. The movie now has purpose - its religious and moral message a lot more understandable, characters make more sense, and while nothing can be done to improve on the lack of any real action, part of the need for that is simply because the previous film in the series was an all out frag-fest.A lot of people are put off by the film because its dialogue-heavy, there's no guns or big weapons to splatter aliens with... indeed there's only one alien as opposed to a planet of them... and most of the cast are British. The trick is that if you're going to compare it to any of the series, compare it to 'Alien', while 'Alien Ressurection' is the real sequel to 'Aliens'. Don't go into it expecting another action fest, and approach it with an open mind(preferably a British one - I guess we 'get it' easier), and there is much to enjoy. The cast are all excellent - some of England's finest actors are on show here, and Sigourney Weaver is excellent as ever. Her final scene, notably different in this version of the film [though arguably this is the one change that isn't needed!], is surprisingly poignant, and the film still manages to pack a fair punch for a [then] 13 year old saga.Do yourself a favour - get hold of a copy of the special edition, and look at it with an open mind - you just may find yourself loving this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Problematic but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let's start with the problems:1. The biggest problem starts right out of the box in that I, and I feel most, will have a hard time believing that the alien queen somehow managed to lay (or carry on board and plant) two eggs when a) she never left the hanger and b) how could she carry or lay eggs when all she does is fight Ripley and get sucked out of the cargo door? So, the whole premise of the movie is flawed from the start.But let's say that you can swallow all of that, that you can believe that by some incredible act of the alien gods, the queen was able to somehow get not one, but two alien eggs on board. If you can do that, you still have to get past the poor special effects, namely the creature.2. The second main problem is that the creature changes sizes depending on if they are using the puppet creature or the CGI creature. The puppet creature is huge while the CGI creature is much smaller (I've seen thicker legs on a 9 year old boy!) and sometimes resembles a green jello mold. There is a scene in particular where the CGI creature is on the ceiling in a corridor and looks not only TINY but appears to made out of pee-green jello. Note I wrote "pee" and not "pea".3. There were obviously two versions of the creature other than puppet and CGI. I say that because initially, the creature was supposed to spring from an oxen, not a dog. However, they changed it for final release to have the creature burst from a pet rottweiler. This may account for the varying sizes of the creature, but it still adds to the confusion and unbelievability.Overall, the movie is watchable. With so many lame movies, especially lame sci-fi movies, coming out of Hollywood, this one doesn't look so bad.However, I still prefer the Ridley Scott philosophy of "if you can't make the shot believable, find another shot". The director of this let-down, should have followed that sage advice. It's ironic that in the late 1970's they could make a flawless classic like "Alien" with incredibly believable special effects, then crank out a lame sequel like Alien 3 in the late 1990's. You'd think that the effects would have gotten even better...</fullReview>

Dutton, Charles Dance, Danny Webb, Paul McGann, and of course Sigourney Weaver.If possible, check out the longer extended version available as part of the recent Alien Quadrilogy boxed set.

		<shortDescription>Fincher did great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe everyone who keeps saying that Alien 3 brought the saga to a halt (not because of ending). I think that Alien 3 is a lot cooler than the original movie but it still carries that classic fear of a just 1 single creature (which went lost in Camerons 'Aliens', though this movie turned out as the best of all anyway so it doesn't really matter)...I know the story that says Fincher himself never liked the movie. And I guess it's not as amazing as he's later productions ('The Game', 'Seven', 'Fight Club' etc.) but it still turned out as a very important part of the saga, and it really is a GOOD movie. And this is an early Fincher-flick, we can't judge him based upon his later productions. He didn't have all those movies behind him at the time of Alien 3. So stop thinking "DAVID FINCHER'S Alien 3", instead, try to think of it as "David Fincher's ALIEN 3". It's just another movie. And I think fincher did great. After all, The first movie was epic, the second movie was like the first one kicked up to a speed of 300 lightyears per second, and it added more action to the saga than T2 did for the Terminator serie. Now take another look at Alien 3. Remember the Alien in the ceiling chasing after the prisoners as they atempt to lour it into the furnace. Remember Bishops shredded corpse taken of a local garbageheep. Remember Ripley's shaved head. This is kick-ass movie! And as far as Ripley-fans should be concerned; isn't this the greatest Ripley portrated through out the saga? I mean, Girl power a side... the Ripley clone in episode 4 almost felt silly, but in Alien 3? Ripley could sit down and arm-wrestle the queen herself based purely on that shaved-head-look. And she would take the queen down. Period.PS. I can't wait to see the Directors Cut version (ooohps, sorry, that should be "extended workprint"-version) that should be included in the ALIEN QUADRILOGY boxset due available sometime around november (?).DS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ALIEN 3 is definitely not as good as ALIEN or ALIENS, but it is not a bad film. I liked the whole idea of it being set on a prison and it worked well in the film. David Fincher does a good job directing this one, and there is plenty of good camera work throughout the whole movie, especially during the action sequences. The film does have a few flaws. I did'nt like the how they used a computer generated Alien rather than the puppets. ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** I did'nt like how they killed off Hicks at the beginning since you are happy at the end of ALIENS that he survived and then he just died at the beginning of this one. Also, they kill off Charles Dance's character, the doctor, very quickly, even though it appears that he is becoming a central character. ***END OF SPOILERS***. Despite these few flaws, ALIEN 3 is a good entry in to the series and is a lot better than ALIEN RESURRECTION. 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where Alien was taught, claustrophobic, original and downbeat, the sequal was flashy, overheated, cliched and like a video game, this third installment falls between the two. Not as gripping or original (how could it be) as the first, not as dumbed down as the second. Not a bad film, generally and maybe underrated in the same way that Cameron's ALIENS was over rated? Weaver is once again rock solid as the tough but tragic Ripley, Charles Dance is sinister as the medical officer and Brian Glover sounds all wrong with his unfamiliar 'posh' accent (normally he played a stock line of dour or dim Yorkshireman with a strong north-of-england accent as in AMERICAN WEIRWOLF IN LONDON). The plot is rather weird, the prison planet-turned interstellar monestry/factory/powerstation isn't fully exploited or explained - neither is the reappearance of that damned Alien. But that aside it moves along quite well and the gore-fest of the previous movie is thankfully avoided with rather more suspence and a lot less explosions! Weaver with shaven head is virtually asexual and the plot line that a woman on this all-male station would cause havoc is a little hard to accept when the woman in question looks like a man, speaks and fights like a man and has all the sex appeal of a potato sack (sorry Sigourney but you look much better with long hair!)- but then these guys have been in prison a long while I suppose! I watched all three movies in sequence, for the first time, over the course of a week and while the series hardly goes from strength to strength in terms of basic quality , it does poses a certain drawing power, which no doubt explains the seemingly impossible appearence of a fourth installment, it's amazing what box office returns can produce! All in all not a classic movie, but much better than it's predecessor. Perhaps if Ridley Scott had remained at the helm of the entire series it would have been better?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel it is a shame that Alien 3 is so underrated. It is nowhere near as bad as people say it is. While it certainly isn't better then the first two, it is a very good sequel. David Fincher ( who would later direct Seven and Fight Club ) was not afraid to make his own unique contribution to the Alien saga and there is more material that exists that was cut out of the film. If the film was issued as a director's cut, then I think people would like it more. The concepts of a prison planet which has a handful of remaining prisoners who have turned to religion to pass the time and that there are no heavy weapons on the planet are very interesting. The Alien effects are very good when done by traditional methods but CGI is not a godsend! These scenes look terrible as it is easy to see that it is just a Computer Image. However, the cast give excellent performances especially Ms. Weaver as Ripley and the prison planet looks stunning. It's very impressive for a 9 year old film but the CGI is absolute crap! Overall, it is a film worth seeing and is not a mess like everyone says it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well done David Fincher for having the courage to rip up some of what was established by the film's two predecessors and instead work from a template that allowed him to bring his own unique vision to the screen.(SPOILERS)Having Ripley sacrifice herself at the end would have been a masterstroke had she not been brought back for a fourth outing, and the restriction of weapons on the prison planet provided a nice contrast to James Cameron's more gung-ho installment. As for Hicks and Newt, these were characters introduced and developed by another director in a totally different context. The thing I've always liked about the franchise is that each film is markedly different by virtue of having a new director. Usually people are the first to complain if a sequel offers the audience nothing different from what has been seen before. You can't have it both ways...I'm not trying to claim that this is the best of the series, far from it, but I think that this film gets unfairly slated because Fincher had the guts to try and do something different with it. I can picture the dismay on the faces of the studio chiefs when they learned about Ripley's fate. It's kinda sad that they felt the need to concoct a fourth installment because it probably wasn't due to artistic inspiration, but rather an excuse to squeeze another few drops from such a lucrative cash-cow.Much of what is on display here is good, the shaving of Ripley's hair robs her of any femininity she may have had, which is kinda ironic since some would say that the ultimate symbol of femininity is childbirth, and she has something growing inside her, but it ain't human! The prison planet is a beautifully constructed oppressive environment which gives Fincher the dark and gloomy motif he's since proved he's au fait with, and the supporting cast was nicely chosen, providing plenty of opportunity for exploiting the tense dramatic situation, rather than resorting to the standard stalk'n' slash scenario all the time, (which the film still doesn't skimp on, for the more gore-hungry amongst you)IMHO, fans of the franchise should accept its continual evolving nature and concentrate instead on praising Fincher's film for what it is, a bold, worthy addition to an almost classic pantheon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 is a wonderfully unique and gothic addition to the Alien Saga. The ambience penetrates everything, and lasts till the end. People who don't see this film for the message it delivers, probably will complain that this film is too gruesome, sombre, or whatever. However, it has an underlying ethical meaning, and is rich in symbolism, which is for you to discover.The third installment of this thread reinstates the terror of the first movie, but delivers it in an altogether original manner. This is no action flick, it is a movie with its own genre - a genre that was nearly lost in the action of the second film. Once again, the alien has become a terrifying and sexual predator. Ripley's character is fleshed out, even more, and we truly feel her Christ-like sacrifice. True Aliens fans will love this, but those that came only because of the guns and claws in the first sequel, won't appreciate the true depth of this beautiful film. It is my wish that, one day, they will release the director's cut of this film, so it can be seen in its entirety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film by David Fincher is a step away from Alien and Aliens, but that doesn't mean it's a step back. The movie is different, with an almost European experience regarding the Alien saga. (Thus because most of the supporting cast is European). The atmosphere is dark and seemingly claustophobic with a quick-as-a-whip killing machine decimating the defenseless convict population.The supporting cast is terrific with Charles Dutton as the Gothic Brute and leader of men, Dylan. Charles Dance as the medical official with the shadey past. Paul McGann plays a more psychotic and isolated loner prisoner named Golic. Ralph brown and Brian Glover hold the place together as the two men in charge of the rusty complex. Pete Postlethwaite, Philip Davis, Christopher John Fields, and namely Daniel Webb are terrific as other prisoners.The film is suspenceful and even if one knows the ending, it is still an entertaining surprise as to who lives at the end, adding a bit of irony to the film with that aspect. I would rate this film a 4 out of 5 stars because although I did not enjoy it as much as the earlier Alien films, it was a wild and entertaining flick right up to the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ALIEN 3 MOVIE SHORT MINI REVIEW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1995, I saw Alien 3 for the first time on FOX as a movie premiere for the network. I was a pretty big fan for the series but when I saw this I thought this movie was the motive and the weapon that help The Alien saga to commit suicide. I have bought the Alien Legacy about an year ago, but ever since the purchase I have never opened the Alien 3 movie cause of the bad memory of it. Recently I have seen it once again and this time I paid real good attention of the movie's ideas, background, settings, and the character's interaction and dialogue. After I have seen I was pretty amazed of what I saw. The setting/background is awesome, the story plot fits.(I have some of the other reviews and they were questioning the idea of how the egg got on the Sulaco. I got this reason from a book of facts on Aliens, but I have came to two conclusions. Aliens can carry their eggs, so that they can plant them strategically in spots to form a colony. Another was that during a emergency or a crisis and queen alien can lay eggs without the huge thing hanging from her butt, but only can lay very few.)Another reason why this movie is good is because it shows more character development for Ripley. This movie also showed more things about the Aliens Universe such as, more sight and concerns about the Company and their involvement and the way aliens work. Please I urge you to watch it again but this time don't look for action but look for the art of the story and director. I suggest to get the unedited version which shows more action and character development. Review Grade: 9 out of 10. DRAWBACKS:The theatrical release was heavily edited so they're were major drawbacks of the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.Alien3 is a return to the low-key realism of the first, and as such is the most underrated film in the series. Frequently scorned, Weaver had to be talked into doing the fourth after this, yet after the flashy Resurrection she has no reservations about a fifth. Also, on the "Making Of" trailer on the Resurrection tape, this movie is marginalised, scarcely mentioned, an embarrassment to the series, best overlooked.Why? I've never fully understood the reason. One of the main gripes seems to be the death of Newt. I mean, for flip's sake! The girl'd be about fifteen when this was made ? that'd be some statis booth! So Ripley finds herself alone on a penal colony that has turned to religion. The colony is filled, as in the first film, with decent actors, and Weaver's presence there puts their vow of chastity at risk. However, it's just as well the rape fear comes from the monks, as it won't come from the alien this time, and this is the biggest flaw in the narrative. The alien won't kill Ripley as she's pregnant with an alien baby. So therefore there is no tension. Ripley is safe, and we know the rest of the cast are just there to be wiped out anyway. (Though again as in Alien, the swiftness of top-level actors' demise are startling. Charles Dance cops it almost as soon as John Hurt did, thirteen years earlier). The film concentrates less on the aliens (who aren't very scary at all this time, thanks to some seriously ropy CGI), but more on Ripley. Maybe killing her off at the start would improve this story, as it's starting to wear a little thin now. What is Ripley, indestructible? Well, no, and that's another bugbear for the fans. As at the end of the film (which should have been called Ripley3), she commits suicide. Of course, I didn't realise till I read it somewhere that this is a culmination of the Christ analogy running through the film. Now, I said the film is underrated, yet all I've done so far is discuss its low points. There are good bits, notably the acting (Dance particularly) and the characterisation. For Alien3 is an adult film, with realistic coding. The characters are genuine, rather than the juvenile cut-outs of the second. Dance in particular gives a dignified performance, while Ripley's death gives a grandiose poetry to the climax. Criminally underrated, the direction and camera angles are well above standard, and the dark, industrial settings magnificent. The set-up with the criminals converted to monks is original, and the character dynamics dealt with well. The effects are, as you might imagine, as improved upon Aliens as that film was on the original. The space shots are exquisite, while the depth in the movie reinstates the literary bent the second had discarded. Now if only they hadn't used naff CGI for the alien. Maybe that's the reason why there are no genuine moments of horror. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I think happened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing that all fans of the Alien series notice about this movie is the glaring flaw at the very beginning of the film. The egg...how did it get on the Sulaco? An easy answer is the queen, but most people consider that impossible and refuse to accept it as an explanation. So here is my explanation (like it or not, I really don't care...I'm just doing this for fun): While Ripley was rescuing Newt, before Bishop started circling (you'll remember at the end of Aliens she thought he left her, when in fact he was circling because the platform became shaky and unstable), an alien sneaked onto the rescue ship with two eggs (yes, two, despite the fact that only one was shown at the beginning of Alien?, which explains how the face-hugger got two beings--two different eggs mean two different face-huggers), hid them, and immediately left the ship. Soon after, the eggs open and the face-huggers leave the rescue ship and search the Sulaco until they find the sleeping survivors. And there you have it, my simple explanation. Point is, they never explain to you what happened, so you have to use your imagination. And if you can get over the flawed beginning, it's actually a pretty good film. It's too bad about the scenes that were reportedly cut (see "alternate versions") though. They would have made a good movie great. Overall, not as good as its predecessors, but definitely worthy of being the third (and what should have been the final) chapter in the Alien series.My rating for Alien? (1992): 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most suspenseful of the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first one was the horror flick. The second was the action flick. This one was the suspense/character piece flick. The fourth one was the Hollywood flick.Honestly, I don't see what people miss in this one; maybe people just aren't patient anymore. This is closer to the first than the second, and almost as good, except that Alien was pure psychological horror, with startling moments and Alien 3 was pure suspense as you waited to see where the characters were going and how this crew of this isolated, miserable rock would be able to cope with this unstoppable creature. How people like the first and not the third, I'll never know. One receives praise while the other is knocked for the exact same reasons. For example: They were both slow-paced, they both had one alien, they both centered on the characters, rather than just setting up for the next action scene. I loved Aliens, but that's pretty what it was. What befuddles me even more is how many people claim the fourth one is better. I mean, an Alien film with sight gags? COME ON!! At least this had a serious note and competent writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best in the series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Earlier I have read a comment that this movie is a bad apple in the series. Personally, I think it is the best. Yes, Ms. Weaver played an excellent role, but that is not the point. The main point of the movie to me was the queen chestburster implanted in her. I mean, she has a one of the creatures she has been fighting for so long growing in her. Imagine knowing that you have one growing in you ready to break its way out. And the fact that it is a queen burster is ironic. The queens the one responsible for the countless deaths of humans and one is growing in her. Another irony present in the movie is when the dog alien is being born as the bible is read. Almost makes this alien a bit different, yes? The dark mood of the movie and the fact that the entire complex lacks defences gives the movie a bit of suspence. One example is the scenes where the alien is chasing the prisoners through the lead molding hallways. The fact that Ripley dies in the end is almost what makes the movie better. In real life, you don't always make it. But the fact she died with such dignity and honor is what makes the audience have a new "respect" for her. All in all, this was one of the best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great debut for one of the best directors today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher is a genius. He creates an environment unparalleled to any other director today, with the possible exception of Tim Burton. Many people didn't like this film because it focused more on the people than the action, but I felt that by bringing us in to the characters better it made us feel more for them. It even made the movie a little bit scarier. The Alien series has featured great directors from the beginning. Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner), James Cameron (Titanic, Terminator) and Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, City of Lost Children) are all brilliant directors. David Fincher can hold his own against them, maybe even surpass them. Alien3 was not the best of the series but it's without a doubt worthy of the Alien title. Anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand how this film only rates a 5,8. I bought the Alien trilogy on video while I hadn't ever seen an Alien film, and I was surprised by every single one of them. The first one builds up the tension nice and easy. The second one is a straight action film. But the third does what you'd expect an alien movie to do: It scared me half to death. David (Se7en) Fincher delivers a brilliant job by actually making us feel like one of those prisoners stuck on a planet with no guns and one deadly alien. The special effects are effective but not overdone; the scenes in which the alien chases the prisoners (upside down) are among the most realistic and terrifying CGI creations ever produced. Overall, this is one of those horror movies that truly deliver, and it definitely deserves to rate higher than a 6. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than critics have said</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the good things about the Alien saga is that every instance in the series has its own vision. The first one was a class 1 gothic horror movie, the second showed us a war in space. The fourth one gave us a satirical comedy with splatter elements. And the third? Well, it is not that easy to categorize as it shows much more of a personal vision than a genre.Alien 3 seems to me the psychological society play. Fincher is more interested in the drama of the small group of people than in the action sequences. This led some critics to write that the final chase is poorly staged. Seeing it now -- some 8 years after its initial release -- the scene is not bad but was just unusally filmed. What wonder since Fincher is one of the new breed of directors, trying to invent new perspectives. Like the one of the Alien with its distorting big "head eye".Funny enough, if you watch Aliens and Alien 3 directly after another, the non-professional fighters in the Alien 3 behave more professional than most of the professionally trained Marines in Aliens. Yes, there are some whining scenes but when it comes to fight the inmates in Alien 3 do their duty. which cannot be said of the Marines who take much longer to even try to save their lives. and even than it's just some of them (and there are not many who survive the first Alien attack) who seem to remember what they are there for.The overall look of Alien 3 is great and shows us how to tend a Future vision without loosing grip on reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third of the Alien saga is also perhaps the most critically mauled of the series. Almost inevitably, it fails to live up to the first two films, but Alien 3 showcases the strikingly visual style of director Fincher: dimly lit corridors criss-cross a claustrophobic prison facility where there are no weapons, and from which there is no escape. True, the script is largely second-rate, and allegedly not helped by interference from 'suits' at 20th Century Fox; true too, the acting is rarely better than adequate, save the ever-reliable Weaver, minus hair this time around. However Alien 3 would have made an acceptable conclusion to the Alien - and more importantly the Ripley - saga, had it not been for Jeunet and his Alien: Resurrection, which left the series once again in limbo after a truly corny ("I'm a stranger here myself...") ending.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant and powerful, far better than one could expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could have been a plain sequel, like it happens often. But the third (out of four) movie of the "Alien" series is definitely far better that I ever expected. Very different from what Ridley Scott, James Cameron and Jean-Pierre Jeunet did, "Alien 3" is a very powerful drama. The dark fate of poor lieutenant Ripley is beautifully told and almost matches a Shakespearian tragedy. "Alien 3" is a story with very strong characters. A story about tolerance, courage in danger, the fear of the unknown, the danger of misled science, the importance of religion: all interesting subjects. "Alien 3" is a splendidly directed movie, with many magnificient pictures and perfect actors. Sigourney Weaver is more impressive than ever as Ellen Ripley. Charles Dance is subtle and moving as Dr. Clemens. The others (especially Charles S. Dutton) all have a very strong presence and make their characters no easy to forget. All the same, "Alien 3" does not forget about the chase with the monster. In that part, the film has good ideas (like the way the alien moves and the shots that show its viewpoint) and produces real good suspense, just like the the others three episodes. To sum up, "Alien 3" is so brilliant that I think it deserves to stay in the future as a major science-fiction film, just like the first episode (directed by Ridley Scott) did in 1979. It was shot in 1992 by a unknown 28-year old man, who was directing his first movie: David Fincher. A man who proved with just one film how great a director he was (he did again later, especially with his recent "Fight club")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves more respect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning, Spoilers ahead...)When I originally saw this film in the theatre, I remember feeling a certain ambivalence towards it. However, after buying the "Alien Legacy" box set on DVD I have had chance to realise how powerful it really is.I can understand how many people hated it. I'm sure they were expecting another overblown and so very 80s spectacle like "Aliens", which to be honest while that is an entertaining flick, I found it was almost devoid of emotion (except the relationship between Ripley and Newt). Killing off the survivors of that episode was brave and probably automatically made it unpopular with the blockbuster audience.Overall, this film is an exercise in futility. I'm so glad they didn't make this a happy ending, which was refreshing knowing Hollywood's cowardice in portraying an idealistic world where "everything works out OK in the end". It deserves respect for that alone.On to the film itself - beautifully shot, the atmosphere of doom is relentless. The opening sequence is nightmarish and effective, thanks to Elliot Goldenthal's haunting score, it sets the tone immediately for what is to follow.Weaver puts in another outstanding performance, her scene with Newt in the morgue is absolutely heart-wrenching. While character development isn't up to much - the largely British prisoners are pretty unlikeable - I don't think it is an character ensemble piece. This is Ripley's film, her final battle with the monster that has been in her life for so long, she "can't remember anything else".No weapons? Thank God for that in my opinion - otherwise it would just have been a retread of the second film. This time they have to beat the alien with their brains, using themselves as bait! Scary stuff.The film is full of good moments. The funeral scene juxtaposed with the alien's "birth" and Dillons speech about "new life" is powerful, and the music makes it quite moving and unnerving at the same time.Charles Dance registers strongly as the morose doctor, and has real chemistry with Ripley. It's a shame he was killed so soon, but that just serves to remind us how the Alien has completely destroyed Ripley's life, taking away everyone she has ever cared about.The bait and chase sequence is exciting, showing the alien's point of view as it scampers along walls and ceilings at high speed. The effects in the main are good. They include the first CGI alien, and it shows. Just after it has killed Clemens and rears up to face Ripley it looks very dodgy, but the usual puppet work is as effective as ever. One great death sequence is where Golic, one of the prisoners, is splattered with blood from another who has just been attacked, and shows the bloodied alien giving its trademark toothy grin at him. Menacing stuff.The ending is well done, I've always liked that. You feel tremendous sympathy and sadness for Ripley, but relief that it is over for her. It's a fitting end to Weaver's character. A journey by a woman who goes completely by the book (as in "Alien") to one who defies the might of The Company (the real enemy) at the cost of her life in order to save humanity. Once again, the music during the final scenes is great, it has the power to bring a lump to the throat.Much respect to David Fincher for delivering a very adult sci-fi drama that demands a great deal more of its audience than most pictures of its kind. It's all too close to the real tragedies that surround us, which I guess is why it seems to be so unpopular. The tag line for "Aliens" was "This Time Its War". I think the tag line for this one should have been "This Time Its Grown Up".As for its place in the series, I consider it second to the original, which I think is still the scariest of them all. As for "Alien Resurrection", that's just a run of the mill sci-fi thriller with a dozen xenomorphs along for the ride...</fullReview>

It wasn't mysterious at all, I didn't scare, it was actually like an action movie. It reminded me of Terminator. Everybody had a gun and was killing aliens. Anyway, Alien 3 reminded me of Alien.

		<fullReview>Warning: possible spoilerAlien3 is a good movie, but could have been much better!I cant understand why so many scenes were deleted. I strongly support the idea of releasing a special edition of this movie. If Fox did it with Camerons Aliens, why not with Alien3, considering that the missing scenes will improve a lot the movie adding more action and suspense that a lot people missed from the predecesors.As for the continuity between Aliens and Alien3, I also complained when I first saw Alien3 about how the heck a facehugger went into the ship in the conclusion of Aliens, and also how the facehugger does Ripley and the dog in the sequel. Well, the only possible answer is that the Queen in Aliens, took two eggs and left then inside the ship. It is the only way.To support this, I say that through all the series the aliens have showed that they are VERY intelligent, so the Queen in Aliens sure thought, "If you kill me, you won't kill the species, Ill leave you a little present", and left the eggs in the Sulaco before nailing Bishop! Otherwise to this explanation...there is no explanation.So, Alien3 is not a bad movie, it is dark, has suspense, manages very well the Ripley character and the no-escape situation with the alien around, and like all good sci-fi films, it shows us in a convincing way a possible and controversial future of humanity.Anyway, the story deserved a better treatment, hope someday we can view the complete movie, as it was intended to be. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

It does not have the suspense of Alien or the intensity of Aliens, but it had a new dramatic depth to Ripley's character.

		<fullReview>I must have a funny brain. I thought that Alien was excellent. The idea of the Alien being was introduced here and so in my opinion this one is the best of the trilogy and always will be. Now this in itself is probably not too far from other peoples opinions but where mine differ completely is in that I thought Aliens was pretty bad. It completely destroyed the idea of the Alien. In the first film the Alien killed an entire crew without any trouble and Ripley was only able to kill it through a huge bit of luck. Now in the second there's Aliens dying all over the place. I just sat watching thinking "What the hell is going on?" There's acid blood spraying everywhere, there's Hicks unloading his shotgun in that Aliens mouth and toward the end it just gets ridiculous with Ripley going into a big hive full of thousands of them and not even being attacked until she finds the queen. I don't care about these marines advanced weapons or training. Its like the aliens have suddenly become stupid insects which are nothing like the alien in Alien. So in Aliens I found disappointment and when I arrived at Alien 3 I wasn't expecting much but what I got was far closer to the goodness of the first film than Aliens. Once again the Alien is returned to the powerful monster it was designed to be. I really cant see one truly bad thing in this film. The acting is excellent, each scene is excellently shot and that music really does stir. How can anyone not love this film? I even know a few people who hate it.</fullReview>

The acting by Weaver, Charles Dance and the entire prison cast is first rate, the dank and dirty sets of the Fiorina "Fury" 161 prison colony are inventive and the surrealistic dark dreamlike mood of the film has a strong resonnating effect; (a funeral scene about 20 minutes into the movie intercut with the birthing process of the new alien is powerfully haunting and effective). I guess my only serious complaint with this film is that the special effects, especially the creature effects, aren't quite up to quality standards. Not as good as the first two, "Alien 3" is definitely better than the fourth entry which should have found a better story and a better director. I give this film a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i loved the premise of the third alien film. take back down to just one alien and give the characters hardly any weapons to defend themselves with. once i saw the film though my hopes were quickly shattered. WARNING SPOILERS:first of all, the movie completely betrays it's audience. the 2 most interesting characters that escaped with ripley in the second film are killed off right at the beginning. and bishop is delegated to just having a cameo appearance. then to top it all off they kill Ripley at the end. basically, they killed the series.taken as it's own film, it's just barely slightly above average. David Fincher's direction was refreshing. and the acting was solid as usual. special effects wise, it's a letdown. the alien is hardly shown and when they do decide to show it you still can't really get a clear look at the creature.i absolutely hated this movie the first time i saw it but as time as gone on my hatred for it has softened somewhat. i read a few years back about the difficulties that David Fincher had with the studio not supporting him. so in hindsight he made the best movie that he could and i applaud him for it.James Cameron had actually written an aliens on earth script but when he submitted his budget the studio said no way and he left the third movie to david fincher and a poor script.still, the movie does have a couple of nice touches and once it finally starts picking up there are a few genuinely tense scenes. still, it just barely rises above mediocrity definitely the weakest of the 4.rating:5.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm as much of a fan of the Alien Legacy as the next ummm fan of the Alien Legacy, but this movie is a mess! Yet, a very stylish and sometimes entertaining mess.David Fincher is one of my favortie up-and-coming directors. I shouldn't categorize him just as an 'up-and-coming' director, but after four features he doesn't seem to have the recognition he deserves. This was his first feature film, and his trademark ink-black vision is printed all over this film.Ripley finds herself on a planet full of male convicts with shaved heads. It seems like after all her battles with the infamous alien creatures, she can only get as good as this dank god-for-saken hellhole. Very few of these men (who, bizzarely enough, mostly consist of Brits) have any tolerance for her. They are 'born-again', have changed their evil ways, and have no need for women. They either shun her away or attempt to rape her. This makes the movie so bleak, it's hard to watch.But Fincher's uncanny style is so interesting you keep watching. The alien finally appears via a pet dog's stomach (cool!) and now the men are looking at Ripley to help them out. This goes to the usual shenanigans, but there are some differences. There is one cool attempt at burning the alien, which shows off that the alien can move at a rapid speed not only on the ground but also on walls and cielings. But I must go back to Fincher's style again. It's so dreadful, its absolutely hypnotic and breathtaking. The little girl from ALIENS is dead, her body naked and white in the autopsy scene. The only human lover Ripley has ever had in the series (which seems to have lasted for more than 100 years due to hyper-sleep!) is killed off by the alien. Ripley recovers from the landing ship in the beginning of the movie with one nasty, bloodshot eye (once you see it you'll know what I mean) and she has to shave her head(!) to fit in with the guys. Also the alien itself seems blacker in this film, probably due to Fincher's signature use of print on film.In conclusion, this movie doesn't amount to the first two. But that doesn't mean it's bad. It's very different, but that doesn't mean it isn't faithful to the Alien saga. It's very disturbing, but deserves a look at, especially for Fincher fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more honest sequel than Aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien3 felt a whole lot more like Alien to me than did Aliens. Aliens is Ripley as Rambo. What made the first movie so good was that the humans outnumbered the enemy but were helpless to stop it. Alien3 returns to that feel. Aliens was an action film while Alien and Alien3 are both really more SciFi/Horror films. Set on a convict world with no weapons and little external contact Alien3 has a good mix of feeling "in the future" but somehow very primitive. David Fincher does dark very well. The Alien has changed a bit physically but it still has the same bad attitude and need for food. The loss of Newt and Hicks didn't bother me at all the way others seem disturbed by it. Dead folks are just part and parcel of this series. The best part of the entire movie is the final "chase" scene through a maze or corridors beneath the iron works. The chase rapidly becomes disorienting and even more so when you shift to alien-cam and the aliens runs up onto the ceiling with you. The effect is outstanding all the more so because it throws you into the sense of the poor convicts trying to figure out which corridor they are in and where the alien is in relation to them. It is a wonderful effect and one that Fincher carries elements of with him into the chase scene in Se7en.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film a lot and am still in disbelief of how much badmouthing it receives. I watch it plainly for the visual style, atmosphere, and production values. It has some of the most chilling scenes of carnage ever. For example, the scene prisoner Boggs is murdered in front of prisoner Golic. The alien giving an evil grin after dumping a large amount of blood onto Golic's face. Or how about that scene where Ripley's relationship with Clemens almost progresses but instead ends with the poor doctor having his skull bitten into. This has to be the most artistic, emotionally charged, and beautifully made motion picture. Now if only FOX could release a director's cut!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so Alien 3 wasn't quite as good as Alien or wasn't nearly as good as Aliens but in my own opinion it was far better than that bloody terrible Alien Resurrection. First off it had that creepy Alien atmosphere, you know that claustrophobic feeling that you felt in the previous two. Another reason to why I like it was it was much darker in a way (Ripley killing herself), and David Fincher delivered it well. It was well acted and again Sigourney Weaver was great as Ellen Ripley. There is a lot of mixed reviews about this movie - mostly bad but I say check it out! If you were expecting something greater than Aliens you will be disappointed but like I said it's better than Alien Resurrection! You either like it or you lump it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This third installment in the Aliens saga has taken a lot of bad rap for it's sluggish script and sometimes less than 3 dimensional characters. While I do agree with this to a degree, some of the lesser characters should not be overlooked. Charles S. Dutton with his usual unbridled fury and the wonderfully poised Charles Dance. Plus, the intense gloom of Fincher's camera that pays homage to Ridley Scott's original Alien. All in all, it's still a keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect ending to a trilogy which should not have been resurrected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly believe that with a few script edits this could have been the best film of all time. As it is, it's only absolutely brilliant.First, it has absolutely THE BEST title sequence ever committed to film: the credits interspersed with short, grim snatches of Ripley's "rape", if you like, by the Alien and the ejection of the escape pod from the Sulaco.Second, the killing of Hicks, Newt and Bishop is both necessary, and a stroke of genius. They aren't meant to develop relationships with Ripley. She's meant to develop a relationship with them and then lose them. That's the point. The Alien causes death and destruction, it's not meant to be responsible for a long happy ever lasting friendship. The only relationship that really matters is that between Ripley and the Alien. To kill them off so quickly though, is brilliant, even though casting problems are as responsible as anything. But it sets the tone of virtual hopelessness and despair for the rest of the film.Third, in Alien 3, acting performances matter. Alien was all about suspense, the performances were secondary to this, even if there isn't a bad performance in the whole film. Aliens was all about action, blood n guts machismo - acting ability was totally irrelevant. If you could look hard, fire a gun and occasionally get a bit worried, you were in. Alien 3 is about hopelessness and despair. It needs good convincing performances so that you care about the characters. Thus, when they die, everything seems even more pointless and without hope. But the acting isn't just convincing, it's damn amazing. Weaver is excellent as a more experienced, resigned to death Ripley, Charles Dance brilliantly sombre as Medical Officer Clemens and Ralph Brown puts in his best performance ever as 85 (Forget Withnail and I - it's the most overrated film ever anyway). But Charles S Dutton is absolutely outstanding. Dillon is very slightly reminiscent of Parker from the original, but Dutton stamps all over Yaphet Kotto in big prison boots. The man deserves an Oscar.Fourth, the funeral/Alien erupting scene with its brilliant script is the best scene I've ever seen in any film, including the Danny Boy scene in Miller's Crossing.Fifth, the Alien's death is by far the most original of the four films, although I do have a soft spot for that in Aliens.Sixth, Alien 3 is an absolutely beautiful film visually. I can't fault the photography, special effects and whatever else is involved at all.Lastly, just as the credits are the best beginning to a film ever, Ripley's death is an immense emotional ending to the trilogy, that puts every single act into perspective and fits the tone of the film perfectly. The Alien should never have been resurrected for a fourth installment because this was the perfect ending.I can only see two, maybe three, problems with Alien 3. One, there's a couple of really duff lines in there which just don't fit. Two, the toxic waste fire scene is over too quickly, and the deaths are just passed over. One often used criticism of the film is that it is too slow, but not enough is made of this. I know it's in the middle of the film where you want to be speeding up, but it doesn't feel right. Third, Brian Glover's voice. I find it grates. "This is rumour control..." - yuk.Of course, there's enough great things about Alien 3, that it still gets maximum marks. But if asked to pick a favourite, I'd probably go for Alien viewed in a pitch black room. It's not as well acted, but there are no flaws, the suspense is brillliant and when the lights flash on screen, they flash in your room as well. It's the nearest you'll get to feeling part of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very realistic portray of what may be out there....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I've got to say that this movie deserves more credit than it received. David Fincher did a great job of directing. The cast was superb as well...the well-known Sigourney Weaver of course, Charles Dance, Charles Dutton, and Danny Webb. Weaver came back as the intrepid Ripley and did a spectacular of of it too. Charles Dance came in as the lonely medic on the far-flung prison colony, Charles Dutton portrayed the role of the courageous and leader prisoner Dillon, while Danny Webb backed up the cast the only survivor of the ordeal playing the role of prisoner Morse. The main thing that got me about this movie was the frighteningly realistic storyline. It all makes perfect sense. In the first two Alien movies, the humans had a means of defense. In "Alien", the characters had flame-throwers for their weapons. In "Aliens", all and I mean ALL of the characters had a weapons: there was the M41-A Pulse Rifle, the M56 Smart Gun, the M240 Flame-thrower, H&amp;K VP70 9mm sidearm, and the infamous M40 Grenades for the Pulse Rifle. But in "Alien 3", there is no weapons...therefore the story is more suspenseful. Ripley awakens after having her cryo-tube and her fellow other survivors blasted out of the U.S.S. Sulaco ship from part 2 on this prison planet called "Fiorina 161" out at the ass-end of space. Dead prisoners begin to mount up and she finds out that a new form of alien has gotten loose on the planet. But this time, there is no fancy sophisticated weaponry to fight back with!Lt. Ellen Ripley: 1st Class/#36706, must lead the last remaining prisoners into battle with no weapons or modern technology of any kind. In the process, Ripley discovers something about herself that she cannot stop: the Queen alien inside of her. The Weyland-Yutani Corporation (the "Company"), want to have Ripley quarantined until their arrival. They just want the alien for their bio-weapons division. But Ripley knows that if it gets off the planet: it will kill everything. In the end there is a final showdown between her and the alien and Ripley must destroy herself in order to save so many others.But if you know the "Alien" storyline like I do: then you'll know that Ripley's death didn't thwart anything back on Earth......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Alien movie made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is near perfect and brilliant with top-notch acting from Sigourney Weaver, Charles Dance, Charles S Dutton, Daniel Webb, etc. The mood and atmosphere is wonderfully dreadful. Elliot Goldenthal's score is ambient but effective and chilling, and the directing by David Fincher was terrific and breathtaking. I find this movie more interesting and tolerable to watch over and over again than Aliens. I would take a colony of funny prisoners over a platoon of stupid space marines anyday. However there are a couple of complaints but they are relatively minor. It concerns the alien. In some scenes it is very fierce looking and in other scenes it is very scrawny-looking. With a big head and incredibly small and underdeveloped body, but it's still very frightening. How can this film be dissappointing? This film is a work of art, a great debut for David Fincher, and anyone telling you otherwise is shortminded and stupid.</fullReview>

It has a lot of British talking and the movie got a well-deserved R rating. The blood and language just keep coming but I didn't mind. The sets were great. The location was a good spot. The plot is good. It deals with Ripley fighting off another Alien that has been grown inside a dog. It's a fight to the finish. Ripley learns something about herself but I won't say even though everyone already knows what happens to her. The script was ok but not as good as Aliens. It's a good movie that you should check out sometime. I still think it's better than Alien, but not by much. Alien3: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic approach and an awesome finale of a brilliant trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to be quick here: Alien = Scott and Giger's typical horror flick buried in fifteen tons of brilliant art and design. Graphically astounding, but plot-wise it leaves a lot to be desired. In the year of 1999 the cast looks unbelievably seventies, and the movie is utterly un-rewatchable (if you can say such a thing), as the initial scares are long gone. Awesome movie because its so graphically perverse. The whole alien-popping-out-of-chest thing was unwatchable, kudos to John Hurt for that. Fabulous movie in its time.Aliens = All-out americanised highly enjoyable action flick, taking the usual american sequel-recipe (make it bigger and louder) to new heights. Adds a new alien design and the whole hive-structure thing to the aliens. The queen looks bloody retarded, a caricature of Giger's original alien designs. The reason this movie seems to be the number one of the trilogy is simply because its so incredibly easy to understand. The soundtrack is simple, the plot is simple (actually), the characters are fantastically simple (and therefore easily likeable) and they packed in a lil annoying kid too (although it added a good touch to the plot) that does nothing but get into trouble and gets saved a lot. Bleargh.A cliched simple action movie sporting fat designs and a dark, brooding industrial-type sci-fi atmosphere, but still graphically nothing compared to the first movie.Alien3 = This is pure depression, despair, anger, realism. It takes the whole "we can take them on" feeling you got after a while in Aliens and slams it through the pavement. Without our big guns and fancy technology us humans are really nothing but a bunch of treacherous gits. Apart from the first obvious plot hole (the alien egg), which was absolutely necessary anyway if there was going to be a second sequel, the plot stands out as the cleanest of the lot. Its deeper, more terrifying than Alien, and infinitely more sophisticated than Aliens. We see the new dog alien (cleaning up the question wether aliens take on their hosts physique) and we see how dark and terrible the world of Alien really is. The imagery is fantastic, sometimes almost like a painting, mostly browns and reds and fabulous camera angles. The scene where the candles along the ground get blown out is like icecubes down my spine, and the first glimpse of the alien is awe-inspiring. The religious theme, the past evil of the prisoners, the only-female-on-a-male-dominated-planet bit, the i'm-gonna-die-soon-anyway bit, the we-dont-give-a-damn-about-you-if-you-dont-help-us bit... Ahh this movie is fabulous. Alien resurrection is disowned from the series in my eyes, it shows too much. This movie is awesome, it shows just enough. "Alien" = Stranger, new, different, unknown. Aliens managed to hide the aliens well enough, and alien3 finishes off perfectly. David Fincher is a sheer visual genius.This is a 100% good movie. Actings good, effects are brill, and on the subject of "we dont like the characters" i have this to say: Thats the point. Youre not really supposed to like ANYONE exept from ripley. They're all filthy b*****ds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fair would-be conclusion to a classic trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher ("Se7en," "The Game") put his own unique film-making style to work here in the supposed last installment of the "Alien" trilogy. Fincher's darker, grittier look makes for an interesting change of scenery as Ellen Ripley fights to destroy the alien creature one last time. Many disregarded this film, due to the lack of Cameron style action and emotion. However, this films real emotion derives from sheer exhaustion on Ripley's part, therefore exhausting the audience as well. She never seems to fully rid herself of the alien terror or keep any of her friends alive. Although we never really feel too much for the "reformed" ex-cons, we do feel sorrow and sympathy for Ripley and her never-ending battle for survival. But unfortunately, that is all we feel. There is no hope or triumph. No celebration or sense of victory when the credits roll. Anyone who enjoys Fincher's cinematography will find this film interesting, to say the least. "Alien3" is a well made, wonderfully choreographed film, but sadly, mediocre as a "conclusion" to the Alien saga.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just purchased the Alien Legacy on DVD this past week, I have had the chance to revisit all the Alien movies and appreciate the different approaches that each director takes. I have to say that Alien 3 went down better then when I had originally seen it back in 1992. David Fincher has such a great eye for detail in every shot that is filmed. The only thing that I had a problem with is the tension that he tried to build but just wasn't working. The last scene in which the alien is chasing the prisoners throughout the corridors was nice to look at, but it came up short on the "scare" scale. If I would have seen the alien itself move at the blazing speeds that the camera was moving at, it would have been more effective.As for the story, it was meant to displease the audience, and Fincher just seems to be too eager to do so. Casting problems might have prevented the return of the little Carrie Henn(she wouldn't have been so little in Alien 3 anyway) and Michael Biehn. To just kill of Newt in the very beginning of Alien 3, especially if you have seen the director's cut of Aliens, is absolutely heart-wrenching. For those who have not seen the director's cut of Aliens(which is available alone or in the new Alien Legacy box set on VHS and DVD as well as on a special edition laserdisc), it expands the maternal side of Ripley's persona. Definitely worth seeing if you are an Alien fan. Even if you haven't seen the director's cut, it is still a major disappointment to see the poor Newt dead.With all this being said, Alien 3 works. It just does. David Fincher's tight direction and uncanny visual style save what would have been a horrible Alien experience. Once again, Weaver's performance as Ripley is superb. The rest of the cast gives excellent performances throughout. The story has its disappointing side, but it can be seen as admirable as well. You have to admire the writers for having the audacity to create such a disturbing world that is this prison from hell. I would have liked to see further developments in the Alien's species. James Cameron did it extremely well by introducing the alien queen. Other than that, great creative effort that offers something different, and this time different is good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very underrated film. A first time debut by David Fincher. For some reason, people love to hate the film, or haven't seen it but assume it's no good becasue of comments they've heard from others. I loved it from the beginning. Fincher manages to make an art of displaying disturbing images on the screen. And I do mean art. Some of his camera pans and angles are to be savored.I think many wanted to see another Cameron adaptation. More aliens, bigger guns and big explosions. This film finished the Alien trilogy in style. It refused to become the hollywood shoot 'em up that was the logical extension of Aliens. It instead focused on the original premise. In a few short words 'Aliens are bad, but not necessarily as bad as humans'.The atmosphere is one of hopelessness. We see Ripley as weary as she should be after so long a journey frought with so much misery. At 'the ass end of space' she finds spirits as worn as her own. Likely the reason a penal colony was chosen as the setting. Fincher has to be commended to have the courage to bring such a stark dreary vision to realization. And, to kill off such a strong and popular character (at least that's what I thought at the time).This movie is an excellent third installment. Standing alongside the first two as an equal. With yet another talented director taking the reins and adapting to his own vision.As a final testament, there I was, having seen the first two over and over again, literally sitting on the edge of my seat during the Alien baiting sequence. There was some serious suspense generated there. Who would have thought that could happen after seeing dozens of Aliens running around in the second film and only having one tinier one in this!Give it a try, and appreciate it for the different, yet true, take on the Alien experience it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ellen Ripley awakens from hypersleep to find herself crash-landed on a prison planet, her human companions killed. Her non-human companions, on the other hand...ALIEN 3 marks David Fincher's feature debut, and he has created a film that is very dark, atmospheric, and more unsettling than actively frightening.Sigourney Weaver plays Ripley a third time, and gives a note-perfect performance. Charles S. Dutton plays a prisoner who becomes Ripley's ally, and is also dead-on every step of the way.ALIEN 3 shows the progression of Ripley as a character. In the first film, we see Ripley as the ship's warrant officer. It is her job to enforce company policy, as illustrated in the airlock scene ("Yes, I read you, the answer is negative...") In ALIEN 3, we see Ripley confronted by Aaron, a "company man", and her own violent reaction to the same mindset she espoused in the original.Despite the criticisms of ALIEN 3, it is more of a groundbreaking film than either of the previous films. ALIENS in particular not only borrowed heavily from Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" but also was grounded firmly in the Rambo aesthetic of the 1980's.ALIEN 3, on the other hand, is in direct contrast to the popular science fiction of its time. ALIEN 3 depicts an all-too-believable universe, where there is no Force, and no Prime Directive. The innocent suffer, strength and courage sometimes fail, and no one gets out alive. ALIEN 3 tells you to put away your Starfleet uniform and your lightsaber, and to grow the hell up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really disappointed that Fincher went on to make the contrived Seven after this great new direction for the Alien series (don't knock 4 either - it has redeeming features). Seven was his way of saying sorry to Hollywood after the dark depressing action film that you couldn't munch popcorn at the drive-in to.I've just seen Alien 3 for the third time and I think it wears re-watching best of all the Alien films. The characters grow on you. They are hopeless nobodys but so were the marines in their own gung ho way and these sociopaths have their own brilliant cool. They don't so much die as disappear through the ceiling but then we know they're going to die at some point. Horror replaced with hopelessness (scarier). Betrayal replaced with heroism (not just Ripley's).It's the only Alien film with a good ending. It's powerful stuff, if you can cope with dark films and always liked the mood and cool of the Alien franchise best then see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's forget there was a part four.Alien cubed, as I affectionately call it (that's what it looks like, a mathematic equation) didn't sit right with me the first time I saw it, which was in the theatre.After I had a chance to buy the video and watch it several times, it grew on me. It's a dark and grizzly painting of solitude and terror. After the all-out shoot 'em up of Cameron's Aliens, it was refreshing return to the "we've got no weapons" point of view. It also restored the science-fiction style of storytelling that was for the most part absent in number two.It's an excellent story with very good flow. I loved the conversation with the inmates as they debate their philosophy (religion) of prison life on a planet with no females. I also enjoyed the multiple conversations Ripley had with the doctor. Very quiet and serene. A couple of elements that are hard to find in Aliens.I realize I keep comparing to it's predecessor but this movie was the perfect fit for third slot of the Alien installments. Aliens got us all worked up into an adrenaline rush of "gotcha" terror and Alien 3 let us relax and enjoy a good story.Because of this and director David Fincher's other works, I'll definitely be looking forward to his future films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ripley in my opinion is the greatest female action hero around. Everything from fighting onboard a huge M-Class Star-freighter to slaughtering a bunch of bugs on a colony and even blowing the Queen Alien out an airlock, Ripley really knows how to be in charge and take action against threats! Anyway, I think this film deserves more credit than it actually got. The low and eerie music was okay, the characters and storyline rocked, and the action was good. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that there wasn't any guns or weapons. But after all, Ripley supposedly crashes on a prison planet with no weapons or modern technology of any kind. That pretty much bites when fighting these things. With the new special effects technology, the alien was very well designed and laid out.Not to mention the action in this film was pretty well acted out when everyone was supposed to be fighting. I think the characters did very well fighting against a nasty predator like that with no guns. David Fincher did a great directing job on this film (just like he did on all his other films). The film itself keeps you enthralled from the start to the middle and finally to its surprising climax. I mean who would think that the main character himself or herself would perish in the end like that. I thought that was pretty lame but the story had to come to a close sometime I guess. In the story line, Ripley was basically saving the world by jumping into that furnace because she found out she had a Queen embryo inside of her and she knew that if that thing got off the planet, it would kill everything. But overall, this film really did it for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually, this isn't as bad as it's been made out to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Alien 3" is probably the most depressing and darkest film of the "Alien" series, but don't hold that against it. Many people did hold that against it, and many people, including the filmmakers, said that this film was a mistake gone horribly out of control. I just think that it was time to bring the "Alien" series to a close. It also gives us a strong feeling of grief, as well as the strength to try and recover from that grief. It is also brilliantly crafted. The sets are dark, greasy, and horribly bleak; a perfect hiding place for a feisty little alien. And the acting isn't bad either. It stays serious and scary, keeping in spirit with the previous alien films. To be honest, I used to hate this film. I didn't understand it, and I thought the whole thing was a mistake that never should have been put onto film. However, the "Alien" film that followed this, "Alien Resurrection", turned me around 180 degrees. "Alien Resurrection", now that sucked! It is a real reason for a person not to like the "Alien" series. "Alien 3" was depressing, yes, but unlike "Alien Resurrection", it remained faithful to the "Alien" series. Now there's a reason to like and appreciate "Alien 3"!</fullReview>

The acting is somewhat good, Weaver still does her best in this film, although she is not as good as she was in "Aliens". The ending is especially sad.

		<fullReview>I have to agree with a lot of the comments already made. If this film was not connected to the first two it would be considered a classic. I read that it was more popular in Europe than in America, which would make sense to me. Everyone I know loves Aliens and thinks I'm crazy to like A3, but I find the characters in Aliens to be comical caricatures. Newt was such a horrid idea on top of that.That said, Alien 3 is my favorite of the series. I love the setting, both as a plot idea and for how great the cinematography is. This really is more of a drama with action. I much prefer dramas to action films, which while sometimes entertaining, too often trade off good writing and character development for eye candy/mind gum.A3 is the way it should be: dark and primitive, man faced with a seemingly inconquerable enemy, armed only with his wits and his courage. I find that much more entertaining than watching a handful of "Marines" wildly spraying gunfire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is definitely not as good as the first two Alien films, but it stands on its own as a powerful artistic vision. The story is pretty weak, and much of the dialogue and some of the characters are pretty lame. BUT, director David Fincher is, quite simply, a GENIUS. Enough said. He took this material and made it into a powerful, artistic masterpiece. Several of his scenes are brillantly done. For example, the autopsy scene (watch the different shots), the funeral scene intercut brilliantly with the dog scene (I won't give too much detail but good god it gives me chills) and the final scene.Now that final scene is something that either people HATE with a passion or LOVE. I think it's great and the series should have stopped there. But I suppose too many people were too upset by how depressing and dark it was and couldn't take it. The fourth Alien film is interesting as well, but I think this would have made a good ending.So definitely check this film out for the way it is filmed and the style of it. Also, I forgot to mention the brilliant opening credits sequence...damn it's cool!!</fullReview>

The most diverse thing is the presence of an Alien egg on the ship SULLACO. At the end of ALIENS we witness the Alien Queen right on the ship, but she was there for a too short time to be capable of laying an egg /and from the Alien 3 it is clear that the eggs must have been at least two - one which attacked Ripley`s hibernator and one which attacked the dog on Fiorina 161./ In ALIENS we saw that the Queen used a special tube or pipe to lay eggs, but as she went on pursuing Ripley she deprived herself of it, so in my opinion she was not capable of laying eggs in SULLACO.</fullReview>

It's a real disappointment to have Newt killed off so perfunctory. I think disappointing is the most apt description of this movie.The kills aren't as exciting. Neither is the premise. The fact is there isn't any rooting interest in any of the characters other than Ripley. They might as well be all Paul Reisers. The chase through the tunnels aren't tense.

Meaning that the founder of the clan would be cloned and subsequent clones be brought in and out of 'stasis' and the one that is 'alive' in charge. Bishop (2) may be a clone of the founder (respecting Avp), or a stakeholder in his own right (ignoring AvP), and has a heavy interest in the survival of the Xenomorph species, for his own (promotion, prestige (as a clan holder/employee)).

If you go watch this movie with James Cameron's superior action film, then you will be disappointed. You will hate the movie and you will bann it and spank it.First advice: Forget about Cameron's version. David Fincher made the opposite to that movie.Second advice: Forget about Ripley good, intelligent and Alien-killer. Here is not only bold, but a little bit brain-less and very annoying.Third advice: You know Ripley will die, that's not a surprise. If you are going to get bored because you know the ending, do not watch the movie.The most disappointing thing of all is that Alien 3, with all the darkness, all the creepiest atmosphere and all those pipes, corridors and candles, is not scary. It doesn't gives the creeps like Alien, or has no suspense like Aliens. Is a very good visual movie, okey. But that's not enough. I like Alien 3, I defend Alien 3 every day, but this is the worst Alien movie ever made. As for David Fincher, this was a tough work to do, without a screenplay and trying to make a decent movie. Thanks to Fincher, and not to Ripley, this movie gets so many stars from my side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Underrated Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a shock to the system when I had originally heard Alien3 that they killed off Ripley. After the two amazing successors: one an amazing horror classic and the other a brilliant action film, it's hard to imagine adding a third film. I was curious to say the least. I liked the trailer.Fincher at the time was only a video director. He had made Madonna's darkly somber 'Bad Girl' video. A personal favorite, even now. I loved the way he opened the film with cuts back and forth as a hidden stowaway alien egg hatches, disrupting the safe trip home for the survivors of the 2nd film. A very well executed, and choppy opening. It's really well shot. I immediately knew Fincher like Cameron, had respect for the series and sat back to take in his ideas.The characters on the planet Ripley crashes on are a series of hardened criminals. They aren't very appealing characters minus two of them, so the main hole in the plot becomes obvious soon as to why this film doesn't work as well as the others. The lack of interest, passion, or sympathy for the characters. There are no Hudson or Vasquez characters here.You really like the cast of both previous films. Here the priest and doctor are the only two you root for aside from Ripley. The new alien is neat though. Its origins from dog DNA was an interesting change from human DNA.Ripley is alone and she is raw now. I loved her in this film. I felt her performance single-handedly saved the film from utter disregard. The strength from the series has always been Ripley. Here she shines as humane and fleshed out. Discovering she has become host to an alien, she doesn't freak out, she knows it won't help. It's her greatest fear come true. Instead she wants to kill the other one to save the remaining inmates. In the end, she knows what to do. Her death actually made me cry, it was powerful because of my love for the series, and the character.Early on in the film, as she watches Hicks and Newts bodies drop into the burner and she is intensely emotional. Fincher captures the moment beautifully. It's a great scene, as she says goodbye without speaking to the only family she had come to know since the aliens first plagued her life. There are great editing cuts to a guard dog erupting and Ripleys nose bleeding, as the bodies burn.More like Alien, and nothing like Aliens I can see why people would be put off by the pacing, but I really enjoyed the film as is. Usually people who like the 2nd film hate the 3rd and like the 4th. I like all of them for different reasons. This one is Ripleys most exposed role. She is the center, and the most afraid. She is also the most determined to overcome her fears too. That's the main reason I enjoy this film, her resilience.A director's copy that Fincher didn't approve of, improves on character development with Ripley and her doctor, but the rest of the changes were bad. In my opinion anyway.The most painful thing in this movie is that they kill off Ripley and then set you up to feel for her. After that they end the film with this horribly noisy score. What happened to the emotional score that emphasized the deserved quite, Ripley got at the end of the two previous films. It totally threw me off.Take notice and you'll probably agree the score ruins her final demise. Otherwise, Fincher made a slick film, with really unsavory characters. At least he was respectful to the tone of the series. Not a bad addition,just disappointing in small areas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under appreciated masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though on the surface grim and depressing, "Alien 3" is without doubt excellently crafted and highly entertaining - especially considering the studio misrepresented Fincher's original vision by heavily editing the film. Due to the unsurpassed level of action in the previous film, the more subdued nature of "Alien 3" is only a natural progression in the overall story. Ellen Ripley has been at war with the alien for so long that it has come to define her entire existence; what could possibly be more bleak than that? Sigourney Weaver takes her characterization of Ripley to an entirely new dimension - capturing the emotional despair of a woman who has knowingly lost her soul. Also there is significant religious undertones to the film, dealing most notably with the themes of redemption and damnation. David Fincher, in his directorial debut, demonstrates his talent for creating startling imagery; something that audiences have now come to expect from the director. The colour palette of the film is simply beautiful, with deep brown hues on prominent display. The special effects, though some appear surprisingly dated (early CGI), still look cool. Highly recommended for lovers of the genre, a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the controversy surrounding "Alien 3"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the multitude of postings as to why people dislike "Alien 3", it would seem that the consensus is simply because the characters of "Hicks" and "Newt" were eliminated fairly quickly. And it seems, also, that most blame the screenwriter(s) for this decision.The truth is, unfortunately, much more mundane than a writer wanting to take the franchise in a different direction. In reality, it was nearly seven years between the production of "Aliens" and "Alien 3", there were nine or ten different screenplays and scenarios commissioned and considered; the actress who played "Newt" in "Aliens" had aged and, Michael Biehn ("Hicks" in "Aliens") - an extremely difficult actor to work with in the best of circumstances - wanted an outrageous sum of money to reprise the role (and because the studio used his "likeness" in the theatrical version of "Alien 3", he was actually paid more for this than his actual portrayal of the character in "Aliens"), the studio opted to take the franchise in a different direction.Now, whether or not this direction was the correct path to take is open to debate - but, at least the original producers (Hill &amp; Giler) were ballsy enough to make a film that was as different as "Aliens" was to "Alien" - and for that fact alone, "Alien 3", especially the "new" cut available on DVD should be respected for what was attempted. Unlike "Aliens", which opted for all-out action, it went back to the womb, so to speak; the flesh-ripping monster in the basement scenario featuring a single alien (pretty bold considering the box office take of the multi-alien "Aliens" follow-up)- and it featured Fincher's debut as a feature-film director composing a beautifully crafted train wreck.Keep in mind, also, that the (still superior)original film was a fluke. No one actually wanted to make the film, but FOX was damn glad they did when they saw the opening weekend's box office returns. Then, seven years later they make a war film as a sequel - and its returns were HUGE. Now, they don't have a quirky hit on their hands, they have a bona-fied money making FRANCHISE - and come hell or high water, they will protect their investment.When the decision came down to make a third film (a decision, it should be noted, that was made by the lawyers and accountants that run the Hollywood studio system, and NOT by the actual filmmakers), they wanted a director that would deliver intense visuals (is it any wonder that "Alien 3" is the most graphically violent of the 4 films?), but would yield to the studio's discretion as to how to actually execute and present the film.Unfortunately (for them; not us), they hired David Fincher to direct a film that had, at best, an incomplete script that was little more than an amalgum of the nine or so screenplays that had been written in the intervening years. And then, when he turned in his cut and asked for time to do much needed reshoots, they balked - and he walked away from the project - and instead, concentrated on making "Se7en".It's all about finances and making product, people! It has nothing to do with making a "good" film or logical "continuity" with respect to a storyline (refer to "AvP" in case you're not following my line of thought here)! So, stop already with these silly notions about "Hicks" and "Newt" - and what might've been a "good" follow up to "Aliens". The powers that be in the studios do not think along those lines of progression. More to the point, THEY DON'T CARE (because, idiots that we are, will plunk down our money and see the film anyways - hoping that THEY will do us some justice)!It's not about "art" or good story telling. It's about money.</fullReview>

The other problem, which is one i share, is that it deviates throughout between the horror and action genres, never really knowing which one it wants to be. This results in a slightly strange film that probably more resembles the original because the trapped, claustrophobic feeling is present throughout. Maybe the previous 2 films just set the bar so high that it was always going to be a huge task to make a third installment equal them. All in all, good, and a fitting ending i thought.

		<fullReview>PRETTY BIG SPOILERS HERE.The story of Ellen Ripley's struggle against the alien ended in 1992 with 'Alien3' The film is flawed, there is no doubt about that. The production of the film stands as a pretty good textbook of how not to make a film and yet David Fincher managed to pull something out of it. And something worth watching.Firstly, I'll skim through the plot. 'Alien3' sees Ripley crash on a prison world after her ship malfunctions. There she is forced to confront not only the single alien that has emerged there, but the alien growing inside her.Second, I'll say that "Rett Mikhals" opinion is unfortunately far too common to be dismissed as an 'Aliens' fanboy and it's a shame because once you dig past the poorly pasted puppet effects and the fact they killed off Newt and Hicks ("OH MY GOD! THEY KILLED OFF TWO OF CAMERONS CLICHE CHARACTERS! OMG HOW COULD THEY?") You get a pretty decent film. It seems a lot of people, I won't name any names, were expecting another no-brainer actionfest like 'Aliens' and they were disappointed when they saw they were actually trying to restore some of the dignity of 'Alien' Eh, I'll stop referring to his post any more because he quite clearly isn't trying to review 'Alien3', he's trying to avenge 'Aliens' ("a dog struggling for half an hour" WTF?)As I said before, 'Alien3' tries to hark back to 'Alien' and it isn't very successful. We've seen the alien so many times they're starting to wear off. Scenes like David muttering "here kitty" are far too blatant for there own good. Where 'Alien3' succeeds, I think, is the atmosphere. The muted browns and oranges really help to portray the feelings of helplessness in the prison colony and the tragedy of Ripley's life robbed by the alien. The religious overtones of Jesus, Satan and Judas are interesting. This isn't a cash-in sequel. Despite the flaws, the makers of 'Alien3' did put some thought into it.Unfortunately, on 'Alien3's test viewing the people they showed it to were braindead. As a result, Fox took their advice to rip gaping chunks out of the film leaving huge plotholes in their place. That is why we hardly know any of the characters. That is why we have an inexplicable egg on the Sulaco (originally an adult alien was on the ship) For the record, the beginning sequence of 'Alien3' is a nightmare Ripley has, hence the dreamlike quality of it. Only one egg is shown because Ripley doesn't know she has been impregnated yet.In all, 'Alien3' is a troubled sequel that bravely tries to be something more than a cheap follow-on from 'Aliens' It has a lot of great ideas, but ultimately their execution is less than perfect. Six out of ten. A good end to the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be worse, could be raining...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a mixed bag. The first two had an organized structure of building up suspense, then throwing us shocks and action. This one takes a different route, being more a typical action movie. Unfortunately, too much time is spent in between with the problems of "Fury" 161 that the Xenomorph takes a backseat to the underplayed drama for the first hour. The brooding nature of the film seems to take the attitude from the first two of "things are only getting worse" to an extreme. (Some Spoilers)The directing style is not as flashy as the first one, but more creative than how Cameron was in ALIENS, that's probably the best compliment I can give this movie. However, I do have some rants:1) Why do the plots keep getting more and more ridiculous with each movie.2) The CGI Alien just isn't that effective. It looks fake, plain and simple. The inventiveness of the effects from the first two are glossed over so instead of goth, we get gloss. Also the Alien POV shots just don't work that well. Call me an old-school skeptic, but I liked the puppets and suits from the first two, at least they improved on the design (somewhat) for this...3) Why did Chuck Dutton have to get killed? I'd rather he was the only survivor because he at least had some depth to him.However, this movie could have been so much worse, but it also could have been worse. I place no blame on David Fincher's shoulders for the results and, instead, lay it on the newcomers in the series--Vincent Ward and Larry Ferguson. Sorry guys, but you really messed up this time.Overall, 3 out of 5. Stick with the first two, avoid the 4th!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Alien 3" is in my opinion, the only film in the series with a personal touch (those having seen Fincher's subsequent work know what I'm talking about). The emphasis is not on the creature, but on the penitentiary environment and on a skinhead Ripley, sibling and skeleton-like reflection of the alien. She's more a victim than a heroine - this might have been the reason for the film not to be such a hit as the second installment of the series. The hopeless aspect of the refinery standing for the underground condition and inner emptiness of the lifers - rallied into a battle for survival, as well as the omnipresence of isolation and contamination are well defined motifs reaching high levels by insisting on gros plans and on dark colours, broken here and there by incandescent outbreaks. They should have insisted more on the religious aspect, implying damnation, expiation, sacrifice and transcendence. Sombre, dark, eerie and cerebral, "Alien 3" is an original sci-fi, providing an amazing score (bravo, Elliot Goldenthal!), a fit cinematography and a careful editing, brought somehow close to perfection. The only minus is the special effects department which could have gotten more than that out of Giger's new designs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has to be without a doubt my favourite film of the saga. It's everything I want from a sci fi horror film and is; in my humble opinion a truly worthy sequel to ALIEN. I can understand why it was so poorly received at the time, Aliens was such a big crowd pulling success and when news of Alien 3 surfaced a lot of people expected another macho marines shoot-em-up fest. Thankfully David Fincher had other ideas, don't get me wrong I enjoy Aliens but I prefer horror over action, Aliens was the perfect advancement for the saga but I always thought that Alien 3 was the perfect way to end the saga. Thankfully through the popularity of DVD with its enhanced picture and sound, it seems that a lot more people are starting to appreciate Alien 3 in a new light, the films colour scheme is so dark and muted; it's not surprising that people who only ever saw it on VHS didn't really know what was happening. I have always compared Alien 3 to Bladerunner in terms of audience reaction - common studio opinion seems to be 'if America didn't like it then it must be poor', which is very unfair, both films were poorly received in the US but opened to far better reviews and even critical acclaim in foreign territories, both films eventually found an audience and even cult followings and both seemed to receive more and more respect as time went on. Alien 3 is far from perfect, Richard Edlunds mo-motion Alien effects leave a lot to be desired and the opening sequence still has many fans confused, but over all I find Alien 3 to be one of the most intriguing pieces of Sci-Fi cinema to be produced in the past 10 years, its not often these days that you find a mainstream major studio produced film that is so gory and downright gritty, which I think is a testament to the fabulous production design from Norman Reynolds, truly amazing creature effects from Woodruff and Gillis and the dark almost nihilistic themes that Fincher seems to handle so well. When you start delving into the terrible pre production fiasco that Alien 3 went through its quite amazing that it came out as impressive as it did, various directors and screenwriters were hired and fired at great expense way before Fincher became involved, the fact that he managed to pull together such a mess and make such a great film is quite an accomplishment in itself. I dread to think how this film would have turned out if Renne Harlin had actually directed it. Now if only Fox would get their act together and produce a directors cut (in conjunction with Fincher hopefully) I know a lot of nay sayers would see Alien 3 in a different light, the typical moans about confusing plots and wasted characters could all be answered if Fincher was to show his original version of the film before it was cut to pieces by studio heads reacting to the opinions of test audiences made up of 'brain-dead kids'. The bootleg working print that's doing the rounds is far superior over the theatrical in terms of plot and character development and deserves to be shown to the public. As it stands today Alien 3 is a great film that deserves a lot more respect than it originally received, hopefully one day Fincher will return to finish what he began and audiences can see his vision as it was truly meant to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great!The appropriate climax of this unbeatable Saga!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was shocked, when I saw the valuation of Alien? by the imdb-visitors. I cannot believe that this great movie was getting a lower quotation than Alien-Resurrection. I think the Saga found an excellent ending in this movie. The characters (especially the one of Ripley!)are getting even more dimensions, so it became the overwhelming climax, when Ripley ...,you'll see by yourself. Fincher also does a good filming job: The camera is dramatic, the tension is always on an high level an the atmosphere is unequalled! If you think, the Alien-Trilogy is just an exciting Sci-Fi-Horror and you are not interested in the backgrounds and details of the story, you MAYBE disappointed, but even this seems impossible to me, because of the story, atmosphere and actors. In my opinion this is the real end of Alien.Such a ridiculous Sequel like Alien-Resurrection can not succeed the first three movies (I cannot find the right words to explain it in english, but "abgedrehte Scheisse" (this is german for ...well.. "not too good") hits the point). I'm sorry for my bad english- I am working on it, but this movie is a great climax for the Alien-trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as some think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As most know, this isn't exactly the best the Alien series has to offer. But it's not as bad as some say. Personally, I like it, and I like it for a lot of reasons. Now, as for me, Aliens is my all-time favorite movie and there is rarely a film out there that even comes close to touching it's glory, so why even begin to compare? Alien 3 is a movie all in it's own. Yes, it's a bit slow, not as action packed, and there is a little too much swearing (but hey, they're convicts) but it's also a very tense and realistic story. Like the first two, the plot and story line are sound and believable. Unlike the first two, it's not an action movie and I think that's where it lost some people. Yes, it does have action in it, but that's not it's main focus. I think this installation to the series needs to be viewed for it's powerful grip and sense of realism. It's so real, the viewer almost feels as if they're really there (which would suck big time). Unlike it's piece of junk sibling (Resurrection) it really is a good movie and well worth a watch if you're not comparing it to it's two older and more powerful brothers. Plus the musical score is excellent. And after reading the alternate scenes, I wish they'd release that to the public! I know I'd buy it in a second.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 might have passed through some horrendous production, with all the odds against it coming forth and maybe just because the people wanted to capitalize on the past success. This should not influence in one's opinion about its quality. The making of this movie could be analogous to an invalid man winning a running race against some very good and healthful racers. Still we should appreciate the quality of the final product independently, and it's a winner by itself. Don't go in expecting to see the same kind of argument there is on the first two movies, this is as much a change on the franchise as it was "aliens" to "alien". It presents conceivable ideas in a very skillful way. If you can watch it beyond your preconceptions, you will doubtlessly enjoy it, as you would enjoy a fantastic dream (or nightmare if you are like me, who sees them as exciting and dangerous fiction that doesn't hurt you at any given moment)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but underrated third installment in the Alien saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the success of Alien, any sequel had a LOT to live up to. With Aliens, James Cameron's second installment in the franchise, being every bit as flawless as Ridley Scott's original creature feature, to say David Fincher, the director of Alien 3, was under a great deal of pressure is probably an understatement. In fact, continuous interference from the studio made the first-timer so nervous and frustrated he eventually left during post-production, refused to make any kind of contribution to the Alien Quadrilogy DVD set (where his directorial debut was shown in two versions, the theatrical cut and the so called Assembly Cut, which was meant to be closer to Fincher's vision) and even turned down Mission: Impossible III because he claimed to have "already f*cked up one movie with a "3" in the title". His feelings may be justified, but as flawed as it may be (and it is in certain parts), Alien 3 is actually a quite respectable picture.Just like Cameron did in 1986, Fincher decides to sever all ties with the previous film by having Hicks (Michael Biehn) and Newt (Carrie Henn), the only two people, besides Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who survived the attack of the Alien queen, die during the opening credits (an effective intro, but it does sort of make the conclusion of Aliens pointless), thus leaving the series' heroine all by herself when she reaches a bizarre planet known as Fiorina 161. Here the Weyland-Butani company, the same that financed the missions in the first two films, has had a maximum security prison built to keep dangerous criminals under surveillance. At first, Ripley's only problem is getting along with these people, who are mostly religious fanatics. Later, when a few mysterious deaths occur, she realizes she didn't reach Fiorina 161 alone, and the nightmare that has haunted her for years is far from over.For a first-time director, Fincher shows a confidence which is rare when tackling projects this huge: while he can't be compared to Scott or Cameron, he has managed to take the claustrophobia that permeated the first Alien and enhance it, making Alien 3 exactly as chilling as its predecessors and successfully anticipating his later work (especially Se7en and Panic Room). Also skillful is Weaver who, having already played the character twice, knows what can be done with Ripley and takes her to new levels, both physical (she has no hair for most of the film) and emotional (her "relationship" with the aliens). Sadly, none of the other characters are as appealing, despite some of them being played by quite talented people (Pete Postlethwaite and Charles S. Dutton among them). The only possible exception is Lance Henriksen "returning" as Bishop, only his appearance is too brief and too late into the movie to really make a difference. The real problem of this film, however, is the alien itself: what was a menacing presence in the hands of Scott and Cameron is reduced to an ugly example of early CGI, which actually looks WORSE as the movie progresses. While it is kept in the shadows, it can get away with its awfulness; once exposed, though, it is almost too pitiful to watch.Overall, this is neither the masterpiece some had expected nor the total trash Fincher erroneously thinks he made. In fact, whatever defects the film has, he completely redeems himself with the climax, one of the bleakest, most audacious in cinema history (another Fincher trademark), so brilliant it will make one wish Fox had never even thought of an Alien 4. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. But that should not affect the viewers' feelings towards number 3: on its own, it is a pretty damn good sci-fi flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this film for 3 simple reasons. First of all, it's got a great lead actress, Sigourney Weaver who has always proven to be great in the role of Ripley whether she's human or cloned. Second, the film has a really dark tone and a lot of style thanks to director David Fincher and cinematographer Alex Thomson. Third and most important, the story shows us the real tragedy of Ellen Ripley's life, how everyone around her, everyone she cares for are taken away from her by the Alien. Still she prevails. The ending left me in shivers because of Ripley's courage and sacrifice. Although all these things could have made a grand film for the series, David Fincher didn't really know where he was going. He just didn't seem at ease and the whole package feels unfinished, sometimes boring. There are very few action or suspense scenes, like I said, the film relies more on drama for it's effect which is great but not for an Alien film. It would have needed more action, more suspense, more terror and victims we care for (except for Ripley of course.) Although it's got it's share of goodies, Alien? is mostly a disappointment, especially when you compare it to it's 2 predecessors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Horror Movie Pales in Comparison to Predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 is the 3rd entry to the extremely popular and successful Alien series featuring Sigourney Weaver as the protagonist. Aside from other factors, Weaver made this series with her version of a tough as nails female dramatic hero in military based settings. Of course it helps that the Alien itself is very unique and interesting. Plus the setting, plot and execution are both novel and unique with very memorable touches. Alien 3 however will likely disappoint. No matter how much it differs from the series and what they were trying to accomplish, the movie doesn't pace and doesn't execute when it matters.This edition does a few things well. It creates the mood well, mixing an abandoned factory and jail with an Alien is a good touch. They set up plenty of expendable characters. They give you a lot of extra themes and story lines secondary to the movie. And again, the biggest redeeming factor of this movie is Sigourney Weaver's acting job. She is on point and does a top notch job.The problem with this movie is out of it's control. No movie could follow Aliens. I mean not only did it increase the scope but it executed on every level. But this movie was a little slow and boring. Add in the fact that a slow start has a less than average pay off for the genre and you're not adding much to the core of the movie. The story on it's own seems forced and irrelevant. It almost just seems like an extension of what was postulated in the 2nd movie.I would still recommend this movie to any Alien fans and horror enthusiasts. But be prepared that if you watch this movie after Aliens, you will be thoroughly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Problematic production leads to a problematic film - the worst in the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by congratulating David Fincher, director of this third instalment in the Alien franchise, for enduring what he did during this production. Alien 3 was his directorial debut, and he was given a massive $50 million budget to play with, in addition to having to live up to fans' expectations after the previous two marvellous films, Alien and Aliens, directed by Ridley Scott and the unsinkable James Cameron respectively. He had to start shooting without a script, and 20th Century Fox stuck their noses in the production so many times that I'm surprised he finished the film. But he did. And after all of that, the film turned out just as one would expect with all that going on ? messy.While the first Alien film finishes with Ripley shooting off into space as the lone survivor, with an unknown future ahead of her, the second film shows Ripley accompanied by two other characters (and a damaged robot). Alien 3 had so much potential to capitalise on this, and utilise Hicks and Newt to a great extent, giving Ripley a family of companions to accompany her through her battle with the creatures and The Company. But no. They are callously killed off in the opening titles, with seldom time to mourn them. This is the film's first big mistake, and is guaranteed to leave Aliens fans a little peeved.The prison story is interesting enough, as Ripley is the lone woman on a barren prison planet full of deadly convicts. Moving on to Alien 3's next big mistake: the creature itself. Quite radically re-designed, this creature seems much less deadly than in previous films, exacerbated further by the tacky special effects. Having spent much of the first two films seeing very little of the creature, which builds fear and tension superbly, this film shows you a little too much, and one realises that the little Xenomorph isn't actually all that scary.Nonetheless, the film isn't an entire disaster. Sigourney Weaver gives a naturally excellent performance, along with the rest of the cast doing a fine job as well. Furthermore, the musical score in the film is, in my opinion, the best in the Alien franchise. (This is understandable, as composer Elliot Goldenthal was given an entire year alongside David Fincher to finish the score, as opposed to the six or so weeks given to James Horner for Aliens.) And, last but not least, the film's emotional final scene is very well written, with great performances all round. The scene could (and probably should) have given a satisfying conclusion to the franchise, before the nightmarish Alien: Resurrection.Overall, while the film makes the best out of a bad situation, the problems shine through, and there are far too many flaws in the film to consider it a classic. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Alien 3 and its sequel ruin the franchise, but they most certainly put a downer on it. Alien 3 is probably the worst film of the four. But it's alright, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film was.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was plain bad. Lets start off at the beginning my two (and possibly other peoples) characters were killed off Newt and Cpl. Hicks, they were very likable and people that you've just gotta want to survive throughout the whole film. They do! But, unfortunately they weren't in the third. The characters in this film were just... Rapist, murderers etc. The characters from the other films were very likable and people (if they died) you would feel sympathetic for. In this one, well, you just don't. How can you, there all rapists and murderers etc. The only character in this one (except of course Ripley) I felt sorry for was Clemens and obviously the Director had to go and make the terrible choice of killing him off as well. HOW POINTLESS!!! Now lets get to my biggest concern, the Alien. The Alien is basically doing what the first Alien did, going around and killing everyone the first Alien did this very well. But this one just didn't. The Alien was simply CGI effects and that's pretty much it. To summarise, a poor film no real storyline and the Alien in the first film looked more realistic. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Alien 3 when I was 12 years old, and I admit that at the time I was one of many young guys weened on James Cameron's Aliens, and thus incredibly eager to see the continuation of the story. I thought to myself "Man, they had big cool guns, hordes of creepy Aliens, wisecracking marines. This has gotta blow that away surely!". And what I got was not Aliens on steroids as I was expecting (and sorry to admit now, hoping for) but a thoughtful, character-driven drama that not only didn't have lots of guns or Aliens, but had NO GUNS, and ONLY ONE ALIEN WHICH IS HARDLY SEEN FOR MOST OF THE MOVIE. WTF??? I still enjoyed the movie, but through my pubescant eyes couldn't see the real beauty of it. "Why are they just sitting around when there's an alien out there?? THEY KILLED HIX N NOOT!!! WHAAAA!!!"Now I'm a 26 year-old student of film, and in my maturity and the passage of time I've learned to love this film more each time, seeing a new layer or different feeling with each subsequent viewing, reaching yet another level of appreciation with the DVD release of Fincher's intended cut of the film. Much has been said about the turmoil that surrounded the making of this film (see making of...), but history has told us that what we've heard barely scratches the surface of the ordeal Fincher had to go through to get this film made. On one side he had Fox wanting to make Aliens 2, and on the other he had producers at Brandywine that wanted total control of the story and for Fincher to be little more than a hired hand. Fincher is an artist, and wasn't going to let ANYONE get in the way of him achieving his vision for this film, but it was this bravery on his part that proved to be the downfall both for him, and this film. This film is unfairly maligned in the public's eyes, and is still seen by many through those same 12 year-old eyes that I grew out of a long time ago. For me now, I see each film in the trilogy (I regard Resurrection and AvP as a different universe altogether) as the logical continuation to the previous installment. Alien: There's a monster killing us, we have nowhere to escape to. Aliens: We've got big guns, let's waste em! Alien3: I can't believe it, they're still not dead. No matter what I do this won't stop haunting me. The story again centres on Ripley, this time crash landing on a maximum security "Double-Y chromosome" prison planet, her companions from the previous exploits dead. She is surrounded by murderers, rapists, thieves as well as company men. People that have turned their back on the world and taken on religion as a form of redemption for themselves. Long story short, an alien came back with her, and hijinks ensue.From the moment Ripley lands on the planet, you get the sense immediately that there is no hope. The environment is grim, dirty and there is a sense of utter hopelessness about this place. Fury 161 is a beautifully designed and lit environment that is both sad as well as threatening. A major complaint from people about this film is that it's too depressing and dreary, but it adds to the overall theme of the film, hopelessness and redemption. Gone is the haunted house feel of the first film, and the video game action of the second, replaced by a character study of a person that has lost everything and how one copes with that. The alien is almost an afterthought, as more time is spent investigating how a person can continue to get themselves back up when all hope seems lost. The fact that she shares the danger with a group of prisoners makes it all the more poignant. They are here for the rest of their lives, they've got nothing to look forward to, but they still see the good in their simple isolation, and thus rally for one final chance at redemption. In terms of character development, this film far exceeds the first two, with Ripley and these prisoners affecting one another in very logical and emotional ways. The music is also brilliant, the best of the series, one moment screechingly terrifying, the next hauntingly beautiful. There are other levels to the story also. There is a very strong religious theme, both with the faith of the prisoners as well as Ripley's lack of it. Why should she believe that good things are on the horizon? Everyone she has ever cared about is dead, and yet she continues to be hunted. Is there something wrong with her? Did she do something to deserve this fate? Sigourney Weaver again excels as Ripley, and IMO deserved an Oscar nom more for this performance than Aliens. She truly is one of the great actresses of our time. Each viewing of this film brings forth something new and often wonderful, however flaws still remain. The shoddy rod puppet alien affects are severely dated, and characters changing personalities at different points (perfect example being Golic, going from a ranting "Charles Manson's British cousin" to "some guy from Liverpool") as well as the ever gnawing question of how the alien got on the ship to begin with. But really, these don't take away from the beauty of this story as long as one is prepared to scratch the surface. Leave your pre-conceived notions at the door, take the time to do some homework about the making of this film and what Fincher was really trying to achieve, and then see this movie. Hopefully you'll come out the end in agreement with me that this is a wonderful movie, but sadly a missed opportunity at a classic. If only they left him alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An older perspective plus the special edition make this a great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being one of those people who was left feeling utterly disappointed and downright miserable when this movie was first released. However, I'm older than I was back then and now understand the new direction this film had to be taken in. The special edition released is a vast improvement as well and even though David Fincher has pretty much disowned his entire involvement with this film, one can get a clearer picture of what he was trying to achieve had it not been for the powers that be ruining what could have been a great film. The special edition features a more appropriate alien birth in the beginning, several more scenes of character development are included, as well as a more subtle but improved ending. If this is what had been initially released, it would have been an almost perfect sci-fi trilogy. (The dreaded Alien Resurrection doesn't exist to me. I see with that one it was all about the money because there is nothing great about that film at all.) Alien 3 is a very emotional, religious and sacrificial journey. There is a lot of meaning behind it, and I love it now. Funny how your perspective can completely change over the years. I really appreciated the desolate prison planet and the sets that were used were very well done. Fox really messed up with this at first, but part of the wounds have been healed with this new release. This film stands alone at being something completely different but still featuring the same character of Ripley. It is not fair for people to try and compare this to Ridley Scott's Alien or James Cameron's Aliens. It would have been ridiculous and impossible to try and do the same thing over again. People also have to realize that not all stories have happy endings, but they can still be very effective just the same. I would love to see a prequel of some sort to this to learn what the exact origins of the Aliens are, but only if the film was done right. On the downside, I will say there are certain effects that are used throughout the film featuring the Alien that make it look rather cheap. 4 stars!</fullReview>

It is far superior in terms of flow, continuity and characterisation. The darkest and my favourite of all the movies Alien 3 is a gritty, dark and very often unsettling movie. It takes everything you've come to expect from the previous two outings and throws it right back in your face. One of the most convincingly malevolent sci-fi movies ever made. Continually emulated(David Twohys-Pitch Black/ Chronicals of Riddick) but never surpassed Fincher, despite his hatred and frustration with the project has created not only a visually stunning movie but an impossibly high standard. One that quite frankly given film studios current disdain of "R" rated movies and dark subject matter will never be surpassed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit that the theatrical cut is a bit disappointing many people say it seems incomplete well that is because of major cuts the studio required to make the movie shorter. but if you watch the extended cut on the new DVD's you'll see a much fuller complete film. the thirty extra minutes allow you finally get to know some of the characters and everything makes a bit more sense. If only David Fincher would make a real directors cut and the effects were improved a bit, mainly with the matte lines around the alien in some scenes, I think I would give it a 10. But either way i still enjoy it a lot and sometimes i have felt like watching this movie over aliens, depending on how I'm feeling at the time. I think it has great acting and sets. also a good music score and great dark mood. give alien3 another shot and you wont be disappointed.jk</fullReview>

"You've been in my life so long, I can't remember anything else."After surviving the LV-426, Ripley realises that she's yet again landed on another island called Fiorina 161...a prison wasteland. After making it alive out of the EEV she realises that her co-survivors didn't survive this time round. As the EEV collided with turbulence Hicks was impaled and Newt sadly drowned...oh dear! Anyway just leaving Ripley on her own (again) she battles out the alien, as the alien starts pinching the prisoners off one by one. Ripley finds out that she cant be touched by the alien, she's this time immune as she finds out that she's carrying the baby queen in her stomach! Ripley I would more or less say your f*cked! With only a short time to get everything sorted, she has to kill the alien and kill herself along with the little sh!t inside her. Good luck Ripley!Very good to complete the trilogy!</fullReview>

It has a truly unique plot line with Fury 161 and the prisoners, introduces a new alien concept that the beast changes physically with different host species (we don't even know if it has the hive mentality of the human host aliens, because it tears everything to pieces instead of trying to save them for implantation). Alien 3 really delves into the behaviors of the alien, such as the behavior above, and that it won't kill Ripley because it senses the queen alien inside her.I think this is tied with Aliens for second in greatness. Nothing of course, rivals Scott's Alien.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is probably the most controversial of the four "Alien" films. At the time of it's release most critics and audiences hated it. Possibly because they expected more of the violent "Platoon"-in-space action of James Cameron's "Aliens". However, just as James Cameron made his own film instead of just copying Ridley Scott's original "Alien", so first-time feature film director David Fincher made his own film here. This film is bleak, dark, depressing and gritty. The film opens with series regular Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) landing on the prison planet Fiornia in an escape pod. The landing, incidentally, kills off the other survivors of the previous film (which came in for a lot of criticism). However, Ripley has brought with her one of the aliens, which quickly impregnates a dog (in the theatrical version, or an ox in the extended assembly cut of the film).The film is set mostly in a dirty, grim refinery, which doubles as a prison. Everyone is bald (the characters have to shave their heads because of lice) and there are no guns. The film is a very brave attempt to do something different with a hugely successful franchise. Its main flaw is that there isn't really a satisfactory explanation of how the alien eggs got on board the space-ship at the beginning.Everything is a couple of shades darker in this film. Ripley is a much bleaker character this time around. Her entire life has been taken from her by the aliens. The acting is very good in this film. Charles S Dutton (as the prisoner's spiritual leader) and Charles Dance (as the prison doctor with a very shady past) are especially good..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-born on DVD as a classic sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original theatrical cut of this film, as many have already stated, was a disappointment to fans of the original two films. However, 'Alien 3' is not a forgotten film due to it's re-release on the DVD format in which it emerges as a classic film from an on form David Fincher.If 'ALien' was birth, 'Aliens' was Life, then 'Alien 3' is all about death. THe tone of the picture is all melancholy and gritty. The characters are a bunch of paedophs, murderers and possibly cat rapists if they put them in prison, I dunno. In this sense we don't really care what happens to them and are extra stressed about the whole thing because Ripley has to worry about unwanted 'bloodsports' as well as the Alien creature.The casting is perfect though, with a great ensemble of thesps to keep the feeling of genuinely and respectability going.The new DVD edition is a longer film and adds some more dimensions to the alien lifecycle, offers a much more tragic element to the part of the story involving trying to capture the creature, and adds some more iconic visuals with a new opening sequence. THe intended epic nature of the film is only visible in this cut and should be the only one viewed really.Very frightening with no 'action for actions sake'. Remember one thing - this is not a film trying to top CAmeron's effort or replicate Scott's - it is a decidedly down beat Fincher version of the world created in the first tow films.6/10 Theatrical 8/10 DVD re-release with re inserted scenes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irony to the Power of Three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT*SPOILER ALERT*SPOILER ALERT*There are a great number of sequels, this reviewer finds, that are unjustly maligned by comparisons to their predecessors. This is a complaint that is a consistent reminder of the fickle movie-going public. This is the first of this review's ironic findings. That when a sequel is considered a rehash of the last film then it is unworthy. And yet when a sequel, such as Alien3, is different we simply turn our noses upwards at it. Basically, it seems the major complaint here is that Alien3 is NOT Aliens. In particular many Aliens fan whine at Fincher's apparent responsibility in killing off Hick's and Newt before the film has even begun. To which I can find no more an appropriate word than 'Boo-hoo'.These people call themselves fans of the Alien Saga and yet do not seem to recognize the basic fact that they all play on our emotional investments as an Audience. From Scott to Jeunet, all of the directors register the 'Freudian Nightmare' aspect of both the alien lifecycle and saga, and Fincher is no exception. All the previous films both begin with awakening and end with returning to hypersleep, coincidence? It is this careful underpinning in the series as a whole that Alien3 and Fincher so successfully shifts to the audience's horror. Ripley, having previously and successfully faced the entire swarm of alien brethren is still unable to escape her fate, being ultimately and irrevocably entangled with that of the aliens. These simple-minded action lovers complain at the film's relentless downbeat tone and sizeable lack of weaponry and action, yet it is something Fincher should be appraised for having such courage to do. These people dare to refer to the previous two as simple.Ask yourself what could be worse than having had the comfort and hope of friendship and love restored, having already once lost everything you knew, and then so harshly torn away from you again? Ripley is absolutely alone, and what is worse is she is doomed from the start, an alien queen is now inside her. She is the harbinger of all the convicts' death (except Morse). This is what I find so thought provoking and, in the end, moving about Alien3. This is a wonderfully original spin on the format of the first; the alien is now more willing to protect Ripley then guzzle her up for lunch. And so does she sacrifice herself in an attempt to right the wrongs. Why do you people complain at so beautiful and righteous a send off for the now legendary anti-corporate symbol that Lt. Ripley has become?The second irony is also the most aggravating to think about, the 'company' themselves. Fox. Brandywine, the small production company that made its debut with Alien had, by the post-production (or the editing phase) of the filmmaking process on Alien3, effectively relinquished controls to 20th Century Fox Film Corporation. The executives there disallowed our valiant director, David Fincher, the rights every director needs to complete their feature. It has even been said that Fincher was locked out completely from the editing process after his initial 'three-hour' assembly cut was dubbed by the ignorant test-screenee's to have too many bald English people in it.I find it no wonder that Fincher has since disowned the film. Now what I really should say here is project; despite being a fan of both the original and 'special edition', what I find is that the so-called special edition is exactly what the DVD claims it to be: an Assembly Cut (or a rough projection of the film). And it seems to me that original is simply a shortened assembly cut, neither is well and truly what Fincher had envisioned, one has simply creeped closer.No matter how brilliant a director Fincher was on set during production, all he does could amount to Barbarella if it isn't edited with the care and attention that expert Terry Rawlings (Alien) tried to allow it. But he also was stomped on his way by the self-defeating fat cats at Fox.Alien3, from the standpoint of the keener brained filmgoer, is a brilliantly textured film from Elliot Goldenthal's deep and wonderful score to the astounding cinematography of Alex Thomson and Norman Reynolds's immaculate production design. Alien3 looks and sounds fantastic, it fits right in the series. With the Weyland-Yutani logo, the rusted, used and abused look and fabulous compound of design styles. But, honestly, what good is a beautiful tapestry in a narrative medium? Fox greenlighted the project with a script for an almost entirely different project that only has echoes in the film as it stands today.As Fincher was pulled onto the project there was no script and no shooting schedule - even the sets were built before there was a completed script. Fox believed that, as a debut director, they could simply push him around, what they found was quite the opposite. And so alot of the films seems rather like a push and pull game with what he could and could not do. This being said, there are certain aspects of the story (or plot holes) that are fundamentally flawed that were there before Fincher was. We are expected to believe without explanation that in her brief spell on the Sulaco the Queen planted two eggs which were then unnoticed, and then that a single spider alien caused a fire so devastating that it created the need for the evacuation of the entire crew. This simply is unavoidable. It is one of the major flaws of the finished film.Another point I might make is, I believe, again due to the suffering of the editing process. The Alien has now become somewhat mindless - killing and feeding randomly and almost constantly where before it was a terrible and on a freudian level a disturbingly erotic menace. It is now an awful puppet too. All the on set effects are fantastic, but there are unfortunately so many shots of this awful blob of a dog/ox type alien running rather spastically. It's out of proportion and the lighting doesn't match - it's just generally awful. I accept however that it was basically impossible at the time to have the alien convincingly run on all fours on set and that as a fan of science fiction, film and drama I should be able to suspend my disbelief. However it does rather ruin the atmosphere.And so as Fox had finished shooting their own feet, I am brought to my final irony: Alien3 was received badly upon release in one country alone, the USA. Everywhere else it sold very well and generally made Fox alot of money. I believe this speaks for itself.And so in conclusion, I find it very hard to evaluate Alien3 as it is a film I adore and yet take with a pinch of salt in equal measure. It is such a contradiction. So beautiful and thought provoking; the performances are exceptional as is the characterisation and most of the dialogue, it features a heart-wrenchingly beautiful score, it looks fantastic and is courageously pitiless in its assault of the audience's emotional baggage. And yet it is not scary, despite being atmospheric and eerie, the plot holes can be hard to look past and is generally rough around the edges. However it sits rather perfectly at the end of what would have been a trilogy. It has a host of interesting philosophical themes; isolation, redemption and sacrifice. As well as resurfacing old ones like dissatisfaction at the brave new universe and certain aspects of the xenomorph lifestyle. However it has none of the freudian eroticism (beyond Giger's alien-penis-head) that really makes the first one for me. So in the end, all I can say is I recommend this yet-to-be-completed project but always with a caution. Ultimately I am unable to rate it due to the large inconsistencies between the good and the bad.Still this film haunts my mind's eye - the furnace goes out - this represents Ripley's death (a reference to Citizen Kane) - the sweeping score. I will shut up now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a fire on the Sulaco an escape pod crash-lands on a refinery/prison planet killing everyone aboard except Lieutenant Ellen Ripley. As Ripley recovers she realises that fire was no accident and an Alien begins a killing spree that she must stop.The idea of coming away from Cameron's Aliens (a fantastic mix of action, suspense and special effects) and go back to the gritty atmosphere basics of the first film was debatably a good idea. Moving the setting from space and jarring the audience by killing off Hicks and Newt it emotionally puts the viewer at unease from the outset into uncharted territory. Producers, though misunderstood what director David Fincher was trying to achieve back in 1992 and it was plagued with creative differences, production issues, script problems and the film released seemed very disjointed.After watching the new assembled version of Alien 3 I was pleasantly surprised. With the new version what you get is expanded and alternative scenes, more character development and a new subplot making it a more enjoyable Alien movie.Like the previous version the Alien effects are still the same and not very well executed. That said, this version without a doubt is an improvement on the 1992 version coupled with a nice score, great performances, especially from Charles Dance and the sadly missed Brian Glover. Sigourney Weaver plays a very troubled shaven head Ellen Ripley convincingly. This time around with expanded scenes the supporting cast get to show off their acting skills within the fantastic sets. Explained in the new cut is where and why some of the characters disappeared.Overall with these adjustments the film finally sits nicely in the series. It's dark, eerie and atmospheric.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like David Fincher a lot. I think his films are very original and very tactful. Let's think though of his directorial Debut Alien 3 which I believe is his best work. The original version of it wasn't bad at all, it just left gaps opened without filling them in. Since the Quadrilogy was released the Alien 3 disc has given the fans of the franchise the chance to see a pre release version with an added 30 minutes of footage just what.It is a bit grubby in parts as far as the sound goes especially in keys parts of the movie but it gives us the look in to what Alien 3 should have really been like. Like I said I thought the original version was very good but the pre release is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's hard to look past some of the faults with the sound but when you do you see an completely different film. It is a shame that it has taken over 10 years for us to see the real Alien 3 but oh my god it was worth the wait. You just get to see all the characters that miraculously disappeared in the first version turn up in the new version and get a proper send off, if it is by the gushing teeth of the Alien but it adds more spice to the movie and less confusion. We get to see Ripley's relationship with Clemence blossom and become more believable. We see Gollick talking more crazy and see him for the little git that he is. You don't see him die, you only assume what had happened to him so it was good to see what became of him and many other things. I think the biggest change was the beginning in how they found Ripley on the beach after her aircraft crash landed. Even though this is a pre release copy there are scenes which were in the original one and not in this. The scenes I am referring to are when the prisoners open the ship and find all the bodies. One sees Ripley and shouts `she's still alive' which has vanished. The other complaint was that David Fincher had nothing to do with the Quadriloigy. I think if he had said `Yes I would like to get the chance to show this film in it's original form, I'll take it into the edit suite and remaster every bit that needs it and give it back to you for releasing on the box set' but that's exactly what didn't happen and that's where this disappoints. The sound in two major scene's really messes up and starts to become confusing and not to spoil it for whoever hasn't seen it, there is no Alien bursting out of Ripley's chest when she is dropping into the furnace.However it is great to see what it would have been like and Fox should have said yes to the release of this back in 93 only if they sort out the sound and have an Alien come out of Ripley's chest at the end. I think the critics would have thought it to be better than the first two which is what I think and then they would have been quid's in. If only people would think about what ifs.</fullReview>

I was more impressed with technical accomplishments on this film such as Alex Thomson's cinematography and Elliot Goldenthal's music and good film editing by Terry Rawlings. Sigorney Weaver reprises her role as Ripley for the third time and does it great. Charles S. Dutton is the best supporting character if there is any at all. As I said before this movie moves at a slower pace but it's not bad.

		<fullReview>That Vincent Ward's initial vision of the movie and storyline outlined on the special features of the Quadrilogy was extremely interesting? I found the whole story with the monastery and the monks instead of the prison colony and the inmates was great. It was almost a 100% reversal in the actual movie. It's not that I don't like the prison angle, but the way the story of the monks was told, I found it pretty neat. I thought the idea of the alien dragging the first victim through the monastic toilet was funny, and that the love storyline (like Clemens and Ripley) was with Ripley and a holy man doubting his devotion because of a woman's temptation. Then, how they viewed the Alien as God's vengeance and judgment and that they blamed this on Ripley and locked her in the basement. Finally, the burning wheat fields with Ripley's sacrifice and the glass foundry were all ideas that were presented in a neat fashion. Too bad the wooden coverings in the gothic style monastery turned off the producers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fincher Alien. So there are more self-contained set pieces; an alternative terrestrial beach in a storm and an epic/romantic aliendammerung finale. There's plenty of technical jiggery-pokery as well, a sci-fi Panic Room if you like.The acting's surprisingly mixed, considering the calibre of the assembled, largely British cast. At the top end, the Charles Dance/Brian Glover showdown of the off-centre plot is absorbing; Charles Dutton's Blakean inmate is a good foil for the earthiness of the other jailbird brothers and the perfunctory brutality of the inevitable Alien rampage. (Of others, I would urge those who didn't mind Ralph Brown's irritating lieutenant Aaron to check out a made for TV adaptation of Shane Ritchie's Lock, Stock etc.: his mockney boss is the highlight of this entertaining spin-off.) Weaver's Ripley is as committed as ever although the nature of the plot and the necessity for some sort of narrative development in this second sequel renders more a Brahmin than a survivor.An impressive watch, but not entirely to the point, whatever that is. Do watch the director's cut rather than the original theatre release if you've hired/own a DVD with the choice; the narrative unfolds more naturally. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien was an excellent film. Aliens was good too, but it's a completely different movie. While Alien was a film about one alien hunting human, Aliens was a film about umpteen humans hunting umpteen aliens - pure no-brainer action.This film goes back to the roots of the series, and has Ripley &amp; co. fighting one single alien. Once again it's more like the alien is hunting the humans than the humans hunting the alien, the way it's supposed to be. Now they even have to defend themselves against the alien without weapons... This film is much more frightening than the second Alien movie, and is a very good film by David Fincher. It deserves more and better credit. And the ending is breathtaking and excellent!This film has about everything; great story, great suspense, great acting and a great ending.

And I especially enjoy its graphics, dialog, and background.Sigourney makes a great entry,and with all its adversity that came from dieing at the end. I think the alien sequel brought it all into a focus of a never ending saga from alien rivalry to breeding eggs, and alien stories that max the screens of Hollywood.But whats so engraving with the Alien series is they will never have to worry about competition.

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of subtext, audience manipulation, and the perfect continuation of the Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film that tips the Alien Saga into the shadow of the valley of death - _Alien Resurrection_ chronicles climbing free of this valley; neither are easy films, compared to the first two. Good that Fox didn't take the easy way out and instead sought novelty with each installment.As Sigourney Weaver hirself commented at the time, _Alien3_ subtextually addresses AIDS. There are many clues to this, and figuring out the puzzle can add to one's enjoyment of the film (just as figuring out A4's puzzles can do likewise). It's almost like a psychic game being played on the audience: it's difficult to "progress" emotionally into a liking of the film until one spends the requisite effort.(SPOILERS?)Clues to the AIDS subtext include the prisoners' noted celibacy, the needle imagery, the excessive bloodiness (the creature is a blood monster), that the creature emerged from a dog that had brutal oral sex with an Alien, the large body count; and especially one scene in which two prisoners run into each other in the tunnels, whereupon one chastises the other for holding a pair of scissors point-out ("You could kill somebody you moron") - this scene makes no sense ordinarily, seeming like a comic overreaction, but becomes intelligible when realised to be symbolic of needlestick accidents.This is a film about sickness, and it did its level best to make the audience, and especially Alien fans, feel that sickness with their very being. Favourite characters killed off immediately, this endless cycle of hopelessness, a melodramatic joke or poignant coda of an ending (hinging on one's interpretation)...as James Cameron said: "Alien3 s**t on the audience". Exactly. A morbidly effective film, as was _Alien Resurrection_. Not surprising that so many gung-ho action freaks disliked it: it's a film about disease and rape and loss, where we learn there are no happy endings. Yikes!Amusing also that many people open-minded enough to appreciate _Alien3_ repugn _Alien Resurrection_. Give 'em a few more years I suppose. All four films in the Saga are brilliant in their difference as much as their continuity, and I only look forward to a fifth entry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not in the same class as Alien and Aliens, but better than its reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard and seen a lot of negative reviews on this film, and while I can understand the reviewers' disappointments I think Alien 3 is a much better film than it is given credit for. True, the script is not as strong, being not as thought-provoking or as clever, the story does have its illogical parts(I can understand why people are upset at two characters being killed off, it was somewhat contradictory) and the characters aren't as well fleshed out as in the predecessors excepting Ripley and even she was better developed before. However, I do disagree it is one of the worst sequels ever, there are much worse I can think of. Yes it is the weakest of the series, but that's not to say it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The production design is excellent, and the editing is also skilled. David Fincher also does a surprisingly good job directing, by principally developing the maternal themes of Aliens. He has directed better, and he has done better films since, but that is no reason to dismiss his credible directing job on this film. The atmosphere once again is bold, the tone and feel here is more dystopian granted but there are still some good shocks and some unforgettable scenes especially the surgical operating scene and the final showdown, the latter of which is exhilarating. The acting is good enough, Sigourney Weaver is very good, while Lance Henrikssen's brief appearance helps too. Oh, and the tag line is the best of all the Alien movies in my opinion. Overall, Alien 3 is not in the same class as its predecessors, but I personally wouldn't go as far to say it is one of the worst sequels or movies ever. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I noticed something after I watched every alien movie including Alien vs. Predator the gore.Alien - not really that gory it generally used atmospheric music and parts were it would jump out at you or reveal itself slowly. Very effective Aliens - getting more intense gore wise human blood chest busters and alien blood and marines what a mixture Alien3- now this is were it peaked gore wise for me it was everywhere perfect blood smeared all over the alien and its slimy head and its teeth slimy red spit. After alien3 it seems the gore level went down what a shame.Alien resurrection - was just a shambles sure it had gore but it wasn't the same it didn't have the gritty feeling of the other three aliens.Alien vs. Predator - am still unsure about this movie something is missing maybe atmospheric music the fact it didn't get an 18 rating because they didn't put enough violence or gore in and am sure the ending could have been better and the predators sounded odd growling like a tiger aliens were OK but no real gore they made a joke out of the Alien and the Predator series I can only hope they wake up and if they do "Alien vs. Predator 2" they make it gore filled violent and with character u can care about. It's strange its like alien3 was the peak of the gore in the Alien series that's why I love "Alien 3" you cared about the prisoners even though they were murders and rapists and the best line in that movie "FUCK" so many perfect death scenes with realistic amount of gore perfect.They need to take a page out of the book of alien three and place it into the alien and predator movies of the future character to care about gore and a perfect creature from hell.</fullReview>

I'm not a fan of the first Alien, I appreciate it for what it was, but I don't think that it was excellent. The second Alien movie was spectacular. "Alien 3" seemed real promising in the beginning. I mean, it had drama, action, and scary sequences. But then the alien turned into a computer image. Which was real disappointing. Also the killing of certain characters that I will not mention, didn't seem necessary. Over all, it's a good movie. There were just some things that they didn't need. If you want to see this movie I would give you the push, but otherwise it spoils the 2nd one for you.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is without a doubt one of the best Alien movies ever. David Fincher brought back the mystery of one alien and the weird atmosphere an Alien movie should have. The movie wasn't packed with action which gave it more suspense and drama. In Aliens, halfway into the movie I forgot we were in the future. With Alien3 the setting was so bizarre and imaginative I knew we were in an Alien film unlike James Cameron's Aliens which turned into a silly excuse for a movie. Alien3 however had the suspense and darkness of the first one, and the dirty reality of what the future might be like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>for this film, they should have never made alien resurrection...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...let me explain, despite what appears to be a lowish score for this film, i love it. But anything over 7/10 is a classic film in my view is one brinking upon immortality from age of cinema/TV etc (eg: aliens, terminator, etc.)A brief overviewalien 3 is a great movie. Many people slag it off, and i'm not sure why. Had it not been for fox wanting to resurrect the series in the form of jean-Pierre Jeunet's 1997 addition, (i do not count the Avp movies as additions as they are a completely different concept) it would have been a great conclusion. It is extremely gritty, and it is easy to see why when you see that this film's cast is mainly British actors. British actors for some reason manage to do the whole 'gritty-horror' film thing very well. Also this film's setting is very dirty and dingy.The alien itself, as all alien director's have done is a unique design (with the possible exception of the new AsVP design, which goes back to the design from aliens, in my opinion the best alien film but not the best design). The first (Alien) introduced us. The second (Aliens) is less a drooling creature, and appears more rigid. The fourth (Alien Resurrection) were brown, and had fins on the end of their tails to allow fluid swimming for an underwater scene. But the third's is very, very fast. It is truly a terrifying incarnation of the xenomorph, possibly the best since the original. It is extremely menacing, and spawned one of the greatest concepts for fans of alien, the predalien. This is the first film that mentions the concept of an alien getting traits from it's host.But the most important thing about this film is the ending. It manages to pull off an emotional ending in her sacrifice, despite the whole series being about pure terror and horror. I really do love the ending. Ripley's sacrifice to 'kill' the alien (just to have her efforts ruined by Brad Dourif, J.E Freeman and others). Forget the ending to Titanic, or even End of Evangelion (for those not aware of what it is, if you knew you would understand, even if it is interpreted different to mine). Unfortunately the truly fabulous ending is ruined just by the creation of alien resurrection. It shouldn't have been ruined, even if resurrection isn't that bad in my opinion.This is a very good film, even though at times it does manage to a little hollow. However, that's not what the genre/series/film sets out to be.</fullReview>

An alien was on the ship and she has brought one (Or more?) with her. The convicts grow to accept her presence and seek her help to destroy a monstrous alien. In the film she also discovers a dark secret inside herself that gives her a decision that will change her life.This film is interesting.

		<fullReview>Despite the efforts of Ripley and the space marines in the film Aliens, an embryonic alien infiltrates the starship. It accidentally triggers the ship's emergency systems, dropping the escape capsule to the surface of a nearby planet. Ripley finds herself in a prison colony peopled by a religious cult composed of former murderers and rapists. Meanwhile, the alien has managed to grow into a new and deadly form, and is picking off the weaponless prisoners. Ripley soon discovers, much to her horror, that the real danger is much more personal...So, this is "supposedly" the worst in the series from the people's and critics' opinions. But that still didn't let my expectations low for this film after I've read the plot for the film. I got even more excited to see this film, not only that, but because some other people thought this was the best film in the series.Well, I'm split in the middle. I found it much better than "Aliens" but not as good as "Alien". To be honest, I don't know why there is even a fourth film. I thought the climax of this film was done very well and could've made a trilogy out of this franchise. I guess they wanted to make more money.Like any David Fincher film, the whole look of this film is terrific, so far the best in this series. There is even more humor and violence. So why didn't more people respect this film? Well, I can pick out a few reasons, some which I really much agree with: Killing off Newt, Bishop, and Cpl. Dwayne Hicks might have been a bad idea.I could go on saying they killed wrong people at the wrong time just the sake to make a higher body count. Oh, and that the Alien doesn't appear in most of the film and that the many times it had appeared, it was all CGI instead of using it as puppet. The CGI Alien, honestly looked horrible.And that's probably what annoyed me with this movie the most. Other than that, I'm fine with it. I'm also glad to say the characters are less stupid than the previous films, although they are still stupid. There is, more or less, suspense and thrills in this film, but not as much as the previous two films.What I like about this film is that it's not afraid to be different from the last two films. There is one point in this series where things get repetitive. There are some signs that they are running out of ideas in this film but they have many new ideas too. Sigourney Weaver have matured into her role as Ellen Ripley, giving a much better performance than the last two films.I might be in the minority saying this was a great film with some many annoying flaws but I'm sticking to it. I thought the ending was satisfying without a fourth movie, although there is one, and that the film has a strong performance from Sigourney Weaver. I know it doesn't have the horror and action aspect like the previous two films, but as I said, it's not afraid to be the oddball.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who wants to follow up one of the most successful sci-fi series ever? David Fincher was not as famous or successful as he is now and definitely took a brave step in signing up for this. Looking back on it with his other work in mind it is obvious that he brought his own dark vision to the project.This was always going to suffer from comparisons with the previous two. It suffered especially as the audience expected a gun-fest; an expectation rather stunted by the news that the film would be set on a prison planet and contain no guns. What the film does do is put the alien back in the shadows and bring back some of the original's terror.Where the film fails is that it loses a lot of the excitement and tension of the others and replaces it with dull sections of the film and a lack of clear direction at times. Despite keeping the excellent sub-plot of the evil military government the film does fall badly when viewed with the others.When you've got a series, changing it dramatically will only ever lose audience. Here Fincher puts the alien back in the shadows and takes out all the gun-action to up the tension - he does a reasonable job but compared to Alien and Aliens this was never going to be much more than a disappointment. Of course it's still miles better than most sci-fi!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting, but ultimately disappointing, third Alien movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***This review is of the original theatrical cut of Alien 3***James Cameron's slam-bang all-action blockbuster Aliens was always going to be a hard act to follow. Relative newcomer to the director's chair, David Fincher, bravely stepped up to the plate, delivering a dark, moody and rather Gothic third chapter which featured a single creature and a cast comprising mainly of British thesps. Audiences everywhere, expecting an adrenaline rush similar to the second movie, were sorely disappointed and Fincher got a smack-down.I have mixed feelings about the film: whilst it is true that the film certainly has its problems (in particular, poor pacing and a lack of effective action), it is still an interesting effort, with some fine performances, beautiful art direction and a well developed nihilistic atmosphere.The opening credits sequence sees the cryogenic pod aboard the Sulaco, containing Hicks, Newt and Ripley (and the remains of Bishop), ejected into space after a face-hugger runs rampant and causes a fire.The pod crash-lands on a planet inhabited by dangerous criminals and, in a plot development that I find rather inexcusable, both Hicks and Newt bite the big one (kinda makes Ripley's actions in Aliens seem rather pointless, don't you think?). Ripley (and the unseen face-hugger) is transported to a nearby colony where the inmates have formed a kind of religious order; these sex starved nutters are dismayed to see a woman enter their domain, viewing her as a threat to their vows of celibacy.But after the sneaky face-hugger finds an unfortunate mutt in which to shove its ovipositor, and a hungry alien eventually emerges, the prisoners become rather thankful for the ever-resourceful Ripley's presence.Fincher's confident handling of characterisation and careful development of a pervading sense of doom is certainly admirable, as is his eye for a well framed shot, but it is in his handling of the later action scenes, in which survivors attempt to lure the alien into a trap, that he becomes rather unstuck. Overusing his novelty 'Alien-cam' POV shots, the novice director delivers endless tedious shots of people running down corridors whilst screaming. Difficult to follow, due to the dizzying camera-work and muddled editing, these confusing sequences lack tension and excitement. It's a misguided attempt to tackle chase scenes in a new way, that just doesn't work.A downbeat finale, in which Ripley dies, also receives a mixed reaction from this viewer: part of me sees her high dive into a furnace as dramatic and poignant, representing the ultimate sacrifice (with Weaver adopting a Jesus Christ pose as she dies); the other part of me sees her demise as totally unnecessary and a very disappointing way to finish off a really great character.Supposedly, the longer 'Director's Cut' of Alien 3 is an improvement on the theatrical cut, and it seems to have its fans, but I imagine I would still deem it to be something of a letdown in comparison to Alien and Aliens.5.5, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most intense film of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. I love the first two films and in fact I can quite easily tolerate the fourth film. But for me, Alien 3 is by far the most 'grown-up' film in the series. Certainly compared to Aliens which, while an enjoyable film in a kind of gung-ho way, is really just a basic no-brainer "Guns 'n' Ammo" action movie that is merely elevated above its status by virtue of incorporating the Alien franchise. Alien 3 is more of a philosophical movie and I find it remarkable that the script was being written hastily in advance of the shooting schedule, as there are many intense and well scripted scenes. And the direction/cinematography is incredible and gives Ridley Scott's movie a good run for its money.But then I guess if you don't like the dirty, moody look to the sets, or the British accents that prevail throughout, or the lack of military hardware, or the notorious ending, then I'm probably not going to be able to convince you otherwise.I would however urge anyone to see the 'special edition' version which, although making the film longer, gives it more of a film-like pace, rather than the MTV-style "let's move it on before people get bored" of the theatrical version.Finally, in the bonus disc that comes with the special edition, there is a short but telling documentary on how the film was received by audiences around the world. You might be surprised to learn that this 'troubled' film only bombed in the USA, whereas it was extremely well received everywhere else in the world. Make of that what you will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the Alien series as a whole. I have the nine-DVD box set, along with Alien vs Predator, and the special editions of both Predator films. The first time I saw Alien 3, I was a kid, and I thought it was the worst of the three films (this was before there was a fourth film). There was virtually no real action and a lot of boring talk. Over the years my taste in movies has become more sophisticated, and with it I watched as a beautifully crafted masterpiece emerged from Alien 3. Watching it now, it has a well-written story with complex characters who exhibit true personality. Albeit, if you are looking for a super shoot-out with the alien baddies, this film is not for you. The story telling in this film is more of an dramatic art form than a typical action/horror flick. Alien was a good film for everyone, and kids are bound to pick Aliens or Alien Resurrection as their favorite, but it takes an adult's intellect to truly appreciate the complex story that is Alien 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior, but its still good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion Alien 3 is not getting the respect it deserves. That being said there are obvious flaws that detract from the otherwise high quality of the film. Nevertheless, Alien 3 remains a good film and a worthy third film in a series that should have ended while they were still ahead.First and foremost I will focus on the positive sides of the film in my review as I believe they outweigh the negative sides very heavily. It is pretty clear that the third film was an attempt to go back to the basics from the first film. There is only one alien that is very different from all that we have seen before. The fact that the alien is so different gives it back its mystique and adds to the tension as you never know when it is going to show up. This brings me on to another thing I found worked very well in the film. The atmosphere. The film is nearly as atmospheric as the first film but the atmosphere is very different. The first film felt darker as the color palette was very different. Different isn't necessarily bad, however, and even with the slightly brighter colors this film are still very atmospheric and tense. The atmosphere is also achieved through brilliant set work. The sets can be both quite awe inspiring and also quite claustrophobic and it all works from where I'm standing. In fact all the sets and props work beautifully. This is largely due to the fact that David Fincher was a music video director before moving into film and this makes him very visually oriented. I felt that his new interpretation of the Alien mythology was a small breath of fresh air.The actors are mainly very good. Even though Sigourney Weaver's performance is weaker than in the previous two films she is still believable and can still portray the emotional state of her character very clearly. Especially the despair of the character. In conclusion her performance is a bit tired (I don't understand why she returned in the fourth film) but still passable. The best performance in the film belongs to Charles S. Dutton. He is perfect as the semi-reformed convict leader who is ultimately a hero. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty good. Of these especially Charles Dance and Pete Postlethwaite do very good jobs.The design of the alien is very, very good. It works brilliantly in the close-up shots but in the wider shots where you actually see it moving it seems pretty obvious that it is a puppet and that is a shame because it lessens the credibility of the film. Still its nice to see a different kind of alien that retains the frightening features of the original alien but is new as well. I was very happy that H.R Giger returned to design the alien in the third film because even though the aliens in the second film were nice they lacked something design wise and H.R Giger certainly gives that something extra to the alien design here in the third film.Where the film comes out a little short is in the actual story. The overall story is decent if a bit like the first film but with a twist. Instead of having somewhat ordinary people confront the alien we have convicts this time around and that is both a good and a bad thing. I found it to be an interesting approach that was very different from what we've seen before but the fact that they are thieves, murderers and rapists somehow makes it harder to feel for them. This of course does that its harder to feel exhilarated when the alien chases one of them. Also the fact that the film never really had fully completed screenplay did that there are a few annoying plot holes. However, the fact that there never was a fully completed screenplay also increases my respect for the director who still made this film into a highly watchable piece of cinema history.All in all the third part of the Alien series is not without its flaws but it is still a highly watchable and recommendable film to horror fanatics.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw Alien 3, I admit that I wasn't that much impressed by it (I even posted a review earlier saying that it wasn't good; just ignore that one). However, after multiple viewings, it seemed to improve. A lot. Okay, so it's not as good as its predecessors. It's a HELL of a lot better than Alien Resurrection. I admit, I was upset as first that Hicks and Newt were killed off. But now I think it's absolutely necessary. If they had survived, it would have turned into another Aliens. And who needed more of that?The performances are just as good as the ones in Alien and Aliens, especially Sigourney Weaver, Charles Dutton, and Charles Dance. And people complain that they don't care about any of the prisoners because of lack of character development. Well, I have this to say: you're not SUPPOSED to care about them! That's the whole point. I mean, they tried to rape Ripley, for Christ's sake. Why should we care about them? And think back to the other two; they didn't have much character development either. In Aliens, Burke was the most developed character in the whole movie (other than Ripley), and yet he was still basically one-dimensional.Sure, this movie has some flaws. Like the egg on the Sulaco. The most plausible answer is that the Queen carried it on the Dropship when it left LV-426. And yeah, the prisoners swear WAY too much, but you would too if you were stranded on a hellhole like Fiorina 161, with an alien killing your crewmates. And the alien looked a little fake in some scenes, but for the most part it looked convincing and frightening. Alien 3 also had the best ending of the entire series, IMHO. Personally, I think they should've stopped with this movie, but Resurrection isn't all that bad.Flaws aside, I still enjoy watching Alien 3. Sure, it's not as good as either Alien or Aliens, but it's still pretty good. A well-directed, well-performed, visually stunning classic. I think David Fincher did an exceptional job, especially since Alien 3 was his first movie. Hopefully someday, it'll get the respect it deserves...Final grade: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Alien enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to say that Alien 3 is a good action/thriller. It has suspense, good dialogue and a decent plot. But it isn't a good Alien movie, and because of that it will be unfairly dismissed as 'bad'. Aliens continued logically on from Alien, with a storyline that told us more about Ripley, the company and the creature. But with Alien 3, however, it seemed to hit a brick wall. Yes, the isolated mining facility looked nice, and it did establish a forboding atmosphere, but it didn't have the tension of the first two. In the first two films, it was more the thought of an deadly monster hunting you down than the actual monster itself, but here the Xenomorph seems less deadly, and therefore less frightening. In Alien and Aliens, letting it get anywhere near you was certainly fatal, but here you might as well play fetch with it. I recommend to anyone who has seen Alien and Aliens but hasn't seen Alien 3 yet, that when you do watch it, try and imagine that after Aliens, Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop (the coolest character in the trilogy) were rescued by the Corporation and that the people here are actually not the same people from the first two films, and it's just a coincidence that they have the same names. You'll enjoy Alien 3 a lot more, and it won't depress you every time you see the ending to Aliens knowing that they're all going to die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 is undoubtedly the least appreciated of the four films; it took a complete different path than the others, was more visually enthralling and, to the dismay of the general public, has anything but a Hollywood ending. But is that so bad? Given the circumstances Fincher had to deal with during production, we should be glad anything came of it. While the theatrical version is chopped up and grasps at a complete story, we have to again realize that it was FOX that screwed it up, not Fincher. Furthermore, the extended cut, or assembly cut, included in the box set is almost an entirely different film. It captures more of Fincher's vision and is a complete story. The fact this film is widely regarded as 'abysmal' cements the fact people don't like change, but in reality this film is a breath of originality, beautiful cinematography, and a score to reckon with. I'm not here to convince anyone to like it, rather, Im here to say if you have not seen the extended version, you haven't seen the film period. see it</fullReview>

David fincher delivered the most unflinching piece of urban decay in a scifi setting ever made. People did not like this film because it was so dam different. A prison colony? Monks? No females? no sex (on screen)? no female claddly dressed.? no hicks? no, well fun ride. Its not meant to been. Alien 3 is one of the most visually exciting films ever shot. Acting is brilliant, especially the underrated Charles s dullton and Clarke's dance. its foreboding look, textures and the Alien its self are really a masterpiece. No its not Aliens, nor Citizen Kane, but a REAl Alien film. Dark and Depressing. Something different. Look at it is for what it is and not anything else. A beautiful film that is part of ALien legacy. Yes ALIEN RESURRECTION did ruin it as it did NOT have to happen and ALIENS will always be my Favorite film EVER. Howeever Alien 3 Has every right to be along side its prequels and truly is a very misunderstood film of our film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 was, in my opinion, a great film. There are some flaws with the film but the photography, the alien, the characters, it's eerie atmosphere, music, and sound are amazing. The alien's actually scary on this one and they used a rod puppet for the sequences where the alien was running. Most of the time it looks great but there are some shots where it doesn't look as believable. However, for those great shots that do work, you would think it was cgi or even real. David Fincher gave the alien a lot of character making it different but not too different from what fans love about the aliens. A lot of people will say that this film was terrible and the worst of the Aliens movies, but if you're looking for a great film that truly stands out from the rest, than you have to see this one. This movie actually has atmosphere unlike many of the movies you see today. I think it's tragic that many people knock this one down because it doesn't follow the typical movie formula, but give it a try and judge for yourself. Truly one of the most underrated movies out there.</fullReview>

There were no weapons to fight the beast, so they had to chase it through a maze until they could trap it and annihilate it. That plan did not seem to be going well at all, as the scum-of-the-earth prisoners kept getting eaten.Basically, Riply (Sigourney Weaver) and Dillon (Charles Dutton) have to fight this bugger themselves. Dutton was fantastic and made the movie worth watching.Fantastic sound and, of course, marvelous monster effects, and I really thought the reanimation of the android to be especially creepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, how many times can the alien return to terrorize people? No matter, "Alien3" is still worth seeing. An interesting difference here from the first two movies is the setting. Whereas in the first two movies, everyone was definitely a good guy, in this case, the people surrounding Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) are almost as nasty as the alien itself - one scene shows this for certain. Having a shaved head gives her an even more bad-ass feel than the second one.And the end? Maybe they wanted to try something different this time. I had no problem with the end, although I will admit that it was a shocker (of course it turned out not to be the living end, given that there was a fourth movie). As for the fourth movie, you'll have to determine for yourself what you think of it. This one is OK to watch if there's nothing else to do. Also starring Charles S.

		<fullReview>I certainly do agree with a great number of people who notice the obvious faults of ALIEN 3 : It`s rather too slow , the CGI alien is unconvincing , the alien POV is overused , there`s massive plotholes , and the ending is totally ridiculous . BUT at least the producers tried to do something a little bit different with the franchise . I know everyone was expecting some good old US marines to kick more alien ass but it was a pleasant surprise to see the story take place on a prison planet populated by a bunch of British bald geezers . I find it slightly sad that no one has given the cast any credit as they`re the best thing about this film***** POSSIBLE SPOILER *****If I have a problem with ALIEN 3 it`s to do with the fact that once again Ripley is the main character . This seems slightly stupid seeing as the franchise is called ALIEN and not RIPLEY ( But not as stupid as resurrecting Ripley for a fourth alien film ) , and would have preferred it if the story had Cpl Hicks as the main character . Indeed in one of the early draft screenplays of ALIEN 3 Hicks was the hero in a story set upon a space station with the company using genetic modification to create a new type of alien species which would have probably appealed to the audience more , but in tone sounds more like the awful ALIEN RESURRECTION</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why directors should have the power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theatrical release of Alien three was a major disappointment to anyone who has seen the previous two but it is in no way the fault of Critically acclaimed film maker David Fincher. If you want a whole spoonful of helpful advice steer clear of the original release. Instead watch the directors cut. It is totally different to the originally released movie and is way, way better. The only exception to the fact is the end. I won't give it away but i believe it was probably the only good part of the movie almost rising to the airlock sequence in the first. I give the directors cut 7 stars but the theatrical release only 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It manages to deviate a bit from the proved formula, and the cast is very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reprising her role as Lt. Ellen Ripley from the previous two "Alien" installments, Sigourney Weaver continues to excel as a forceful female presence on the screen. Weaver is quite regal with her head shaved, wearing combat clothes and demanding that people listen to her; once again, she's the main reason to see an "Alien" movie apart from the special effects. Here, Ripley hunts down a killer creature on an all-male prison planet, and director David Fincher goes crazy with his camera swooping around barren corridors. Charles Dance is added as a very credible love-interest for Ripley, but there aren't many other surprises in this script, and Fincher doesn't seem to know how to bring it to a coherent, satisfying finish. The art direction and cinematography are curious but ultimately off-putting, and Ripley's final moment is a bummer. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The debut film from director David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, Panic Room), and sequel continuing where Aliens left off is okay. The film begins with flashes off an alien being in the ship that Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver, also co-producing), Newt, Hicks and Bishop (Lance Henriksen) escaped in, which lands on a remote prison and refinery planet. Ripley is the only survivor (of course), Bishop is broken, and Newt and Hicks died, but Ripley wanted to make sure Newt died of drowning, and then they are cremated in molten metal, while a dog injured on the face gives birth to an alien (obviously those marks made by the face-hugger). Ripley like everyone else is made bald, because of the lice problem, the Company call emergency rescue to collect Ripley, who is important to them. Eventually, the prisoners one-by-one are being killed by the alien, Ripley finds out from repairing Bishop it was with them all the way, so the remaining prisoners plan to trap it and cover in liquid metal. The bad news for Ripley though, is that it won't be over for her killing the alien, because she has been impregnated with one. So when the Company eventually show up to take her and the survivors away, including the human Bishop (Henriksen), she knows it is right to destroy it, and is willing to kill herself to do it, so she purposely falls off the edge to die in the molten metal, along with the alien that bursts out just before they hit the pit. Also starring Charles S. Dutton as Dillon, Charles Dance as Clemens, Paul McGann as Golic, Kes's Brian Glover as Andrews, Ralph Brown as Aaron, Danny Webb as Morse, Christopher John Fields as Rains, Holt McCallany as Junior, Christopher Fairbank as Murphy, Pete Postlethwaite as David and Clive Mantle as William. The special effects are not as good as the first two films, the cast is good, and it still remains a good science-fiction action thriller, but it is not essential. I have seen the re-edited version, which is ridiculous, e.g. Ripley found on the beach, and no alien coming out of her chest when she dies, so just see the original. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Effects. Sigourney Weaver was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Ellen Ripley was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ripley Vs. Alien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third installment in the series that has seen our heroine 'Ripley' pitted against the deadly 'Alien' was originally rumoured to be in the hands of Ridley Scott. Since then though it has passed through the hands of Renny Harlin and Vincent Ward, while David Fincher finally completed it.His film is not unlike Scott's ("Alien"), as we find ourselves in very similar surrounds and confines, facing just one creature. Fincher wastes no time creating tension with the very clever beginning to the film, and the climax includes some well-shot chase sequences.Sigourney Weaver is again very convincing in a movie that dispenses with suspense and fast becomes a 'Ripley vs. the Alien' feature. However Fincher never fails to show us the gruesome reality of the monster.Much of the credit must go to the scripting here though, even if we have to allow for some minor plot inconsistencies. "Alien 3" is a more than satisfactory finale to 'Ripley's' confrontation with the 'Alien'.Sunday, June 28, 1992 - Hoyts Forest Hill Chase</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film begins on board an escape vessel in which Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and a droid called Bishop are traveling on. The pod crashes on a planet inhabited by prisoners who have been left to govern themselves in a facility, killing Newt, Hicks, and destroying Bishop. Ripley is revived from her cryo-sleep from the prison doctor and soon discovers what happened to her and her remaining crew members. After calling for assistance from the Company they wait for Ripley to be transported off the planet, as she doesn't belong there. After a short time, a shaven-headed Ripley starts discovering that prisoners are being killed in a very similar manner to that of the Aliens she has faced in the previous two films. Once this is discovered, she and the remaining prisoners must devise a plan to kill the Alien that stalks the prison facility, hiding in ventilation shafts. However, she soon discovers that that it isn't the only Alien on the planet. There is also a Queen, but where? Pretty decent sequel to Aliens. But it copies off Alien a bit too much. Three points of interest is Good script, Not bad acting and a few early appearances.Rated R for Graphic Violence and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was OK. It was still kind of scary and Sigourney Weaver did a good job of reprising her role again. The premise was a little shaky. I mean, how did that egg get there? But still, it makes for a decent movie. Fans of the first two will be slightly let down, but overall it was a decent movie.I did miss the "aliens exploding everywhere" of the second movie. Still, one alien in an unarmed prison complex does make for a nice movie.If you are a fan of the Alien movies, I would stop here. Don't bother seeing number four. Although despite warnings like this one, I still did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien3 misses something... but it's still enjoyable enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something about Alien3 seems... strange to me. It's an enjoyable movie still, but there is something missing.The story is still good, but not as good as the two prequels. There is a build-up, there is development and of course, there is a climax. But it just doesn't feel as... 'wow' as the last two films.The connection with Aliens, or rather the disconnection, makes this film a lot darker. The fact that all the joy you had at the end of Aliens, is crushed at the beginning of Alien3, makes this movie cruel, to me anyway.There are even more shots of the Alien then in the two prequels. Not a bad thing, but there are some points in the movie where it was a bit unnecessary. If you have watched Alien and Aliens, you'll know what I mean.The fact that the creature now is 'born' from a dog, rather than a human, paves the way for new twists. They are present in the movie, mainly how the alien moves. On four legs, instead of two. It's nice to experiment with a concept, but it wasn't really needed for this movie.I think my biggest problem with this film is the cast. Part from Sigourney, none of the characters appeal to me. They're all 'crud', to speak with Sigourney. All criminals, rapers or just plain scum. They don't need a background, but the way they act on the screen just makes you think why they are there. Basically alien food. It's no surprise that barely anyone makes it out alive.There are huge differences with the Director's (extended) version and the 'standard' cinema version. I've watched both several times and I can't say which version I liked best. I advise you to watch the director's version at least once and ponder about the many changes. It left me with more questions then answers, to be honest.In overall, Alien3 is not a bad movie, but it lacks a few things when compared to the prequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did they do to the script?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read some reviews and one said that the 'SPECIAL EDITION' is the only one worth seeing. Maybe so, I don't know. The version I saw was really weak. It was choppy, depressing, and nothing new came into the storyline. The dripping wet, dark hallways look so damn similar to the other versions. At least Ripley had sex. To bad we didn't see a little more skin. That would have helped some. The ending of this movie was fitting, but the setup sucked. If the producers really limited what the director could do, that explains a chopped up crappy movie. Most producers are not artistic. They're business oriented, bottom line morons who can sink any potentially good script down to the bottom line. There is so much bottom line stuff on TV. Alien Resurrection was better than this one, but I don't consider it part of the Alien series. It was a newer story, similar to the trilogy, but different. At least we were able to see Winona Ryder looking good. But it not good enough to deserve a sequel. Most sequels, even if the movies they're bleeding off of were money makers, are quite disappointing. Let's face it, Alien was a great movie. None of the sequels were nearly as entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien3 is worthy enough to be in this series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the production of Alien3, they ran into a lot of problems ex. filming with hardly any script, the film being too long etc.The Original Alien3 can be a huge let down but if you see the Special edition of Alien3 from the Alien set, you will see a very different cut of the film. Including a different Alien Chestburster which comes out of the ox and a new alternate ending.With the special edition version of Alien3, there is about almost 40 minutes of footage added. It shows David Fincher's true vision of Alien3 before it went into editing problems and deleted almost half of the movie. Alien3 is also a human apocalyptic tale, it is more about the humans and less about the monster, which is bad for some viewers who only like to watch the Aliens kill the humans. As well with the visuals on the computerized Alien, looks a bit too fake.Alien3 does bring out great character moments through emotions, which we have not seen in other Alien movies. This is what I believe which makes Alien3 great and unique.Even though Alien3 is no where near Aliens, it follows up more closely to the original Alien, having some scenes that might make you jump. But after seeing Aliens and then watch Alien3, You can say "What the Hell happened?" But if you look past the image of Aliens, you will see that Alien3 is a worthy film. Not the best in the series but worthy enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly underrated - a great film in its own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never really understood why people don't like Alien?, because I think it's a great film - easily as good as anything else David Fincher has turned his hand to. I'll happily concede that the alternative version in the Alien Quadrilogy boxset is superior to the original theatrical cut, so if you're going to watch it, watch that version. It just makes more sense, plot-wise.The first 3 films are all very different films and I suspect that Alien? is unpopular because people expected a sequel to Aliens - more colonial marines, more wisecracking, more guns. More Newt and Hicks. Alien? doesn't deliver this. There are no supermen, fewer gags, and no guns at all. Hicks and Newt are shown as corpses in the opening titles. I wouldn't have objected to a bit more Hicks, I'd had my fill of whiny Newt by the end of the scene in the Aliens Directors cut where she screams her head off in her parent's tank. So, hooray for killing off Newt! I like the look of Alien? - it's dark and gloomy, just as any decent sci-fi/horror crossover film should be. Ripley's companions on this round are for the most part, criminals. It has a decent cast of established British actors in it, who all do a good job of making you care about them as characters - despite the fact they're all rapists and murderers.So, there are no guns, just grubby prisoners in the middle of nowhere. There's also just the one alien, which works well as it restores some of the element of suspense which was so prominent in Alien and almost completely absent in Aliens. Ripley gets impregnated by a super-facehugger and is carrying an alien queen. This is a natural progression in the series, but a good one at that, as we finally get some idea of how it must feel to have an alien growing inside you, from someone who knows it will eventually rip its way out through her chest. From the moment we discover this, we know this film can't have a happy ending (and it doesn't - it led to Alien:Resurrection, which really is a turkey). This also ties up the theme of Ripley and motherhood - we know her daughter died of old age while she was floating out in space. Her 'adopted' daughter Newt dies when they crash land on Fury 161. How sad that her only 'child' turns out to be an alien queen. I thought it was a nice touch that for the first time we are shown that the Alien isn't just a brainless killing machine - it won't kill Ripley because it smells that she has an alien inside her.If I knock off a star, it's because I found the final chase sequences with the doors and the lead works a bit too long. Other than that, I think it's a good film - just not a cheery no-brainer popcorn flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just has good as the previous two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 is a great sequel to Ridely Scott's original sci-fi horror classic Alien. Alien 3 has a dark tone to it which I like about it, it also returns to having one Alien instead of loads like James Cameron's sequel Aliens which is also a great movie. The film has some great gore scenes and suspense scenes, the acting is great and the Alien effects are good and scary, the visual effects are a bit dated. Alien 3 had some different plot ideas before using the plot they did, one plot for Alien 3 had Ripley crash land on a monastery planet where a group of monks thought the was living in a post-apocalyptic dark age and lived a middle-ages style life and don't use technology. After Ripley and the Alien crash land on their planet they would blame the attacks on Ripley and lock her up, in the meantime she finds herself dreaming of a human-Alien hybrid. The idea was changed to have the monks replaced by prisoners and the wooded planet to a prison planet.The film begins right after Aliens and sees the ship catching on fire after an electrically malfunction. The ship detaches and the escape pod crashes onto a prison planet, Newt and Hicks are killed in the crash while Bishop is damaged. Ripley is the only survivor, after waking up she discovers what happened and checks the escape ship to see an acid burn on one of the tubes, she asks the doctor to do an autopsy on Newt to find that there is nothing inside her chest. The bodies of Hicks and Newt are cremated, meanwhile the dog of one of the prisoners was impregnated by a Facehugger and the ChestBuster bursts out. The new Dog-Alien hides away until it's full grown and soon the nightmare begins again as it begins to attack the prisoners, Ripley finds Bishop and reactivates him to ask what happened on the ship. Bishop tells her that an Alien was on the ship, Ripley and the prisoners have to stick together and try and stop the Alien before it kills everyone of them but Ripley discovers something else, she has an Alien inside her. The Facehugger got her while she was in hyper sleep and the Embryo inside her is a Queen. Now she has to stop the Alien before killing herself to stop the Queen from bursting out and the whole process starts all over again.Alien 3 is a great sequel that should be seen. Check this out. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No masterpiece, but no dud either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review based on the Assembled Cut: 'Aliens' was a phenomenon and box office smash at the time of it's release. It also seemed to be the end of the story, but I guess the praise and millions of dollars said otherwise. Another installment would come 6 years later, but both the studio and star Sigourney Weaver wanted it to be the true finale and move on. It's no secret that there were problems during production in which the studio interfered, which eventually made the director leave. Though a really bad sign, it was nothing compared to the reaction this latest sequel would receive. After the crowd-pleasing 'Aliens' what we got was a film much closer in tone and pace to the original, except darker and not filled with much hope. As of this writing, 'Alien 3' is 16 years old. Has time been kind to it? Is it much better than it's reputation would suggest? Not exactly, but it's far from a total bomb.Pros: Excellent performances from the leads. Beautifully shot by music video veteran David Fincher. Some really good special effects. Like blood and gore in these movies? Well you'll find plenty of both here, and more than in the first two. A really good, at times quite beautiful score. The depressing look and mood of the film, which turned off many, is a nice change and fitting for what was supposed to be the final installment. Impressive set designs. A powerful ending that I refuse to give away for those who haven't seen it.Cons: First of all, what was the point of killing off the other survivors of 'Aliens'? Aside from the leads, this film is lacking in people to care about when it comes to the rest of the characters. Some effects don't measure up to the others in this film or it's predecessors. Some plot holes like how did the alien queen in the previous film find time to lay an egg in the ship where Ripley and the others were in hypersleep? Though not boring exactly, the film's first two thirds move at a really deliberate pace, making them a bit hard to get through at times.Final thoughts: This sequel is hard to like, but at the same time not easy to hate. It's ambitious, very dramatic, has some good ideas, and an astounding performance by it's star. But at the same time it's got a few major flaws that hurt it hard. Should the studio be to blame? I'd say so, because it's a known fact that a lot of times studios get in the way of the creative process and the filmmakers vision suffers. Not a total waste, but considering how good the first two are this should have been a much better film.My rating: 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Love it or Hate it Cult Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rest assured, most of us have a detailed assumption of the production troubles David Fincher had to endure making this film. I am one of those damn fans that defends Alien 3 as a highly stylized above the norm sci fi flick, that whilst not falling into the title of masterpiece, is still a brilliant exercise in the darker pleasures of cinema. Alien 3 is an anti climax, or perhaps Aliens was so climatic that there was no need for another sequel. Accepted on its own terms however this may well be a hidden gem of the 90's sci fi cinema.Yes Hollywood is run by the dollar but Alien 3 is a story within a story, the gritty, gun less battle between the nadir of mankind and a lone Xenomorph. It is also Fincher Vs. Fox, the question which may never be answered is: did he save a disaster of film from being a total disaster or did he escape the hands of his accommodates with a stylish but flawed above par mood piece. Out of personal preference I like to think of the second option. Fincher did bring the most creatively shot film to the franchise, and Alien 3 is also the blueprint for Fincher's later artist success's such as his most known works "Se7en" and "Fight Club".The characters in the theatrical release are indeed at times confusing to tell apart, but the films main supporting leads are well drawn out and acted by excellent turns from Charles Dance and Charles S. Dutton . Dances character, Clemens does seem underused but as the franchise has frequently shown us, even the strongest of leads can become the creatures next victim. The take no prisoners aspect of Alien 3 works much better than many of its genres other titles surprisingly. The proof is in the visceral impact Fincher allows you to intake, and make no mistake, Alien 3 is not a feel good film. Weaver gives a restrained but affectionate portrayal to the Ripley character, and in the films emotionally climatic ending some can understand that the restrained performance was a good compliment to it.In terms of Art direction the film is a complete success, especially if one views the assembly cut. It's also always a good thing to have the talented Mr H.R Giger at the helm when designing the runner. So how about the Alien in this film, well he certainly is the most unpleasant the franchise has to offer, and its to Finchers credit that his damp and lonely shots of the "Fury" capture some of the spark the original Alien possessed. The fear is not in the jumps that the audience receives but in the ominous tone of the film as you just don't know where the creature is lurking. Plot holes are also indeed little, a big misunderstanding about a movie like this is the shouting of the words "plot" and "hole" unless your personal opinion on events is compromised there isn't much left unexplained.One of the complaint's about Alien 3 is its CGI, as this was a movie to use some of the first early CGI techniques of the 90's, however weak shots of the creatures CGI are short and in-between. Perhaps my biggest grievance lies in the pacing of the films near final 10 minutes, Fincher does manage to create a kinetic energy to hide this flaw however and the ending of the film also makes these 10 minutes redeemable. Final consensus of this film is in my opinion a high one, I long made peace with it's first 15 opening minutes and concentrated on the substance of the film as a whole. Alien 3 is a strong and satisfying ending to a brilliant franchise ?..if you allow it to be in the most honest of manners.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Alien 3 did not continue with business as usual, the movie manages to make a statement leaving an indelible print on the franchise.The first two films were great and actually superior to the third installment. However, David Fincher defies expectations by bringing closure to the trilogy. (Note: the fourth Alien is an abomination and holds no place in one of the truly great franchises in film history, therefore making Alien a trilogy).While Alien 3 is not perfect the film presents a disillusioned and seasoned character in Ripley. In the first two films, Ripley battles the alien beast with tenacity where the third film shows Ripley coming to terms with her destiny. The alien creature will not leave her trail until she is destroyed. While this theme is somber and unappealing to most audiences, Alien 3 executes it very well. Sigourney Weaver in particular brings the perfect balance of emotion and complacency to master the tone of the film.Alien 3 is lacking in some moments in special effects but the emotional tone of the film remains solid. Ripley is doomed and the movie plays out her finale in solid fashion. Alien 3 may not have ended the franchise in a way most audiences agreed with, but no one can deny that Ripley faced her proverbial demons and faced her destiny for the good of humankind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Check out the Directors Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I usually don't say this, but for this movie it's true: The directors cut, special edition, or whatever you call it (it's a raw version of Fincher that the producers refused) is much much better then the 'original' version we had to see at the cinemas. First, it is longer. It has more atmospheric scenes, that let you get a better feel of the emptiness and coldness of that prison planet. Then there is an important part of the movie where they manage to catch the alien. The producer in the 'making of' says that they didn't want that, because it would reduce the danger of the alien. They took the whole part out of the movie - that was a totally wrong decision in my opinion. In part one (Ash) as well as in part two (Burke) exists a traitor who sabotages the whole thing and in part three that is Golic. In this way it fits perfectly well into the series, and the scene where Golic frees the alien is just magnificent. After all, in this version everything fits better together, it takes more time to develop the whole thing (especially the atmosphere - what is always really important to me) and it has more nice references to its predecessors. So my rating for the normal version would be 6 out of 10. But the new cut would be a 8 in my opinion. But, after all it's a just really good horror/science fiction movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "black sheep" of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is such a departure from the previous movies that it has been blacklisted by the fans for years. Only in recent years, after a decade of rumors of missing footage &amp; production problems, has a more complete "Assembly Cut" given audiences a closer look at what the film originally would have been.Alien 3 was the first film by David Fincher, whom brought his own personal style to the series. Giving the film a bleak look and feel, the movie in the first ten minutes tells us that this isn't Aliens 2. While the script should have been given additional drafts &amp; the film itself has several plot holes when viewed against the previous films, none-the-less Alien 3 delivers the scares and terror of the original film. The music is extraordinary, though at times is washed out due to the screams and sound FX. Audiences may have trouble identifying certain characters, as many look similar, and most names are hardly used. While the film may drag out at points, the suspense soon picks us, giving us a modern-day (or futuristic) "ghost-house" type of story similar in style to the original film, leading to a heart-racing final climax.Sigourney Weaver delivers a great performance of a woman trapped with little options, who has evolved from a common woman in Alien to now a woman with little to lose; willing to directly combat the creature. There are plenty of plot twists in the film, and for fans of the previous two films, the ending is emotional.As for the Alien itself... Without giving away spoilers, the Alien effects and in terms of how it acts and moves is cranked up a notch; the bar is raised in terms of viciousness and speed.As part of the two-disk set for the Assembly Cut, there are also extensive features that detail previous story ideas, including the popular "wooden planet" concept, and for the first time delves into the production problems that caused David Fincher to walk off the project and give up the film to the producers.After viewing both the Theatrical and Assembly Cuts, as well as the extensive making-of features, I personally give the film an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose with the benefit of hindsight, I can see exactly what director David Fincher was trying here. We all know him for his Se7en's, Fight Club's and his Zodiac's but this really does work as an early piece of bleak cinematography and eerie suspense from the man. There is a lot of hate for Alien?, partly because it resembles the first Alien so much and probably partly also because it does not resemble the second Alien film enough. But to dislike it due to its lack of covering new ground is more of a compliment to Alien and its original, brilliant approach than it is a criticism of Alien? because whilst this isn't better than '1', it is better than '2'.I did not enjoy Cameron's fast, action packed shoot 'em up attempt at an Alien film the first time I saw it and with subsequent viewings, it slips even further down the ladder of quality. There was just no heart and no attempt at trying to scare us ? it was merely a bunch of uninteresting, annoying marines shooting monsters. But Alien? tones things down; it calms the viewer and allows us dialogue to listen to; situations to arrive and be dealt with whilst allowing certain characters to die either tragically or unexpectedly. In Aliens, there would be a gunfight; a death and some silly one-liners afterwards ? this would be repeated for the film's duration. Alien? does not allow us dumb action rightly so until the film's finale and even then, the action is not dumbed down; it is a sequence where the prisoners must use their logic in trapping the beast so that they may succeed ? the idea to ban all guns from the film is a bold and brilliant one and one that is said so early on in the office as a sort of way that allows Fincher to announce his ideas: "this will not be like the previous film: there are no guns on this particular planet." But then again, Fincher cannot direct action too well anyway. His subsequent films include little to no action but they get across a feeling that you have just seen something rather stunning anyway. The finale in Se7en is not an action set piece but a twist that makes you feel you've just seen something incredible; the twist in Fight Club hits you in a way that again forces you to come to terms with the revelation whilst making you feel you've just seen an amazing action set piece. But Alien? is a Fincher film that has a few death scenes sprinkled in it throughout without ever feeling like it will suffice as guilty entertainment - Fincher knows suspense and gets the balance right. There are some scenes early on involving a suspicion Ripley (Weaver) has; the subsequent autopsy and nearer the end when nobody knows where the Alien is in the tunnels. To me, these scenes suffice and act as more entertaining and more interesting viewing than out and out gunfire action.With this in mind, whenever death scenes do occur they do so in a sudden and disorientating manner which is a neat idea for a film to do but when it is handled by someone like Fincher who is more of a suspense director, it can fall flat. Consequently, a scene in which a couple of explosions go off for some reasons and people go flying all over the place, it seems a little heavy handled and sloppy, but it only ever happens once until the finale which like I said is more logic and camera than one-liners and gunfire. Directors such as Spielberg in Jaws, Saving Private Ryan and Munich as well as Scott in the first Alien can get the balance right between suspense and action and here, Fincher gives it a good go.There is also that reoccurring idea to do with gender and sexuality. Ripley and the last few members of the crew from Aliens have crashed onto a planet inhabited by male prisoners. There is a scene which challenges what these prisoners want, sexually, with how much they want it. The lead warden (rather foolishly?) announces a woman is in the establishment but the woman is Ripley who of course embodies very masculine traits; this is further emphasised when she shaves her head, shedding any femininity that remains ? this challenges the male prisoners, some of whom have been established as rapists: do they still want the woman if the woman is not 'like' a woman? These ideas also pay reference to the character of Vasquez in the previous Alien film.There may be the notion that Alien? is very much like Alien what with its idea behind there only being one beast to contend with and a crew in an confined space without any weapons. There is also a hard bodied, strongly willed black character who is clearly (in a positive ethnic representation) the only one who wants to fight, echoing the character of Parker in Alien. But the film is not bad; the sets and cinematography are good and whilst the deaths, action and the surprising amount of British prisoners is iffy, Clemens' relationship with Ripley acts as a sweet distraction and the film does its job overall. The only thing that had me truly puzzled was why we saw the world from the Alien's POV in this film ? I do not recall that having been done previously and cannot work out the theory (if any) behind this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You definitely won't hear me say that "Alien?" is better or even on par with its two brilliant predecessors. It's not. It's not even playing in the same league, but nevertheless this third entry in one the greatest Sci-Fi franchise ever accomplished is a sublime movie in its own right and the negative reputation it developed over the yeas is undeservedly harsh. Part three isn't as suspenseful as "Alien" or as spectacular as "Aliens", but at least the script doesn't aim to be an ordinary imitation of the first two and continuously attempts to add new ideas and twists to the formula. David Fincher's film has multiple trumps, including the depressing setting, grim and nightmarish set pieces, plausible and versatile characters, the recurring presence of the always-reliable Sigourney Weaver and a handful of marvelously staged action sequences and special effects. Somewhere in a distant future ? allegedly the 26th century ? Ellen Ripley's space capsule crash-lands on prison colony in outer space. The inhabitants of the prison planet are all hard-boiled and dangerous individuals who haven't been around a woman in several years. The unhealthy sexual tension between the prisoners becomes a luxurious issue when it turns out that a rapidly developing monstrous alien sneaked aboard of Ripley's capsule and prowls freely around the facility using the ventilation systems. The unstoppable alien makes several casualties before the remaining survivors gather around Ripley and decide to help her fighting the creature, rather than to wait until the Company comes to the rescue. The first half of "Alien?" is superior but, ironically enough, also the tamest and more story-driven half of the film. The interactions between Ripley and the prisoners and between the prisoners mutually form the highlights of the film. Every character has a fascinating background and you'll quickly find yourself wondering who amongst them, if any, will survive the confrontation with the alien perpetrator. "Alien?" masterfully exploits the element of surprise, meaning that ? apart from Ripley perhaps ? it's practically impossible to predict which character is likely to die next and how. Admittedly the second half, largely revolving on the bloody cat-and-mouse game between the inmates and the alien, is a bit too chaotically filmed and not always easy to follow. James Cameron's masterpiece "Aliens" offered a delicious smrg?sbord of heavy artillery and copious amounts of gunfire, whereas this sequel is the complete opposite. Supposedly the extraterrestrial prison facility doesn't have any weapons at all (a bit hard to believe, but still?) and thus Ripley &amp; C are forced to battle their nearly invincible opponent with sly and well thought out plans and industrial machinery. The monster's original design still takes my breath away after all these years and innumerable viewings. The alien is ? hands down ? the absolute scariest movie creature ever developed, and even the newborn ones look incredibly menacing. The climax is stupendous, sad and legendary all at the same time and anyone who ever saw all the Alien films will unmistakably feel the deepest sympathy for Ellen Ripley. Speaking of which, Sigourney Weaver gives her third flawless performance in the franchise she pretty much owns entirely by herself and, just like in parts one and two, she can once again depend on a solid supportive cast. Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance, Brian Glover and Danny Webb all give away the finest performance of their whole careers. Some of the characters are killed off perhaps a bit too early, but it's all part of the delightful surprise and shock effect. The best description of "Alien?" I ever encountered unfortunately isn't one I thought up myself, but here goes anyway (I wish I could credit whoever said it, but I forgot where I first encountered the comment): "Alien?" isn't a bad movie at all. In fact, it's a terrific movie and countless times better than 90% of all other outings in the Sci-Fi genre. It just has the misfortune of having to follow two landmarks it couldn't possible equal in the first place. Amen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply a great ALIEN movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>!Warning! This comment will contain spoilers!When I first saw ALIEN 3, I was maybe 13 or 14 years old. I thought it was really a great movie, so later, when I read some reviews, I was surprised how almost everybody hated it! I really liked the idea of setting the story of this movie on a prison planet. The previous films were all dark and scary, but this one also added the depressing element of a rotten, lice infested, dirty prison. Plus the whole religion thing gave a great mystical feeling to the Alien creature. The acting is also very good, and I didn't even mind that Newt and Hicks died right at the beginning of the movie (not that I have something against them). Sigourney Weaver's performance is impressive, just like in the previous films, and the other actors do a really good job too, especially the character of Dillon. The final part of the movie, when the remaining prisoners try to capture the monster in the lead works, is simply brilliant. The scenes done from the look of the Alien are great and they give the chase a claustrophobic feeling, so the thin corridors look even smaller, and you get the impression that the characters can't escape from the Alien. The ending is, in my opinion, the best in the whole series. Ripley sacrificing her self even brought a tear to my eye, because I am a long time fan of the series, I love the character of Ripley, and seeing her sacrifice her self to save man kind was a touching moment. In the end, when they close the prison Fury 161, you realize, that over the movie, you have grown to like the place. And by the way, I think that ALIEN 3 has the best musical soundtrack in the whole series. However, the movie is not perfect. Aside from some of the plot flaws (but the flaws in the plot don't keep you from enjoying the film), probably the weakest point of this movie are the special effects. I'm not talking about the shots were the Alien suit appears, Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff did an amazing job designing and building the Alien and it really looks alive. I'm talking about the shots were we can see the computer generated Alien. The CGI version of the creature looks fake.But this is just a minor flaw in a great movie such as this one. So all I can say is, that this film is in NOT a bad film. It is great and I just don't understand all the negative comments that it is receiving. I can only recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of My Favorite Alien Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 'Alien?' 10 years ago and remember having really enjoyed it. Recently, I found the special edition DVD at a reasonable price, so I grabbed the opportunity. It was also the first movie from the Aliens series that I had watched. I saw the other three movies afterwards and didn't like them so much. However, 'Alien?' takes off pretty much from where 'Aliens' ended and this might make the understanding of the going ons a bit fuzzy in the beginning.What makes this movie better than other alien movies is that it's not only the alien that is scary but the whole atmosphere. Fincher is quite successful at this as has been evident in his other films. The setting is very claustrophobic, dirty and isolated. It's shot in a very neo-Gothic style. It's set in a rusty tone. Visuals are outstanding. Of course, there is the fight-the-alien-with-weapons but the film does manage to sustain the entertainement factor without putting off the viewer.Weaver is back again as Ripley and does very well. She isn't the typical action heroine. Her character is very layered as Ripley's very strong and brave but at the same time vulnerable too. She gives a nuanced performance. Charles Dance and Charles S. Dutton are good too as are the rest of the cast.While the current screenplay isn't bad, I wonder how the film would have turned out had they used Vincent Ward's original script where the film was to be set in the monastery (watch a special edition DVD) as I liked that idea and perhaps it would have made a great film too. 'Hope they use it for the next one. While I generally do not like most alien movies, there are a few like 'Alien?' which provide the kick-ass entertainment while staying a clever film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the assembly cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a bad movie, but it is an unexpected and unneeded twist to a stable storyline. Its important to differentiate an alien movie like this one from one like Alien: Resurrection, which is mediocre verging on bad. At least in this movie Ripley is still an actual character as opposed to a superwoman. She has fears and hope, but she is also beat down and resigned to her fate, which creates tension.Its interesting to note that in Ripley time its only been a few months since she was on the Nostromo in the first film. She keeps getting frozen for a hundred years...My advice is to track down and view the 'assembly cut'. There is a great deal more dialog and additional scenes, and as a result you can actually develop a connection with the characters - unlike the theatrical release where its just a bunch of anonymous guys getting slaughtered.After aliens, I look at the other sequels as if they were "what if" comics - (for example 'what if' hicks and newt died and Ripley crash landed on a prison planet).I hope that someday someone will make a movie that picks up where aliens left off, instead of letting that storyline die. However, if you like the alien series and mythology the 'assembly cut' is the way to go. Although the sound isn't perfect, it is more true to the directors original vision and a fun 'what if' storyline. The theatrical version may be enough for you, or you could just plain not like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally agree with other reviewers that this movie grows with time.Not so much because of the new monster and horror, but because of the graphical design of the scenery and the atmosphere. The filmic expression is very well and consequently followed through.I saw one reviewer complaining about the erotic affair between Ripley and Clemens. I think the type of their affair follows quite well with the character of Ripley. This is nothing like "Gone with the wind" or anything. It is not a big part of the plot, but it makes the character of Mr. Clemens more interesting. I will really recommend people, not liking this movie the first time, to give it a second chance (or third etc.) Once again Weaver is great as Ripley, taking charge. The end of the movie is OK but the "return" of Bishop is a little lame and unnecessary./brian</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of time but a jump for Fincher into the scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all i have to say that wasn't very clever from Fincher to do a 3rd. part of a story that everybody knows, but thinking of the work he has done years after directing this movie i see the eager Fincher trying to get into the world of suspense in big productions, i have to say that maybe when he has his first read of the script he thought he can create a piece of art, but honestly the script doesn't have any new ideas to the alien world, and doesn't left chances to create an atmosphere of any different suspense like the past 2 films (that i enjoyed very much).About the plot, well, if you like Hollywood movies it will be OK, i really like Fincher work, and for been his first serious work he have done a very good work, acting is very good in almost all scenes, the plot (compairing it with the past 2 movies) is flat, special effects (because we have seen very striking scenes in the past 2 movies) are very few and without any creativity about machinery, weapons, etc.But, it's watchable, and from Fincher's point, my first serious movie was a millionaire Hollywood project..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually Alien 3 gets better with time. I recently re-watched the film and I have to admit that I quite enjoyed it. This movie is very creepy and atmospheric, and looks quite beautiful in many places.. OK the story was pretty lame but the story originally done by Vincent Ward had been gutted and only a shadow remained of the original concept. It's not a perfect film by any means, they killed off Hicks in the first 2 minutes (my favorite character from Aliens)and overall the story and character development is very weak. Non the less give it another try. I hated Alien 3 when it first came out, however this film grows on you with time. A worthy addition to the Alien franchise, heck it looks like Godfather pt 1 compared to AVPR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm probably a minority of one, but I think this is a great film. I just watched the "Special Edition" from the box set yesterday, and it was like watching a different film to the "Standard Edition". It is the true, spiritual sequel to Alien. It's dark (both literally and metaphorically), with a great cast of characters played by "proper" actors, with a gratuitously profane script with some Olympic-level swearing worthy of Quentin Tarantino. After the crash, bang wallop of John Camerons's Aliens, this is a far better movie.Here are the extra bits that IMDb demands; From the cast, Danny Webb deserves special mention as a cross between Patrick Malahide and a rat. Charles Dance is his usual smooth self with a pinch of menace, and Sigourney Weaver IS just as sexy as usual with a crew cut. Brian Glover and the 85 character make a great double-act - like a malevolent Morecambe and Wise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though this movie is not necessarily like the first two Alien movies, it stands alone as a great movie that is based on a familiar story. When I first saw it, I must admit that I expected an action-packed ride similar to what James Cameron gave us. But that movie was very different from Ridley Scott's view in the first movie. So, I tried to keep an open mind.David Fincher's take on the story is a grotesque view of just how bad Lt. Ripley's luck can get. And thanks to some terrific performances by many of the cast, Alien3 is (just like the first movie) a very entertaining Sci-Fi thriller.I agree with many, here, that the Special Edition is an improvement over the theatrical version. However, I also believe that both versions tell the story with great flare. Perhaps a lot of my view comes from being a serious fan of David Fincher's work since this movie. So, perhaps I am biased but I will maintain my opinion, nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this would really be an awful film I would not have chosen to watch it again. If you want to see awful go see the Alien vs Predator flicks. Those deserve 1/10 ratings and are simply B-movies, made without talent.But this film has interesting characters in a setting we haven't seen in the Alien films before, with more depth than any of the other films. While it's true that it doesn't help to have a leading character that is going to die for sure combined with lowlife thugs, you may not care about them. I did care about the Charles S Dutton guy and the doctor who died way too soon. They made a mistake there. Finally Ripley is a bit sexier and has a relationship with an interesting man but he's one of the first to go. And yes there are more mistakes. It does not make sense that Ripley stays alive for so long before the chest burster comes out and that she didn't drown long before that. Beyond that others have pointed out plenty of other plot holes. One thing I don't get and remains unexplained is how exactly this alien is different...yes it's smaller and has a different color...but why??? The movie lacks much of the suspense and shock moments that the first Alien had. Also, graphically, it's rather monotonous in color. David Fincher has made better films and this one is no where near as gripping as Seven.But of all the films it probably has the best acting. Weaver is brilliant in each film which is why they kept asking her, as the popular heroine Ripley she's guaranteed to generate plenty of cash for the box office and she sets an example how to portray a real strong and heroic, but still fragile and feminine character of flesh and blood (not a single actress has come even close to her performances i.m.o.). Dutton and the British guy that plays the doctor are very good too. That and addiction to the Alien series with Weaver makes the film worth watching. I consider the 4th installment to be the worst, because it had too much caricatures, in this film, the people are more real and you really get the sense there is a community they live in, no matter how humble and grim.</fullReview>

It also really does connect you with the characters, even though they are criminals, you still feel for them.This is a good follow on from the second. Some bits may be a bit slow, but when it gets to the alien scenes, the suspense kicks in. Again great cast and Weaver again does a great job of Ripley.I love the way it shows filming from the alien's eye when chasing the victims, great idea. I really like the lighting (brown and gold together)because it shows how dirty the whole of Fury 161 is. It also shows a lot of shadow which is good to create suspense.I think this is the most tense and scariest in the series because we see the alien run and attack so fast that you feel you have got no escape. We see for the first time, this one has four legs.Some people think this is the worst one, but I think its definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated as its own film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People tend to give this movie quite a bit of negative attention, whether it was the writing, how it correlated to the overall plot, or David Fincher's work. To be honest, this seems to be fairly close-minded. People have to accept that each movie is its own entity, like a collection of short films. Scott made a claustrophobic horror movie. Cameron made an action military film. Fincher made a chase movie, with stakes even more depressing than the first film. Simply put, none of them are the same, quality-wise and story-wise.As its own film, this movie is quite good. The writing (though not necessarily the premise) falls short of the masterful directing, and the acting overshoots it. The effects are, sadly, 1992 (you can't expect much) and there are quite a few small mistakes here and there. Still, Fincher's choices were, for what he was given, well thought out, even at that stage in his career. People on IMDb have a tendency to pin every bad aspect of a movie on the director, when at times others are at fault. Fincher got all of the flak for a script he tried to polish and a few actors over-acting.Fincher's choices surpass those of even Scott. Unfortunately, the choices of many others shadowed his in what could have been an incredible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 was given the unfortunate situation of preceding two ground-braking films. The first redefined what we'd come to expect from the horror genre and the second did the same with the action genre. The third had high expectations and ultimately failed to meet them. That is not to say its a bad movie though.Alien 3 assembles just as strong of a cast as the first two. With a good mix of both American and British talent. The British actors outshine the American ones, with only Charles S. Dutton really sticking out amongst the American bunch. The Alien now resembles a four legged animal, but unfortunately loses a lot of its scare by being computer generated a lot of the time. In my opinion that is the largest fault of the movie. The movie is saved by the strong cast and their relationships with each other. Some don't get much screen time or much of a character but the ones who stick around till the end are the most interesting anyway. There are some powerful scenes in this movie which stick with you and its thanks to the excellent cast. You'd be best off getting the Special addition of this movie as it fleshes out a few more of the characters and clears a few others things. You'll still do well seeing the regular cut though.Artistically the movie is more impressive than the previous two. Thanks must go to Fincher and his dark style of atmosphere and storytelling. Why he dismisses this film is beyond me, not his best film but nothing to be ashamed of. All film makers have their ups and downs and this is definitely one of Finchers downs but because of the sheer quality of his other films it shouldn't be seen as bad in any way.Its safe to say this movie might not be for everyone. Its dark, violent and a much different beast from what we saw in "Aliens". But pay attention to whats on screen and you may think differently than most.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aliens 3 as an early 90s AIDS scifi parable?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing Aliens 3 in an almost empty movie theater during its original short release time I had the feeling that I had just viewed a cinematic parable for the AIDS scourge. There were haunting and elegaic sections of the film that were wrenching to view. Coupled with beautifully muted thoughtful music cues it was a somber but enriching experience. Being a social deviant was presented as a curse that keeps on giving regardles of the setting or one's vague search for redemption or atonement. A hetero female enters into the monastic/penal colony setting and shows that regardless of their determination she is the one symbol of gender purity that will not just haunt them but very likely be the catalyst of a terrifying death and oblivion. As other viewers have pointed out the film is rich in material to ponder much like BLADE RUNNER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike most people, i enjoyed this film. Sure it didn't have those same characters you could relate to but that was the point. This was a dark gritty movie and was intended to be that way. I am happy for the way Newt and Hicks died. I thought Aliens left us with a hope that should no have been there in the Aliens franchise. Right from the first movie to the second I could tell that Ripley would be fighting these things to her dying breath. And that is why I found the ending the greatest part of the entire series! It gave us a conclusion that ended Ripley's journey and I thought in a good way; sacrificing herself to stop the aliens. I agree, this movie does not TOUCH the greatness of Alien or Aliens, and nothing ever will. Not even the supposed Prequel in the works that is to be directed by Ridley Scott himself. But in all fairness, this movie BLOWS AWAY the pile of garbage that is Resurrection. The characters in this film, although not the kind you could relate to, were believable. They really seemed like the types of people they were portraying. Resurrections characters were not only ones you couldn't relate to but weren't even believable and they were just action movie clichs. So yeah, not as good as the first or second But hell of a lot better than resurrection. Alien 3 will forever be my favorite ending to a series of movies, considering i will not accept Resurrection as a legit movie in the Alien series. I will leave you with one quote that rightfully fits this movie and series. It is better to burn out than fade away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Alien titles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a real shame that many people did not enjoy this addition to the Alien franchise, all the comments that you see posted are generally the same but I think that they superficially skim over the surface of what is actually a very good Alien film and one of my favourite's.It is important to note that there is a 'Theatrical' release of this film and also a 'Directors Cut'. It is a real shame but the Directors Cut explains the story a lot better than the theatrical version ever did. The editing and cutting that became the Theatrical release really impaired the story and the characters and left everyone with the same clueless feeling about the overall package that is Alien 3.If you want a lot of guns, cool technology and colonial marines then watch Aliens by Jim Cameron, Alien 3 is more of an exploration of Ripley and her regression back to her normal self before she was mentally scarred by the events of the previous films. Her regression is short lived as (in true Alien style) there is a Xenomorph on Furion 161. You can relate to Ripley, she is a normal person (a Flight Officer profession wise) but a lot of what she used to be had been stripped away by the previous events. What you see in Alien 3 is a small glimpse of hope in her that things might be over.The prisoners of Fury 161 comprise of many talented British actors (not all British of course) who deliver exceptional performances (Charles Dance is a prime example). It was not to everyone's taste. They do however offer a gritty and well balanced malevolence to the whole film.If you want to fully appreciate Alien 3 you really need to treat yourself to the Directors Cut, this offers a better delivery of the story and also explains things in a lot more depth. There is still small room for improvement even in the Directors Cut of the movie (more notable the Queen Face Hugger the comes off the Ox, you see it from a distance however there was a large model made for the puppet and to be honest it looked amazing, you never see this).I still have to rate this film with an 8 though, I would love to make it a higher rating but the effects on the Alien itself are not the best. They literally used a puppet on poles and the result is excessively noticeable and lets the movie down. However this film is substance of quality and is a real discovery of Ellen Ripley and if you follow the film and enjoy it you do feel the emotion as she kills herself over the blast furnace.Top film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The restored edition. Not the crappy studio edit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Alien 3 I thought it was the best one of the entire franchise. So when I saw this two disc special edition in a shop and bought it I expected to see the classic Alien 3 I fell in love with at the beginning. What I didn't really expect was the added parts and how much they stick out from the original cut I'd grown so used to seeing over the years. Fincher's everlasting attention to detail is evident early on in his career but his ability to make the norm a menace is showcased even here. Alien 3 is, on the surface, just the next chapter is Ellen Ripley's nightmare encounters with a xenophobic alien with acid for blood and a taste for carnage, but look deeper and you'll see there is so much more to it. This film is so much darker than the other three in the sense that there is the human element which makes it so much more? sinister. These rapists, murderers and so on that Ripley finds herself amongst adds to the already high tension of the movie. The exploration of the human psyche and its elements is an aspect which is becoming more and more closely regarded with Fincher's cinema, perhaps even paramount to it.Charles Dance's excellent turn as a the prison doctor and love interest is soon destroyed by a regretful confession of his past whereby he killed for joy and sets a tough benchmark to be beaten. And, like the first two films, there is the obvious sense of sexism lurking amongst the men, when Ripley proclaims an alien is with them she is shrugged off and kept in solitary.With all of this going on, it is easy to see what Ripley faces in this third chapter as she is not only pitted against the xenomorph once again but first she must convince the men there is indeed an alien with them, as well as survive the lusts of these very same men whom have not set their eyes on a woman in the flesh for years?Alien 3 is, undoubtedly, the true sequel to Ridley Scott's terrific first instalment, unlike Aliens which merely attempted to up the ante and better the original, Fincher's debut actually lives up to it and keeps it within the Alien realm but takes it elsewhere too.Although in the strictest use of the term this version isn't actually David Fincher's "director's cut" of the film, this extended and restored version gives it more than enough justice and authorship so deserved of Fincher. Although nowadays, thanks to the precious medium of special edition DVDs, those visions can be seen unhampered, unadulterated and in their true, original and intended forms. Which, when you see the slightly altered scene of Ripley's self sacrifice at the end which doesn't have that God-awful clutching of the alien as she plunges herself into the molten iron in some laughable attempt at heroism, you'll be bloody well thankful for.Read the full review and more at www.wrawreviews.co.uk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, But I Have Seen Better Sequels!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 is a pretty good movie. There were several things I was disappointed with in the plot. Overall, I enjoyed watching Ripley versus Alien the third time around.The story takes place right after Aliens. As soon as Hicks, Newt, and Ripley escape, they crash land on a desolated prison planet. Only Ripley survives. She finds out that an alien has boarded the ship and is now loose on the planet. Ripley must unite with the prisoners to defeat the deadly foe.The acting is still pretty good compared with the first two films. Weaver as Ripley is powerful displaying her emotions. Some of the prisoner actors were great too especially the black guy. There are a few things I am disappointed with. I am displeased when animals die gruesome deaths such as the dog did when the alien attacked him. I was sad to see Ripley commit suicide. She ends up being a clone in movie number four. I think that David Fincher did a good job. This is one of his first projects.I rate this movie 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this film when I was a kid. I used to watch alien and aliens all the time and was so excited when this one came out. I was 13 when I watched it and thought it was crap because there were no guns but I have changed my mind and now rate it very highly. The directors cut is a lot better that the theatrical. The scene where the inmate goes mental and opens the door to release the 'dragon' is special not to mention the class chase scene through the aliens eyes and when the alien grabs Brian Glover from the ceiling. What about Charles Dance's exit? Class. The ending where the real Bishop turns up, again really good. The atmosphere is really downbeat and you think I don't wanna be in this situation. I think it is a fitting ending to a great series. The real travesty is Alien resurrection which doesn't fit into the series at all. This film is miles better than a lot of blockbusters that come out with fantastic fx and action scenes but shocking scripts and story(transformers springs to mind).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual and atmospheric dark sci-fi experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have to say I was shocked, to see such bad reviews and low ratings for this movie, here on IMDb.As a huge fan of the Alien series, I consider myself very rigorous about the content of any Alien franchise product (whether it is a game or another movie). Also, I have to admit, that when taking "Alien" and "Aliens", into consideration, Alien 3, is really not much of a deal in terms of shock, which the first two Aliens brought to the overall cinematography. Maybe thats what those poor reviews are about? One must take into account, the amount of production problems this move has gone trough. Huge and rapid changes of scripting, budget problems, lack of trust in Fincher's style just to name a few. Also, the movie is extensively cut, to suit FOX's time and style demands (The whole material Fincher had shot for this movie, lasted approx 13 hours). Another thing worth noting, is that Alien 3 was facing a "cancel order" from FOX a few times...As for the actual movie:The overall acting performance is at the top level, with excellent choice of actors. Almost every character is unique, with some special characteristics. Of course, this is not even close to the marines from Aliens, but hey, Cameron was already a master when he directed Aliens. Fincher was just beginning. Also, there's a lot more characters in here.As for the atmosphere, I believe that in certain moments, it draws near to that of the original Alien masterpiece. The feeling of a "man-hunt", a strictly no-chance situation, with the prisoners unarmed, trapped in a huge maze of tunnels and corridors, really IS the thing you should be able to get from any Alien movie. Alien 3 has it.Also the artistic level of the movie is simply great. The machinery and structures of the massive foundry are all covered in rust and dust, giving an old, dirty touch to the whole movie. The sets are absolutely amazing in scale and design. Especially the new ones, shown in the Director's Cut edition. Some even getting close to a picturesque feeling, just like in Blade Runner. The movie is masterfully shot (Thanks to Fincher's touch), especially the final corridor-chase sequence.Elliot Goldenthal's score to Alien 3 is undeniably harsh, frightening, and one of the most unique scores ever to be composed. It works great with the overall "rusty" touch in the movie.Was it made just to make some more money out of Alien franchise? No! It still brings a lot of important plots and ideas to the whole Alien world. Also, it beautifully ENDS the Alien story (Alien 4, is a misunderstanding for me).Having seen it quite a few times now, both the first (cut) release and the second (director's cut, almost 40 minutes of never seen before material) I am absolutely convinced, that this is a great Sci-Fi movie. It's a bit different Alien. Different in terms of color, atmosphere and approach the the overall idea of an Alien movie. Still, I strongly believe, it is an important installment into the Alien series. Born in terrible pain, still managed to become an object of cult for Sci-Fi and Alien fans.An important Sci-Fi classic, worth remembering. Also a great debut for Fincher!P.S. If you happen to have access to the Alien Quadrilogy release, check the special features regarding Alien 3! An eye opener for me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not understand people and their movie tastes sometimes. Alien (the original) was; to me, a very good but not perfect movie, but gets in the top 250. Aliens to me; was perfect, gets the top 250 but lower than the original. Alien 3, was almost as good as Aliens, gets a 6.4 (as of 3/3/09). Why? I know: Its because people saw the action-packed Aliens and loved it (I'm guilty of that as well), but then saw the slower-paced, unique, different Alien 3 and hated it (not guilty there). I loved this movie. It was very different but very good. I'll admit it is slow and hard to follow at times but its very very good. Some just need to watch it again, I know I did. I saw it the first time and didn't get it all that well, then I saw it again and liked it a lot more. If I had rated this after one viewing I would have given it a 6 or 7 probably, but after a 2nd viewing I decided a 9 was more appropriate. Everyone was very well cast, especially Charles S. Dutton as the God-fearing, spiritual leader-type Dillon. Every time I saw him on screen it reminded me how good of a movie it is. The story is different but very good still. Fans of the first two who are open minded enough should check this out (Im getting a "Useless Comment" rating for this one). 9/10.P.S. I love my low useful comment rating!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(maybe) not quite as bad as I first though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, let me just start off by saying that, when I first saw Alien 3 on video, I was kind of left thinking "what the **** is this garbage?" and like so many of you viewers out there, i too was gob-smacked at the (rather brazen) decision to do away with the other two main characters from "Aliens" (Newt and Hicks) during the opening. Not only does it make the first two films seem pointless, but it also opens up a potential plot hole (e.g, how an alien egg managed to stow away aboard the Sulaco-even I have trouble swallowing this particular plot device) Even now, I still can't get over that. My initial impression of A3 was that of a cheap rehash of the original 1979 classic by director, Ridley Scott.However, (in my case) time has been a little kinder to this film. Since my first viewing, I have found out a little information about the kind of "look" David Fincher had set out to create for A3, which was a dirty, squalid, low-tech look. Then, there's the well-documented stories of the director being stifled by constant studio interference, which in a way, altered my view of this film.One of the interesting aspects of A3 is, obviously, the production design. A lot of the sets had a rather unusually "step back in time" aura about them. I did notice a few Gothic, Victorian, Edwardian Baroque, Art Nouveau, Art Deco and Streamline Moderne influences here and there-quite a mixed bag of architectural styles, you could say! (Truth be told, the whole "retrogade" look of Alien was originally a major turn-off for me.Petty as it might seem, but one of my pet gripes about Alien 3 were the design inconsistencies between the hyper sleep chambers shown in the opening, and those used in the previous film, "Aliens"Overall, the visual style did remind me a little of some of Terry Gilliam's more outlandish films-only played with a straighter face.Another interesting factor that caught my attention was the way the film plays on the simmering tensions between some of the characters (in particular, the prisoner Morse(played by Harry Webb) and the screw, Aaron, a.k.a "85",so-called because of the character's IQ) Brian Glover puts in an admirably high-handed performance as the prison superintendent, Andrews. Personally, I felt Charles Dance's role was somewhat underused. Charles S. Dutton also has one of the other juicier roles as Dillon, fellow convict-cum-spiritual leader.Another level where Alien 3 doesn't disappoint is the short, sharp shocks of bloody violence and gory death-perhaps, it might be said, the goriest the Alien franchise has seen so far.Last, but not least, what can also be seen here is the blossoming of Fincher's cinematic style-the use of dark, dingy environs and a palate of dull, grubby colours, which goes to prove my point that A3 is not totally without merit.All in all, I feel that Alien 3, though not entirely atrocious, could have been improved considerably. There are plenty of things I would have done differently if I had directed instead of David Fincher. However, as I had previously hinted to before, it would be rather unfair to condemn Fincher for how this turned out. We can thank the studio bosses for a lot of that.I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing the "assembly cut" but hopefully, it will do more to Improve my appraisal of this interesting, if rather flawed entry to the "Alien" series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfortunate victim of bad circumstances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only seen Alien 3 on television being that I was too young at the time it was out at the cinema. What strikes me as this: It's not that bad. Granted, it's not as brilliant as the first two films but you could see where Fincher was going with this. If there was ever a case of the whole not adding up to the sum of its parts this would be it.Alien 3 was the third film in a hugely successful, highly profitable franchise. Fox didn't want to screw it up and were understandably very anxious about the film so they interfered constantly in its production. Ironically this ended up causing all manner of problems for Fincher as his predecessors. Fincher himself was young, it was his debut film and I imagine he was probably overwhelmed with the amount of pressure piled on by the studios and too inexperienced to know how to deal with their constant attempts to intervene.Secondly, at the time Fincher took over, the production was over half way complete with no actual, definite script being followed. Let me repeat that, nobody actually knew what the story was and they had already started filming! No wonder the film became a mess of ideas and has several plot inconsistencies. Again, is this Fincher's fault? No. If he had been more experienced though perhaps he would have had the sense to either have pulled out or started to exert some real control.Alien 3 is the rather depressing story of an overbearing studio, an inexperienced but brilliant director and a film with all the weight of the world on it to succeed both critically and commercially. The result becomes somewhat analogous to the Titanic, it sunk under its own expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully dark movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a tall order after Ridley Scott and Jim Camerons previous masterpieces. This movie was taken in a completely different direction which is why its so good. Director David Fincher did not have the element of surprise as in the first Alien film, we all know what the monster looks like, and no guns and flame throwers like the second Aliens. This film is set in a dark sullen prison setting where you can almost feel the isolation, complimented by the fantastic music from Elliot Goldenthal. Ripley crash lands on Fury 161 and finds out after a series of accidents involving the prisoners that a face hugger has managed to stowaway on her EEV, the monster escapes and plants an embryo in a dog ( an ox in the directors cut) resulting in a hybrid alien. Unfortunately the prison holds no weapons so its down to the prisoners led by Ripley to save themselves.The cast in this film are very strong and are made better by the excellent lighting and camera work. There is an element of CG work with the alien in some scenes but this is minimal and there still have the original Alien models in the film.There is a couple of slight differences in the films depending on whether you watch the directors cut or the original release, i prefer the directors cut but you can choose your own favourite.Well worth a place in your DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The follow up to Aliens few of us wanted to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I absolutely hated it. It totally invalidated the ending of Aliens, I didn't like most of the characters (who were hard to tell apart), and I found it to be a depressing body count movie. My feelings have mellowed a little since, and while I still consider it fairly poor at least it wasn't as bad as Alien:Resurrection.*** Spoilers follow *** I think the first problem most of us had were the deaths of Hicks and Newt. After the ending of Aliens we'd come to love these characters, and to kill them off in such a way was a huge turn off.I soon realised the only character I cared about aside from Ripley was the Doctor (Charles Dance), but he died fairly early and it soon became obvious that Ripley was going to die too (with an Alien inside her).So the bald guys get killed one by one and I couldn't care less.On the plus side some of the visuals were good, and the movie was successful in evoking a dark and depressive tone. But with no emotional involvement or interesting plot, the experience was just flat.After the first two movies in the franchise, this had a lot to live up to, and in that respect, and like so many third installments, it failed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only on Quadrilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See here's the thing. Alien3 went through something of a hatchet job for it's theatrical release and it left the film, frankly, another uninspiring slasher sequel. What did this was the removal of an additional sub-plot involving the character Golic and the capture and release of the Xenomorph.With all evidence of this sub-plot removed a lot went with it. Not only was Golic shifted from an intriguing madman to a 'wtf character' but viewers were left far less acquainted with only survivor Morse. Thankfully the Assembly cut, an additional feature on the Alien Quadrilogy box-set re-instates this massive plot-hole. It also brings more focus to the religious aspects of the picture, adding over 30 minutes of film.Basically the Assembly Cut make Alien3 a worthy sequel to it's predecessors. But if you're going to watch the theatrical version? Well, don't expect it to get anywhere near Aliens of Alien. Really that version's only useful for playing 'spot the cool British actor'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher: "a lot of people hated Alien 3, but no one hated it more than I did."Don't listen to him. I've just finally got around to the 145min special edition of this film, and it's fantastic to see what a misunderstood gem it really is. OK, so it's not a 10/10, but I felt it deserved that for the trashing it gets here otherwise. Still by no means perfect - it essentially follows the same course as the original film - but with the guts put back into the special ed, what you get is a wonderfully twisted attempt to bring the alien series to a close. What's brave, and almost unique for a sequel, is its ceremonious trashing of any continuity fostered in the previous films, and its aversion to any kind of easy, sentimental notion of hope or optimism (no, she's not going to have children. Or get married...) With the alien itself desperate to protect its own survival, the story hones in on the irrational, pessimistic body horror at the centre of the series, and, well... doesn't wimp out. The original theatrical version was fatally cut to pieces by executives, but frankly I'm amazed this got filmed in the first place. It's fantastic that this exists as even a work-in-progress - after the action-fest of Aliens it seems like blatant commercial suicide. So anyhow, all this guff aside, seek out the special ed of this film and take a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>She's back, and this time it's not so great.Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash lands on a planet inhabited by convicted felons with only y-chromosomes. Everyone else is dead, and she's the lone survivor...but she soon realizes she didn't come alone. An alien attached itself to the ship, and is now running free and killing the inmates and guards.With no firepower, little help, and an alien bun in the oven, Ripley once again has to battle for survival...but this time she learns the only way to really survive is to kill the queen alien inside her.One of the worst "Alien" movies out there (better than "Resurrection" and the "AvP" series), there isn't much to this film like there was in the first two. It wasn't AS bad as how others make it out to be, but it's nowhere near the perfection of "Alien" and "Aliens."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear God, I recently re-saw Alien 3, but the movie I got was not the one I wanted. apparently, the version I had been used to was the THEATRICAL version, the one with the dog. the one I saw just now, was the one with the ox, which they said was re-mastered. i must say, although it was longer and somehow more explaining, I was disappointed, and I have to say: Stop re-releasing these movies, and just stick to the original version. David Fincher is one of my favorite directors of all time. he gave us SEVEN, THE GAME, FIGHT CLUB, PANIC ROOM, ZODIAC which are all very good movies, and Alien 3 is among them, with no exception. The reason people despise this movie is because they have all seen the other version, the one with the ox, which is a totally different movie. it's longer, more boring, and the entire idea gets lost along the way, diffused in the mumbo-jumbo of what they thought might be a good idea. Sigourney Weaver is great, as usual in this role, also great performances by some British actors such as Charles Dance and Danny Webb. great movie. the series goes on (at least until Resurrection, because AVP sucked big time).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, the theatrical version was not the version Fincher intended to make in the first place. The studio basically kicked him in the head and told him he had A: killed off the strong characters the story needed and B: Didn't do what they told him to do. In my opinion this is the best film in the "Alien" franchise. Imagine for a second the balls it took to look at the success of "Aliens" and say, "Ok.. in the first 5 minutes we're going to kill everything the audience was expecting to see the next couple hours." Every thing in this film- from the script, the dark style, the prolonged losing battle, and the direction was FAR ahead of it's time. If the studio hadn't raped this film and violated Fincher as badly as it did, he would be a god-send to bring this franchise back to respectability. Take a look at what he's done... "Seven", "Fight Club", "The Game", "Panic Room" (another underrated film), "Benjamin Button"... He's golden. The studio tried to ruin "Alien 3" and despite their best efforts- I still loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah I know it's starting to become as clich to defend this movie as it is to trash it, but for what it's worth I do enjoy watching this film from time to time and it always offers something new.Mainly the nice thing here is the atmosphere - nothing like a dark and miserable labyrinth of abandoned tunnels, foundries, and prison cells alone on a miserable inhospitable planet to really set the stage for a dystopian slaughterfest, is there? Add to that an impressive cast of unsung British character actors such as Charles Dance (GOOD MORNING BABYLON), the unspellable Pete Postlethwaite, Paul McGann, and Philip Davis (THE BOUNTY)... with the added bonus that they're all bald and dirty prisoners on a bleak prison planet. Throw in an alien to kill them all and what's not to love? Directorially, Fincher threw in a lot of good surprises along the way with lots of surprisingly well-handled action sequences with an appropriate mixture of suspense and gore. I particularly enjoyed seeing a few "squished frame" shots and some strange staging where you don't quite know what to make of what you're looking at. There's some nice ambiguity thrown into many scenes, but never to the point where things get confusing.However, this film makes a lot of messy turns in its narrative. First off, there are just too many red herring scenes such as Newt's dissection and the bit with Ripley scouting around in the basement. They seem only to exist to pad out the running time. Secondly, it fails to really distinguish the prisoners or even solidly identify the fates of any of them during the chaotic action scenes. For instance, does anyone know what actually happens to the big guy with the meat cleaver? I've seen both versions and unfortunately they both suffer from a lot of the same problems. Overall I like the extended version as it provides a lot more insight into the life and society of the convicts, but then again the Oxen subplot is absolutely pointless.That "pointless" word could actually apply to the movie itself, but taken for what it is and just enjoyed for a bleak outer space horror film, ALIEN 3 actually *can* be quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien 3 gets put down a lot of the fans of the Alien series. I think this is mainly due to the depressing opening and sad ending. I myself love Alien 3 for that reason.To simply put: beggars can't be choosers. Whenever I watch a movie, I watch it with an open mind as to what the atmosphere will resemble and how the movie will play out. I don't go in expecting a movie to be one particular way, which may be why I like so many movies.Alien 3 takes place after Aliens left off. The surviving members of the squad in the previous film (while asleep) crash into a distant planet. No one survives except for Riply. The planet turns out to be one big prison for serial murderers and rapist, which may be another reason why the film is so reviled. You can count the number of likable characters on one hand.Sigourny Weaver (who helped quite a bit in the production of the film) plays Riply better than any other film in the entire series. She is developed as a strong character surrounded by men who would like to do nothing but rape and kill her... that is until she earns their respect.Of course, an Alien was what caused the ships crash landing. Therefore, an Alien is loose on the prison planet. The Alien in Alien 3 looks absolutely terrible. While some of it is done with excellent puppet work, there are multiple shots of the Alien done with some poorly done CGI. This not only took me out of the movie; It was downright distracting. It was obvious they were aware of this behind the scenes, as the movie is filled with more alien POV shots than you can shake a stick at. The action scenes themselves aren't that spectacular either, although there are still quite a few suspenseful scenes.The movie also relies heavily on the gross-out factor. This is a good thing and a bad thing. I know that the movie wouldn't be as enjoyable if it had less gore than what it had, but just the fact that it needed it wasn't a good thing either.To simply put: I can understand the hatred that revolves around this movie, but it's still not the worst in the series. The movie is also very good as a stand alone movie. Great performances all around.The movie falls flat when it comes to being uplifting and creating likable characters, but it still gets a recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not Aliens but it is still good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as Aliens was very different from Alien, Alien? is very different from Aliens so if you go in to this film expecting hoards of aliens battling elite space marines you'll be disappointed, however if you crave tension rather than all out excitement this is the film for you.The film starts with Ripley the sole survivor once more when the Sulaco's escape pod is jettisoned after a fire. She finds herself on Fiorina 161, AKA Fury, a prison facility housing violent offenders who have found religion. Unfortunately for her they had also brought an unwanted passenger along in the form of an alien face hugger which attacks a dog in the theatrical release and an Ox in the Special edition of the film. As the alien has grown inside a quadruped it turns out to be quite different from the ones seen in the previous two films.Initially Ripley isn't believed when she tells the prison governor (Brian Glover) that there is an alien there even after three suspicious deaths, which are regarded as either accidents or murder. However when the alien strikes in public they realise that they have a serious problem and turn to Ripley for advice. The rest of the film follows their attempts to kill the alien before The Company arrives, I won't say more as I don't wish to spoil it.This film has a much darker tone than the previous outings, where Aliens ends with hope for the future, this starts by dashing that hope and doesn't get any more cheerful as it progresses. The acting is solid, provided mostly by actors who will be familiar with British viewers, it was just a pity Charles Dance and Brian Glover's characters didn't survive a bit longer.This review is based on the Special Edition (Assembly Cut) in the Alien Quadrilogy DVD set. Having seen both versions now I'd recommend watching this version if you have the choice as it is superior to the original theatrical release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien 3 misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 lacks the overall appeal of Aliens, but that doesn't mean that it's a poor movie. Alien 3 is a drama - not an action movie, not a horror movie - it's about Ripley and what dealing with the alien has done to her...it has some of the best dramatic lines of the series, and sets up the only redeeming aspect of Alien Resurrection - namely, the continuing progression of Ripley's descent into inhumanity...watch the movie, enjoy it for what it is, and don't expect another Aliens, and you'll be much happier - as for the elimination of leftovers from Aliens...get over it...it's an ugly universe, and people die for no good reason the cast is excellent, the story and pacing are still better than most modern movies, and it's still better than Alien Resurrection...or any of the AVP movies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why people thinks it is so baaaaad....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..because Fincher had balls to change whole idea of Alien Trilogy. Cameron made pure action alien movie (and it was absolutely fantastic). Fincher did not want this copy Cameron's idea and he's back to beginning. Atmosphere of the prison is serious and story isn't packed only with action and gun shooting. Please take a look on details, like scene where we see a born of alien. It's amazing how director combined the issue of birth and Dillon's speech. Great thrill...Alien 3 has great ending, without patterns seen in the other s-f movies. So, I give 9/10, because Special edition is better, but standard version is still great, great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very under-rated movie (plot details mentioned)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to a fire on board the Sulacco returning home after the events in Aliens, an escape pod is released containing the survivors. The crash landing on Fury 161, a former penal planet for dangerous criminals who have now found religion, leaves Ripley the only survivor. But something else came with her, and the horror is about to continue....Alien 3 was directed by David Fincher, who went on to make Seven, Fight Club and Zodiac. This was his first movie, and you can see the beginning of his style here. The movie is bleak, atmospheric and like most other Fincher movies, gloomy and at times very dark.The script for the movie was written by Walter Hill, David Giller &amp; Larry Fergusson. The story itself is credited to Vincent Ward. His version involved a wooden planet and monks, instead or prisoners. There are also various scripts and stories written by such people as David Twohy (who wrote Pitch Black), Eric Red (The Hitcher) and others. I don't know how much of their ideas were actually used, apart from Ward's story idea, but I think the writers do a good job.In Alien, Ripley was simply the only one to survive, in Aliens she becomes almost like a surrogate mother to Newt's character. Here, after surviving everything that's happened to her in the first two movies, she's left crushed and devastated by losing everything she fought for in Aliens, It's a brave move to take the character and make her want to die, after everything she's been through, but it is understandable, and I think it does work.Of course it does help that Sigourney Weaver gives another compelling performance as Ripley. It is notable how in all of the Alien movies, the character shows different sides to her, yet is always believable.As for the supporting cast, there is good support from Charles S. Dutton, Brian Glover, Charles Dance, Lance Henriksen, Ralph Brown, and in the special edition cut by Paul McGann. His character's role was cut out of the theatrical version, but in the special edition, with the restored footage, his character makes sense.There are faults with the movie, and most of those are to do with the Alien creature. NOT the actual design of the creature, which as has been pointed out does not come from a human host, as in Alien/Aliens, but from a different creature (dog in theatrical creature, cattle of some kind from the special edition). But I do think some of the special visual effects of the creature chasing after the prisoners are a bit weak.The ending too does come in from a bit of criticism. As has been noted it does have a similar ending to Terminator 2, but I like the ending. Ripley sacrificing her own life to kill the Alien queen growing inside her is a brave decision to make for the film-makers, and I think it works well. The idea of using prisoners is an interesting choice within the movie. These men are presented as dangerous murderers, rapist, the worst kind of prisoners forced to face something that is more dangerous and scarier than themselves. While it is difficult to make the prisoners sympathetic or likable, thanks to some good performances, you do find yourself hoping some will survive. Having said that however, the decision to have them all bald (due to a problem with lice on the planet), does sometimes make it hard to work out which characters are still alive or dead at times.Whilst the theatrical version was okay by itself, the movie is far better in the special edition. Restoring the sub-plot of Golic's (McGann) almost worshiping of the creature gives added depth to the story. I will say however, the theatrical ending, with Ripley holding onto the Alien queen as it bursts out of her chest as she falls into the incinerator is better than the special edition one.I think Alien 3 is under-rated in the series. While I still think Alien is the best one, I actually prefer this one over Aliens. Whilst Aliens may be more exciting and action-orientated, the atmosphere and bleakness of Alien 3 make it a braver movie and a much more interesting one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated and misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked through 12 pages of reviews on IMDb for this film &amp; they were all negative. Well I'm gonna stick up for this film. I love it! Everyone seems to moan about how it messes up everything Alien &amp; Aliens set up. I say great, life doesn't work out how you want it. You don't always get the girl &amp; live happily ever after. The whole point of killing off Hicks &amp; Newt at the beginning was to set up that feeling of 'oh crap, we're in a world of sh1t &amp; all bets are off'This film is dark &amp; gloomy &amp; is all about redemption, looking back on the path you've taken &amp; how it's affected your life &amp; everyone around you &amp; the sacrifice you make for the greater good. David Fincher did a great job directing considering he never had a full script to work off &amp; Fox screwing him over at every turn (especially in editing).The set design, music score &amp; lighting are all top notch.. Although to really appreciate this film you should watch both the Theatrical release &amp; the assembly cut of the film. Don't listen to all those negative reviews and give this film a chance..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Aliens 3 a day after watching Aliens and a truly awful "original Sci Fi Channel" production. Aliens 3 is not a great movie but it's not an abomination, a bomb, or any other word one could use to describe a one-star movie.The plotting was trite and the script unremarkable, but I've seen much worse. You can tell the effects are not as well-done as the previous installment. Sequels are generally not as good as the original so why expect much? Approach it as a medium-budget, dry sci-fi/bloody horror flick without a whole lot of soul.At least the cast has a number of actors one often sees on Masterpiece Theater. Try browsing IMDb while you watch this one and amuse yourself with the "where have I seen that guy before" game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all,I agree on all who blames the theatrical version - it deserves all the blame - a movie should never be mutilated the way it was. So my comment is about the Director's Cut.I think that this movie is more about the notion of 'purpose' than about the alien. The convicts are possible on the lowest level a human can be: day-to-day living, no challenge, decaying environment (both physically and intellectually), absolutely no further purpose one can work towards. They are constantly waiting - for God to raise his servants? Or for the end of their respective sentences? Both are something vague and no one really believes it to be possible. Ripley and the alien intrude into their stable world: Ripley represents the temptation against which the convicts have to struggle inside themselves, the alien represents the external threat - something which they haven't had to encounter on Fiorina. The woman threatens their soul, the alien threatens their body. Andrew aims to preserve the stability - his purpose may be said to be the restoral of the purposelessness, but one cannot prevent changes from happening once they are imminent. The movie goes deep and explores this aspect of life and ultimately conveys the message: this place is as good to rise to heaven from as anything else. The alien is just a means of illustrating the utter inevitability of the change: there is no way to ignore it. You may trap it - but from that on you have to be on alert. Or you may kill it - this requires cooperation and that you put personal differences aside as the common aim is the one that counts. After that (let's assume that many other convicts survive, just for the sake of interest) the entire community would be different, they would have changed to a real community, united on a higher level. This is also a change what would be inevitable, no matter that the alien would have been killed.So I think this to be the ultimate message of the movie: there is no bottom point you can't get out of. No matter how deep the pit is, there is always a way out - sometimes a path too weird, frightening, difficult to take, sometimes even to think about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you don't like noir films, don't see This movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't like filth, don't watch this movie. If you are emotionally attached to the characters from previous two movies, don't watch this movie. If you appreciate dark lighting, desperation, and the strategic use of English people, definitely see Alien?.In this sequel, where heroes die, bad things happen, and characters are for the most part unlikeable, we see a complete 180 degree turn from the blockbuster style of Aliens. You'll either love it or hate it, but you'll acknowledge it either way.I never liked a happy ending, so I give this film an eight despite the critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A breath of fresh air</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After James Cameron's overblown, overlong, Aliens, complete with incompetent marines, cutesy kid and dreadful dialogue, Alien3 is like a breath of fresh air.Despite Fox's butchering of Fincher's original vision, the assembly cut, although not perfect, repairs the damage done by the theatrical release and a lot more besides.The Golic sub plot has been replaced and there many extended scenes, many of which are a vast improvement on their shortened versions and in a film from the Alien series there are unexpected tender moments highlighted by Goldenthal's magical score.Highly recommended.</fullReview>
