		<shortDescription>Let it Stand Alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I was enthralled with this Western from the start and stayed that way. It delivers twists and turns that keep you planted to your chair, and after reading some of the reviews of others, I was surprised at the 'nic picking' that went on while comparing it with the 'Hateful Eight". This movie stands on its own, and if H8 hadn't of been out, then I feel the reviews would have been more favourable. I thought it was great...it certainly turned corners and ventured into areas that would/or may offend others, yet being a lover of good movies, this 'epic' kept me glued to the screen. It is certainly well worth the watch, so you can determine for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent low budget western, shot in the style of your favourite 70's westerns. I can't believe some of the negative reviews. It is well acted, well shot with some great thoughtful moments and has a nice flowing style with a few twists and turns. I really enjoyed this film leading up to a great last half hour.It helps being a huge fan of westerns but I think some reviewers think the western starts and finishes with the Hateful Eight.This film deserves more than 5.4. If you are a fan of westerns check it out. If you are 16 years of age move on,, Can't wait to see more from this writer director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ultra violent, psycho-sexual art house flick. Totally unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the main problem when it comes to the bad reviews here is that many folks watched this expecting a western and it's only a western because of the time period. The story isn't for fans of westerns, clearly, and people expecting the same old satisfying formula plot points in a normal western are going to be sorely disappointed. This is a wild ride. Fans of Bad Lands, Killer Joe, Natural Born Killers and Goodfellas will have more in common with this than anyone else. Acting is incredible. Story is totally surprising and unique. And that gorgeous and grainy 35mm film is absolutely stunning. Not for the faint of heart, but a damn good ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the negative reviews here I nearly didn't watch this epic film. I am very pleased I did as I liked everything about this classic. Cinematography was beautiful, stylistic and creative. Dialogue was like a western homage but subtle. Sets and costume flawless. Lighting was a standout. Loved the evening scene with the chooks. The script has humour, romance, suspense, characters with depth and the themes and subtext work all the way to the end on many levels. Some of the scenes are confronting and there is gore. If you like Tarantino then this is sure to please. However I don't think comparisons are fair as this gem stands on it's own and works in more subtle and richer ways. A rewarding watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic homage to classic westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. Initially I wasn't so sure about it because the way it's filmed at first glance makes it look low budget but as it progresses it's apparent that they were attempting to make it look older like a classic western. The movie is funny, thrilling, shocking, gritty, and gory, all things I love. The script and acting were brilliant. I loved most all of the characters even the ones you are supposed to hate just because they were so well portrayed. The scenery is really beautiful as well. This movie reminds me of the old westerns I used to watch with my dad but at the same time feels up to date with the advances in acting, plot, and originality.I saw someone else comparing this to The Hateful Eight. I have to completely disagree with them. This is so much better than that movie. The Hateful Eight was highly disappointing: too long and drawn out, mostly boring, and not really funny. This movie is not in any way boring, it is clever, funny, and entertainingly shocking.The two issues I did have with this movie are:1. Luke Wilson--he sucks as an actor and I was annoyed when they switched to the scenes with him. Luckily he isn't a major player in the picture. 2. While the turn of events at the end did have some entertainment value, part of me feels it would have better had they ended it just before the last bit. It just seemed like maybe they were trying a bit too hard. Plus taking that part out seems to fit more with the traditional ending to a western. But still it's good as is. 8 out of 10. Would have easily given it a 9 without Luke Wilson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Movie-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a solid piece of movie making. The underlying writing is very good and the acting is excellent throughout--no jarring performances, nothing to take you out of the story. It kept my attention to the end, despite not getting a lot of sleep the previous night. I fall asleep during a lot of movies.SPOILER: I think the unconventional story line is why so many people reviewed this with such low ratings, and obviously, not a lot of flash and dash. Perhaps it's too slow for people, but I thought the pacing spot on. I disliked intensely all four members of the hostage family, and found my sympathies veering toward the outlaws. The twists and turns kept my interest throughout, although in all honesty I wasn't particularly happy with the ending. A dose of reality, perhaps, where I'm more a happily-ever-after kind of person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty, realistic, totally unpredictable. Like nothing else out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may think it's like Hateful 8 because of the confined atmosphere, the violence, and the western genre - but that's really all they have in common. The film is shot in a much different way and has an entirely different approach than 8. It also touches on taboos that I've never seen in any western. This movie doesn't just push the envelope, it busts it wide open. Much more in common with Killer Joe than anything else. Although I thought the 35mm cinematography really set this film apart. Usually when a film has a low critical tomato rating I don't like it. But for the life of me I can't figure out why so maybe critics are so upset about this movie. It's damn realistic, super dirty, artfully shot and choreographed (there is one single shot that must be 20 minutes long!!), and just totally unique. Refreshing with so many cookie cutter movies out there now. Sure it's not perfect, there are a few things I wish were done differently, but it's one of the best films I've seen this year and certainly the most interesting. All I can figure is that the subject matter is genuinely too much for some people and they just can't get past it. It's pretty twisted, no doubt. But it's also beautiful. All the lead actors are shockingly good. Was blown away by Chad Michael Murray. Eastwood carries the torch well. And Terry polo is absolutely incredible - like way out there. Wait till you see the "screaming church scene". WOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique, well acted, make your own mind up because its worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first review because I damn near skipped it because of the reviews here which are senseless. No its not an epic... whole thing could be staged in a theater. And with not a lot of scenes at that. But the characters are strong, acting outstanding (only one passenger), set, location, costumes, context really well done. Plot was a bit of a departure... bit up and down but pushing the boat out and maybe that's what made it memorable. To compare it to Hateful8 is illiterate, think killer Joe meets the salvation, meets GoT...its really its own thing. Really liked this film. I think it could be a stayer and get a cult following in time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a bounty on their heads, outlaws take refuge in a pastors family home for the night. The pastors wife is a god fearing lady with one lovely daughter and another not so lovely daughter. The youngest daughter fancies the gang leader as expected and decides to follow her heart than stay with her family. The film is edgy and quite entertaining (I felt) but bit rough around the edges. It reminded me of Quentin Tarantino flick. Loved the performances from all characters. Its funny at times and with good supporting cast. Only downside would be the bounty hunters who just don't have a meaningful role, and a passable performance from Luke Wilson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute must see!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an absolute must see for anyone who is a fan of the late 60's early 70's nihilistic gritty style of film making, westerns in particular. This film could have easily been released in 1973.As much as I liked Hateful Eight, I believe Mollner far better captures the B-movie "grindhouse" quality that Tarantino likes to strive for. Everything from the Kodak film stock, to the Panavision cameras, to the sound track is just absolutely authentic. Even the script is more authentic, and in my opinion superior.The whole cast is amazing. Every single part down to the smallest was played to perfection. The standouts by far being Francesca Eastwood, Teri Polo, and Chad Michael Murray. Murray captures the brutal anti-hero of few words excellently. Eastwood is amazing as the tortured youngest daughter. Polo gives a jaw dropping performance as the bible thumping lunatic mother.I honestly didn't even recognize her.If I had to pick one flaw in the film it would be the sporadic voice over done by Wilsons character. It just felt out of place and pointless. It happens very little though so it is a very minor flaw.The film is a masterpiece that is a true representation of a time when film making was an art form. I look forward tho seeing more of what Mollner can create.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You just wish that six shooter was aimed at you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine Wood Allen Jr, dreaming about growing up to be Tarantino. As a viewer, It is a shame that you have to suffer a worse faith then 90% of the cast.You spend most of your time with this movie just by trying to endure the dreadful first one and a half hours. By the end you realise that there are some small reflections of a story and the fact that Francesca Eastwood looks good wearing riding pants, while the star of the movie is actually a fly resting on Teri Polo's leg (seen at 1:34:22).When you just cant bare to stand it anymore, you cant avoid the feeling of cringe when you come to the conclusion that the whole plot revolves around setting up for a sequel. My only tought after watching this movie is, what sane person would ever take on the task and humiliation by producing the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible script - wanna be Tarantino with no grit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is slow and dull until finally the 3rd act it becomes a wanna be Tarantino twist similar to Hateful Eight. Rather pathetic since the DP did a wonderful job and the acting was quite decent but in the end you feel like it was too rushed and unbelievable, almost pointless.Hard to imagine this film was even made based on the script. A sad commentary on American film makers once again trying to create bad ass blood thirsty violent Female lead characters.... truly pathetic. what is wrong with American film makers these days. And why did Luke Wilson get involved with probably the worst useless character in the entire film. I give it a 4 mostly to the Crew and Cast esp DP. Otherwise it would be a quick B rated 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie seemed to try way to hard to be like a toned down Hateful Eight but came off as more of a soap opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Where does it all begin. Violence, the gun, the knife, the axe. How's it born, how's it start?" Henry (Murray) and his gang of outlaws are on the run when the find a frontier house. They decide to hide out in there against the wishes of the family that lives in it. What starts off as a simple idea to hide soon expands into a dynamic that no one involved can explain or expect. There have been many many westerns that have come out in the last few years. Most of them awful, a few decent ones and then ones like this. One that isn't terrible and one that is worth seeing, but at the same time one that isn't all that memorable but it is watchable. The movie seemed to try way to hard to be like a toned down Hateful Eight but came off as more of a soap opera. There are some really good things in this and the twists are interesting and I do think it's worth seeing, but really only once. Overall, a movie that is entertaining as you watch it but a day or two after you won't remember half of it. I give this a C.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LJ's QR: Enjoyable Gritty Western with Intriguing Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LJ'S QUICK MOVIE REVIEW:"Outlaws and Angels", directed by JT Mollner, is a Western that takes place in the unforgiving American frontier. It follows the story of three wanted bank robbers that take refuge in a troubled family's home. The movie's script features violence, crime, love, and revenge. As the movie progresses, the seemingly ordinary characters reveal darker and freakish sides to their lives. Emphasis is put on cynicism, human fears, and role of women in Western society. However, several characters never get the screen time they deserve. Their transformations often feel rushed and awkward.Visually, the movie captures the essence of a Western. The colors and tone used in the film make for a very immersive experience. The movie is also shot using 35mm film, which adds to the gritty and grainy feel. Clearly, a great deal of effort was put into the detailed set-pieces, costumes, and makeup.Overall, "Outlaws and Angels" is a movie with intriguing characters and high-quality visuals, but the flaws in its script and editing slightly compromise the experience.LJ's Grade: B- , 6.4/10To be honest, Django Unchained and the Hateful Eight are better Westerns and were both released recently.For more quick reviews, please visit LJ's Movie Facts on Facebook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really people, would anyone with even half a brain rate this garbage better than a 2? I can't believe some of the reviews I've read on this site that actually can find even one redeeming quality with this crappy movie.The writing is terrible, the acting is awful, the story line is juvenile, and the movie besides being complete and total rubbish, is so boring that even fast forwarding it won't get you to the bitter end fast enough.When IMDb give this trite a 5+ rating we know all is wrong in the world. Those brain dead reviewers who pushed the rating for this crap should be banned for life from ever sharing an opinion ever again. Take it from me, this movie is so bad you'll be dumber just for even considering it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for low budget movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a OK movie, nothing great, but I think it had a small budget. I don't have any info on the budget,so if it is a low budget then that makes it hard to make a really good movie.It was written and directed by the same guy mollner, and usually movies made like this with same guy writing and directing are really bad.This one is bad in some ways, but some of it was good too. My advice to mollner, is stick to one or the other, but your not good enough to do both.I thought the guy playing the sheriff was miscast, and did a poor job, and was also written poorly. His character, and the "posse" were really unnecessary.The scenes at the beginning were poorly done, and amateurish. But after they get to the house, the movie was much better. That was the best part of the movie.There is one scene that was again unnecessary and kinda gross, you will know when you see it.The ending is a surprise, with a twist to be cool I guess, but it sort of made sense after thinking about it.I can say it is worth seeing once, it is comparable to Bone Tomahawk movie with Kurt Russell.The girl playing flora, is Clint Eastwood's daughter by Frances Fisher, and Frances was in the movie too, as old woman who gets slapped. Francesca did a good job as flora.For a low budget movie, it was interesting, and watchable, which is more than I can say about other low budget movies, but mollner has a lot to learn to be a good movie maker.I gave it a 7, and would have given more, but the sheriff, and the gross scene cost it 3 points. I have to wonder why mollner would want to include the gross scene ?? (has to do with one guy on another guy)Chad did a good job as the boss outlaw, and the last 2 with him at the house also did a good job. Terri Polo as the mom was weird, I remember when she was a young looker !I imagine many might give up on this before they ever get to the house, but try to hang in there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly acted "Dirty" western wanna-be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting was bad The storyline was bad The subplots were bad The setting was the only thing even close to being western-esque Has to be the last time I let the name Eastwood, not relating to Clint, influence me to see a movie. Scott Eastwood seems to have SOME skill, albeit mediocre initially, but you can see the spark. HOWEVER after seeing Francesca Eastwood's acting in Heroes reborn, I blamed it on the script and directing....until I saw this horrid tripe. No, she is not in even her brother's range of skill. The only thing she has down is that "Deer in the headlights" look...and nothing else. I foresee a LOT of bad horror/Sci-fi in her future.The BIGGEST disappointment in this flick was Ben Browder. I mean he is one of those guys that has that specific way of talking, looking and reacting that can carry a bad scene up a level or 3...not this time. I am unsure if he is just tired of acting, disliked the director or was drunk the entire time, but he actually drug the movie downWilson!!!!!!!!! Yah, his bit parts were done as badly as can be. The catchy phrases they had him toss out MAY have resembled period specific jargon, but they were idiotic in delivery. I mean, Wilson makes me laugh. That snort snicker of his, sideways smile with the curled lip, THAT is his segue into a scene. In this flick he was just a monotoned, quip quoting character who's skill, it appears, was to carry every scene with no emotion of feelingif I have not made it clear enough, I EXPECTED A LOT better from this movie and barring some bad writing, expected at least 1 or 2 actors to carry a bad script into the realm of bearable I was sorely mistaken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see a lot of movies, but not a lot that were made for under a million dollars like this one. I am a huge fan of Outlaws and Angels. While on the surface, it could seem like someone doing a Tarantino (who is one of my all time favorite directors,) nothing could be further. The movie was written long before Quentin hatched Hateful 8 and the movie certainly had nothing to do with Django. JT Mollner took his notes from Polanski and Peckinpah. There is tons of violence in the movie, but there is not tons of gratuitous violence. It was done in a brutal and unfamiliar way, but that is because that is the way it happened on the frontier when it was the wild west. While we don't say "Curly Wolf," "Bag of nails," or "Lick finger" now....they did back then and that is why the dialogue was so foreign to some. The subject matters while challenging were lifted from actuality as opposed to trying to play to a viewer or a reviewer. I say the movie is a masterpiece and as time goes by it will be a standard that is referred back to time and time again. In my mind it is a must see. The cast is simply off the charts. Francesca Eastwood gave an Oscar worthy performance in her first major role and Chad Michael Murray playing so off type was nothing short of spectacular. The attention to detail, the lens packages, shooting on 2-perf....everything about this movie was master craftsmanship.</fullReview>
