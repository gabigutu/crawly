		<shortDescription>One of the best animated features not to have the Disney name on it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking for a movie with cutesy talking horses that the kiddies will love? Then Spirit is probably not the movie for you, it is instead one of the nicest animated features to come along in a long time to not have Disney written all over it. No, the horses do not talk and they shouldn't as the whole story is told from a horse's point of voice in a wonderful narrative. In fact there's not a lot of pointless dialog to weigh down the movie at all.Instead it's filled by a wonderful score by Hans Zimmer and songs by Bryan Adams who admittedly I wasn't a big fan off except for (Everything I Do (I Do It For You) and Star) but the songs he did for this movie especially Here I Am, Get Off Of My Back, Can't Take Me, Brothers Under The Sun and Sound The Bugle made me download the soundtrack from Walmart.com the next day.The main reasons I liked this move would have to be the beautiful drawn animation, mixed with an endearing story with some comedy elements and a wonderful soundtrack. Spirit is simply fun and enjoyable for the whole family no matter what their age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We need more films like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time when Hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs, and war, along comes this film which reminds us the concept of the "Indomitable Spirit". If you are feeling beaten down, this movie will free your mind and set you soaring. We all know how tough life can be, sometime we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through. That's what this film did for me and I hope it will for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An animated movie that is to be commended. One that is up there with the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spirit is a unique and original look at western life from the point of view of a wild horse, and native Americans. The film focuses on the friendships and perils that a wild horse, Spirit, encounters during his life.Very well done in the presentation, using the technology available today to deliver stunning visuals that are breathtaking in their depth and realism.The music is fantastic, with songs by Bryan Adams, and music by Hans Zimmer, who also was responsible for the extremely popular music from the 1994 Disney hit, The Lion King.The story is not very deep but the fact that it isn't quite as in-depth as some movies doesn't in my opinion detract from the film as a whole.An excellent film which I enjoyed immensely, and that is suitable for all the family. Not one to be missed. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first great western of the 21st century!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON, the new animated feature from Dreamworks, is an honest-to-God western. Some of you may be forgiven for thinking it was just a horse movie, a distinct and definable genre in its own right (e.g. MY FRIEND FLICKA), but I assure you this is a real, bonafide western, complete with cavalry, Indians, Monument Valley and the building of the transcontinental railroad. It's a familiar saga (to western fans) but told here from the point-of-view of a wild horse. It just may be the only western that children in today's audience will get to see on the big screen. (And it's perfectly suitable for even the smallest children.)The movie has three selling points for people who are appalled at how childish and inane animated features in the U.S. have been over the last decade or so:1) It's got a serious story. 2) The horses don't talk. 3) The horses don't sing.The latter two functions are served by Spirit's first-person narration, voiced by Matt Damon and told in the past tense as a reminiscence, and several songs on the soundtrack written and performed by Bryan Adams. Neither of these elements were particularly necessary and the movie would have been better without them, although they aren't fatal. Hans Zimmer's excellent music score does a far more effective job in conveying, in dramatic and emotional terms, what the songs belabor. But, thankfully, aside from Damon, there are no other celebrity voices.The other big selling point is the artwork. The background art and western landscapes are stunning and offer a mix of painted scenes and computer-created scenery, although everything seems computer enhanced in one way or another. Most importantly, the film gives us a chance to savor the backgrounds. The characters don't zip around in constant frenetic motion the way they do in Disney movies. Although there are several chase scenes, the characters are just as likely to pause and connect with each other in movements reflecting naturalistic behavior. There are moments of gentleness, tenderness, curiosity, and discovery, so we get to see the space the characters are in and get to connect with it ourselves. There's a real palpable sense of environment and geography, of time and place, something rarely found in American animated features.The character design is also well-done. The human characters all have solid, expressive, recognizable faces, strongly differentiated from each other. The horses are well designed also, looking like horses, but anthropomorphised enough to give them recognizable emotional responses. No character, human or animal, is exaggerated for cartoon effect.I normally have problems with digital animation and computer created imagery and SPIRIT is, for the most part, computer created, although it replicates the look of traditional 2-D animation. Still, if this is the wave of the future, then SPIRIT shows us how it should be done. This is digital animation at the best I've ever seen it (including the Japanese anime features I've seen in the last few years). And combined with a good story and clean concept that doesn't patronize its audience, it's created what I think is the finest American animated feature since BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (1991). If there is any significant flaw in SPIRIT, aside from the songs, it's that the story falls short of greatness, undercut by the lack of a sufficiently emotional payoff. Still, it's a better story than any I've seen in an American animated production since at least THE LION KING. Some viewers may quibble about the politically correct aspects of the story (cavalry=bad, Indians=good), but there is a moment near the end that balances things out in an intelligent, dramatic way.SPIRIT may suffer at the boxoffice because it doesn't have the all-important lowest-common-denominator touches that have so cheapened the animated genre but attracted audiences looking for easy laughs (e.g. celebrity voices doing hyperactive genies, show-tune-singing meerkats and jive-talking jackasses). But it should give a measure of hope to that small, passionate segment of the audience that cares about animation as a medium capable in its own right of great storytelling and cinematic artistry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie a lot. The animation was well done and the romance was cute. I liked most of Bryan Adams' songs and the Hans Zimmer score was excellent. What a lot of people don't realize is how well it relates to the Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now themes (what happens when so-called "civilization" invades someone elses home, what does it mean to be "civilized" etc.). The opening scenery and music were very stirring. The film is a lament to an America that was once beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, not bad at all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, what can I say, this movie really got to me, it's not so bad, as many say, I really loved it, although the idea seems so simple, and rather boring, it isn't. First of all I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really goes with the movie. Second the simple story, and the drama of Spirit gets your attention. One thing I like the most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now do they ?, but... I don't know, making animals talk is just so... lame.One of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion, I recommend it to everyone, not just the kids :), because it is very relaxing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The horse is indeed a fine animal. Picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animation flick.The animation is simply stupendous. The fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that the horses embolden across the flick. More so when the stallion traverses diverse terrain, jumps across cliffs and braves waters. Soundtrack too is very impressive. The wonderful instrumental music lures you to appreciate the movie. "They say the story of the west was written from the saddle of a horse . " huh? Well ,The story of a fine horse sure was written from the saddle of the west .All in all, this movie is clearly up there with the best .It is one of the best animation flicks i have watched. Would be a very fine choice on a lonely night. An easy 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent fare for younger viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's said that when Disney first contemplated Dinosaur (2000), the idea was to have the giant lizards play out non-speaking roles and that this was eventually abandoned, principally through a fear of alienating a junior audience. Asbury and Cook's Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron reverses that decision, takes the braver choice and leaves the equine main characters mute - though still subject to some restrained first person narration by Matt Damon. `They say that the history of the west was written from the saddle of a horse - but it's never been told from the heart of one' he says and, right from the start, it is clear that this will be a Western with a different perspective. Animated Westerns are rare enough (the last one I can easily recall is Fievel Goes West (1991)) and those told from an animal's viewpoint even scarcer. Spirit is refreshing in that it carries off a combination of these two challenges effectively, if inevitably somewhat simplistically.The stallion Spirit's indomitable nature is what shapes the narrative, and is his most defining characteristic. His craving for freedom and independence remain uppermost, even when eventually tempered by the relationships eventually established with the mare Rain and the Indian Little Creek. Strictly speaking, one might argue that Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is less of a Western than a nature film, in which pastoral ideals loom more important than the rigours of life at the frontier. As such, it plays more like a cross between the pony paean of Champion the Wonder Horse, and the pantheism of The Indian Fighter, than as a regular film of the genre. The traditional Western often centres around the establishment of civilisation, the drive West, the homestead movement, and so on. The scene in which Spirit wrecks the locomotive, checking the advance of the railroad, is at odds with a genre world view which, typically, has seen the iron way's coming as a tremendous advance. Spirit seeks to keep the wilderness pristine, a place apart from the footfall of white men, where foals can be brought up in peace and security. Of course, his halt of railroad expansion can only be a temporary one, but it is good enough in the meantime. It is as well that he acts when and how he does too, for his friends the Indians are blissfully unaware of events, and seem unable to act with similar determination. A far cry from the marauding savages frequently presented by the Western in its heyday, the tribe here are a peaceful people, somewhat enervated by the need to have a strong animal lead and presumably the claims of political correctness. Little Creek is the exception (although still open-mouthed at the stallion's continued rebelliousness at the fort), even if his amazingly timely and successful trudge to find Spirit down the tracks strains belief.First time co directors Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook have had some involvement with successful animated projects in the past, such as Prince of Egypt, Toy Story, and Little Mermaid. They've clearly learned from their experience. Hans Zimmer's stirring score (which echoes his triumphant Gladiator music at times) and Byan Adam's throaty warbling helps them along, and the story of Spirit runs like clockwork, displaying none of the cutesy parochialism which mars some of Disney's work. With no horse dialogue to slow matters down, much is conveyed through meaningful neighs and equine expressions, surprisingly effective in communication.Some viewers have praised the quality of the animation, and while it is done effectively enough much of the figure drawing has a stripped-down quality which leads to a certain TV blandness (more noticeable in the pan-and-scan video version). The most effective animation occurs during the dramatic destruction of the railroad, but even here there's a suspicion that, had a little more care been spent on light and shade (for instance), the results would have been even more impressive. Least effective of all is the scene on the train, when the despondent Spirit sees his family and friends imagined in falling snowflakes, as the graphic visualisation is disappointingly unsubtle. It's at times like this that the soundtrack proves its worth, carrying the reader over such less effective patches with some emotional charge.When all is said and done of course, it's the target audience which matters the most. The two junior ladies in my household have watched Spirit repeatedly since it arrived at Christmas and would give the film a big four thumbs up. No doubt the successful reception of the feature on the big screen may encourage a sequel (the antipathy between Spirit and The Colonel has been left unresolved, for instance) and in my home, at least, the result of Spirit and Rain beginning a family would be eagerly awaited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spirit: The greatest Dreamworks film yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really dislike both Shrek films. (Since their both "PG" and have words in them I would never say myself, so I disliked them.)But when it comes to "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," which I just barely watched for the first time last month, I became a fan of animated films, other than Pixar. ***Spoilers ahead*** In "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," a horse foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of his heard. One night, he sees a strange light in the distance, and he sets off toward it. This action eventually leads to his capture, and several more things. Throughout the movie, we hear a narration. It's through the thoughts of Spirit, though the horses never talk. This is what makes the movie so goo. They (the movie makers) recored real horses to do the sounds the horses made; none of those sounds were made by humans.Spirit meets Rain, a beautiful mare, and Little Creek, a native-American, who owns Rain. Little Creek later frees Spirit and Rain, they go running home.I have never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I intend to buy the soundtrack to this film in the near future. Watch this film, and you won't regret it. My Score: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wondferful Movie For Everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I began riding horses fairly recently, and, as anyone who has ever ridden should know, I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented Spirit on a whim, just trying to pack my life full of as much horse related material as I could, and I was surprised by the results.What I expected was a feel-good Disneyesque movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes.What I got was an amazing film, filled with beautiful scenery and animation, and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm one's heart.Spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, whose entire world is brought crumbling down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his homeland. The story unfolds with a wide array of characters, some human, some animals, all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story, and who has an appreciation for history and animals.One thing I forgot to mention, but that I feel is important, is that the animals in this film do not talk. This was a really nice vacation from the Lady And The Tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is an overall wonderful movie. The blending of animation types is unique, the storyline is amazing, and the music is wonderful.The drawn animation is a special thing about many animations. How they expressed the characters, especially the horses, through their animation are spectacular especially. While the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand, many young children and people who haven't studied horses might not understand. Without words, I would imagine it would have to be challenging to express them through the features. Because of this, I understand the 'eyebrow' they added to the horses (while real horses don't have those thick lines). One of the few things I noticed about horse habits that might have been portrayed strangely is that Spirit lead his mother's herd. In wild horse herds, the lead stallion usually chases the young colts out.Also, while some people might think portraying the white army officers as the 'bad guys' is stereotyping, think of all the movies in which the Native Americans have been portrayed as that. Sometimes back then; they did treat mustangs very poorly. For example, in real history, the Appaloosa breed was almost wiped out due to the Army officers. Imagine what would have happened to one of the worlds best loved riding breeds if the Native Americans had not saved them.I think it's amazing how the realism wasn't subtracted by making the horses talk to each other. Spirit's feelings were expressed by a little bit of narration, but mostly through the music (by Bryan Adams). The songs express the story really well, and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams did a great job telling the story through melodies and lyrics.The emotion I got when watching the movie, whether the first time or the twentieth (yes, I've watched it that much), you wouldn't believe. Some of the scenes take your breath away, while others seem to force tears into your eyes. The opening sequence, showing Spirit's homeland, puts you right into the spectacular action right away.I don't understand at all why some people are so hateful of this brilliant movie. Overall, I rate it a 10/10 - a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is about freedom.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched Spirit and enjoyed it very much, I've seen it about 4 times now on HBO and will buy the DVD. Those who gave negative reviews would probably think that `Vanishing Point' was just another car chase movie and `Thelma &amp; Louise' was just another chick flick. Although the conclusions of those films are darker I feel the themes are somewhat related; that freedom and individualism are very important and that there is usually someone wanting to take it away from you. The other common trait of these movies is the caring, thoughtful `guardian angel' types who help the main characters to overcome adversity.Another review here mentions how this film relates to the theme of civilization invading someone else's home. All one has to do is look around at the dwindling open areas around us to see that.I thought the animation and the story were amazing, the animators really got the horses to look, act and move naturally. Spirit's emotions were very clear as the story progressed (yes I'm aware they do humanize the horses a bit, but this is fiction). In a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the rapids and the heat from a forest fire. In other more quiet scenes (which are most of the time) you're allowed to savor the backgrounds. One of the big things that make the story really work is by not going the talking, singing animals route. Doing so would take away from the story's power. Instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character, further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack. Another plus is that they weren't afraid to give the story somewhat of a dark side (which really made this film watchable to me). This isn't prevalent through the entire movie though, and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappy.Those who appreciate horses will really like this movie, but I think it's a bit more than a horse movie. I don't feel this would be a good movie to take children to if they're brought up on the inane fare that's offered up today. But if they're the thoughtful sort that can handle compelling stories like The Lord of the Rings and Black Beauty they'll likely love this movie. Hell, I'm 35 years old and STILL love that stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5, and 4) all loved this movie, including myself. The music was also fantastic. No, the horses do not talk, but instead, the story is told by Spirit. And to hear a story told by a horse's point if view was fun.I think the title says it all, "spirit". This movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. I would have to say my 4 year old boy and 5 year old girl were really touched by this movie, and even got so into it, they laughed so hard, and they cheered for spirit in the end. Enjoy "Spirit" with your family and have your spirit lifted with this heartwarming story. Your kids will love it. I think you will too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not easy to create a animated movie in which the animals can display human feelings without losing his animal nature and will be understand by the younger audience at the same time. I have only seen three feature films, in which the idea, to tell a story only through the eyes of animals without "cartoonize" them too much, really works: "Bambi", "Watership Down", and "Spirit - Stallion of the cimarron". This movie is very underrated, it contains all the spirit (oops, good play with words ;-) that once was the realm of Walt Disney. Unfortunately modern Disney lost the ability to tell a good, straight, and heartwarming story in great pictures and symphonic music, like "Spirit - Stallion of the cimarron" do today. Unfortunately modern Disney films needing a lot of action, running gags and sidekicks to cover the weak and soulless plots. Without doubts, the primary model for "Spirit - Stallion of the cimarron" was Disney's old masterpiece "Bambi". As a great fan of "Bambi", i recognize more than a dozen references to Disney's greatest movie of all time: The opening sequence with the forest, Spirits birth, the fight with the cougar, the look to man's camp far away, the burning forest and the jump into the river, the final reunion... and a lot more. That's not wrong, because the makers of "Spirit" use this lovely references in its own context and add a lot more to bring us a great movie that will really touch you. I give him 8 out of 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This animated movie is a masterpiece! The narration, music, animation, and storyline where all remarkable. My girlfriend and I saw it again for a second time and we got more insight from it. We invited a couple friends to see Spirit with us and they really enjoyed it a lot. When I asked them to come along to see it, they thought it was a movie about horses, but afterwards they realized it was more than that. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain, and Lil' Creek, who reminds me of Nathan Chasing Horse who is Smiles A Lot in Dances With Wolves. Spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that I found to be empowering and inspirational.I saw Spirit for a third time and I want to go see it again. I enjoyed "Spirit" tremendously because its portrayal of American Indians is realistic, dignified, and non-stereotypical unlike the movie "The Road to El Dorado", which was a total farce because it portrayed American Indians in a disrespectful and stereotypical way. But Dreamworks has redeemed themselves by making Spirit a great movie that I found to be acceptable! I hope they continue to make more animated movies like Spirit, and I would like to see sequels or spinoffs to Spirit if its done respectfully and without stereotyping American Indians.I highly recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow.I thought it was very powerful, but then again I am a Native American. Having said that I must say that I could not believe that white people could make such a story. And its a good thing they did.If told from the Indian point of view, there would have probably been too much anger.This is also a very important film for right now. You need to see that the same thing is happening to the Palestinians and the Afghans and in other places, and that nothing has changed.But the filmmakers are not that heavy handed. They just tell the story in a straight ahead fashion. They do not try to relate it to current events - it just does.I am extremely well trained in breaking down movies and separating the elements, diegisis, regression, self-reflection and all that film-theory stuff. But this film held me so strong that I could not do any of that. I was just a pile of jelly from the first images of the Eagle to the last images of the family.It is really a film about freedom.Americans have a lot to be proud of in making this film. It took a lot of courage and strength. It is honorable to tell the truth about things and not ignore them as if they never happened. It is honorable to re-examine mistakes. It is honorable to see things from another perspective.Also a good story for African-Americans as the horse is consistently introduced to slavery.You can take children to see it, but this is really a film for adults.Hoka Hey!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the nicest movies that I have ever seen and I really loved this movie! In this animation film, Matt Damon's voice suited well for each and every situation in the movie. I will never forget this movie. It makes you laugh, cry, jump with joy, etc. So this animated film has got the characteristics of a good movie... I liked Spirit. Spirit was cool! It is the only greatest animated movie that I have ever seen until now. I loved the movie that I did not like to move away from the television until the movie ended. Children would surely love this movie. Some adults may love this movie. The directors did a great movie. I hope that you too will enjoy this movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a word: Refreshing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lovely film! SPOILERS ahead ...Major kudos to whoever decided that the horses wouldn't sing or talk. OK, there may be some inconsistencies with the anthropomorphizing, and maybe the animation isn't stellar compared to some things out there. But how refreshing to see a simple, sweet story about a beautiful animal with loads of heart, in his quest for freedom no matter what. How refreshing to see an animated feature with none of the following: scatological humor, mean-spiritedness, adult-oriented jokes, cynicism, and inane techno-pop music. (Lush orchestration throughout, like classic 30s and 40s Disney features. I would've liked songs by Calexico instead of Bryan Adams, but his work was suitable.) I'm sorry for all those jittery viewers who couldn't relax and enjoy the slower pace and simplicity of this charming film. I also enjoyed the rather surprising twist of the Custer-type allowing Spirit to escape.I have no problem with the portrayal of the white men as the bad guys. It's a shame that truth isn't spelled out more clearly in history books; I was many years out of school when I learned of the inexcusable genocide of the Native Americans and their way of life. (All the more shameful considering that the whites came to America to escape oppression.) There are good and bad members of all races and creeds, and we've endured decades of Hollywood whitewashing (pardon the expression) and rewriting of history at the Native Americans' expense. Why not do a complete turnaround in the other direction for a change?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is an enjoyable film from beginning to end. Good story line, great effects, and wonderful characters.About th graphics being poorly done, some of you should really watch those made-for-TV movies. Their graphics ARE poorly done, but not to say they're not good. Of course in movies, you can't really go for computer graphics itself. There are so many elements to a good plot and "Spirit" has that.If you are a Bryan Adams fan or not, the songs are incredible because it's like the songs are telling a story. Unfolding it if you will. Narration also does the same thing, but music can go so much further than that and being a music fan, I know.I think some of you are a little upset because throughout the movie, horses do not speak. Not to say you guys shouldn't keep in title with your opinions and what not, but to me, the movie would be terrible having the horses speaking. It'll just ruin the point of the film at all.I'm very shocked that I didn't see this movie in the theater in the first place because some of the scenes just blow your mind away like the (spoiler) Canyon Leap. In some aspects, I think everyone should at least give the movie a chance. If you don't like, fine and if you do that's great. Just reconsider as for all movies you are about to watch or going to.In end summary, I give this movie 9/10 stars at the most.-Sincerely, a movie buff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular eye-candy, expressionism at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a student and self-proclaimed connoisseur of animation, and having been amazed by The Prince of Egypt and intrigued by The Road to El Dorado, I walked into this film with the highest of expectations, as well as with my seven-year-old nephew and four-year-old niece. Animation-wise, this film was a spectacular feast for the senses. Some of the rendering and color and style was some of the best I've seen in years. How they can communicate an entire script told mostly through whinnies and neighs is truly an incredible feat (the true art of animation is expressing emotion, and to do that without words is remarkable). The characters seem real, have depth (physical and emotional) and the look and feel in general is fantastic.To those whose kids were traumatized that horses were treated poorly, I would say that my nephew and niece are as sensitive as the next kids, and they thought this film was nowhere near offensive. If anything, they thought it was a little too short. To those who say this film is propaganda against "evil white men", I say that the Native Americans in this film put a rope around Spirit and caged him as well.This is FAR more than a story about a horse that gets a rope around the neck every time he tries to escape and is abused and beaten at every turn. This is a good example of Expressionist film: An Everyman character (I believe Spirit can relate to everyone) with some kind of journey, a quest to find out where he belongs, to find his home, with a character (or characters) that symbolize purity of word and mind, a guardian angel of sorts (I believe this character is found in the Eagle, Little Creek and the mare Rain) with some kind of a message or a moral. This is a fable about the unconquerable human spirit. Sure, Spirit himself has some ups and downs and even forgets for a little bit who he is, but he's reminded and realizes his spiritual identity is worth fighting for.So if your kids were raised on Teletubbies and Barney ONLY, they may be disturbed by this fantastic film. What is lacks in story, the characters, emotions and meaning more than make up for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for the hard bitten cynics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do people who already have a preconceived notion of what is an acceptable amount of tenderness in a film write reviews for films like "Spirit"? I have one message to anyone with a blindly scathing opinion of this film: if you just don't like children's films, or if you have the rigidness of mind that makes it impossible for you to go back to a time of greater innocence, DO NOT REVIEW THIS FILM! Please.That said, I can continue that "Spirit" is extraordinary. The animation is technically impressive, from the opening shot to the locomotive scene at the end. The storytelling is straightforward and pure, yet has many totally original moments that combine with the more formulaic, tried and true story elements. Objectively speaking, you can see that a great deal of time and money went into making the movie something that would stand a little taller than its competitors.Sadly, "Spirit" suffers from its subject matter in a way unfair to the film itself. The film will likely appeal more to the sensitive (read: women, girls and young boys) than a general audience. The story is about a horse, and that means it is NOT likely to have lots of guns, swordplay, singing animals, characters saying, "It's all my fault", or distinct good vs. evil. My word, what happens when someone is courageous enough to make a movie that so deviates from tried and true storytelling devices? The answer: they don't make as much money as the recyclers at the Mouse."Spirit" was outshone and outmarketed by "Lilo and Stitch" and did not have nearly as long a run as a result. Guess who lost out because of that? You did, very likely. I saw this in the theater and on home DVD. "Spirit" loses an enormous amount of its power going to the small screen. The opening panoramic, long shot behind the eagle is reduced to a clever camera trick. And the experience of being engulfed in the thunder and masterfully recreated power of the galloping herd of mustangs is reduced to a moment of natural drama and little else. If you missed this movie during the summer of 2002, it is little wonder why you might overlook (or worse, pan) this magnificent milestone in animation.See "Spirit" with an open mind. Enjoy its fresh take on the Bambi/Kimba/animal adventure tale. If you can, watch it with *children* so you can get a glimpse at the magic that they can easily see in this superior film. When it's over, take a moment and imagine what imagination and heart went into creating this film. And if you still cannot decide favorably on it at all, watch "Scary Movie" or something that appeals better to your sense of intelligence and taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just the plain, simple facts !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It appears to me, that a lot of people have VERY mixed views on this film. While on holiday (vacation) in Florida, I took my (then) four year old granddaughter to see Spirit at a pre-release viewing. WE both totally enjoyed the whole film.It certainly was not what I was expecting, no singing/talking animals, just a great sound track and songs to tell the story along with the animation - it was all very well done and I could not wait to see it again when released in the U.K.WE did go see it again - twice, once we took a friend of my granddaughter along and suffice to say they BOTH loved it.Having read some of the comments from others on these pages, I can not believe the references to '9/11, anti-white', etc. etc. What are these people on about? This film took almost five years to make, long before 9/11 and it was released MONTHS after that atrocity. As for anti-white/American, are these people on my planet?Like most films, it certainly is not perfect but just remember that it is aimed at children and although I can not claim to speak for my (now) five year old granddaughter or her friend, I do know that they enjoyed it, no doubt in a different way in which I or most adults would, so as far as I am concerned Spirit did it's job.The truth for me at least is, that I loved the film and (most) of the music by both Hans Zimmer AND Bryan Adams but, I can recognise that some people would HATE that, possibly because it was all too much for them to follow the story with out 'Disney' style talking animals - who knows? As I've already said, it was not what I was expecting.Suffice to say that I now own a CD of the sound track and the DVD of the film. Worked for me!Quite simply if it is on at a cinema near you, go and see it OR rent it OR buy it.Oh, before I forget - some people who have commented on this film failed to realise that this was NOT A DISNEY FILM. Doh!As they say, it's different HORSES for different courses!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what's the problem with this movie being politically correct. It only means white men had a kind of barbarian behavior to animals while native Indians had to learn how to live together with them. There's nothing depicted in this movie white men did not do with horses. Okay, is it stereotypical? Yes, in a level, yes, but come on, this is a movie, this is an animated movie, aimed mostly for kids; world is more black&amp;white for them than this movie shows. By the way, the colors of the movie are incredibly beautiful; just as the pictures. Maybe not always really interesting pictures but lovingly beautiful. And the action scenes are better than any in the last two episodes of Star Wars (I had the same opinion about Tarzan after The Phantom Menace). That train sequence... And when ****spoilers*** before the very final scene, Spirit is aimed by guns but is not shot, you can see this movie isn't half as stereotypical about white men as you thought. If you still think it is, you have missed that scene. I personally am sad that this tale could reach only a smaller part of the movie-goers; this might mean that stupid (even if funny), poorly drawn animated features have future and ones like this do not. I certainly would love to see more of this type. 8/10. (p.s. Mustangs are really wild European horses...true)</fullReview>

The storyline has a lot of symbolism in it, from the captivity of Spirit as well as that of the other horses, and the 'lessons' the movie tries to teach us in the bad guy vs the good guy, the bad guy being Army, and the good guy being Lakota.

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie in a lot of ways. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. The animation is excellent and easily demonstrates that there are plenty of producers who create films that are as visually brilliant as anything that comes from the Disney Studio.One difference from the normal Disney fare is that this Dreamworks movie does not feature some wise-cracking side kick for comedy relief. And, there are no sudden moments where the characters break into song. I am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a Disney picture: the birth of Spirit. But it is done tastefully and is not offensive at all. "Spirit" was a great breath of fresh air. Don't get me wrong. I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so. "Spirit" is another example of great animated fare. As soon as it was over, my kids wanted to watch it again. I had the same feeling. I thoroughly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a must see on the big screen where the backgrounds alone are worth the ticket. I was please that there were no contrived comedic characters that are found in so many of today's animated movies. I loved that the horses didn't talk and that the plot depended on the narrator along with the music. The animation of the horses expressions and movements replaced the need for talking. Bryan Adams' music matched beautifully with the story and should deserve awards. It reminds me a little of The 1979 "Black Stallion" where the action replaced the need for dialogue. I consider it one of the best movies this year, a joy from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ground-breaking animation! A soaring journey!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I was skeptical about this film. An animated feature about a horse fighting for his freedom during the "How the West Was Won" years. It sounded a little dull. Well I couldn't have been more wrong. SPIRIT is a captivating film... beautifully animated and told.In the film's dramatic opening, we follow an eagle as it soars through rich Western landscapes. The backgrounds are stunning. I've never seen better in a 2D animated film. The eagle flies over a rushing river and into a forest, which comes alive with fluttering birds and frolicking bears. Han Zimmer adds an eloquent score, which gave me chills. There's some tasteful narration during this segment, done by Matt Damon. A perfect choice for the voice of the hero, Spirit. I'm not a big fan of narration, but the film-makers were smart, and the narration is used sparingly. Within moments a herd of horses charges over the horizon and the audience is taken on a wild ride.The big surprise in this film is the amount of story telling that is achieved without much dialogue. Yes, the horses in SPIRIT don't talk. I was shocked too. John Fusco is credited with the screenplay, but he obviously didn't have much to write. The real story tellers here are the animators. These horses are beautifully drawn. Their dramatic expressions tell you everything the horses might think or want to say. It's nice to see a film daring enough to break away from the Disney formula. I was dreading a sequence with singing and dancing horses. Fortunately, it never came. There are no silly side-kicks either. Again, a welcomed change.I don't want to give away too much of the story, because it is quite an exciting experience. The basic premise deals with a stallion named Spirit who is captured by some cowboys. Spirit is then dragged off to a Cavalry fort, but he never forgets his herd and longs to return to them. Spirit meets a mean colonel, a friendly Indian and a attractive mare (you knew there had to be a love interest) in his travels. All of them help open Spirit's eyes to the new world around him.The film features songs from Brian Adams. Most of the songs are strong and serve the story well. Once or twice I felt the songs were a little too close to each other, but that is only a minor gripe.Overall, I found the film completely engaging and surprisingly moving. Also, the themes, especially involving freedom, are very timely, given the post-9/11 era we find ourselves living in. Without a doubt the best animated feature in a long, long time. I look forward to seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is no doubt... Spirit is the best of 2002!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron today, May 24, 2002, opening day. And I have never seen a movie like this.First, let me say that I have waited for this movie for about six months, ever since I saw its short trailer that was shown with the Shrek video and DVD. Since then I have eagerly anticipated its arrival, and today finally was able to revel in the movie's gorgeous characters, stunning animation, superb plot, and hilarious antics.I could begin by telling you some of the plot, but I believe that is unnecessary. Plenty of commentors on IMDb have already done that, and the trailer for the movie shows enough as it is. If one goes to the Spirit fansite, one can learn nearly everything about the movie.I went into the theaters today already knowing the first half hour of the movie, thanks to my lousy habit of browsing through the different sites dedicated to this movie. Although I already knew most of the movie, I was still speechless. The cell animation and hand-drawn art is utterly seamless, just like the creators have claimed. To put it plainly, Spirit's animation is perfect. I can find one flaw only. When Spirit and other characters are running, they are in the foreground and the ground is rushing beneath them. You can tell that they are not really running on the ground. But even this flaw is nothing compared to the true essence of Spirit.The true essence, or essences, of Spirit, are the beautiful, extremely realistic horse characters and its music. The horses act like real horses. Of course, we all know by now that they don't speak English (or French or German or Italian), but they really do speak. They are intelligent in the movie, with the squeals and neighs comprising their language. They speak, move, look, and FEEL like real horses. The animators and screenwriters have put so much effort into creating these magnificent characters.At first, when I heard the songs by Bryan Adams on the soundtrack, I didn't really like them. But now that I've seen their places in the movie, I cannot get the songs out of my mind. They are perfect for the movie. And if I went on about Hans Zimmer's music, this comment would be the length of a few miles. Zimmer has composed such an eloquent, vivid score that tells its own story. Without his music, the movie would feel empty. It is the score that helps bring it alive.Matt Damon is a great guy for the narrator. He knows just the right tone that will put one into the "mood" of the movie. Its almost as if he really is Spirit, as if he was more than just a narrator.It's obvious now, isn't it? Spirit is the best of 2002. No other movie will match its friendliness, its vivid characters, its loveable tale, and its legendary score and plot line. If you want a movie filled with nothing but endless entertainment and a great feeling that just lingers for hours, Spirit is for you. So is the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique And Beautiful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first movie I ever saw in Theaters. I never got to see movies in theaters because my parents thought at the time it was a waste of money. However they let me go see this movie and I was dazzled.1. The animation is some of the best Dreamworks animation. The horses look like real horses and show great expression without any talking. The humans are drawn nicely too depicting the time-line they were living in. The backgrounds are wondrous on the eyes.2. The characters hardly ever speak except for the narration, the Indian and Sgt. Adams along with minor characters. The animals never speak which can be really hard to do but it worked perfectly. The narration was done when needed and was quiet when all you needed was to see the horses expression. However these are good characters.3. The story is pretty easy to follow. Plus it helps that you want to see them all over come their obstacles. Even the bad guy learns a good lesson. I was thrilled to see Spirit and Rain come home.Go see the movie! You will love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not like any of Dreamworks's other animated films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will say this: I find the animation films from Dreamworks to be fun and entertaining. Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmaron is a completely different film compared to Shrek, Over the Hedge, and Kung Fu Panda. Spirit does not have any talking animals, pop culture references, or many laugh out loud situations like the other films from Dreamworks.But this is not a bad thing. Spirit is the story of a horse who was born free, lived free, captured, and made it his mission to find a way to escape what has happened to him. While Spirit does not actually, his memories of his past are narrated wonderfully by Matt Damon. Damon narrates the story as if this all happened in the past.The animation is so amazing to capture the look and feel of the old west. It makes you feel like you are out there way before people started moving out west. The story is amazing at centering around Spirit and capturing the ups and downs of his story. It is an amazing story with crisp animation, along with a thrilling screenplay. It is well worth checking out. This film is a complete change of pace for Dreamworks and works well on so many levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Dreamworks' most ambitious, but most visually stunning and most underrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether it is the best Dreamworks movie is up for debate, but it is a long way from being their worst. Along with The Prince of Egypt, one of the most powerful, evocative and stirring animated films I have seen along with Watership Down, Spirit:Stallion of the Cimarron has to be Dreamworks's most ambitious film to date. It is also visually stunning, and do I think it is underrated? Yes, I do. I am going to do something I have not before in my earlier reviews, I am going to talk about each element of the film and talk about them in sufficient enough detail(or at least I will try to): ANIMATION: My goodness! The animation in this film is absolutely stunning! No, no, can I change that to gorgeous? I cannot count the amount of times I sat there awed at the audaciousness of the backgrounds, the vibrancy of the colours and the swiftness of the character movements especially on Spirit himself. I know I have raved about how amazing the animation was in Prince of Egypt and Over the Hedge, but seriously the sheer beauty of the animation here makes this for me the most beautiful visually of the Dreamworks movies.MUSIC: For this movie, I have read reviews not only on IMDb but also from critics that the songs and score here sucked. Can I be obliged to disagree? I admit at 17 I prefer classical music, but the songs from Bryan Adams I thought were lovely. They had nice melodies and meaningful lyrics that do try to convey a message, Here I am was amazing. I also liked the orchestration. Hans Zimmer has done better work, and I admit the sounds used in the orchestration were unusual they were somewhat effective as well.STORY: When criticising this film, this is the element that gets bashed most. Critics complain that the story is slow, lacklustre and not compelling enough. Okay, it isn't the most fast moving story or one driven by humour and excitement, though there is evidence of both. This film for many reasons is somewhat more mature and ambitious than most of the other Dreamworks films, I think the only other Dreamworks movie that surpasses it in terms of ambition and maturity is (predictably) The Prince of Egypt. The story here is driven by themes of love, courage, following your heart and freedom and they are explored acceptably. Admittedly, it wasn't always as in-depth as it could've been, but some scenes like the scene with the train really did have an impact on me, and the romance between Spirit and Rain was cute. I wanted Spirit to succeed, even when it looked impossible.SCRIPT: I liked the maturity and heart of the script here. And I also liked the fact it was delivered in the perspective of Spirit, I like films that are told through the perspective of a character from the film, it offers a whole new perspective on things. Spirit isn't the first film to be told in the perspective of a character, Black Beauty and Watership Down are prime examples and the Rankin'/Bass special Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer had a snowman telling the story. That said, the script is very reflective and beautifully written.VOICES: Very little to complain about here. Matt Damon was a nice choice for Spirit/The Narrator. I have also heard complaints that Damon was bland and dragged the movie down, and I also do disagree with that. I have heard much worse voice acting, and as far as I am concerned(not trying to sound opinionated) but Damon did a good job. And I liked the character of Spirit, he was brave, handsome and loving, quite possibly my favourite character. Daniel Studi was appealing as Little Creek, and James Cromwell plays the mean Colonel with crusty demeanour.In conclusion, this is an underrated film, that deserves more praise. It isn't one hundred percent perfect, but I do think there are worse animated movies out there, that are nowhere near as ambitious, as well animated or as brave as Spirit:Stallion of the Cimarron. It isn't easy taking on ambitious projects, and I applaud ANY film that tries. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a film for the family... A western for everyone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film at my local cinema back when it was first released in 2002. I brought it on DVD and have seen it many times since. I recently mentioned it in an essay i wrote, regarding the history and development of the Western genre, and as soon as i did i found myself looking at it in a whole new way. The reason i mentioned this film in my essay was because i was discussing the influence of westerns on contemporary films and argued that the westerns are slowly becoming popular again. Whether or not they will has yet to be seen for certain but it is films like this which prove my point.The film centres around a wild stallion which grows up to become the leader of its herd. One day curiosity leads him to examine the camp of a group of cowboys who capture him and take him to be tamed as a military horse. Refusing to be broken he crosses paths with an imprisoned Indian boy who helps him to escape. Spirit is then taken on a journey across the western frontier, along the way discovering the Indian world and meeting a female mustang. Forced to run for his life, the life of his new Indian friend and to keep his homeland safe, Spirit takes on impossible odds to once again run free.First time directors Lorna Cook and Kelly Asbury had all of the right ingredients and made them into a beautiful film. However, they failed to notice that they had the potential to make something amazing.Firstly, the film is great as it is. On the surface it works well for its intended audience and for those expecting a bit more it has something original. The main reason for this is that the animals in the film don't talk. Matt Damon voices the narration from Spirits point of view at strategic moments in the film, but Spirit the horse never speaks. All of his emotions are shown through music and his themed expressions. Mostly, however, it is the soundtrack which creates the great atmosphere. Bryan Adams provides the key songs to reflect on the story of the film, but Hans Zimmer provides an amazing score which works equally well, if not better. Either way, both do an excellent job, all of the music is amazing and can be listened to over and over many times.The story is good, its not great, but it works and covers the ground that it needs to. John Fusco, whose back catalogue reads very plainly as a western orientated writer, develops the script well and knows where he wants the film to go. However, this is where the films problem begins and is the reason that the film is not better. Its themes aren't varied enough. The themes of freedom, love and the true hero of the west are the strongest ones but the one which is only kept at one level is that of the unbridled west. Basically, Spirit is so called because he is supposed to be an embodiment of the spirit of the western film, the Wild West in general as well but the western in film is clearer. The idea being that the countless number of times people have killed the western as a genre and successfully argued that the western is dead are a dime a dozen, but the 'Spirit' of the western a genre can never be killed, it will always live on and Spirit's relentless attitude is reflective of that. It is especially reflective during the scene with the train, as Spirit has ultimately decided to give in and admit defeat but as soon as he sees that classic western shot of the landscape he realises that he must fight on. In reality this happened recently, in the 80s the western was almost completely out of production but in the early 90s, with films such as Clint Eastwoods 'Unforgiven,' which showed the real west in a whole new way. Since then westerns have been produced more prominently. The western still lives on and films like Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron are the reason why! The reason Spirit deserves a lot more credit than it got is that it brought the west to a new audience and in a new way. The horses are an essential part of the western (in fact i doubt that there is a western that doesn't feature them). The reason, if any, that the westerns died out is because it exhausted itself and audiences got bored of the same old thing. What makes Spirit different from usual westerns is that it has a new story, from a new perspective and for a new audience, which if the western is to come back, is what it needs to do.All of the right archetypes are featured in this film, we have the mythical lone hero vs the encroachment of civilisation, the cowboys, the Indians, the romance, the action and adventure set against the backdrop of the unchanging background. The main difference is obviously that of the cowboy being the villainous entity of the film, destroying the beauty of the real west with modern civilisation. Which isn't wrong! The horses and the Indians were there first, but the Cowboys came and took them over, this is the difference between that of the mythical heroic cowboy and that of the real one. Which is what Spirit successfully captures. There is so much more i could talk about, but i won't. I will simply end by saying that this essential animated western is worth watching. It gives the classic west a modern make over that is often tried but rarely works. Every time i watch this film i am captured and am blown away by the real beauty of the wild west.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful film, well worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spirit is a wonderful movie, full of excellent scenery and moving characters. Yes, they're animated, but still very human. People have accused the horse of being "too" smart and human-like. Of course he is! He's the star! No different than Lassie. There are a few inconsistencies, if one is overly-concerned about historical accuracy/fact (horses are not as old as the buffalo grass on the US plains), or horse behavior/anatomy (foals are not born with teeth, and their manes could NEVER grow as fast as Spirit's does). But if you're able to just sit and enjoy the movie with your children, it is quite good, and the musical score is wonderful. I did buy the CD, and my whole family enjoys it. Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer did a great job of giving Spirit his musical voice. Final note -- don't expect this to be an historical document, or a serious drama. It's cute and amusing, with some wonderful animation and scenery. And if you rent the DVD and watch the making-of feature, you will be impressed with how it was made using a combination of hand-drawn and CGI graphics. ENJOY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A children's movie that will actually make the whole family feel good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just returned from the theater with my family after watching Spirit and realized that I enjoyed it as much if not more than my children. Spirit may not have been the blockbuster that it could have been (for reasons that I will touch upon below), but it is a strong film with stunning animation. From the opening frame, the rich textured backgrounds are lush and beautiful. The characters have a very "Aeon Flux" look to them that actually melds nicely with the scenery.The narration by Matt Damon, and the voice acting of James Cromwell (of "Babe") was also very well done. Some individuals I know have complained that this movie makes the US look bad while placing the American Indians in a positive light. I love my country (The USA) as much as anyone, but I did not feel that this was the case. I felt that this movie was based on the stallion's fear of ANYONE, not just the white man. It was a movie about freedom, not about an "evil" US government. And, the freedom that this government gives us, enables Dreamworks to present such a film. So if you are opposed to seeing American Indians as shown as having a heart, do not see this film. If you would like to see a good family movie intended for those with an open mind, please do yourself a favor, and see this movie. It may even make you appreciate your freedom.I give Spirit 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

I Love the narration of the movie and how you can tell what's going on by the music or by the actions of the horses. The music By Bryan Adams made the movie and i love it he has come back with yet again great songs. The story of a wild horse trying to be tamed seemed like a good movie to me and watching it was to my enjoyment better than i expected. You will love this movie and the little girl in the movie i just wish they would of had more with her i loved the indian he was awesome he was as just a free spirit as the horse.

		<shortDescription>A triumph of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading a few of the most recent reviews for this film I decided I would give my account of this movie from an artists' stand-point. But I will get onto that a little later.Firstly, when I first saw the trailer for 'Spirit' I was a little skeptical about what it was going to be like. I myself have an overwhelming passion for horses and animation, because of this I was worried that 'Spirit' would not live up to my high expectations.My worst fears however were left far behind after I saw the movie for the first time. No other movie I have ever seen with the exception of one, The Last Unicorn, has left me so unspeakably breathless and in awe. 'Spirit' captures the majesty and power of the horse, as well as their gentle, sublime nature. The animation of the horses, although it leaves a little to be desired from my personal view, is stunningly beautiful and accurate. The landscape and scenery are impeccably well done and gives the film a spectacular sense of space, mood and atmosphere, traits which are greatly lacking in many American animated features.The movies' 'crowning glory' if you like is the fact that the horses don't speak, although the film is narrated in parts by the main character Spirit. This gives the film a boost in the realistic direction as I have never seen before. The concept of 'Spirit' was to make it as realistic and as serious as possible while still keeping the story line followable. When you have a horse talking the story is no longer serious, the thought of a horse that can speak is found largely humorous and would have ruined the plot to a large degree.Although this will weaken the story alot for younger viewers, as the horses' moods are only shown through facial expressions, stances and neighs it will work well with those who are yearning for something a little different. There is very little speech throughout the movie altogether but it doesn't let the movie down in the slightest.The story itself is the only real downside, it's run of the mill and pretty predictable, but alot of this lacking is made up by the musical score, by Hans Zimmer who's work I have long admired in other animated films. The scores are inspirational and most of the songs, by Bryan Adams, fit into the story very well.A point which most people won't be able to grasp is the fact that the animators for 'Spirit' had a huge task to undertake which was achieved beautifully with help from real horse experts. I myself am an artist, and aspirering to be an animator. Horses are extremely difficult to animate due to the shape of the head, position of the eyes and the low set mouth. Having drawn horses both realistically and how they would appear as animated characters for many years, the challenge of producing the animation for this film is very real to me and as far as I know it has never been accomplished so successfully until 'Spirit'.From my personal view, the most remarkable feature of 'Spirit' is the main theme, 'Freedom'. Being a horse fanatic, I believe that horses are meant to be wild and free. Even though back in the days of the old west horses were essential to the time for transportation ,they do not have the same role in modern countries today. By this I mean the keeping of horses primarily for racing, show jumping etc. Personally the vision of a group of horses, mounted by riders and being whipped with a piece of leather is too heart breaking to bear, to the point where I have to look away or leave the room. The theme of a wild horse fighting for his freedom and the freedom of his herd is satiating and powerful, however, if you're not fond of animation or horses this movie won't do anything for you at all. I think I've rambled on long enough about this film, it has it's ups and downs but I feel it's a classic tale in its own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved everything from this film: The animation (Which is wonderful) the story (Which is charming and captivating) the characters (Which are very likable) and the music. This is a great film, and it is one of the best animated production from Dreamworks. Too bad that the company doesn't make more films like this anymore: To be honest, I like movies as "Shrek" and "Kung Fu Panda", but I think that stopping doing traditionally animated films was a mistake from Dreamworks: In the recent years, we don't see such wonderful films as this one, almost everything are silly CGI animated comedies that try too hard to be like the films from Pixar, without reaching the same level of quality. "Spirit", instead, is one of the most beautiful animated films of the recent years. I can't understand why all the negativity against this film. Just because the main characters are animals doesn't make this a rip-off of Disney films.This movie deserves a lot more of appreciation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember, when this movie first came out critics barraged it for being too simple and childish for modern auditory.. and a lot of people believed that and a movie was quickly underrated and forgotten. In my opinion critics spend too much time in searching for mistakes and never really saw this movie and how beautiful it was (especially for that modern eye they were talking about) People (i'm talking about grown up people now :D) are a bit tired from blockbusters Hollywood feed us.. and want something to watch and relax.. this one gives both +remmembers you're living in one big wonderful world with a lot of stuff going around.. If you really want to relax watch this film alone.. if you want to have fun time and refresh yourself watch it with your family or/and friends..I saw this movie two years later after it was released on TV.. and i laughed and cried at the same time.. then i watched it again a few months later.. and a year later.. saw it about 5times in total. In my country TV ratings goes up when this movie is shown.You will be amazed how beautiful goes music with this film.. No one could do it better in this movie than Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer did.. Music gave spirit to spirit :D animation is also 10/10.P.s. this is my first comment.. also sorry for all the mistakes i did in English xD i just had to write a comment to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie for All Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been one of the best things that I've seen in a long time. It wasn't some little girlie thing with talking horses and plots where everything was perfect and dandy. The movie is very correct in it's historical references. Some people haven't liked the way that the white men were portrayed in this film. BIG DEAL!!!! It was a movie that told it like it was, no sugar coating. Many people just want horses so that they can ride them and tell them to do tricks. But horses are much more than transportation and Dreamworks captured the elegance and beauty that so many people have missed or ignored. It's a wonderful movie about a strong horse who keeps fighting until he gets what he believes in: freedom. We really need more movies around like this one. We could do with less of those boring things where everything's perfect. Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron shows that there's always been obstacles for everyone. It's been one of the greatest westerns in a long time!! And the music was beautiful! All of the songs by Bryan Adams were beautiful! They really helped describe the mood of th scene or help express what Spirit was feeling. The day after I saw the movie I went out and searched for the soundtrack. More people, of all ages, should come see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this film. This is Dreamworks single movie that I actually enjoyed. It has great music, and a great score. Until I watched this movie, however, I did not like Bryan Adam's music at all. But after watching this movie, I purchased the soundtrack, and I listen to it every day (or as often as I can).**Spoilers begin here. Do not read if you haven't seen this movie.**Young Spirit is born at the beginning, and we see a hilarious young Spirit running around, and sticking his tongue on an icicle, and having too much fun, as it seems. We see Spirit grow up in about 5 seconds, and he becomes the leader of his herd.He has an adventure with a mountain lion, or some kind of wild cat. He chases the cat away, and then later on, we don't know how much later, he sees a light far in the distance, and he goes to investigate. Little did he know that this decision would change his life forever. He is soon captured by the men that were at the campfire, and is taken far away to an unknown place. He has many adventures, but I can't go into detail. He meets a native boy, called Little Creek and also meets a mare named Rain, who he really likes a lot.I'll say one more thing, though. The music for this movie, especially the score, is 100% phenomenal. I highly recommend this movie for all ages.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my daughter's absolute favorite movie and, I think, the movie that really got her into horses. The animation, the music and the story line are all excellent. The message, stated at the beginning in Matt Damon's narration, is something everyone can appreciate, whether it offends them or not: "Whether the west was won or lost -- I'll leave that up to you to decide." Think "The Last Resort" by Don Henley.Movies about animals that don't talk are often boring, but the artists made Spirit and the others so expressive that we can completely understand the communication (horses don't really have eyebrows, but this movie is very brow-heavy, with great results).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who follow my reviews here (and I was a professional movie reviewer many years ago), you know I am very hard on movies and very rarely rave about anything. I am raving now. SPIRIT is one of the best cartoons I have seen in several years, and looks like a solid bet to become a lasting children's classic. It is the first time I can remember that a horse story had been told in animation form, and it looks absolutely magnificent. The artwork and the animation are some of the finest I have ever seen, right up there with THE LION KING and RESCUERS DOWN UNDER (to which this film bears more than a passing resemblance), the soundtrack is terrific, and even Bryan Adams' maudlin songs help keep things moving in a movie that never stops moving. Matt Damon is the perfect narrator and in my humble opinion the heir apparent to Robby Benson for cartoon voice work. The fact that the horses do not talk (a la Disney's talking animals) makes the movie even better. I don't know if this cartoon made its money back in theaters, but it surely will on video. And I suspect the soundtrack will be a huge bestseller for the younger set, since Adams' tunes are integral to the plot and will evoke memories of certain scenes as they are played. Dreamworks should be extremely proud of this cartoon, and I hope they make a ton of money on it so they keep producing cartoons of this quality for many more years to come. One gripe -- what, you thought I was going to let it get away completely clean? -- James Cromwell's evil Army captain should have been silver-haired. Brown hair didnt become him and the depths of his infamy.</fullReview>

It takes you back to the early America with a story that is very well done in a way that even the children can understand it. What a refreshing break from all the "talking animal" movies that are out there, we simply loved it! The movie is done in traditional animation which was also very nice. Not that today's computer animated movies aren't great but a cartoon done this way, narrated very well and without the unrealistic detachment of talking animals... A winner all the way around.

		<shortDescription>Absolutely incredible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a perfect example of why I like DreamWorks Animation. Like its title character, they refuse to conform. Don't let the G rating fool you. Even with that rating, "Spirit" possesses a remarkable intelligence and treats the audience as such; it never talks down to the small fry. The horses do not talk or sing (and even Matt Damon's narration is used sparingly). This allows the audience to put 2 and 2 together, and the animators shine--this is the most remarkable horse animation I've ever seen. It also places a greater importance on the music. I've always felt Hans Zimmer's best scores were for animation, and this is the best of the best. His score blends seamlessly with Bryan Adams' songs, which complement the story beautifully. The CinemaScope frame is used to great effect, and the film looks so good you could pick any one frame of film, frame it and mount it on a wall. But more importantly than all of the above, after you see it you will be proud to be free and better yet, your own spirit will be uplifted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love animation, go see. If you love horses, go see. If you love both you will be in HEAVEN. While they could have animated the horses a bit better, what really got me was the movement. The human eye can pick out the correct movement for a given creature, and they FINALLY got the horse movement right! And you can tell these folks learned their stuff between 'The Lion King' and 'Shrek'; the fire and water effects are just incredible, as are the backgrounds and camera work Mark my words, Bryan Adams will get at least one, if not more, Oscar nominations for those perfectly-fitting songs. I wouldn't be surprised if the movie itself gets more nominations for cinematography, sound editing, and Foley work; the horse sounds were just perfect. And, of course, Best Animated Feature Film, though I felt it was a bit short at 1hr 20 min. Some parts may be a bit intense for younger or very sensitive children, so parents may want to consider if seeing the main characters shot at and hurt will upset younger viewers. However, this movie is for all ages; my friend and I were not the only adults without children in the theater! Just... go see! ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful (warning, spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of seeing this film at one of its sneak previews and it took my breath away. "Spirit:SOTC" takes the viewer on an epic journey through diverse and wonderful landscapes as it tells the adventures of a young mustang in the old west. The title character encounters various situations that take his innocence, but also leave him a stronger leader. From being captured and an attempted army induction to falling in love, working for the railroad and again finding his freedom, Spirit invites us on an emotional roller coaster. The animation in this film is stunning; the horses don't talk so emotions are conveyed primarily through body and facial acting. Spirit is first party narrated by Matt Damon, additional voices include James Cromwell and Daniel Studi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific animation, beautiful story. A winner through and through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like part of the reason why DreamWorks's Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron works so well (Ebert noted this in his excellent review) is the fact that none of the animals talk. Although the titular horse is given internal narration by Matt Damon (of all people), not once does Spirit, or any other creature ever speak themselves. This allows for more time spent on music, visuals and storytelling free from banter or exposition. When you have a movie with such sweeping scope and majestic beauty, it's nice to just relax and let it wash over you, almost like a music video. I'll always love 2D animation, and here its done exquisitely, the wild frontier rendered in richly colored strokes, the horses vividly brought to life through the illustrations. It's one of the last classic 2D outings, before the eventual switch to computer generated stuff. Don't get me wrong I'm just as in love with 3D animation, but I will always have deep nostalgic pangs for this style as well. Someone once told me that cinema is the only art form in which every single artistic medium you can think of can all inhabit the same space, interacting and complimenting each other to create a symphony for all the senses and perceptions. Spirit is a shining example: exceptional drawing and animation, terrific voice acting, and the music, which is a standout. Both the stirring score by Hans Zimmer and the original songs by Bryan Adams are heartfelt compositions which soar along with the visuals in perfect harmony. Spirit is a wild young mustang, who is captured by a vicious Colonel, gruffy baritoned by James Cromwell. He tries to train the horse and break him, but Spirit has that wild spark of vitality that any protagonist of the animal kingdom must possess. He refuses to give in, never losing hope of one day returning to his herd. He is befriended by young native man Little Creek (Daniel Studi) who is also searching for home. The two form an adventurous bond, putting them against man and nature to return to their origins. Mountains, valleys, corals, trees and the untamed northwest wilderness are all presented in a fashion so gorgeous that the colors nearly pop off the screen. It's just terrific entertainment through and through, never too silly, sappy or frightening, hitting all the right notes along the whole breadth of its breezy 80 minute runtime. DreamWorks doesn't often give Disney a run for its money, but consider this a glowing exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main reason why I watched this movie the first time was because I was so fond of horses. From the age of 10 until the age of 14 I began riding horses (I'm eighteen now). I thought horses were the most beautiful creatures on earth and they were my best buddies, so when I noticed they made a film about them, buying that movie was the first thing I thought I should do. My expectations: a good film (not great because I'm not a fan of animated movies) with talking animals and sometimes you can have a good laugh. I didn't expect an amazing and meaningful movie, just a movie where I could watch horses in an amusing way.Now I have to say, my expectations were not quite right. Spirit is much more than just a good movie. You don't get to have a good laugh, the storyline is amazing, they sing beautiful songs (sung by Brian Adams) and you get so many different feelings when watching this: sad, happy, mad The songs express the story and the feelings of Spirit very well. But the best part is that the horses aren't able to talk, which makes a better impression. It's an enjoyable movie for the whole family, because the age doesn't matter. Everyone will eventually cry &#x263a;It is an amazing film with beautiful scenery. Some of the scenes take your breath away, while others seem to force tears into your eyes! For example where Spirit has to pull a train and he is suffering from pain. Or when he is separated from the love of his life, that female Indian horse. That got me crying! Spirit was even nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Deserved. The horses and people, they all look so realistic. Not a simple thing to do, but the directors (Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook) did a great job! This digital 3-D computer animation is the best I have ever seen, much better than Toy Story or others! Besides this animation, they use many light colors so you get in a very good mood when watching this. You will never get enough of Spirit, even after the 5th or 6th time! Great movie, children and adults will love it. So next time when you don't know what to do, take Spirit and enjoy your evening. Don't forget the tissues!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as ambitious as The Prince of Egypt and How To Train Your Dragon, but an underrated classic nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up as a kid after the mid-90s, I've seen new animated films in the early 2000s which included two of Pixar's films Monsters INC and Finding Nemo after having seen Ice Age, but later, I stumbled upon another animated feature length film "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" from Dreamworks Animation after having seen "The Road to El Dorado" before I've seen their computer animated hits like Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. I've heard that lots of people hated it for being too slow and not compelling.Well, I will admit that while it's not as ambitious as The Prince of Egypt and How To Train Your Dragon, it's a neatly underrated film much like "The Road to El Dorado" (which I also liked as a child). The story, although not nearly as compelling, has some great themes of love hope and courage and there are some moments with the characters that really touched and captured my heart including the scenes with Spirit especially the romance between him and the other horse named Rain which was cute. Even the script is mature and ambitious. The characters on the whole are likable and the horses are beautiful creatures in the western setting. The villain, although not given enough screen time, is entertaining and enjoyable and the native American characters, including Little Creek, are excellent people while being helped by an excellent voice cast.What excels the most is the beautiful animation and the music from Hans Zimmer. The visuals are excellent and well-made throughout the film and the character animation on the horses are solid and flawless. For those who hated the music and the songs from Bryan Adams are dead wrong because the score from Hans Zimmer is effective it has an emotional charm to it and while I like modern pop song and classical songs, I think the songs from Bryan Adams are lovely and memorable.Overall, not nearly as excellent, but an underrated movie that is worth-watching as most animated films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is an animated film that was released by DreamWorks. It follows the adventures of a young Kiger mustang stallion living in the 19th century wild west.The voices in the film includes Hollywood superstar Matt Damon together with James Cromwell Daniel Studi. The film, written by John Fusco and directed by Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron presents its main character,Spirit, a wild Mustang stallion living free in the Old West of the late 19th century, where he's captured by human horse traders and sold to a cavalry regiment at a frontier outpost. There, a cruel colonel nearly succeeds in breaking the willful horse, but not quite. Spirit escapes in the company of another captive, Little Creek, a Native American youth that tries to possess the magnificent animal by more humane means, but Spirit refuses to bend to human will even when he makes the acquaintance of Little Creek's beautiful and fiercely loyal mare, Rain. After he saves Little Creek's life in an Army raid, Spirit believes that the gravely injured Rain has perished after a tumble over a waterfall. Despondent, the horse is captured again by humans, enslaved this time for work in a pack team on the transcontinental railroad. Undaunted by the tragedies that befall him, Spirit manages to escape for a reunion with Little Creek, Rain, and his long-lost brethren. Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron presents politically-correct themes like anti-slavery but it is a visually stunning film. The story maybe predictable but it will nevertheless allow the viewer to be satisfied with this film.The animation is also great and the characters involved are smart and far from annoying.Overall,Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron will be enjoyed by kids and adults alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An animated movie that conveys the feeling of freedom brilliantly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" is a story about a wild horse who is determined to getting his freedom back, while befriending a young man and a lovely mare along the way.Let me start this off by saying that "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" is not your usual children cartoon movie. Though animated, the horses don't talk. That significant detail was a welcome change from all the other animated movies where animals of all kind exchange witty banter and so on and so forth.The soundtrack was beautiful. It fit in with all the scenes and was a wonderful substitute for the lack of dialogue. They really helped express the longing of freedom that Spirit wanted. Although none of the songs are really a masterpiece, there are about 2-3 songs that are still stuck in my head.Even if speech was limited, the movie managed to convey so many emotions. This movie is definitely on my list of top 10 animated films that managed to make me feel so many things. It made me feel sad in some parts and I genuinely gave out a laugh in about 3 or 4 scenes. And that's saying something since I went into the movie, expecting this to be a flop.This was a great animated movie that talks about freedom. It's actually a pretty simple movie, if you look at it. But that still doesn't stop that uplifting emotion that people will generally feel after watching this.Viewed on: April 28, 2011</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night, I rented this movie and I really was amazed by it,and it was one of the coolest animated films that I have seen. A horse named Spirit, is taken prisoner by the U.S. Army and is befriended by another prisoner,a young indian but Spirit has his own fear, he dosent depict between white &amp; indian,he has a prejudice against all humans who he calls two legs.The young Indian who is very acrobatic collaborates a jail break with Spirit and their off.Being pursued all over the forest &amp; badlands,it looked very cartonish or like a video game, but it is very adventurous.I like the scene at the end when the George Custer looking officer seems to tip his hat off as a sign of respect for both of them.The computer animation was good to,the way that the animals looked, and the forest and trees ,the mountains,the red rocks,and not mention the pure sky blue water in the river.The music was also good and I especially liked that Bryan Adams song,I might rush out and get that CDOne last note:For those of you that are upset about the white man being portrayed as evil just keep in mind that in the 50's &amp; 60's the western movies portrayed the indians as evil.So why don't all you idiots just SHUT UP AND GET A LIFE !!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an era of CGI silliness and major 'live-action' blockbusters being almost fully digital with actors just peppered in, it's refreshing to see a film come down the pike that seems to have some respect for the time-honored animation tradition of, you know, actually _drawing_ something.The Good:1.) The characters were enjoyable, especially our lead. . .er. . .equine. I got a strong feeling for each and every personality in the film, which is saying something considering the lack of dialogue. Speaking of. ..2.) The bravery of the filmmakers to tell their story visually. Man, the urge must have been _huge_ to divert from their chosen course and just let the animals talk to each other. The audience expects it thanks to years of Disney formula, and no one would have thought twice about it. But it would have ruined this film. So, kudos to them.3.) The animation and scenery. All impeccable. You really got a sense of the landscape and the importance of it in the grand scheme of the film. In a movie that glorifies the west, the countryside needs to be almost a character unto itself. I think that was achieved in this movie, Generic Western Waterfall(tm) notwithstanding.4.) *SPOILERSPOILERSPOILER* The a-typical resolution with the US officer. Nice to see the movie didn't revert to the easy "all American officers were completely evil" line. It didn't _really_ seem to be in-character for the guy, but it was so refreshing that I forgave it.The Bad:1.) The music. And oh, how bad it was. Every single time, EVERY TIME, Brian Adams kicked in, I was dragged away from the movie. I can't even explain why. I mean, Phil Collins in Tarzan didn't bug me, and that was in a jungle at the turn of the century for crying out loud. But I laughed out loud every time those rotten chords kicked in. I was embarrassed for the filmmakers when the horse-breaking scene was accompanied by "Get Off of my Back." I understand that, without dialogue, they needed the music to break the monotony of horse neighing, and also to move the plot along, but they could have chosen MUCH better selections and/or performers. A Canadian pop 'star' doesn't strike me as old west material.2.) The CGI animation. As beautiful as the standard animation was (digitally animated or not), every time they added something with CG, it looked horrific. The US troops that populated the background of most action scenes and crowd shots were so blocky that they reminded me of the music video in 'UHF'. And don't even get me STARTED on the train scene. That thing was so jumpy I thought the film was going to break.3.) Did I mention the music? I can't stress enough that it is really, _really_, bad.Overall: Great effort. Could have been a lot worse ('Pocohantas' roars to mind). If it weren't for the logistical miscues with the CGI and music, I would have rated this much higher. All in all, though, I give the filmmakers a _lot_ of credit for not taking 'Spirit' lightly and trying to honestly make an ambitious movie. When someone actually tries to appeal to the highest common denominator in a 'kid's movie', they get a positive mark from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie once, but twice and I'd go back again! I have never felt this strongly about a movie since I was a kid. This story, the music, everything touches that little piece in all of us that are wild and free. If you see anything this year, see "Spirit", you will not be disappointed. "Spirit" has a silent main cast -- the main characters (except the humans) don't talk! This is a novel idea! Dreamworks has outdone themselves on this picture. From the very first note at the opening screen, you will be hooked. I know I was! And I hope they continue the story and that other animated movies will follow in "Spirit"s hoofsteps. The animation was astounding, not like so many animated pictures recently released. The story was plausible and, most importantly, it stays with you. Bravo Dreamworks, bravo. Let the new animation begin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elegantly Fluid Film That Beats Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a striking artistic style and beautiful narrative `Spirit' speeds ahead of recent Disney feature-length animations as elegantly as the film's horses whiz past the bad guys. The DreamWorks studio has crafted a fluid and stunningly beautiful animation with a simple, endearing story of love and freedom. The majestic, sweeping opening and thoughtful narrative is alone worth the admission price.It's a long-awaited and refreshing demonstration of how feature-length animations can be done without inventing a nauseating menagerie of cutesy cartoon characters needed simply to stock toy store shelves. The film succeeds in appealing to all age levels without being self-conscious or pandering according to some Hollywood formula. Having the horses actually not `talk' (al la `Mr. Ed") really give the film a special `class'.If I were Disney's CEO, Michael Einsner, I'd be chagrin. `Spirit' is more `Disneyesque' is the classic tradition, than Disney Studio's own recent lackluster goofy offerings. It's a genuinely charming and lovable film. It's the first animation I'll buy on DVD. Move over Mickey Mouse.</fullReview>

We need to understand them, especially Spirit himself, or there is no point to this film. So, we have as one important element the body language, including facial expressions. These are made more human, for relatability, but at no point do they feel cartoonish or unfitting.Then, there is the score and songs by Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams. Words cannot begin to describe how wonderful these are at bringing across the emotions and thoughts of Spirit. They are consistent in bringing out his character. Although, he displays a vast range of emotions as he goes through his journey, it is always him. It flows seamlessly.One more important element of the narrative was ... the narrator. Not only was a narrator excusable here, but Matt Damon did an excellent job. In this way we are able to hear the voice of Spirit. I personally treasured the opportunity to get to know his character better in this way.Now, in addition to the multi-layered narrative, we have beautiful artwork throughout. The scenic environment, the majestic horses, the humans and their settlements were all excellent, excellent works. The characters of all are also very well written and voiced. I especially enjoyed Little Creek, and the little girl, as I'm sure many have and will.If you haven't watched this one yet, whether or not you have children, pick it up. Go ahead and buy it.********This is where the spoiler is.*********(The only caution I'd give is that there are some scenes where Spirit was captured and he tries, successfully, to escape that may be frightening for some very young viewers.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie for all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just browsed down some comments of random people who just gave this movie a bad number. There i find a comment about that this movie was all bad for the white mans name. You should then think about what really happened that time, because it is possible that this is based on the truth.In the history lines, there are black spots with awful things. And most movie's never tell anything about that, or just lie. but this movie doesn't! and that is just what is cool about the movie, not just lies about what would be great if happened, but things based on real history.Besides that, the graphics are really great for a Disney movie, and the music is well chosen. The music is also well-fitting with the storyline. The storyline was easy to follow, and is expressed at his best. It would be great to see the movie in a movie theater, but i watched the DVD.when you really like animals, should sure watch this movie. After all, if you hate horses, and watch a movie with a horse on the cover, and THEN complain about the movie, you should consider what you are doing.This is my first comment for a movie, and i think this was the best to express my comment without spoilers. besides that, i watched the movie just 15 minutes ago. After all, i think you have to say the reason why u like a movie, and not just something like "it was great".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm 16 and still love this movie! No matter how many times I watch it - I always seem to enjoy it. It is one of few where the narrator is actually the animal - instead of having the animals actually talk. This makes it more believable, and as a horse lover it's nice to see a movie where we are seeing it from their point of view. It helps us understand how they felt when they were brought in for breaking. It must of taken a lot of work and for that I thank the cast and crew members including the film writers for all the work they put into it. One more thing - The quality of the movie is excellent even if there may be mistakes, too tell you the truth I didn't notice them until they were pointed out on here. And I believe that we should learn a quality lesson from this movie, that no matter where we are and how hard the situation may be you have to keep going - because out there somewhere someone loves you and needs you. Thank you.</fullReview>

There should be the place, where the beauty and nature could rise on its own and grow up to become more beautiful. And that could only be happen when humanity will stay away from it and will give nature to go on there own way.This is a very-very emotional story and I hope that you could feel the same pleasure, that I feel now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie right after V for Vendetta ( a little late I know), and I can surely tell you that this movie is the non-bloody better version of vendetta, A true valiant fight for freedom resembled by the horse who refuses to be ridden, Strugling to get back to his homeland. Bryan Adams is just astonishing, his sweet voice and correct timing of the songs made me cry like 4 times even though I'm 18. As for the animation, It was tremendously amazing and neat, The natural scenes were drawn by the best artists, Horse animations are so real (Sometimes 3D models are used). Overall, this movie deserves a 15 out of 10 and deserves to be in the top ten. Believe me , you must see this movie immediately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spirit: The Narrating Horse?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is one of those movies that will rip your heart out, stomp on it a little bit, then put it back together with a really cute pink band-aid. I can't honestly say that I know much about how the west was won, because I actually don't live in the USA, so I didn't learn these things in school. But I think the movie, while amusing and heartwarming in it's animated ways, also portrays a fairly accurate image of what life was like back in the old days.Melodic music, accompanied by Canadian singer Bryan Adams, opens the movie, and sets the scene for a great soundtrack. Meadows, mountains and rivers are drawn beautifully, and, let's face it, one can only coo at the antics of a new baby horse. Skip forward a few years, and the baby is the king of his pride, so to speak, and takes it upon himself to scare away the invading settlers. Madness ensues, as do a few changes in landscape and location. Brace yourself for a climactic chase and a dance of triumph as the rat-like bad-guy is put in his place. And if the feel-good ending doesn't make you want to cry at least a little bit, then you may be a tad dead inside. While I believe this film was well done, I can't say it's even remotely close to a 'great' children's film. If the kid loves horses, the kid will probably love the movie, if only because there are pretty ponies in it. But the fact that the entire movie is narrated, and that the horses only whinny, and don't talk, means that the already minute attention span on an average kid will not stand up to the trials of a movie where the animals don't talk. This film is definitely made for the older kids to appreciate. And even then, it's got to be an older kid with a love of horses ... or settlers with muskets ... that will truly be able to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who runs as fast as the wind, is as strong as the Sun, and is as wild as the place he calls home? Of course it's Spirit. That's what it said in every trailer I watched.The movie is about a stallion that got captured by U.S. expansionist soldiers. Spirit wanted to free all the horses that were captured by those people. The people made Spirit stay in the Utah sun surrounded by fences for three days without drinking and eating. They did that so the stallion would get weak and could be broken. This movie was quite touching... and funny in some parts. But of course there were bad parts... but I can't think of them for the moment. I think that this movie is suitable for horse lovers. Not that I am one... but I just watched it with my best friend two years ago. For this movie you need... cany, popcorn, a drink of water, a soft drink, and a tissue just in case. If you have all that you'll have a good time watching the movie (well at least I did). Since, I've explained everything I give this movie an 8. The things that ruined this movie kinda is that it got a little bit boring sometimes and that Spirit was kinda stupid. But overall it was good. The movie I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As animated films go, this one is one of the better ones. Graphics and animation are top notch; the story is not bad. The movie is remarkable because of the lack of dialogue and use of expressions and mannerisms to tell the story. The plot is, as expected, fairly predictable and two-dimensional, and is almost derailed by being overly sentimental. However, my kids love the movie, and since it was intended for them anyway, who am I to argue its a bad movie. I give it a 7 out of 10; I would have rated it an 8 if not for the superbly annoying songs by Bryan Adams.</fullReview>

But the further the movie went the more I realized that I was actually liking it and then ultimately completely loving it. And there I was, with tears in my eyes out of sympathy for the main characters and worrying whether everything will be all right in the end. How pathetic is that?I really wanted to hate this movie.

		<shortDescription>An 83 minute Bryan Adams music video...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...that was ambitious for its time and succeeds at conveying a good story.When thinking today of movies with little or no talking from the main characters, one thinks of movies like Wally. Visual story-telling is so incredibly rare in cinema these days, that to find similar approaches often takes a step into the past.A movie that instantly impresses with an ambitious blending of 3D CG landscapes with cell animation styles, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron features a cast of characters that predominantly don't speak at all. This may confuse children who are accustomed to anthropomorphism allowing animal characters to talk, but this movie instead features a young-sounding Matt Damon as narrator, with occasional music breaks and beautifully rendered landscapes.It's not all praise-worthy, with some elements of the story being a little comically overdone, but nor is there any major missteps to pull you out of the story.Fans of Bryan Adams and of visual storytelling will enjoy this animated film that was ambitious for its time, and amongst a small selection of movies of its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, this is one of the most unique animated films of all time for one reason. The animals don't talk. With that kind of a concept in a children's animated film, in theory it should have been dead on arrival. And, yet, kind of like a Miyazaki film, it just sort of works.The film just has a sort of charm to it, and the best bit of the film is the animation. This is some of the best 2D animation that has ever been made. Horses do not have very expressive faces, yet they get so much emotions into these animals' eyes that its almost like they are talking. You also get caught up in the landscapes, its a real throwback to the old west, I for one am a fan of large open wild spaces and its always nice to look at if it has been animated well.The film is not completely without dialog, you see the humans communicating from time to time, but its mostly done from the point of view of the horses, which is clever, so you get some useful exposition but never lose focus on who the main characters are. Spirit's thoughts are told by a well read narration by Matt Damon, which is a random choice but well read none the less. The music also speaks, Bryan Adams writes some great songs that are kind of like the Phill Collins songs from Tarzan (1999) and I can see people not liking them, but I liked them fine.I can't find much wrong with the film, it is a little slow and I can imagine kids being bored by the film. Overall, Spirit, is a great film with great characters and stunning animation told in a unique way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible film that has 3 huge flaws that keep it from being relevant or even great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all this film blew me away with it's 2-d majesty and emotions it brought out of me (seriously made me cry at least 4 times legit).The good is everything other than the flaws i will get into. The animation is incredible, the score by Hans Zimmer while sometimes overly epic still sucks you in since the best quality is that the horses don't speak (except for the terrible narration. The plot is also excellent in most respects with the quiet moments being the stronger ones by far.So here we go with why it goes downhill. 1- Bryan Adams. Tarzan and Phil Collins were hugely successful with their film so they though why don't we do the same. In the first 30 minutes there is 4 hard to understand Bryan Adams songs that will test your patience. Although the 2nd act is the best since he doesn't come back for a while. Most painful of all is when the tears are balling out of your eyes from emotion only to be completely broken by aggravating, pandering and completely useless songs. 2- Matt Damon. No wonder he hasn't done much voice acting work since. In this film he narrates from the perspective of the main horse and by god does he sound bored. Never in the hole film does he change his monotone and emotion-less narration. The words are there and emotions are being alluded to but again with no conviction, it's pretty baffling.3- The return of a character who should have never come back. It completely ruins one of the best moments in the film by completely negating it without reason or sense.I watched Dumbo with this and seriously they would be equals if it weren't for the blatant flaws that just get in the way of an actual fantastic film. So if you love animation you have to watch this but just know you will be as mad as you will be sad (in a good way).This was a green review</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stirring Gallop!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long time ago, before the age of capitalism, the American West used to be a beautiful place where Indians, buffalo herds, and wild stallions roamed free and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron tells that story effectively. As a 2002 release, the animation is gorgeous and it captures the "old-style" images of the West. The score by Hans Zimmer, which was backed up by stirring music from Bryan Adams, was a major force driving the film. This is one of those G-rated films that both adults and children will enjoy, although the parents may not agree about the political correctness of the film.This film introduces us to the stallion Spirit who is a wild and free horse. But when he is captured by the US Army, Spirit refuses to be broken. So along with the help of a fellow captured Native and his mare, Spirit inches his way back to freedom and his family.The film does not rely upon voice acting to tell its story. That being said the film was able to garner up some talent in the voices of Matt Damon and James Cromwell. They did a good job with their roles. However the story relies upon the music and the physical emotions of the horses. For these kind of stories, it's nice that we have no barnyard talk or talking horses for that matter.Overall, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron was an incredible film with beautiful, realistic animation and a story that is simple, but very engaging. The music is a huge strength and it's an unusual way of telling a story, but it was very effective. As an early DreamWorks film, it makes for a very good watch, better than I thought. A good family film! I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MasterpieceYes, just like this I and I consider. This animated cartoon is a masterpiece. One of the best drawn animated cartoons!It is history of life of young stallion. History about that, how he was born, as he became the flagman of horse of Cimarron and. as on a carelessness got in the real adventure changing all his life!Magnificent sound tracks, magnificent storyline. All combines perfectly, all is neat ideally. Every detail passes the mood of heroes, and even the same Spirit of freedom unnoticed infused with and in an audience!:) Yes, the animated cartoon is able to compel to cry, because to cry actually I am from what. But these tears will be not sorrowful, and by some lungs and clean. A separate plus is this absence of "talking" animals. People talk in the animated cartoon only, but the pronounced IDEAS of horse - it quite the small. This reception allows fully to submerge in a narration.Stylistically all, again, is built absolutely correctly. Interesting beginning, dynamic development, logical end.</fullReview>

When the colonel fails to break him, he is about to shoot Spirit. A captive Lakota brave Little Creek escapes the fort riding Spirit taking him back to his village. The colonel attacks the village, and Spirit is taken away to work on the railroad.It's a nice little cartoon. The animation is more classic like the hand drawn style. It is earnest with its morality. It doesn't have any modern references. It is very simple. Matt Damon does a narration for the horse's inner monologue. It has a very light touch about it even with its darker more difficult moments. It's not anything outstanding but it works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPIRIT: Stallion of the Cimarron || Instant classic. One of the most beautiful and exciting animated features ever made. Spirit, a horse, befriends a young human and finds true love. The horse Spirit forms a remarkable friendship with a strong Lakota brave from northeastern New Mexico. Across the majestic wilderness of the American frontier, SPIRIT is an action packed quest against impossible odds. Lakota must save his homeland with Spirit. Spiritual movies about horses are inspiring to the families of the world. Spirit is born into a new world. Spirit is born to be a leader with honour and responsibility. Other hoses will follow. We have written and accepted a script for a new cinematic classic inspired by a horse, Amigo. Amigo is a black racehorse with a white diamond patch naturally grown on his forehead. He is known first for the white diamond? and then as Amigo the R1 racehorse. Diamond Head! Diamond Light! Diamond Heart! Diamond Fight! Look to cheer for Amigo in Theatres soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs a sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Urg! It has wonderful music and I love it but it makes me so sad because there isn't a sequel T.T It had a narrative instead of cheesy talking horses, the animation was good, the message was good, I still don't have 10 lines but I really want to post this because I want a sequel and must share it with the world! Dream works should totally make another one, I think it is about Rain and Spirit have a baby who gets separated and is the last wild horse but then it finds its parents ^.^ isn't that just adorable! I heard rumors about 2016 but hey before that they said 2010 so I'm like what but I really want it to come out!there is only one picture and its of Rain and her baby sitting under a tree :) I can't find any other :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No celebrities, no side-characters, no meta-humor, no gimmicks, and no pop-culture driven schtick; have I turned you off?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is arguably the most beautiful of Dreamworks animated films. Of course, we're talking post-CGI era, when animation still had an imperfect quality about it. Prior to that, however, to see something like Spirit, when competitors like Pixar were gaining momentum on the style and substance of a story an animated film could bear, is truly a wonderful experience. Aside from a narration by Matt Damon, there is no dialog in Spirit and much of the events are told through facial expressions on the horse or through the bombastic, but ultimately, touching score.The story is small, focusing on a horse named Spirit in the early American West, who goes from being small and fragile, to bold and dashing in almost no time. However, his consuming curiosity always seems to get the best of him, and because of that, he finds himself often in serious trouble. He ventures out of normal horse-bounds into a US cavalry post, where he is kidnapped by the army (currently involved in the Indian Wars) to be used as a slave for the men. He meets a young Native American man named Little Creek, also taken captive, and the two try and escape and find freedom together.The talking animal clich in movies has run its course, but can still be done right with the proper writing and the proper amount of creativity. Spirit, on the other hand, doesn't need to worry about that, for it functions supremely on the fact that its story isn't burdened by silly side characters or half-baked incidents of arguments or fights. It's hard to believe how much is minimized when the characters are deprived of actual dialog, and this isn't necessarily a bad thing as you may think. It allows for a smoother, more uninterrupted pace, and truly shows a talent on the writer's part (John Fusco, respectively).It's been revealed that the animation for the film was done using a mixture of hand-drawn animation and computer animation to create what is informally called "transdigital animation." Personally, it's a shame this technique became outdated before it even became somewhat recognized as a legitimate way to conduct animation. This looks much more beautiful than several of the CGI pictures I've seen recently, and its story is a bit more engaging, too. Notice how I say "a bit more engaging." Unfortunately, it's a shame to note that while Spirit may feature some of the most beautiful visuals this side of the wild west, it features a story that feels outgunned and kind of bland. The encompassing themes of breaking the shackles that bind you and achieving freedom and a stronger feeling of self-worth are very important and should be recognized by children and adults all around. If only they were injected into a story a bit more concerned with progression rather than emotional manipulation with its sometimes heavy-handed score.However, the score can be used to great effect, as in the opening shots showcasing the mountainous terrain and the beautiful landscapes. Also consider the scene when Spirit is frantically galloping away from a runaway train-car that was just let loose by a number of slave-horses he miraculously freed. The train-car, upon being let loose, slides downhill into the small US army base, crushing everything in its path, obliterating small shacks, and other train-cars as well. The scene is suspenseful, breathtaking, and a tremendous use of animation. It's the kind of scene that claymation wouldn't have done justice too, hand-drawn animation would've made it a bit too much of a cartoon, and present-day CGI animation would've made look too polished.Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is an experience more-so than it was a gamble. Dreamworks already established a solid name with strong winners like Antz and Shrek that Spirit seemed like an ideal pursuit to further subvert the animated genre with beautiful visuals and a strong moral. The film excels in many departments, flounders in few, and is only assisted by the terrific direction of Kelly Asbury (who has her name on films from both Dreamworks and Pixar in various departments) and Lorna Cook. It's one of the few animated films that is under eighty minutes in length that I haven't equated to fast food.Narrated by: Matt Damon. Directed by: Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favourites! Honestly it was because of Bryan Adams songs that I initially watched Spirit in the first place but when I did it was one of the most enjoyable ones apart from Shrek and Lion King that I have ever seen. My little one loves it to bits. She cant get off TV when I play the DVD every single time. In fact Brave and Spirit are the only two cartoons she loves to watch. She loves the songs specially Get off My Back and Here I Am. I loved the part where Spirit gets caught in the end and then musters all his strength to escape and finally the General lets him go. It is a fantastic journey through the eyes of someone who never gives up. Come on Hollywood we need more movies like these!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Dreamworks flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spirit:Stallion of the Cimarron is one of the lesser known films in Dreamworks' list. It tells the story of Spirit, a young and strong horse and his quest to find and lead his herd, all set in the time of the westward expansion. Beneath its rather mature themes like taming of the west and treatment of Native American tribes, it is more of a coming of age film. The fact that no animals speak in the movie(although spirit narrates the story) is a nice touch. Though its narrative is rather shallow(it is still a kids movie, sort of) and the songs are average, I enjoyed it but kind of understood why it was so off the radar when other Dreamworks films are regarded more highly. Still it is a decent one, if not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spirit was one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. If only movies today were as amazing as this one. The animation is stunning and the music is gorgeous and moving. The story is captivating and emotional, and the characters are well developed and lovable. Spirit's longing for his family and true courage is touching. His full out determination to escape and return home has you sympathizing with him and encouraging him throughout his entire journey. I recommend this movie for any and all ages, as it would touch anyone's heart who truly understood what the true spirit of the west is. This is definitely a keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It looks like a bottle of water half full but that is wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My summary might look incredibly strange, I know. However, that was the only thing it came through my mind when I decided to tell someone about this film. SPIRIT looks like a bottle of water half full: the animals don't talk, don't sing, the dialogs are rare and sometimes we feel the film never starts. However, that half-water-in-the-bottle left is exactly what we need to love this feature: what matters is the message behind all the beautiful images: the importance of being FREE. Also, the comparison between Spirit and the Native American is beautifully done: they are both free spirits and no one can tame them.This is, in my humble opinion, an underrated movie. Show it to your kids, let them figure what FREE means and you could just sit with them and be enchanted as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spirit, Stallion of the Cimarron" is a beautiful, classic animation. The colors are really good, so is the soundtrack.However, this movie's storyline is very predictable and that is the only weakness of this film.Also, I am really happy a sequel didn't come out - continuations usually just destroy the atmosphere of the original movies.I really love it how the horses don't talk like humans; they just neigh. This adds even more beautiful climate to the animation. If the horses would speak, this would've ruined the magic the animation has.This is definitely one of my favorite Dream Works film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love This Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it was released on DVD, as I missed the opportunity to see it in the cinema. I really wish I had been able to, because TV does not do the amazing soundtrack or visuals justice.This was my favourite movie when I was 9 years old, and is one of my favourite animated films ever! I love how the emotion of the characters is easy to read, despite the fact that none of the animals talk (unlike almost every Disney film released to date!) The voice-over by Matt Damon can be a little annoying at times, but at others makes the film that little bit better.The plot may not be all that strong, but it is an enjoyable film all the same, combining adventure and romance together perfectly. The characters are likable and superbly animated. The opening 10 minutes of the film are incredible, with a fantastic 3 minute unbroken shot of the animals and landscape of the wild west, and the movie just gets better from there! There are some genuine laughs in the film, as well as scenes that will make you reach for a tissue! I have also read a lot of reviews that complain about the number of Bryan Adams songs in the film. My advice: ignore them. Bryan's songs are amazing and help to express the emotions that Spirit is experiencing at any given time in the movie. The score is also incredible, which was pretty much a given with Hans Zimmer at the helm. The soundtrack remains one of my favourite to date, despite me being in my late teens! It is also responsible for introducing me to the amazing songs of Bryan Adams, of whom I have been a fan of ever since I saw this movie! I would thoroughly recommend this movie to all horse lovers, people looking for a good movie, and parents looking to keep their kids entertained for an hour or two!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel a little guilty at not liking this film more.The animation is fine, the look of the film is a pleasing cross between traditional hand-drawn and modern 3D CGI, characterisation is good, the story is full of excitement and emotion, and the music is excellent (I wasn't so keen on Bryan Adams' songs, but I could see why they were there). And Matt Damon's narration was fine, although it wasn't immediately clear that it was first person and not third person.The absence of dialogue was absolutely fine - it was easy to follow what happened, and the mild anthropomorphising of the horses' faces was sufficient to allow human emotions to be communicated to the audience.So I'm not quite sure why, after it was finished, I ended up feeling somewhat indifferent. I think in the end, it may have been that it all felt a little bit inconsequential.The film's title is clumsy and should have been more carefully considered.I must say, though, that I am looking forward to seeing my 4 year old horse-mad niece's reaction to it.</fullReview>

I dislike Bryan Adams (he's the male Celine) but he's used well here.The two songs "Here I Am" and "Don't Let Go" are very very good pop pieces worthy of a normal album.The female singer in "Don't Let Go" is very good indeed... she sounds like Sarah McLaughlin with some Enya in there too.And Matt Damon is pretty decent in this too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as it is this movie annoys me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(These are my thoughts after seeing Spirit in the movies right after it was released) This movie annoys me.Okay let me back up---TWO AND HALF STARS-moments of it are much better.I liked it.Understand that? I like the film. Where was I? Oh yea, annoyed me.Why does this movie exist? Its too long by a half an hour, mostly because its so leisurely. This is a YA book done by Cliff Notes. It got the feel of a Scholastic book brought to life.Not that its bad, it just is so bland.There are great sequences, some of the fort sequence, a lot of the Indian village stuff is all quite good. What has me snackered is that this should have been better. It should have been tighter. Say what you will about Disney films , they would not have made such a rambling film. I am a vocal critic of Disney and its product but I know, in my heart that this wouldn't have been as loose as it is if Disney had done it. Of course we would have had to suffer through talking horses but thats not the point there would have been more meat to this. Why I find it truly bothersome is that because its so loose I found the film much more bitter sweet than its meant to be simply because I could fill in the history of what happens and how things were pointless, the railroad was built, the horses were rounded up and the Indians died, despite the happy ending of the film. I shouldn't have had time to think about that.What also irks me is the mix of computer and regular animation. They spent how much on this and its painfully obvious what is what.It wouldn't have been bad if say they computer stuff had been allowed to be seen as computer animation when it came to humans, or the railway camp (which except for the train wreck, works) but its not and I was was watching the melding of the two styles while shaking my head. A lot of it remind me of the truly awful hell sequence from the live action Spawn.Couldn't They have paid someone from Japan to come and sort it out. I mean you were stealing shots from things like 'Night on the Galactic Railway' or 'Spring and Chaos' for the train sequences anyway. (and don't tell me its not stolen and that you can only do it so many way, baloney, they borrowed.) Whats worse, is that other than making money I see no point to this movie having been made. None. Zippo. Nada. I don't say that about many movies even when I despise them but to me this is a completely pointless movie from top to bottom. Its at best a 45 minute story stretched to almost 90 minutes. And while it doesn't lag,I wished that something unpredictable and truly exciting had occurred for more than thirty seconds at a pop.I do have to say that this is a wonderful proof that you don't need talking animals to have a good movie. (I said I liked it ,I just want BETTER) The melding of music and image to tell the story is wonderful and I think its the music that makes several of the soaring moments, even if at times even that is a bit clunky. You also have to give points to a movie that begins with the birth of a horse, tastefully done on screen. Disney would have had kittens with that.Forgive me for ripping the movie apart, but it should have been better than good. There are flashes of great here and they deserve a better frame than this. Truthfully if Disney and Dreamworks had done this together it would have been better---assuming that they could have both used their strengths.See it at some point, you'll like it, and you'll probably be annoyed it isn't better.You know what it is, I wanted a movie I would remember and not one that slips from memory as one is writing a review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an okay animated movie made by Dreamworks Pictures and possibly their finest animated movie ever. Too bad that they have let themselves ruin, making awful animated movies such as "Madagascar", for example."Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron" is a good alternative to the Disney classics. It is considered one of the most ambitious animated movies ever made. Perhaps not as good as the good old Disney classics, but way better than most CGI creations.But this movie has also characteristics of its own. For one thing, the horses don't talk. Instead, they communicate through their own sounds. Despite this, we know how they feel and what they think because Spirit has a narrator (in this case, a brilliant job by Matt Damon). The soundtrack is entirely performed by Bryan Adams and it also serves to express the horses's feelings and thoughts. The soundtrack also happens to be beautiful. The finest song here is "Here I Am".Visually this movie resembles a bit Disney's "Pocahontas", with its new techniques. The result is good and very natural, although I still rather the old-fashioned drawn by hand style.Spirit (a Mustang wild horse) is beautiful, brave, intelligent, funny, wild and indomitable by nature. During the whole movie he expresses the hero inside him and during his adventure he befriends with a Lakota Indian and falls in love with a mare beautifully named Rain.This movie is full of adventure, danger, humor, good backgrounds, beautiful songs, great characters and an entertaining story.I don't have major things to criticize about this movie. Apart some minor things, my big critic goes to the Colonel and his men's chases towards the horses (which are a little too much). Even at the end they're still chasing them!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You really need to be a horse lover to enjoy this film as much as my roommate and myself did. As one can see by the other reviews people either like it or are 'eh, it was okay'. Horse lovers will love the film regardless of a few of the nitpicky problems here and there. While it is a kids movie it has some rather adult things going on. One scene has the U.S. Calvary galloping down on a group of Indians, guns blazing etc.People who are only going to see some spectacular over the top animation will be disappointed. The mix if 2d and 3d is fairly obvious to the trained eye, but done well enough. The animation is overall quite good. The story is good enough for our hero as well. This film is not groundbreaking in anyway, something I think people just expect form every animated movie these days. People who say it was boring etc must just one of those 'interesting' people we like to raise our eyebrows at. More than once the entire audience cheered at our theater.In short, I loved it..my roommate and I were crying like little girls (not because of any sad ending..as happy an ending as one could want, and of course we are both horse fanatics.)Hurrah for Mr. Katzenberg ( The driving force behind getting the movie made ) !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, many people are saying that the music is awful in this movie... Well even to this day the music doesn't annoy me and it fits the scenes perfectly. The creators use the best music for the perfect moments and it just makes the movie more inspirational and intense.It isn't some dumb old Disney movie. It is inspirational. I love this horse Spirit. I have been watching this movie for as long as it's been out. Me and my cousin love this movie!!! It is about a horse (Spirit) that takes place of his Dad. Some people "settle" on his land and he goes to check it out. From then on Spirit goes through an ah-mazing adventure that is just breath taking: Finds Rain ("love of his life"), Meets Little Creek (The Indian), Beats the odds, and wins back his freedom together with Little Creek. There is just SO much more that you have to see to believe.Sometimes when I watch this movie, I just get so tense and I just LOVE it. I sing a long to every song and know every word that Spirit says.The characters are portrayed beautifully. The horses are beautiful and the people have good graphics. The scenery is amazing and you can tell that the creators put a lot of effort into making this moving #1. And it is my all-time favorite movie.Sometimes the animators make mistakes. But you don't really notice them. I didn't notice any of the mistakes (10 years) until I came on this site and looked at all the "Did You Know?" comments.Definitely a movie for horse lovers, kids...people of ALL ages.

		<fullReview>I am giving this movie 3 stars due to some good animation in parts otherwise it would have been 1 star only i am afraid to say.The movie overall is poor and very tedious to watch.This is mainly due to the terrible sound-track. Which starts off trying to be too epic (and takes itself too seriously for a cartoon in my opinion) and goes downhill from there.There are many times I am angry thinking please just shut up that annoying music and let me just hear the sound effects and even the occasional talking of characters which does not happen enough.There is too much emphasis on the horse and not enough on the people - fair enough nothing is more annoying than a talking horse but then again donkey was cool in Shrek ha ha.They have tried to be too PC in portrayal of big bad white man and too much honour to natives and animals.Matt Damon is damn cool normally but even he did not improve this movie by being the occasional narrator or voice of the horse.Mostly this was mis-timed not by Damon but by whomever decided when and where the voice comes in.As i say the animation is not bad at all in parts in fact good and so is the scenery.Its just the constant dreamy soft rock concert music i think its Bryan Adams (who i normally like by the way). The way this is blended together is actually good for making you feel annoyed and bored and is such a shame for with this quality of animation the whole thing could have been so much better.I would have personally wanted much much more for my 80 million dollars budget if i was financing this movie - i mean i feel short changed after getting this DVD for 3 pounds at my local supermarket.They say never work with animals or children but when you have total control over all your characters being an animation i am afraid there is absolutely no excuses here. The quality of the animation is not the fault just what they did with it.See it for yourself to make your own opinion by all means but i would not advise you to spend much money in case you feel the same as i do now. Ripped off and disappointed .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a Great Animated Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My daughter's favorite animal is a horse. My daughter has seen spirit at least 25 times in 4 years. Although, my husband and I roll our eyes when she puts it on, we thoroughly enjoy this movie. It is very well done. We enjoy the interaction between all the characters. We enjoy the plight of the Spirit, Little Creek and yes, even the Colonel. Everyone was just trying to do what they needed to do. I highly recommend for children and adults alike. The kids enjoy the colors, the vivid images the horses and the adults enjoy the storyline. The soundtrack is awesome, Bryan Adams did a wonderful job with the songs. They are great songs even to hear on their own. I'm not sure why Spirit did not win the Oscar, maybe it couldn't compete with Disney or Pixar, but it should have. My daughters favorite part of the movie is the ending, of course, my favorite part is the friendship that develops between Spirit and Little Creek, plus the romance, plus the corral scene, plus the buffaloes, etc...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film, but also one that could be improved drastically.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into the film with high expectations, especially as TV Week called it, "More moving than The Lion King". I'll start by saying this film has very complex animation, awful, inappropriate music, and hardly any dialogue.This film doesn't develop the characters straight away, it does that over the course of the film. The characters are quite good; they're likable and actually have depth - so much so that I was actually saying "No!" when something bad was about to happen to them.It's quite a serious film, too. It's not necessarily a kids' movie at all, which is what most people would associate it as. It didn't have a silly little love story to ruin it - it's one that most people of all ages will enjoy; although there's little to no humour to be found at all. But you know what, this is one of the few instances where the movie's actually better without humour.The only negative things about it are the music, and the sudden plot turns. Firstly, the music. Oh dear, what on earth were they thinking? Absolutely awful, awful music that ruins the feel of every scene it represents.Secondly, it can be a bit unbelievable; and not in a good way. Especially at the end, where the men are chasing and trying to kill the horse and the Indian, and all of a sudden, the horse defies science and gravity by jumping to the other side of two separate cliffs. Then all is forgiven and they suddenly "win back the land" as if they actually did something notable.While it's certainly not perfect on many levels and for many reasons - it can't even compare to how moving The Lion King was, TV Week; I praise this film for being different to most other animated films - which doesn't mean it's better, but means there's something different to watch amongst all the animated films being released nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie complains wonderful scenes of the animal's life as well as good songs by the incredible Bryan Adams. The movie descirbes the life of a horse that gets captured, brokes out and falls in love. Bryan Adams' voice makes the movie much more emotional than it actually is. During this movie you'll be supposed to feel with the horse and you'll see the world like it is in another view. In the view of the horses we used to use for hard work. Although the horse doesn't speak, accept some rare comments from the horse by Matt Damon. Just like Bryan Adams said in an interview- you can try to ride the horse you won't manage it and you gonna end up in the dark. Great movie for kids and adults at every age. There's also a CD which you can buy in the stores.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has one thing good about it, the animals don't talk and thank god for that. However, there is enough neighing to drive anyone crazy. It also seems that marrying computer graphics and cell animation is not always a recipe for success. The film does occasionally provide some light hearted moments and few good action sequences ,but nothing lingers, nothing makes you want to see it again, assuming you have had the patience to see it all.As animated films go these days, this is no Lion King. It is good for a younger audience but will make a more discerning viewer yawn and yawn and yawn. As of the music scores, let's just say that the grinding noise of my rusty Lawn mower will be more soothing than listening to Brian Adams' Ballads which unfortunately happen every five minutes during the film.....</fullReview>

At home, I opened it and didn't pay much attention at the beginning. However, by the times the story went on, I could not go far away from my computer. If you tried to see(read) between the lines of this movie, you would probably notice that this movie could cheer up your days. Bad people might not be as bad as you see but they did their duties.Morever, the graphic might not as good as SHREK or FINAL FANTASY, but the drawings are really good at expressing the characters' feelings. You don't really have to understand the horse language, but surprisingly you will understand it from their actings or face expression.7/10 from me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron' (2002)`Spirit?' is the newest animated film from Dreamworks, who brought us the refreshingly reassuring `The Prince of Egypt,' and the forgettable `The Road to El Dorado.' Much like `The Road?' `Spirit?' is very average and nothing memorable.It is the tale of Spirit, a stallion (never would have guessed!) who is captured by the savage white man. But, of course, the Indians, or `Native Americans' understand the horse, and capture it back from the evil white man to teach it to be free (?).`Spirit?' has to be one of the most politically correct animated films that I have ever seen. It portrays whites as savage animals and Indians as caring protectors.OK, I understand that whites did some bad things a few hundred years ago. It's in human nature. But to portray whites the way they are in `Spirit?' is like portraying whites of the revolution as a bunch of ruthless Adolf Hitlers. The leader of the explorers is a gruff man who has no care for any of nature's gifts. He leads a gang of explorers as, if not more, vicious than he himself. That's what gets me about `Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron.'I now understand why the British hate `The Patriot' so much and Germans hate films like `Schindler's List.' It's hard to face facts about your descendants. The thing is, the Germans in `Schindler's List' were very brutal; but what they did is mostly true. The British commander in `The Patriot' might have been overplayed, but they didn't portray ALL the British as barbarians, just that one. In `Spirit?' all the white men are portrayed as barbarians. That's what is so appalling about the film.Apart from that minor detail, the film is decent. It is definitely nothing special, and just an average, emotionally-controlling drama, but it's not awful. It's worth a peek.Matt Damon narrates the film, from the perspective of Spirit the Stallion. I like that they didn't give Spirit an actual voice to interact with the other horses. It seems more realistic to have it narrated by an animal, like in `Black Beauty.' Animals talking to each other loses any aspect of?I don't know, reality? I know it's an animated film, but when an animated film is presented realistically in all other aspects and then they throw in talking animals?it works in some movies, let's put it that way (`Bambi').All in all, `Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron' is just average entertainment that I recommend for a one time viewing. It'll entertain the kids, at least.3/5 stars ?John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually I'd much rather have wanted to see Lilo and Stitch, but then my best friend dragged me to this movie with her litle sister because we couldn't convince the 6 year old to resist the "movie with horses". After I all, I found it to be much more than just a movie with or about horses and I was glad that I had gotten to see it. Not only is it beautifully animated and made me miss the states very much, it also tells a story very touching and exciting at times. I haven't that much completely fallen into a movie since I was very young. I forgot everything around me, I cried, I laughed, and just didn't care about what anyone might think of me. I also found Bryan Adams' songs very fitting and supporting to the movie's athmosphere. But as I already mentioned, if there were just those landscapes and nothing else I would have enjoyed it already. Very recommendable, especially for teenagers with younger siblings - guys, take them to the movie's sometime. They really anjoy being with the "old" kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is post-90's-Disney animation at it's best. After Disney's musicals started faltering, they abandoned them, and so did Dreamworks. The music is still there, but it's in the background. Except in this specific movie, it's ends up as the main voice, especially since Matt Damon just doesn't work as the horse's voice, and thankfully doesn't say too much. The true narrator of the story is Bryan Adams, and his songs do a much better job. This is combined with some the modern sort of animation seen in Titan A.E. and Atlantis to narrate a plot that works, and works well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute, if not moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a media student, one is usually forced to look upon movies such as this with the right degree of disdain, though as someone that has an interest in computer animation I saw the film to witness the amalgamation of drawn animation with CGI. Looking past this, however, I saw that there was a quite a viewable story.To get things straight, this is obviously not a film based on reality. Horses are not known for their sentience, but surely this is not grounds to write off any film that crosses into anthropomorphic error? So why review it as documentary? However much this film may seem to be about 'herd loyalty' and 'animal instinct', do not be fooled; this piece says an awful lot about what we are as humans, and the ways that we do not give animals their due. There are several scenes where we can see cruelty and the usual human tendency to believe we are superior and therefore above caring.The story is nothing knew, that has to be said, but it has taken this 'Dances With Wolves' scenario (I compare the the films in the loosest possible sense, the idea of fish out of water and divided loyalty) into a different light, the film says, 'The say the history of the West was written from the saddle of a horse, but it's never been told from the heart of one. Not until now'.Through the combination of breathtaking animation, an extremely well composed Gladiator'esque soundtrack and a moving story, this film is a good one. I would recommend this film to most audiences, though it may not fit as a beginning to a 'Lads night out', but rather more to a relaxing evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I had wanted to se this film since the first time I watched the trailer, I was in for a deep surprise with this film. While some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too ?cartoonish,' the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience. Instead of the feel-good-happy-story, this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting, but also disturbing. Most kids won't understand some of the darker moments in the film, which makes this film rather watchable for adults. I was also impressed with the cinematography, using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts. The musical score was once again solid, proving Hans Zimmer is the go-to guy when it comes to animated scores, and I never thought I would say I actually enjoyed Brian Adams' music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love horses and admire hand drawn animation, so I expected nothing short of amazement from Dreamworks new animated picture Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron. I guess you could say I was a little bit disappointed. You have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story. A story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature. The animals don't sing cute songs or even talk -- a major plus. Sadly, the film has an uncalled for narration by Matt Damon; a sappy soundtrack by Bryan Adams; and enough action scenes to compare it to a Jerry Bruckheimer production. If the film makers would have just stayed with simplicity, we'd have a masterpiece here. This is not a great film, but it is good entertainment for small children. I would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that isn't offensive to small children. Not bad, but could have been much better. Very pretty visuals though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Good Common Horse Sense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good-looking animated feature that tries to cover its lack of material with sometimes irritating narration and a soundtrack that does not always go with the production. A stallion in the old west grows up quickly and then is immediately captured by Union soldiers who are determined to break him. Naturally he has other ideas though as he dodges the U.S. Army, befriends a mare and does create a lasting friendship with a Native American. Through it all though the only real goal is to get back to his mother and the horses he was taken from. "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" is a great-looking movie, but the animation is beginning to get in the way of story-telling in Hollywood these days. It is hard to feel a connection with the characters at times and this is when there is a problem with the writing. The film-makers also make the movie too long. Even though the production only runs about 83 minutes, it could have been cut even further. Matt Damon and James Cromwell are among those who lend their voices to the characters. A 2002 Best Animated Feature Oscar nominee. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual treat for the eyes, chewing gum for the brain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a biography of a horse named "Spirit." We watch him from the time he's born, until he takes leadership over of a heard of wild horses. The area these horses roam seems to be the entire western half of the United States, from Arizona to the Pacific Northwest. Spirit and his extended family greatly enjoy the wide open spaces, even though dangers in the form of mountain lions may lurk around the next boulder. But as dangerous as a mountain lion can be, it pales in comparison to white men. Spirit, who is a living symbol of freedom, carelessly walks into a camp of sleeping cavalry soldiers, and finds himself captured. The soldiers and cavalry are symbols of discipline, hardship, and a type of slavery. As anyone who's ever served in the armed forces knows you don't have the freedom to do as you like when under military authority. Even some the constitutional protections civilians take for granted are out-of-bounds for a serviceman. Spirit is taken to the soldier's fort, and is quite literally tied up. The fort is symbolic of prison, and is portrayed as a type of concentration camp for wild horses. Spirit does demonstrate quite a bit of spirit and independent thinking the entire time he's captive, to the dismay of the colonel in charge. So the colonel attempts to do to the horse what the military does to every single man that joins it's ranks: he tries to break him down. At the same time Spirit is being held in the fort, a young native American is brought inside and tied to a post. His only crime: being a young, free brave. The native American, much like Spirit, is also symbolic of freedom. So it's no surprise when the young man cuts himself loose from his ropes, and storms out of the fort in the company of the horse. On their way out, Spirit makes a point of "freeing" all the cavalry horses, making for one major jail break.But Spirit still does not get to enjoy the freedom he once knew, for now the young Lakota takes him captive, and puts him in a coral near the tribal camp! But their is a profound difference between the captivity of the U.S. Army, and the captivity of the Lakota. The young brave, named "Little Creek," uses love, kindness and generosity to "break" Spirit of his wild ways, even using his own female horse to help persuade him. Yet whether it's the Army's harsh, violent ways, or the gentle, loving ways of the Lakota, Spirit refuses to give in, preferring his freedom above and beyond anything that man can do for him.The animators at DreamWorks have their work cut out for them in this film, taking an abstract concept like freedom and creating a wild horse to embody that trait. This is a difficult trick to pull off with educated adults, and even more difficult with young children. But they do put in a good effort, and those who are used to symbolism and types will be able to see the point of this film without looking too hard. Spirit's love and commitment to freedom is most plainly evident in a scene where Spirit destroys a railroad camp. The "sin" committed by the railroaders which causes Spirit to fume with righteous anger is their use him as a part of a very large team of horses to pull a steam engine up a mountain. Spirit decides he's had enough hard labor for one day, and feigns sickness to get released from the team. He then recovers quickly after being unhitched, and proceeds to act in a way that causes the destruction of the locomotive being hauled up the mountain, along with one sitting on the tracks below, along with the ENTIRE railroad camp at the bottom of the mountain, along with the forest surrounding the railroad camp. The punishment levied against the railroaders is quite drastic and very violent, and goes so far as to make Spirit look like almost like a villain. Yet, a small price to pay in the name of freedom. The animators do a fantastic job with the visuals, especially where nature and wildlife are concerned. There is a scene in the movie where Spirit has a race with a bald eagle that had me in mouth-gaping awe. Very well done. The movie is truly a feast for the eyes, if not also a famine for the brain.In the end, this is a movie that demonstrates that freedom IS something worth fighting for. Whether it's a railroad, the cavalry, or a friendly tribe of natives, slavery and servitude is not preferable to living the life of freedom. Sadly, while this film does a fine job demonstrating the need to fight to maintain freedom, it doesn't touch on the fact of the responsibility one has to oneself and others when free --for there is a strange paradox in that as one's freedom increases, so does ones responsibilities. In other words, you can never be free from responsibility, especially when you're free! Think about it.While one can be upset at the constant negative portrayal of white men in this film, truth be told white men did, in FACT, do a great deal of harm to native Americans of ALL tribes. While their were certainly some violent, warlike tribes that received their just deserts, there were also many peace loving tribes that were exploited and manipulated for evil purposes, mostly by white males. It is a sad fact of history, and one I do want my children to make note of. Overall, I applaud the message implied in this film of the overriding importance of freedom, even if it means the destruction of innocent railroad employees and the demonizing of white males. Rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great animation, nothing else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Some possible spoilers) I'm not too sure what Dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk $80 million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick. They probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences (mostly families) to see it in droves. Well it seemed to work for the opening weekend, it made $26 mil., roughly and has made $38.1 mil. total (an estimation for this weekend). But I think audiences that came during the weekend saw pretty much the same thing I did, when I saw and they spread the word. This is one majorly lame movie, apart from the animation everything else, mostly the script seem to be done by a three year old. The movie is only about 80 mins. long, but it feels like a three hour epic. A few sticking points for me are, well the irritating narration is one of them, and it's so obviously written. At one point he escapes from some captors and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared, up pops the narrator (the voice of the talented Matt Damon) to clear up any misconceptions (which would only happen in the simplest of mindsets. Another one is the constant pop up of Bryan Adams songs, now I'm a fan of his music, I think he's good, but come on did Dreamworks really think audiences would be able to handle 8-9 of his songs throughout such a short movie, I certainly couldn't. Finally and here's a spoiler, a horse gets shot at point blank range by a member of the calvary, no less, she (the horse) then falls into a raging river, Spirit (the focus of the movie) tries to save her, but they both go over a waterfall that must have at least a 50 foot drop, well later in the movie near the end we see that this horse is alive and well. Now I know this is a kids movie, but even that little amount of realism is unacceptable. To sum up, this is a really lame movie, I'm not saying kids won't enjoy it, but anyone else will be checking their watches just waiting for this tripe to end. Definitely on my Top 10 worst list of this year. -** out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the stallion because there's nothing not to love. Not only is he strong but considerate and humble. Everything he does is admirable. You know how the heros in every animated movie do things that irk you? Not this guy. He just makes you want to stand up and cheer. The whole movie brought tears to my eyes.Now the other characters? That's a different story. I hate how the director had the idea to use a female horse to get the stallion to calm down a bit. I for one cannot stand that in any movie. Using a females charm to sway the hero into going a certain direction is just wrong. And because of this I did not care for the mare. If it was a fellow male horse, THEN it would have been better because of course sexuality would have little to do with the reason why the stallion grew to love the Indian territory. And how they used the baby was just wrong. I hated how the stallion 'has' to calm down because there is a kid on the screen and we can't hurt the kid. The movie also makes you dislike the white man because they are portrayed as people who think they own everything and everyone. But, of course, movie writers had to do SOMETHING so that the white man didn't seem so evil. And, in the end, they made the head white man in the army stop someone from shooting the stallion and the native American. I know they did this JUST so that the white man wouldn't be the enemy in the end. In reality, this wouldn't have happen, which is why this pisses me off. Of course I know this movie isn't a history lesson or anything but, still. If you're going to tell a story about how the old west was developed, make sure it's accurate. Now a man wouldn't waste all of his time chasing after a native American and a stallion only to let them go JUST because they jumped a big cliff. Why would anyone do that? It's dumb and unrealistic. And it was almost like the camera was afraid to show the black people working the rail road tracks, and the audience KNOWS that those men hammering at the railroad were black. They should have showed them. But, of course, that would have made white people look waaaayyy too bad. And we can't have that. Not in America. It would have been nice for the movie makers to help kids grasp the fact that THIS is how it was back then. When white man came to America, they enslaved people, chained animals, and burned villages. And they killed those who refused to conform to their ways. The movie touches on that a little bit when we see the white man try and shoot the horse after he couldn't break him. But that's it. I really wish that the movie was accurate in that way, which is why I can only give this movie an 7. It was an awesome movie but it could have been a lot better if the film makers weren't so scared of making white people look like the monsters they truly use to be.</fullReview>

However, that being said, I think the movie does succeed in overcoming hackneyed politicization because it plays to the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone. You may not be onside with the movie's rubbishy revisionism of how the West was won, er lost. But anyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when horses could run free on the Western plains. (The movie also conveniently sidesteps the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there). Anyway, I liked it.

		<fullReview>Time for a rant, eh: I thought Spirit was a great movie to watch. However, there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 (I'm being a little bit generous with the 7).Point #1: Matt Damon aggravates me. I was thinking, 'what a dicky voice they got for the main character,' when I first heard him narrate - and then I realized it is Matt Damon. The man bugs me so very bad - his performance in "The Departed" was terrible and ruined the movie for me (before the movie got a chance to ruin itself, but that's another story for some other time), as it almost did "Spirit". I was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was... thankfully.Point #2: Brian Adams sucks... The whole score was terrible... The songs were unoriginal, generic, and poorly executed; not once did I find the music to fit; and the lyrics were terrible. Every time one of the lame songs came on, I was turned off. I almost thought I'd start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super-American freedom style lyrics (I couldn't help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9/11). In light of the native American aspects of the film, they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments, not petty radio-hit, teen-bop, 14-year-old-girl crap. I thought I was back in junior high school. I can't believe no better could have been done--I refuse to. Had it not have been for this, I'd rank the film up more with Disney, which knows a thing or two about originality (ok, don't bother saying what I know some of you are probably thinking ;). Too bad, it's a shame they couldn't have hired better musicians.I liked the art and animation, except for some things here and there... like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body (thick/dark lines mainly near the end). There were often times when I thought they _tried too hard_ on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion. But there were also times when the emotion ran thick. Anyhow, many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent.OK, I'm falling asleep here so I'll sum it up before I start making less sense...Nice try on an epic film... it turned out mediocre though. Matt Damon, you suck!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spirit has no REAL plot. This plot has probably already been taken a million times.Spirit is is about a animal (horse) underdog named Spirit. He saves horses from a life of misery. THAT IS IT. There are many factual errors about horses here. Spirit's actions get oh so boring. Overall, predictable. You can predict every second in Spirit. You know that this whole movie will end in a happy movie.Pretty much the only thing GOOD about Spirit is the animation. Who could resist the Disney-like animation? Personally, I think that is the only element that draws people in.I will give this movie a 2/10, **/****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has one thing good about it, the animals don't talk and thank god for that. However, there is enough neighing to drive anyone crazy. It also seems that marrying computer graphics and cell animation is not always a recipe for success. The film does occasionally provide some light hearted moments and few good action sequences ,but nothing lingers, nothing makes you want to see it again, assuming you have had the patience to see it all.As animated films go these days, this is no Lion King. It is good for a younger audience but will make a more discerning viewer yawn and yawn and yawn. As of the music scores, let's just say that the grinding noise of my rusty Lawn mower will be more soothing than listening to Brian Adams' Ballads which unfortunately happen every five minutes during the film.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember, The Studio That Brought You 'Shrek" is also The Studio That Brought You "The Love Letter."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saying, as DreamWorks did in its posters, that "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" comes "From The Studio That Brought You 'Shrek'" is like saying that "One On One" comes "From The Studio That Brought You 'Six Feet Under'" - technically this is true, but that doesn't make it a must-see. (To save you a search, both "One On One" and "Six Feet Under" involve the Greenblatt/Janollari Studio.) A more honest approach would have been to mention that this comes from the writer of "Young Guns" and "Young Guns II"... but then, that would have meant even less people might have gone to see this in cinemas.The adventures of a young horse in the Old West, "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" is very liberal in its outlook - the Native Americans (pure, unspoiled) come off a lot better than the representatives of the white man (the Cavalry at first, then later the railroad) - but it's not going to touch off any nerves in all but the most sensitive of viewers, in part because the movie's lovely to look at but very, very dull. Moral after this, "Titan A.E." and the shortlived TV series of "Clerks" - NEVER hire Matt Damon (the narrator and representation of Spirit's thoughts - we get no talking animals here) for animation.The makers's desire to avoid fantasy in this story is understandable, but while it perks up now and again the whole thing never really involves; like all too many other DreamWorks movies, characterisation is where this falls short. The music doesn't help either - this isn't one of Hans Zimmer's best efforts, but the real drawback is Bryan Adams and his endless songs being used to underline Spirit. It didn't work in "The Road To El Dorado," and it didn't work here.Of course, this might work on a second viewing (I vividly remember being underwhelmed by "The Lion King" in cinemas, but when I watched it again some years later on the Disney Channel I liked it more). But I doubt it. "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" is the Naomi Campbell of animation - very beautiful, but leaves me cold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this animated film, the animals don't talk like they do in most films like this. Instead, we get narriation from the horse's perspective every now and then. I just didn't like it that way. I guess I like the way animals are usually portrayed in other movies better.This movie also is judgemental by making the Indians good and the new white settlers bad. Why do they have to be bad? It was just too stereotypical.Plus, the plot moved slowly and it wasn't very entertaining. The movie is very short, lasting just a little over an hour. A cartoon about the unsettled west just isn't very interesting.FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it for adults or kids. The plot is too boring and the animation isn't as good as recent animation movies.</fullReview>

It's a little different from other animated movies, because, the animals don't talk, but we can hear their thoughts, which is kinda different, and quasi-interesting... for about three seconds. Then, the kickass Bryan Adams music underscores a 6 minute scene of Spirit -- our hero -- running over pastures. Then, the humans come. And not just any humans, but humans that know how to throw lassos. Lassos made of anything! You might think that a guy who shovels coal into a locomotive all day wouldn't be very good at throwing a lasso around a wild horses neck... but, you'd be wrong. He's amazing at it! He threw this lasso -- made of chain, mind you -- over a big piece of wood, and around Spirits neck, in one try. Yes: one try. And, all the humans posses this ability. One try, no matter what the lasso was made of.s In the end, Spirit wins. The End.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron' breaks with tradition a bit by having its animal characters be less anthropomorphic in nature than is customary in most feature length animated films. Indeed, except for an occasional voice over on the part of the main character, the horses in this film never speak (only the human characters do). In many ways, one respects this effort to keep the film more true to life, but the decision to take this approach ultimately ends up ruining the film for the adult audience (not being a five-year-old myself, I will not endeavor to say one way or the other how this film will play with that member of the audience). For a film aimed at children, it is striking to discover just how humorless most of `Spirit' turns out to be. There are no singing teakettles or furry little wiseacres to provide the comic relief we often need to get us through some of these films. Without the wit that made `Toy Story 2' and `Shrek' as much fun for adults as they were for kids, `Spirit' leaves its adult audience high and dry, stuck with a story that is as old as the hills, with nothing but a few good action scenes to keep us from falling asleep. The problem is that, when the main character is essentially unable to communicate with anyone else directly ? having to rely almost exclusively on soulful glances to convey all his emotions - the conflict and drama of the story tend to dry up. And the conflict itself is so simplistic that one wonders if the filmmakers expect their audience ever to have seen a movie before (for many in its young audience, this may well be the case). We're introduced to Spirit and the rest of his herd living free and undisturbed in the great Far West, when into the picture come the evil, dastardly white settlers who want only to corral the horses and use them as beasts of burden (I hate to quibble over historical realities here, but weren't horses extinct on the North American continent until the Europeans brought them back over?). Of course, even though the whites are all uniformly brutish in their treatment of the horses, the Native Americans are portrayed as loving and respectful towards Spirit and his brethren and spiritually at one with them. The PC meter runs dangerously high at times in this film.In terms of animation, `Spirit' has a certain elegance in its backgrounds and colors, and its action scenes are executed with a fine fluidity and flair. The first fifteen minutes or so, before the arrival of the humans, offers promise that the film will take flight as a charming adventure tale. When the men make their appearance, however, the movie becomes confined and static, with Spirit having to endure hardships, for what feels like ages, tied to a post. After that, the film never recovers that sense of wide-ranging openness it has at the beginning. There isn't much else to say about `Spirit,' except, perhaps, to note that the Hans Zimmer score (crooned by the lugubrious Bryan Adams) is both maudlin and undistinguished. `Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron' may be fine for horse-loving children under the age of eight. The rest of us, however, might prefer to find an animated film that engages both the mind and the funny bone and leave `Spirit' for the kiddies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has three problems...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I REALLY enjoyed Spirit. I want you to remember that. I left the cinema smiling with enough joy to go and built a ten story castle out of sand. I didn't, because I lived about 600 kms from the beach. But that was how I felt.But what stops Spirit from being an all-time animation classic is that it has three major flaws. I will discuss them.(1). The first ten minutes are about as exciting as watching grass grow. We see a lot of good animation, some of the best, but it's dull. We see Spirit 'talk' to younger foals, but not in words but in 'horsey sounds.' The problem is that it looks like a talking horse talking Horse, not a horse making natural sounds. That only adds to the bad ten minutes.(2). Bryan Addams. He has 2 very good songs, but the rest of them are bad, so whenether a new song comes up someone groans.(3). When all is said and done and over with, it is just a bit TOO politically correct. I'm no racist. I hate politically incorrectness about as much as the next person, but I hate political correctness the same. (talk about bothersome situation I'm in). So, unfortunately (and might I ad uncomfortably), it just hampers the movie. I'm sorry.But don't worry. It has something what I will call The Sense of Adventure, something you find in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), The General (1928). It is the excitement that leaves you on the edge of your seat! And this movie, at least, has it. Unfortunately most wont enjoy it if the 3 problems don't spoil the movie for them.Dreamwork's Animation Department has always been good in blending 3D CGI with 2D animation. I suggest you watch this movie in the cinema, for all the widescreen fun you can have.So, take a change, try and bury your hatchet and enjoy. You might stand in line for the DVD...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but still worth a look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard for me to describe just what didn't satisfy me about this little picture. I enjoyed the fact that the animals never opened their mouths to speak or sing, but was annoyed by DreamWorks' decision to put Matt Damon in the mix and give him the chance to narrate. His speeches are way too nature-happy and obvious for this movie-goer, talking 'bout the wind calling Spirit's name and all that. It's just corny and a bit stereotypical. The animation was excellent, as it always is when you see a DreamWorks animated film. I also liked the music, sung entirely by Bryan Adams (kinda like what Phil Collins did for Tarzan). It might have been nice to have a little more variety, though, since the same singer popping up tended to get monotonous, but as it is the music is good. While the story is not complicated at all (horse is free, then he gets captured, etc), it's easy for younger kids to understand and get them emotionally involved with the main character. Adults may look at their watches from time to time, but I don't think they'll be too bored unless they dwell on how unrealistic the premise is. Because really, it seems a shame to lie to kids about how the wild nature of the West really went untamed when it was basically trampled and paved over with highways. On the animated summer list, Spirit comes in at third place behind Powerpuff Girls and Lilo and Stitch. 3 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bunch of pretty horses running around...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamworks SKG set out a task for itself to show the spirit of the animals without their ability to use the English language. Here the horses don't sing, dance or talk. So where is all the fun? The only "horsing" here is done through Matt Damon's narration of Spirit's thoughts. This could have worked - but it didn't.Spirit is a wild, free-spirited stallion and leader of the Cimmaron herd. He runs with the eagle until he's captured by some by Cavalry soldiers in the old west, due to his curiosity. The cavalry's leader (James Cromwell) decides to break spirit by starving and dehydrating him and ties him to a post for three days. The same fate is met by a captured Indian (Little Creek), however the duo manages to gallop away. Little Creek (Daniel Studi) teaches the stallion about the power of love and the value of compromise.While the horses galloped, never has there been anyone in the audience who was that excited about discussions in regards to painting doors. One can't be blamed for taking a little break, considering just how predictable this movie got. Perhaps the greatest fault lies in the extremely weak script/storyline. Aside from Spirit's galloping away and being caught over and over, there is nothing much else. Most scenes in the movie lack plausibility and while it can certainly be forgiven in a film, not to such an radical extent. Throw in a couple of hard-pressed morals and you've got yourself a headache.The film's major premise was to lay off the standard talking-animal pattern of most animated pictures. The horses convey their emotions through whinnies, snorts, and facial expressions. Instead of horses being Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt, horses are horses. It's an interesting tactic, although talking animals are not an emotional conflict either! Perhaps it would have worked, except it didn't. Inserting a voiceover narration by Matt Damon didn't help either. It felt entirely out of place. If there was more horsing around in his narration, it would have helped greatly.The animation is the strongest element. It's stunning and reflects the rich, vibrant colors of the Old West with bursts of exhilaration and energy At numerous moments the animation actually felt real. When the snow dropped, you thought it was dropping on you and when the horse jumped, you felt like you were about to fall. Hans Zimmer's score also greatly flatters the film. It's very much in sync with the picture. As for Bryan Adams's songs, a few did stand out such as "Get of off my back," and "never going to give up." However most of his other songs were quite weak and mild.Directors Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook utilize a lyrical style of storytelling, employing music greatly to drive the plot. There were a few times when eyes could have gotten candidly teary and they did. It's obvious that there were at least some talented people involved with this spirited project, but they must have been looking the other way when the ghastly script sneaked up on them.The target audience of girls will definitely appreciate it much more than the adult world. It's stunning, has horses, high energy and a few jokes here and there. While the idea was there, it's unfortunate that the script left us to watch not much more than a bunch of pretty horses running around from place to place to the 'soulful' tunes of Bryan Adams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been awhile since I've seen a kid's movie, but it seems to me that at one time they were entertaining for both kids and their parents (take the Wizard of Oz for example). This movie seems like an insult to our kids' intelligences. Much like Disney's failed dino flick Dinosaurs, this movie unfairly skews the natural world such that the movie becomes a parody of itself by the end. The whole notion that predatory animals are "evil" and that captive animals somehow need emancipation is pretty silly. This isn't helped in Spirit by the fact that the horses do not speak and rely on human-like facial expressions to convey their thoughts. There are many different ways of interpreting some of the reactions of the horses in this movie, many of which are not favorable. I would like to see a Disney movie that, even if it doesn't realistically portray animals, at least knows when not to take itself seriously.</fullReview>

Every pivotal moment of the movie is slathered with viscous layers of Adams' personal interpretation of the subtleties we might not have noticed. Spirit is born: cue Adams to hoarsely announce "Here I am!" Spirit is in a ring being ridden by various US Soldiers: Adams underscores the taut drama by singing a song the chorus of which is "Get off of my back." Spirit is in a chain gang pulling a steam engine up a mountain: Adams is necessary to indicate it with a song titled "This is Heavy Stuff, Man." Only one of those is false.

		<fullReview>In the words of Homer Simpson, this movie should have been "Less artsy, more fartsy." I've never said that about a movie before, but please.So we have a horse narrating the movie...but the horse can't talk during the movie. At what point did he learn the English required to narrate??? I have no problem with the silence, although I'll comment on that later. Nor do I mind the narration, though it too was weak. It's the inconsistency. If you want to be realistic, fine, have the horses not talk. Cool, great. But why, pray tell, does the Lakota indian speak perfect English, rather than his native tongue?And as for the non-speaking horses, here's the problem. Since you and I don't speak Equine, we're left to interpret the emotions of the horses from their whinneys and neighs. Well, animators don't know horse emotions any better than you or I. So, we're given exactly two emotions from the main character. Happiness, which is represented by a lot of frolicking by the horses and their Lakota friend, followed by a Bryan Adams song that could have been left on the cutting room floor, and sadness, which is also followed by a Bryan Adams song that makes me want to choke myself to death.That's about it. Oh, one other thing. This movie has not plot. It's a character study. About a horse. Yes, I know. That's just wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't the most pointless animation film experience ever, but it certainly can't be admired as much as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later named Spirit (Matt Damon, providing the first person narration), and his journey through across the frontiers of the Old West. Basically he is born free amongst all the other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, he manages to throw off all who try to ride him. However when he escapes his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two of them form a friendship, oh, and he obviously has a thing for Little Creek's female horse. In the end, after a few more escapes, being chased by The Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and making a final big leap across a gorge, Little Creek lets Spirit go, and he also releases his female horse, and they run home to their countryside and fellow horses. Also starring Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy/Railroad Foreman, John Rubano as Soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I was expecting to see the horses talk in this film, but it turns out to be more like a Dumbo thing throughout, and the songs by Bryan Adams aren't the most engaging, but it isn't a terrible film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Song for Bryan Adams' "Here I Am". Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just strange</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler Ahead*I love horses and nature and thought when I saw the DVD in the rental store, "Hmmm, this ought to be a good couple of hours." The first ten minutes were absolutely beautiful... wild horses gamboling in gorgeous animated scenery full of eagles, clouds, mountains, and prairie grasses.Then the actual narrative started and the plot began to move into high strangeness. Not too surprisingly, horses are shown not with intelligent horse minds but human minds. "OK," I thought, "I guess I can handle that, it certainly is not the first film to give animals human minds, attitudes and viewpoints." I was disappointed, though, because Disney has made an industry out of same, and other non-Disney productions like Dreamworks could blaze a little new territory if they were willing (and obviously, they are not).The strangeness kept coming. In one prolonged scene, Spirit enlists the aid of teams of horses used to lay the railway through the mountains to instead destroy it and the train manufacturing facility. The idea is to keep the trains from bringing more settlers west to ruin the land. What action could be more pointless and destructive? We all know that the railroad did come West, to the Pacific. Spirit's actions did nothing to help his land or his fellow horses. We see the liberated horses fleeing into the forest. What happened to them next? The film glosses over that. Horses living in a forest do not necessarily live happily ever after. For one thing, appropriate food is scarce.I'm as ecologically conscious as the next person, probably more so, since it's my career. Couldn't Spirit have done something a tad more constructive to help preserve his native land and educate the humans, since he is so smart? What a missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dances With Horses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything you need to know, you learned from "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron."1. Most viewers are too just plain DUMB to understand the concept of Point of View in film. From Spirit's point of view, humans were pretty much the enemy. Especially the mean ones that wanted to cut his hair and tie him up and kick him with spurs. This is all pretty straightforward and simple enough even for little kids to get, but many viewers see it and are just, really STUMPED as to why the Cavalry is portrayed as the enemy. They are just incapable of seeing it from the horse's point of view.2. You can make hundreds of movies about white settlers who are good guys and Native Americans who are bad guys, and it's ok. But as soon as you make Native Americans the good guys, that's "Racist," "too politically correct," and "Un-American." Also, some viewers do not seem to be capable of realizing that, when it comes to cowboys and Indians, white settlers were pretty much the bad guys. It would be very interesting to see how those people would view things today if the situation were reversed...If Indians had gotten in their canoes and paddled over to Britain and other parts of Europe and tried to take it all by force. I guess then all the Indians would be the "Good Guys," and it would be considered Racist and too politically correct to portray any British people as being peace-loving or honorable.3. As soon as you make a movie about ANYONE, that person is interpreted to be representative of his or her entire racial or cultural group in perpetuity throughout the universe, and you will be accused of stereotyping. So if you make a movie about a small tribe of anonymous, peaceful indians, and a small group of anonymous, mean, Cavalry soldiers, your audience will get very upset. They will say things like, "What, so ALL of the indians were good, and ALL of the Cavalry soldiers were bad??" even though your movie said nothing of the kind, and was in fact a very limited portrayal of only two small groups of people. That is irrelevant, because viewers will apply unfounded stereotype no matter how few people are actually involved in your movie. You could make it about a single family of peaceful Indians and a single family of mean white settlers, and many viewers would cry stereotype. This is because such viewers do not see people as individuals, but as stereotypical representatives of their respective groups. To them, one woman in a movie is a symbol of all women, one indian in a movie represents all indians, and one white settler in a movie is just like every other. And because this short-sightedness lies with the viewer, there's no way for you moviemakers to get around it, so there's no point in trying. If you tried to tell these people that there were once like, hundreds of Indian tribes in the U.S., and that they were often very different from eachother in their lifestyles and philosophies, and that some were warlike and others were peace-loving, so it would be literally *impossible* to be portraying or stereotyping them all by having just one small, individual tribe in your movie... I guess those people would just look at you blankly.4. Many people are unaware that "Calvary" is something else entirely.5. If there is a movie with a vaguely historical setting, some viewers will assume that it is supposed to be a literal documentary that contains only historical facts. No, no, no... it doesn't matter at all that "Based on a true story" never appears. If it's set in history, it MUST be historically accurate, down to every rock formation. People will actually criticize your movie if the Painted Desert is not where it's supposed to be; animals having eyebrows is ok, animals being smarter than most audience members is ok, but some viewers just WILL NOT be silent when a river or waterfall appears in a place that is not geographically accurate.6. Murphy's Law is still very much in effect. The "Horses Pulling Locomotive Over Mountain" scene actually WAS based on a real event that truly happened in history. The ONE place your movie is historically accurate, is the one place where the viewer's erroneous assumptions fail you. They look at this scene and tell you how unrealistic and impossible it is.7. Just because you see it in a movie, that doesn't *necessarily* mean it's real, but it depends on the movie. For example, it actually takes *years* for a horse's mane hairs to grow out to a foot long, and foals would probably grow up in that time, too. And horses generally don't jump in to save eachother in roaring rapids, or survive 50 foot plunges into rivers and over waterfalls. Also, most birds don't have teeth, and most animals can't plan elaborate schemes, or talk (or even *narrate*)... UNLESS the movie involves bats, spiders, snakes or sharks. THEN absolutely everything is true in it, even if it's completely a fictional film. All 300+ species of sharks are man-eaters, every bat wants to drink your blood and nest in your hair, and every snake and spider wants to chase you and bite you. Are we all clear on this? If the movie is about some animal that most people are totally ignorant about and terribly prejudiced against, then every bit of it is true and you should never question it. So "Spirit" is very unrealistic, but "Jaws" and "Anaconda" are like... Pretty much documentaries. Really, they practically Discovery Channel and PBS fodder.8. Many people think that every horse color has some meaning, and that it holds true in any film involving horses. For example, white is the "good" color and black is the "bad" color. Both of these are suspiciously absent in "Spirit," but that doesn't mean the audience will be open-minded about color. They will still read blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty into Rain, and dark-colored wildness into Spirit, and that this is some kind of message about light being tame and decent, and dark being of questionable virtue. Nevermind that the filmmakers intentionally used similar colors to establish brotherhood between Spirit and Little Creek, and that Spirit's mother is also a wild horse, and even lighter-colored and more blonde-haired than Rain. Some viewers will only see what conveniently fits their preconceptions.9. A Movie that focuses mainly on beautiful vistas and good animation instead of complex plot and character development, will likely not be that successful. Even when your eye candy is truly amazing and your main characters are beautiful horses, this holds true.10. Not everyone likes Bryan Adams (or knows that it's supposed to be "Bryan," not "Brian" or "Brain.") so it's not a good idea to dominate your movie with too many of his songs played all the way through. Some of us really like these songs, but out of sensitivity to the other people, you should probably play them more quietly in the background or just play a verse or two and then let it go instrumental. Also, even the fans don't care for the minimal, repetitive lyrics.11. "Remember Who You Are" is THE LION KING's Moral, NOT Spirit's. This Katzenberg/Disney rivalry has gone too far.12. "Spirit" is not a bad film, but it lacks in substance and tries (unsuccessfully) to compensate for this with action, songs and lovely visuals. It is one more mediocre offering to cement the fact that there is nothing wrong with traditional animation, only with studios that believe it will sell when not given properly detailed story and character. It has nothing to do with the medium; even the mighty SHREK would have failed with these flat characters and this limited, repetitive plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spirit - Stallion of the Cimarron" is a more experimental feature from Dreamworks, but still a very family friendly film. This film has some flaws, but it still a good film on it's own merits.The case that the horses don't speak works quite really well, actually and they have great personalities even they don't speak. Matt Damon's voice over works also well, without being annoying all the time.The music of Hans Zimmer is also great and so is the animation. The film has a great atmosphere most of the time and it's surprisingly funny sometimes.The story is very simple, but personal I liked the story and the plot, I found it inspiring for the title character, even it's the not the most well developed script in a film ever. But in it's own merits, it works.One of the problems with the film are the songs of Bryan Adams, who doesn't quite work well. They're not bad, but they get quite annoying sometimes (except one song ). But the real problem with the film is that the third act of the film get's too sentimental, without humor and it's also gets very sweet, almost too sweet and that's why we (or I, for that matter) don't get so involved in the story in the last act.Not a instant animated classic and far from perfect, but besides that, it's a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just caught Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron on HBO, and have to say that the film, while rendered and acted beautifully, is some of the worst Dead White Male-bashing I've seen this side of Jebediah Springfield.First of all, the American Indians were not the bastions of all thing natural. Few people know that the "Native American" tribes of ancient times hunted the North American horse to extinction. Just because we see that their ropes are a little less tight around Spirit's neck and that they use wool blankets instead of saddles does not mean that they understand the nature of horses any better.The Union Army were baseless, barbaric savages? Yeah, that's a really authentic portrayal. Any fool that has experience with raising horses knows that you do not treat the animals this way. In the so-called "Wild West" or "Old West" horses were lovingly and respectfually taken care of...otherwise, they would not be adequate beasts of burden or an excellent mode of transportation. Cowboys and soldiers treated their horses very well...nothing like what is portrayed by these Nazi-like Union soldiers in this film.The evil transcontinental railroad? Not hardly. And while we're at it, let's make the horse a terrorist. SPOILERS AHEAD. He could have killed those men when he caused that steam engine to roll back down that hill, as well as the ensuing explosions and fire. What kind of message does that show to children?I urge parents with any amount of intelligence to keep this film away from their kids, or at least explain the great amount of fiction that lies within it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great animations but falls way too short as a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never was too anxious about seeing this movie. I mean, an animated movie about horses? Nevertheless I still decided to give this movie a shot, since it visually looked fine and the musical score by Hans Zimmer was just great. The end result was sort of relieving but also disappointing.The time that big animated movies only got made at the Disney studios are far in the past. DreamWorks Animation proved with its past movies "The Prince of Egypt" and "The Road to El Dorado" before that it could make good animated movies with an own style and aimed toward a different public the Disney movies always got aimed at. Nevertheless they sort of go into the more mainstream direction with "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron". It follows the safe and usual formulaic road of an animated movie, that is predictable in almost every way possible.The movie is wonderfully animated and visually there is a lot to enjoy while watching this movie. Unfortunately the story is not doing much justice to its animations, or better said the way the story is told and progresses.Thing is that the movie its story just never could interest me. It also lacked a clear main plot-line and didn't seemed to have the right proper character treatment in it. You just never care about the characters and you're never frightened by the villains because just non of them are properly developed. The movie often repeats itself throughout and the action/chases and all are just more of the same the whole time. Spirit is really lacking a spirit. And its getting kind of annoying seeing animals all the time reacting and thinking as humans, in order for the viewer to be able to bond with the animal characters.Positive thing is that it was a good move not to give the animals human voices. The images and interactions between the animals speak for themselves and you always understand them, though like I just said before, it's kind of annoying that they are doing this in a more human behavioral way.The musical score nevertheless still brings some life to the movie and often its action. The music is so loud during some sequences that you can't help being blown- and carried away by it. It's yet another fine musical score by Hans Zimmer, who also did the music for previous DreamWorks animated movies. There are also some songs being sung by Bryan Adams but those songs are mostly blah and predictable sounding nonsense. Guess they tried to achieve the same thing Disney's "Tarzan" achieved by using Phill Collins, as a sort of singing narrator and describing character's thoughts and emotions. Didn't quite work out though.Still somewhat watchable for the movie its visuals but it's not a movie that shall leave an awfully big impression on you.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Animnation, but not recommended for toddlers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good piece of animation. The music was also good. However, we took our 3 year old to see this in the movie theater and we did not think it was appropriate for her age. The movie contained several sequences of violence with whips (hitting horses) and guns (shooting at people and horses), which we were not expecting, especially in a G rated film.Overall, it's probably o.k. for the older child, but if you have not introduced the concept of violence and guns to your child, which we had no intention of doing anytime in the near future, I would strongly recommend keeping your toddler or smaller child away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great, family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" follows from birth to adulthood the story of an untamed mustang who is determined to stay wild and free, no matter what people expect of him. "Spirit" is gorgeous to look at, and those who love traditional cell animation may enjoy it solely for its artistry. The songs, performed by Bryan Adams, are passable but nothing spectacular. What sets this film markedly apart from other animated films featuring animals is that none of the animals here talk (though the mustang's thoughts are relayed in a voice-over by Matt Damon). Moving from anthropomorphism toward realism may be a laudable goal, but if so it's one NOT realized to perfection in "Spirit"; the film loses some of its charm to its characters' silence. Also, the pace lags in several places.This is not to discourage you from seeing the film, though, if you're of a mind. "Spirit" is positive, family-friendly entertainment with an inspirational message, and it is likely to please horse-loving kids (though very young children may be bothered by some unkind treatment the horse endures). The film has its shining moments and you could spend a worse 83 minutes. It's just a bit disappointing to think that with an enhanced score, tighter pacing, and more vivid characterizations, "Spirit" might have reached the heights it aspired to. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though an animated film it really bored everyone under at least 6.As a grown up who grew up in an area with wild horses and native americans, it felt this was a combination of PC mixed in with too many fantasy films created by people who never lived in the area they filmed about. Talk to those who have lived on horse back, most treat their animals like family members, regardless of background. Regardless of background we have dealt with good and bad breakers of wild horses. I had to explain that was a real life issues to us vs the movie makers views to children who were surprised to see how PC showed a world different than what they knew in reality.This dreamworks break from the normal disney or dreamworks fare of cute talking animals burning up the screen was nice from the older viewer point of view. But if you live in an area similar to what is shown, you may end up answering questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great animation, and.....well, that's it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you notice about this movie is the breathtaking animation. The horses, the scenery, everything, is wonderful to look at. But, unfortunately, you can't have a good movie with good animation and nothing else. And that's what Spirit was.The most disappointing thing about the movie is that, aside from Spirit's occasional narration by Matt Damon throughout the movie, none of the horses talk. All you hear is a series of whinnies, snorts and neighs, all of which get very old after the first fifteen minutes of the film. Fortunately, you're saved from this constant "horse talk" when humans enter the film and you hear some real dialogue.We start off with Spirit (who, actually, remains unnamed until the very end of the movie) as a young horse, wild and carefree. He grows up to become leader of his herd (surprise, surprise) and spends his days fighting off mountain lions and racing the eagle. Everything seems pretty good for the mustang until, one night, he decides to investigate a human camp on the outskirts of his homeland. He is then chased by the men on horseback. Apparently Spirit is able to win races against eagles, but somehow he isn't able to outrun a bunch of domesticated horses carrying humans on their backs. That aside, Spirit is captured and taken to a fort nearby.Well, things have gotten fairly exciting, but from here on, things start to go downhill. The Colonel wants the wild horse to be broken, so his men volunteer to try and ride him. He manages to buck all of them off. The "mustang" as he is called by the humans, is tied up for three days without food or water. During this period, a Native American named Little Creek is brought to the fort and tied up as well. At the end of the three days, the Colonel himself rides the horse. Even without food or water for three days, the horse manages to buck him off as well, breaking the corral fence in the process. By this time, Little Creek has freed himself. So, the horse and the Indian escape the fort, somehow managing to free all the other horses as well.Spirit is free for about five minutes, before he is captured again by Little Creek's companions and taken to their home instead. There he finds love, a filly named Rain who belongs to Little Creek. The latter tries to tame Spirit but, like the white men, is unable to ride him. So he ties Spirit and Rain together, telling Rain to "teach him some manners." Despite Rain's snotty attitude, Spirit quickly falls in love with her and everything seems okay again.Awhile later the white men raid the Native American's camp, and in all the chaos, Rain gets shot while trying to escape with Little Creek. She falls into a river and Spirit jumps in to save her, right after saving Little Creek from being shot by the Colonel. Both horses go over a fifty-foot waterfall, and that night while Spirit is laying beside Rain, he gets captured AGAIN by some railroad workers.He is then forced to work with a hundred other horses to pull a train up a hill, and he soon figures out that the railroad will be built in his homeland. Miraculously, he frees himself, all the other horses, and causes the train to roll down the hill, explode, and set fire to all the buildings and the forest. Spirit runs away from the fire but gets caught on the way, and is saved by Little Creek. Together they jump into a river.By the very next morning, Spirit is looking pretty good for a horse that's fallen over a waterfall, nearly gotten killed in a forest fire, and leapt into a raging river. The men from the army camp find Spirit and Little Creek, and the chase is on. At the very end, Spirit ends up soaring over a cliff with Little Creek on his back, and (surprise, surprise), they make it. Instead of shooting them, the Colonel simply nods and lets them go on their way.They return to the Indian camp, where Rain is perfectly okay, even after being shot and going over a waterfall. Little Creek sets Spirit and Rain free, but not before giving them a few cheesy parting words and hugging both horses. They run back to Spirit's homeland, and everything is bright and happy again.All in all, the movie is predictable, corny and clich. It's basically a tiresome circle: Spirit gets caught, Spirit runs away, Spirit gets caught, Spirit runs away...and it is all rather pointless and boring, and hardly believable in most instances. If you're looking for a good kids' movie, I don't recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film lacks in Spirit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of most uninspiring Disney films I've seen, and I don't slam Disney films very often. Spirit is a wild stallion who repeatedly gets captured, either by the cavalry or by Indians, both of which try to "break" him. Spirit ends up forming a bond with the Indian, and that, in a nutshell, is the story. With exception to the beautiful animation of the horses, neither I or my five year old were very inspired or excited by this film. It's ironic that it's titled "Spirit", as spirit is what this film could have used a bit more of. An extra point was given for the soundtrack, which was enjoyable, with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this film is rated G, you will still probably have to end up explaining what "breaking a horse" means to your five year old. I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agenda before Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happened to the children's movies where care-free entertainment was in mind versus setting an agenda that tries to teach that white men are evil and the devil-incarnate? I rented the movie for my 6 year-old step-daughter because she loves horses. She didn't understand why the humans (evil white soldiers) would want to hurt or mistreat the horse. Half way through the movie she was crying and asked to turn the movie off, but only after enduring the horse being tied down, beaten, spurred, ridden by every soldier with little brains &amp; an overwhelming amount of testosterone, shot at, forced to ride a train in the dead of winter, and being put under the chains to haul a train across the new railway during the expansion to the West. We ended up watching Sponge Bob to cheer her up. I think she should be watching shows that make her laugh and enjoy her childhood, not shows that confuse her on how evil white people mistreat the animals, Indians and the virgin land. What's worse is movies like this never portray the evil white people as being an isolated incident. They portray them as being the norm. I don't doubt that there are evil people out there in the world, but to try and teach a child that she comes from a lineage of evil-doers does little to improve her outlook on life, let alone it makes for terrible entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the whole, crap **very mild spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Balto", "The Road to El Dorado", "Ice Age", "Anastasia". What do those films have in common?Answer: they are all Disney wannabes.Sure, they are well-made, good-looking, etc., but you cannot forget the sixty-odd years that Disney has dominated the animation market. Again, all those films are GOOD, but they're in the shadow of the majority of Disney's efforts. "Spirit", however, doesn't even come close to those, much less the Disney classics.Saying this is the greatest animated film since "The Lion King" is akin to saying that Denise Richards is the best actress since Claudia Cardinale. They're good-looking (though Cardinale is ten times sexier than Richards) and are passable, but lack any real depth (Cardinale has genuine talent to go along with her ravishing beauty; see pretty much any of her Italian films of the early-mid '60s and most of her roles from the '70s onward if you doubt). "Spirit", of course, is just BARELY passable, with music that made me want to puke.I'm not going to get into the "this is too PC" debate because, well, though I hate PC in general, I don't mind political correctness in movies in general if it has a point (the superb "Dances With Wolves", for instance). Also, I am hardly the most patriotic American out there, and would agree with certain aspects of the film's allegory (though, like many people, I found Spirit the Terrorist kinda hard to root for).The animation is gorgeous - so what? How many films in the last twelve-odd years have been poorly animated? Maybe a handful - not an extraordinary amount. It was realistic - big freakin' whoop.Oh yeah, and this movie is supposed to be great since the horses don't talk - big flippin' deal. All it does is make this film a wee bit more realistic - and even then, with Matt Damon's narration (which actually was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be) and Brian Adam's vomit-inducing songs, it doesn't make much of a difference.But, let's stress the music now. Before the movie I was completely indifferent to Adams; now I hate him. The only song I even remotely enjoyed was "Get Off Of My Back" - and even that was mediocre. His songs were an attempt to use Phil Collins' "Tarzan" technique of using songs superimposed over the action to show what the character is thinking. However, in "Tarzan" (which as a Disney film wasn't that great either - although it is eighty times better than this garbage), Collins' songs, while not great, were at least passable and certainly enjoyable to an extent. Not here.And Hans Zimmer? The guy who brought us "The Lion King", "Pearl Harbor", "Gladiator", "Backdraft", "We Were Soldiers"? Here his "score" consists mostly of repeating guitar riffs, some minimalist string sections, and crappy electronic noise (I don't want to demean the word music). I still believe Zimmer is one of the best composers out there, but you wouldn't know it by watching this film.And, since this film so pompously claimed to be in the same league (okay, it was the critics) as "The Lion King", I couldn't help but compare it to that film at every step. Everytime a horse stepped onto an outcropping (and the end, of course, though there was no outcropping there), I kept being reminded of Pride Rock. One of the songs reminds Spirit to "remember who you are" - sound familiar? The scene where Spirit and Rain (it sounds like Little Creek called her Lorraine at one point) are frolicking together reminded me of "Can You Feel The Love Tonight?" - albeit without a lyrical song and considerably longer (though not better). And during the mountain lion attack scene, I kept thinking of Timon's immortal line - "Go for the jugular - THE JUGULAR!" (That would've ended this movie sixty-five minutes earlier then . . .)I must admit I saw this movie with pretty low expectations, but I at least expected it to be enjoyable. This film, however, doesn't even touch "Pocahontas" and "Pokemon 2000" (two movies which I considered close to the bottom of the animation barrel), much less "The Lion King" and other classics.If you have real young kids or are a horse freak, maybe should see this film. I will say it IS the best Western of the 21st Century thus far - but seeing as its competition consists of made-for-TV schlock and stupid "pop Westerns" (like "American Outlaws" and "Texas Rangers"), it is pathetic.Four stars for at very minimal, mild enjoyment and good animation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the good news first. "Spirit" is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release. The artwork and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone.And now for the bad news. I really mean it when I say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it. You may remember that "Spirit" got badly trounced by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first person who argues that it was because Disney is more well-established and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitled "Why 'Lilo and Stitch''s Script Didn't Stink".For all the incredible new animation technology on display in "Spirit", the story is almost *astonishingly* dull. There is a lesson here, and (needless to say) it doesn't just apply to animated movies. You can have the most mind-blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we don't care about your characters, it's bad film-making. Simple as that. The animation is still mind-blowing; I just can't wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney Checklist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Essentially, aside from my beef with the main character, there isn't anything wrong with this film. The problem is, there isn't anything GREAT about this film. It falls into the syndrome I like to call the "Disney checklist". This film is not Disney, but Disney forms the frame work for the now apparently extinct 2d animation genre. The categories are as follows: Beauty, cuteness, laughs, 'magic', historical/worldly quality. As has been mentioned before by other viewers, the film borrows heavily from "Bambi" and "The Lion King" and possibly "Pocahontas". It strives to be like those films while providing a somewhat pretentious message to younger viewers about the 'evil' of the white man. The film aggressively attacks and finger-points in a very discomforting way while overbearingly emphasizing "freedom" in the form of an eagle. It talks its simplistic message, instead of showing it.Back to the list. The film opens quite beautifully with a view of the western landscape; we see the large magnificent trees, the towering mountains, waterfalls, you get the drift. It's so awe-inspiring, you know, nature and stuff. We get a look at the horses and birth of our hero "Spirit" and it's just so damn cute. Aww, he gets his tongue stuck to an icicle; remember when we were kids... Anyway, life is good, he's happy as a youngster; strong, spirited; curious; foreshadowing what he is to be.Next, Spirit has grown to a healthy and happy equine adult. He is seen chasing an eagle and believing he could fly because life is just so good being free and nothing will ever infringe on his freedom. It's almost as if the eagle senses his freedom and guides him through his high points, quite magical (later in the film Spirit freaks out at the sight of the eagle as he's being taken captive). Of course, the film is historic and takes the viewers on a journey through the old west. A world, you know, "when the wild horses ran free". Check check and that's everything. Nothing really wrong with these qualities, but the film should bring a little something else to the table. One idea that is unique however, is the main character, Spirit. Of course, he is spirited, but for this film "spirited" means insanely and annoyingly cocky. Unfortunately, that isn't a good thing. The animation is great, and its good to see something from Dreamworks that isn't pop-cultured invaded. So all I have left is to examine how well done the film is. Unfortunately, it's admirable quality of the none talking animal is tapered by a clunky narrative.It's okay, with some more misses. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking practically everything usually present in a good animated flick, Spirit gallops towards nowhere from beginning to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone that loves predictable movies with an awful soundtrack, lack of dialogue, clichs up the wazoo, and also stereotypes that just happens to be typical of an American film, look no farther. DreamWorks whether wanted to save money on acquiring voice talent, or really wanted to create an animated episode of National Geographic; either way, they succeeded in delivering a rather bland and boring movie. Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is a bore fest that sends mixed signals to kids and adults, and also fails to entertain despite the oh-so-cutesy theme of animals triumphing over humans. After looking past the wonderful animations, what you have remaining is nothing but a big mess.Spirit is about a stallion that from the beginning of the film looks like quite a handful, as he is a horse that cannot be tamed, calmed, nor controlled. Because of this, he rises and becomes the leader of his group of high-spirited horses, which includes his mom. But, his life of freedom and running around comes to an abrupt halt as he is captured by a group of Americans in the process of connecting the Wild West with the rest of the country. During this, Spirit (never actually named that throughout the entire film almost) befriends a courageous Native American, and a fellow female horse, and also has a lot of run-ins with the cynical and cruel Army folks that apparently don't believe in giving up.Why must movies mix computer animation with traditional? It comes off looking rather meshed, something Spirited Away suffered from as well. Best example is when a train is chasing after Spirit; you see the hand-drawn Spirit running from a computer-animated train. It would look much better if it were one or the other, but not both; unless you can really pull off some nice effects. Beauty and The Beast's famous dance sequence uses computer animation, but it is nowhere near as obvious as the train or the snow in this movie. The opening sequence was the best-looking part of the film, kind of sad to see the rest of the movie slide a bit downhill in terms of quality. A little scene has multiple; I mean multiple similar shots of just a general's face, quite repetitive and annoying in my opinion.The kids might enjoy this flick, but with lack of dialog, song, and motivation, it might be a perfect technique in making hyper children fall asleep. While Disney becomes criticized for its animated musicals, they wind up becoming much more entertaining than a more realistic approach to telling a story like this one. Bryan Adams has no place in this movie, and why does Hans Zimmer stay away from using a Western theme in this movie, when it is a story taking place in the Old West? Soundtrack sounds a bit off if you ask me. At least they are using realistic noises of horses, two points for that. Yet, if you are going to refrain from making horses talk, why even have a narrator interrupt every so often, which just so happens to be the main character himself?Native Americans are nice, and the Western folks are evil, Native-killing, horse torturing, rowdy, psychopathic monsters that must be destroyed. More or less, this is what Spirit is showing us. It reaches a point in which they are trying so hard for the viewers to hate the travelers of the Wild West; they even had a scene of several horses pulling a huge train up a hill, and another scene of them destroying an entire village of Natives. Now, the person Spirit befriended happened to betray him, on more than one occasion, yet that is forgivable, apparently because he is not a soldier; that or because he has the sassy female horse.Spirit isn't exactly a victim we should feel sorry for; the viewer is supposed to sympathize with Spirit despite him putting his entire group of horses at risk, wreaking havoc, and even perhaps resulting in some off-screen deaths that are quickly shoved aside because oh no, Spirit is in trouble! This film gets quite rhythmic, as we see in multiple instances Spirit escaping from chains, kicking people around, destroying property, freeing horses, and then getting captured again---all in this same order too. The writers also seem to have an obsession with cliffs because they are sprinkled all over the movie; for an Old West film, they certainly have very little room to roam.Bottom Line: This is most certainly no Disney movie, as a matter of fact that is a bad thing, even though it was what they were aiming for. So, instead of the typical musical, we get a boring film that becomes predictable, dull and slow in multiple instances. Even the decent animation becomes inconsistent when the computer work gets thrown in. Everything about this movie was just wrong; from the ideals that back then Americans that were not native were evil buffoons, to the soundtrack and musical score that just seemed so far off. Kill Bill Vol. 2, which pretty much has nothing to do with the Old West, has more of a Western feel than this movie. Do yourselves a favor and totally skip this by all means necessary. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many cartoon movies and I remember a time when these movies had a semblance of depth and I owe my fondest childhood memories to the Disney classics, so if anyone thinks the following words come from a person who doesn't watch or love cartoons they are greatly mistaken. That being said I have also seen some not-so-well done or simply naive cartoons which obviously hint at only being enjoyable to young children. But I have never NEVER in my life seen such a big hunk of cheese as Spirit.It's a film that relentlessly goes over the top in the following respects: fake and slimy political correctness; absolute implausibility; cheezy, VERY cheezy song numerals, occurring in relentless numbers. I don't think a movie has EVER induced more groans out of me. Painful to watch, this movie goes over the top to a degree which is simply wrong and inhuman.Yes, the young horse freely rides the plains. Everywhere he goes the music follows him. He is captured and of course struggles in his relentless fight for freedom. He stumbles upon a captured Indian and (guess what!) they become friends. When captured again, being a smart horse that he is, he singlehandedly (singlehoofedly?) sabotages an entire railway production. He makes poignant speeches in his head (since he can't talk) every five seconds. In the end, he makes a daring leap across a cliff to escape capture (will he succeed? oh my!). Suffices to say, a painful, unwatchable movie. A big piece of (to use kiddie-friendly language) poo. A groan fest.Of course, I am sure that all the Indians will feel compensated for all their suffering having seen this movie. It is easier to make such movies than make those methods of the past truly be a thing of the past.Rating 1/10 Scale: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK, 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 Mediocre, 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great western, my ass.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only way in which this movie qualifies as a 'great western' is because it takes place in the Old West. Compare this movie to classic westerns, and you will see next to nothing in common. How does it qualify as the 'first great western of the 21st century' is because there have been so few - and even that doesn't save it. Even "Blazing Saddles," the Mel Brooks satire comedy, beats this movie as a 'western' by genre and reality!The reality here is that it's meant as a kids' movie. The sheer number of real-world inaccuracies is astounding. Here's an example: When was the last time you saw a wood-fired steam engine explode with great flame when it crashes into another similar engine, neither of which with a fire in the boiler. And then continue to explode all nearby buildings. Then continue to create a forest fire - in the middle of winter, with everything covered in snow. With rocks burning, and fire raging across the land. And the next morning, miraculously, nothing else is touched, and it's a nice, warm spring day.One of the true tragedies of this movie is the vain attempts to vilify humanity. Every human we encounter is completely wicked and vicious. Until, of course, our 'native-american'. Who even betrays the lead character, Spirit, on at least 2 separate occasions - and yet the horse continually forgives him. Did I also mention that virtually every point at which a white man is displayed as a horrible abomination of creation, they're also dressed in military uniforms, with the American flag waving in the sky or other symbols of the Union? And despite the approximate era at which this movie is supposed to take place, you also did not see any blacks anywhere oppressing horses, even working on the railroad lines - they were all bland-faced, grey-skinned, down-trodden folk.This movie is a kids' movie, and that's about all. It is a movie about the changing face of the West, and how utterly wrong it was for us to have done that. Every time the horse made some jump or leap, I kept thinking, "Matrix rip". Even the closing shot is a ripoff from "The Lion King" with Simba on the high outcropping being worshipped by his subjects. If it wasn't for the fact that it was the first movie in a double-feature with "Fellowship of the Ring," I would have never seen it in the first place, and left before it was even done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel I have to keep reminding people that movies are meant to be entertaining - i.e. they are only at most entertainment. Too many people feel that if a movie isn't accurate then it is bad. This is a misconception. Are comedians accurate? Of course not, we don't want them to be - they are there to entertain. Is the press accurate? Of course not. And so it goes with all media - especially movies.This movie fails to entertain the adult, but succeeds to entertain the child. If you are a child, then you will almost assuredly love this movie. If you are an adult, then you will see it for the maudlin pap. If you want, compare this to Monsters, Inc. which was a brilliant animated movie which may appeal to everyone on all levels.There is another mix that didn't work. The computer generated images (c.g.i.) were beautiful; the cartooning was only typical. I wanted to see the whole thing in one or the other - the mix was annoying. On one hand the computer images were far more real, while the cartoons were pulling you backward away from the awe of the c.g.i. 6/10- Zafoid</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually impressive, but not particularly compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very pleased to see this done in wide-screen (as I've always wished had been done with The Lion King), and I think the animation work is outstanding. The deep backgrounds are stunning and richly detailed, and much of the foregrounds as well - though I kept wondering why there are so many shots where the grass just appears flat and unmoving. The character animation is terrific, to the point that sometimes the cavalry officers could have been mistaken for real people (not in closeups, of course). The horses are all tremendously well-rendered, outstanding in line and movement; my only complaint is that I wish the coloration of their coats had had more texture, which would certainly be true of real horses. And there's one truly stunning sequence in a raging river where the animation is state-of-the-art.Given all this, it's deeply disappointing that the story this all rests on is so mundane and simple-minded. The narration, though there isn't much of it, is largely unnecessary, and the songs seemed to me to be awkwardly shoehorned into the film. The story, such as it is, is a simple series of episodes where the main character escapes the threat of captivity, and longs to be with an attractive mare. It's all quite predictable and straightforward.The white people (cavalry, railroad workers) are uniformly depicted as vicious, nasty, coldhearted. The looks on the cavalry horses' faces are seemingly intended to suggest that the horses feel mistreated, though I strongly suspect that any cavalryman who mistreated or abused a horse would swiftly have found himself in the infantry. The handful of natives are uniformly depicted as peaceful, community-based, serene - and oddly not interested much in riding horses. Doubtless "Spirit" never saw a native American eat one of his brethren, either. (The natives are Lakota, it seems - Dances With Wolves has really had the effect of making them the convenient "good guy" Indians in perpetuity. This movie would have been a lot harder to buy if they had been Apaches, for instance. And I wonder why the Lakota are so close to what appears often to be Arizona.....) None of this would have bothered me so much, if the movie hadn't started by stating it was a "history of the West."I really don't think kids over age 10 will be much into this movie, given how simple the story is; and the romance between the horses is certainly limited. On the other hand, there's a LOT of violence in the movie, which may turn off the smallest kids. The horses get shot at several times, as well as roughly restrained; there's a rough fight with a mountain lion where Spirit emerges implausibly without a scratch; there's a large explosion and fire (where I suspect some humans get killed - offscreen, natch), a train wreck which I thought not too probably depicted (I doubt a locomotive would roll - and BOUNCE - with such ease), several long falls off cliffs and the like, a potentially fatal drowning of a horse in a roaring river, etc.I'm not sure what the target audience is here; fairly unquestioning 8-year-olds, I suppose. But it's extremely lovely to look at.6 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Creative geography aside, the subtle racial discrepancies make this movie questionable. Spirit is a great character and truly emphasizes freedom and remaining true to yourself through any adversity.The creative geography that places the Colorado River between the mittens in Monument Valley and Yellowstone within a day's run of the Grand Canyon is really very amusing. No less amusing is the idea of using horses to pull a steam locomotive on a sled over a mountain.The subtle racial discrepancies where whites are referred to as men and the Native American character as boy disturbed me. The blond, blue-eyed horse taming and teaching the dark, wild horse manners and civilizing him. Subtle, and harmful.I can't say I would recommend this movie for children as it does reinforce attitudes that we really should be fighting against.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthless in every respect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe me, I wanted to like "Spirit". The idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see old-fashioned, hand-drawn animation again, as if the last pencil-animated cartoon had been released twenty years ago, and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques obsolete, had got my blood up ... but then, the insulting, flavourless banality I had to endure in the first ten minutes of "Spirit" got my blood up even more.The character designs are generic, the animation (partly as a result) merely competent, the art direction as a whole so utterly, boringly lacklustre that you wonder how it could have come about (we know, from "The Prince of Egypt" and "The Road to El-Dorado", that there are talented artists at Dreamworks), and the sophisticated use of CGI is in every single instance ill-judged. (Why do they bother?) There's not a single thing worth LOOKING at. In an animated cartoon, this is fatal.But it gets worse...The horses can't talk, but they're far more anthropomorphised and unconvincing than the deer in "Bambi", which can. And it seems that, in a way, the horses CAN talk. Spirit himself delivers the prologue (sounding for all the world like a 21st-Century actor picked out of a shopping mall in California), and from then on his laid-back, decidedly unhorselike narration is scarcely absent from the soundtrack, although it never once tells us anything that we didn't already know, or expresses a feeling which the artwork, poor though it is, wasn't capable of expressing twice as well. That prologue, by the way: (a) contains information which Spirit, we later discover, had know way of knowing; (b) expresses ideas which Spirit would lack the power to express even if he COULD talk; (c) includes new age rubbish like, "This story may not be true, but it's what I remember"; and (d) will give countless children (the production is pitched, I presume, at six-year-olds) the impression that horses are native to North America, which is sort of true, in that the common ancestor of domestic horses, zebras etc. WAS native to North America - but all horse species on the continent had gone extinct long before the first humans arrived, and the mustangs of Spirit's herd (which allegedly "belong here like the buffalo grass") were descended from horses introduced by Europeans.So the prologue rather annoyed me.As often as Spirit talks, Bryan Adams sings, sounding as usual as though he's got a bad throat infection - and it's not THAT he sings or even HOW he sings, it's WHAT he sings: maudlin narrative ballads which contribute even less, if possible, than Spirit's spoken narrative, and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune (although I was paying close attention, and was able to discern that they probably didn't). If only Bryan Adams and the guy-pretending-to-be-a-horse could have SHUT UP for a minute or two, the movie might have been allowed to take its true form: mediocre and derivative, rather than jaw-droppingly bad.</fullReview>

There is no plot to speak of, simply a series of captures and escapes that, while they are interesting enough to carry us from one minute to the next, ultimately lead nowhere. The character of Spirit does not grow, change, or learn much of anything. Additionally, the narration is awful and goes a long way towards ruining the film, as do the Bryan Adams songs with their 80's synth sounds and painfully "on-the-nose" lyrics. To sum it up: gorgeous film with a great concept that was mishandled badly along the way. A potential classic is undermined by flaws in storytelling. I give it a 10 for visuals and a 1 for content, giving an overall rating of 5.5. Since I don't believe in half-points, it's a 5.</fullReview>

The fact that the horse then finds love, so conveniently, so ridiculously easily and so stereotypically is a tribute to how little thought seems to have gone into to this movie.

		<fullReview>Flat, soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds animates a horribly predictable story in this film. Absolutely nothing takes you by surprise, you can even tell when the Bryan Adams vocals are going to come in, which are always at the wrong time.The main character, Spirit the horse, is given an annoying voice when he narrates what is happening. The narration is not needed, though, as everything happening is really obvious. You can even tell what the horses are saying, although all they do is neigh. Which would be good, but all the horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for sorrow, one for laughing, etc. There is no variation between the horses' voices.Young kids might like this film, though. It's soppy enough for a family to sit down and watch, and there's little danger of anyone being frightened. If you have nothing else to do, and want to watch a film with your kids, this isn't a bad choice.But otherwise, this isn't recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed the opening scene of "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarrron," which in a Disney, whoops Katzenberg, animated flick is usually terrific, but then, it's usually an ocean storm and I doubt there was one on the prairie. I came in time for Spirit's birth and to get completely caught up in the action. Yeah, I was one of those pre-teen girls who loved "My Friend Flicka" (the whole book series and the TV show) and "National Velvet" and "Black Beauty," had horse models all over my shelves, and no, I don't really understand the psycho-sexual implications of that.It's nice that the horses don't talk or sing "Hatuna Makata", but they do neigh meaningfully to each other and grin and otherwise emote, so this isn't exactly the Junior Discovery Channel. The visuals are thrilling and realistic and the story line cheer-worthy. But other decisions are wincible. Matt Damon's flat and condescending voice-over narration as Spirit is simply awful (though I liked Daniel Studi, Wes's son, as the voice of Little Creek, and James Cromwell did a Custer-like villain pretty well). It's crying out for a Western drawl, say Sam Shepherd.I'm a closet Bryan Adams fan but his songs are just wrong (OK, except for the heartfelt "Get Off of My Back" where, gee, Spirit literally wants men off his back). Even if the songs could be tolerated, the bloated, bombastic orchestrations are inappropriate. The score by Hans Zimmer too-- why the heck not have Western musical flavor out on the prairie, or some sense of Native American musical themes in the Indian Village, let alone some military martial touches in the frontier fort. Did Katzenberg intentionally want this to seem not a uniquely American story so it would make more money overseas?An even better movie all around that touches on virtually the same themes is "The Silver Brumby: King of the Wild Stallions," which is based on an Australian children's book. And you get a real Russell Crowe instead of disembodied hunk voices. Ah, horses AND Russell Crowe -- that's something I can understand. (originally written 6/6/2002)</fullReview>

That was uncomfortable to watch!I'm glad to see that Bryan Adams has a new outlet for his music. Joan Baez could have lent some balance to the soundtrack, though.Extreme left-wing (or even right-wing) morality plays don't make for good entertainment, no matter how well presented. Propaganda has its place in global warfare, not in cartoon cinema. At least "Fahrenheit 911" and "Primary Colors" were up-front about being message movies, and Joseph Goebels was more subtle in his delivery! This is kind of confrontational in its portrayal of Union soldiers as evil, horse-abusing Indian killers. It's uncomfortable, bigoted and racist on many fronts. We get it, comrades. Revolution! Blah blah blah!The animation was breakthrough and very pleasant, but wasted on the "America Sucks" message that does nothing but offend a lot of the audience. We know that people and horses suffered during the founding of this nation. (Show me a nation that didn't.) This film could easily be applied to any other country in the world, however.Four stars.

		<fullReview>There have been a string of kid's movies that are for the purpose of supporting a political ideology. This is quite the opposite of what Walt Disney used to do. Disney originally made most films for fun, entertainment and happiness of young people.Films like this and others are just to make kids view the world in a certain way which is very popular with critics and translates into box office. This is of course politically correct to the maximum. Another writer wrote that in this film Native Americans are sensitive and the others are mean especially to horses. As a U.S. historian I am aware that the old west was much more complex as horses were first imported from Europe and used by all sides and even trained heavily by Commanches and Apaches and even used as a food supply by Native Americans, not quite the image in this film.I believe kid's movies should just be fun and not for secret agendas. I agree with other writers who say the young kids cried at this film. It is a sad to use beauty to once again make kids cynical about history and make a lot of money. Sad.</fullReview>

One must understand that if your going to make the horse mute, you can't likewise have him share every other human quality. By the fifth scene of Spirit running from some tragedy or calamity that had befallen him or his family, with his head screwed on backwards (he obviously does not need to see where he is going), eyes rolling, and neighing incomprehensibly in a vague attempt to express worry, i couldn't help but burst out laughing. It was so ludicrously bad i was both horrified and amused. The scene that really gets me though (i will never forget this)is when (SPOILER) Spirit jumps over the canyon with his Indian buddy and the characteristic 'bad guy' holds his men from firing on them, and instead nods his head at the horse who, get this, nods back! (END SPOILER) C'mon, just make the horse speak already! It's awkward and boring to attempt anything else. And preferably give him a new voice, matt damon's whiny (or whinny) kid-like yet sincere voice employed as the narrator will wear even the most resolute family film watcher down. 1 out of 10, i just wasted 2 hours of my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie for my sons, 13 &amp; 8. They are even now begging me to turn it off!It is one of the worst instances of PC claptrap I have seen in years. According to this movie, all white men are evil, and the transcontinental railroad is especially evil. Horses are tortured for no reason at all, and the white men want to kill all of the Native Americans.Then, of course, there is the hideous soundtrack. It started off with some pseudo-rock n' roll boy band music, and it went downhill from there.Finally, my wife could not stand it any longer. A little over an hour into the movie, my sons fled the room, and my wife turned it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Animation, But Deadly Dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the animation was first rate, the movie overall was a big yawn. The story was terribly clichd and hackneyed, with unfortunate elements of racism and sexism. Surely, the talented folks at Dreamworks could come up with something more original than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just terrible, the worst popular tripe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The naive idea that North America was some sort of paradise before Europeans settled here is absolute idiocy. Anyone who has an inkling of history knows that the harsh wilderness that was and to some extent still is the American landscape was no picnic. Leave it to the wannabe social engineers who make movies to try and rewrite history. These folks live ON the American Dream (in the same way a tapeworm lives ON it's host) while criticizing the discovery of the west by the early settlers. The same people who lavish praise on the native American Indian culture they so fondly admire, wouldn't last a second in it. They who simultaneously enjoy the fruits of American culture while criticizing it are simply "no-nothings" and more importantly "DO-nothings". Their excuse for being ineffectual and lazy is that they don't agree with the "system". They contribute nothing to the nation being totally absorbed in self. Just like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harmful for kids...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, that parents would check out "children's movies" for content before allowing their kids to see them!I believe that a person's whole outlook on life can be colored by the books and movies absorbed in childhood. I point to myself as a case in point. Ever since I can remember, I've been ardently conservationist. My parents certainly weren't. None of our neighbors evinced any interest in the subject. And up until recently, I hadn't questioned why I might have deviated from my cultural upbringing to adopt this stance.But when my sister recalled to me a movie we had seen in our childhood, I looked for and found a VHS copy on the Web: "The Enchanted Forest." Watching it again as an adult, I understood that it was little more than a piece of anti-logging propaganda. The loggers were portrayed as thoughtless, even sadistic, and the gentle old forest hermit was a saintly hero. A light-bulb clicked--aha! There was my formation begun.Now, this might not be entirely bad; humans need to pay attention to the preservation of their environment, if only to ensure their own survival. And books and movies which help build such realizations can, in spite of the lies, serve an ultimately good purpose.However, "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" propagandizes children in a way that is likely to hurt them eventually. It portrays cruel soldiers of the Union army terrorizing, capturing, and subjugating herds of beautiful wild horses, which are then rescued through the altruistic intervention of the noble Indians. I question the wisdom of forming today's children to despise the military and the white frontiersman. While there have been some sadistic military leaders in American history, and many noble Indians, it's a fact that the good and the bad were far more randomly distributed than this movie would have our children believe. In fact the widespread use of such extreme cases in children's stories can only foment hostility between peoples and lack of respect for the European culture that brought the ideas of personal freedom and--eventually--equal rights to fruition.In short, this movie is harmful because its thrust is to perpetuate stereotypes about the past to impressionable children, and to build hostility. I believe such hostility will eventually cripple its bearers and targets alike.If I were rating this film's propaganda effort, I would give it a 9, but since I'm rating its value, it gets the lowest possible mark.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid the pile of horse do do!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie falls into the category of: It could have been better but it failed, category.If DreamWorks wanted to make a film about horses with no speaking roles, then why did they have to make the horses appear human? This seems to be a big complaint with many viewers who didn't like the film. And I for one couldn't agree more with them.The only saving grace of the film is the animation. Blended 3D and 2D looked astounding and in some scenes almost lifelike. However a movie needs a good plot to save it and this movie does not have that formula working for it.The only thing I liked about the movie was Spirit himself. The rest of the characters were unlikable.I just hope they don't green light a sequel for this filth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this is what children enjoy then I hope I die before those children are old enough to be making movies.This movie is total rubbish. It failed to touch my inner child because my inner child left after 10 mins to go and see 'The Rookie' again. I wish I could have joined it.This is absolutely dreadful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film if you like PC propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The animation is good. The soundtrack is so-so. The story is horrible.This film could've been much better if it wasn't for the anti-American (and anti-military) bent. I wouldn't recommend taking your kids to see this movie because of the cynical message (which is so blatant even little kids will get it). It's no wonder it's not doing very well, this film is totally out of place after 9/11.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst animated film in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's embarrassing how bad it was. It felt like a "B" made for tv movie, something totally lacking in everything. Watching it is like seeing a story written by boring unoriginal children, animated in the 1970's by arthritic blind people. I found myself wondering if I should just stop watching; it wasn't particularly exciting, funny, or interesting at all. In addition to being such a bad movie, it had absolutely no redeeming qualities. This kind of animated film is an obviously cheap attempt to make a quick buck for the studio and pad Matt Damon's resume. Whatever standards he had before were definitely lowered by this piece of crap. Oh yeah, the music was terrible too.</fullReview>
