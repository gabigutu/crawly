		<shortDescription>Bill Maher is a hero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just returned from a screening. Let me say I am a sucker for a good documentary and this film makes a load of powerful points that just cannot be refuted. As someone who believes in evolution as well as God, the film did enlighten me about a host of issues that I had been unaware of. In recent weeks my biggest fear has been that the Neo-cons were finally going to give someone the nuclear football that truly believes in the rapture. Bush and McCain and Reagan and even Bush Sr. catered to the evangelists because they are sheep and are as strong a voting block as this country has. But none of those politicians really believed things like every word of the Bible being literal. Now Palin comes along and she, like Huckabee who also scared me, is the real deal. The Neo-Cons have plucked an actual sheep to get the sheep vote this time. When people with beliefs like that are given power, the inevitable result is destruction, and that is the point that this admittedly at times hilarious film hammers in during the final 5 minutes. I call Maher a hero in that he fears the consequences of irrational religious so much that he is literally willing to put his life on the line to deliver his message.Make no mistake about it, this man will get death threats from the film and I will pray that that is all that he gets. I am not worried about a Christian extremist, though maybe I should be, I am worried about Muslim reaction to the film though he arguably treated that religion with a bit more of kid gloves than his other targets. I believe that everyone should see this film, but instead all the nuts that need to see this film the most, will probably be picketing in front of the theaters where the film is showing. Hugely entertaining, enlightening, hilarious and ultimately frightening what more could you ask from a couple of hours at the movies?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contemplative Religiosity For The Masses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the world premier of this at the Traverse City Film Festival. I am a big Bill Maher fan and this was definitely the movie/documentary I was most looking forward to at the festival.I was not disappointed, though I think it could have been developed a bit more. It seemed to play to the lowest common denominator in that a lot of issues were touched on, sometimes in rapid fashion, but none was examined closely for any length of time. Any astute viewer of Real Time already knows what Maher thinks about religion and many of his arguments with regard to the same. I was hoping for a more in depth analysis of some of the primary aspects of how religion can negatively affect our world in ways that people might not intend. The documentary did that only on the surface. I suppose that shouldn't be surprising as the need to draw people into contemplative thought in this area is probably more of a priority than retaining those that already are there (not to mention selling more tickets).Subsequent to the showing, director Larry Charles had a discussion on stage with Michael Moore, with questions from the audience. Larry pointed out that he had many many more hours of footage that didn't make it into the final cut, and that he thought maybe a series could be released on cable of this material. I would very much like to see that happen as I think it would quell the thirst I had for more substance with less of the fluff.However, kudos for Maher and Charles for doing this. If it is successful in getting people to think about religion in real world terms, then it has accomplished its goal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Bill Maher's new movie, Religulous at it's world premiere at the Traverse City Film Festival. It was one of the first films to sell out at the festival, selling out in just the first couple days of sales.Okay... now for the movie review: for those of you who thought that Dawkin's "Root of all evil" or "Jesus Camp" were powerful statements, then you might want to wear diapers because you might just crap yourself. Religulous doesn't take prisoners. It addresses Christianity, Scientology, Mormonism,Islam, and other religions. Bill Maher travels around the word, visiting the Wailing Wall, USA Bible Belt, Salt Lake City, and other locations while interviewing a wide range of religious leaders and followers.Throughout the interviews, Bill throws out zingers and the joke timing is impeccable. Like the pro-creationist movie "Expelled", Religulous cuts to a variety of old film stock when making jokes. Although it fails at times, I would say the vast majority of the cuts connect and generates hearty laughs.The first third of the film deals with Christianity and several offshoots of it. Here, the movie shines. It is hilarious! Poking jab after jab into insane ideas by asking simple questions.Unfortunately, the move starts to slow down after he lampoons Scientology. Dressed as a vagrant, he appears in Hyde Park's Speaker's Corner and runs through Scientology's belief structure... appearing as a raving lunatic while accurately describing what that religion teaches.By the time it deals with Islam, a lot of inertia has been lost. Although it still delivers some funny bits, the movie is much more subdued. Granted, anytime you are dealing with a subject so inflammatory that people have been killed over it, you tread lightly, but I think Christians will criticize the movie for being softer on Islam than on Christianity. The sad thing is that it's true. Being the more dangerous religion, people seem to be treating Islam with kid gloves. I wonder how long before other religions start adopting that tactic as they become threatened by critics? The ending is a fiery call to action for freethinkers. Rousing music &amp; inflammatory speech hammer the dangers of religion into the audience. Propaganda techniques? Yes. Pretty heavy-handed about it too. However, I think it's needed. The flow of the movie needed something to bring things together and although thick with images and rhetoric... it is a solid ending.Is it worth seeing? Hell yes! Will people be offended? Most definitely. Will there be protesters? There should be, this is far more blasphemous than "Dogma", "Passion of the Christ", or "The DeVinci Code".Comparing "Expelled" to "Religulous", it's pretty quickly apparent that Religulous is the better movie. Bill Maher, with his previous experience doing standup and conducting interviews shames Ben Stein. Nicely done Bill!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two things about this film took away a star. One was that Bill Maher spent so much time with the ones he tried to make look bad that he didn't meet with enough experts who could further the points he was making. The second problem is that the people he interviewed could have easily made fools of themselves without him cutting them off and lecturing them. That being said, let's get to the good points.For one thing, he makes it so clear how illogical the mass amount of people can be. He exposes phony beliefs and shows how they can become very protective against his film crew. The film stock they put into use is done masterfully. Plenty of laugh out loud moments (particularly the image of Jesus as a teenager, you will see). My word must be taken as truth when I say that the final part of the film MUST be seen. This isn't just about cracking jokes on faith. This film is about the human race taking responsibility of itself and stopping the damage it has been doing for far too long.I truly hope religious people are not quick to brush this film off. For once, listen to the side from someone who is sincerely concerned about all of our futures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny view on Religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was everything I expected and more... To admit, I never really knew much about Bill Maher when I went to see this film. I saw this at the Atlantic film festival and I loved it. My friend had told me that it was going to be good, so when I saw it in the schedule I said " Hmm, maybe i'll see this." So we did. It was hilarious, I wet myself at several points. But! It was also VERY insightful. I actually learned quite a bit about how religion can be REALLY stupid. And it's true. I really enjoyed the interviews with some people who just take everything way to seriously. I loved the comedy being used to explain things that are very serious. So I completely suggest this to everyone, not just Bill Mahers fans. " You don't need to pass an IQ test to be a senator."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie exhilarating. I'm with you, Bill Maher! That said, this film attempts to cover the basic tenets and idiocies of several of the major religions, namely Catholicism, Judaism, and Islam. It also encompasses evangelical/American/born-again-type Jesus-focused religion, which considers itself "Christian" but I have never understood that title, since Catholics revere Jesus also. But anyway...Maher is a smart man, and I would like to think that he considered the points I feel were left out of the movie and chose not to include them for the sake of condensing the film. However, there are several facts that I think would have made an even stronger case against mass religion in general: 1. Although Maher mentions several times that the Judeo-Christian Bible was written by men, and therefore contains the fallacies of men, he does not bring up the fact that the Bible has been constantly rewritten, translated from language to language, and amended to suit the needs of those in charge of its distribution -- for most of history since Christ, this was the Catholic Church and its founders. And for those of you who don't know, translation is not an exact science. Languages just do not translate word for word, and the accuracy of the translation depends on the skill, vocabulary, and motives of the translator (a human being, don't forget).2. Catholicism was successful because it incorporated many old religions. Greek and Roman gods are just a few of those who have direct equivalents among the Catholic saints. Mahar discusses the inherent flaw in a monotheistic religion with bunches of demigods, but he does not point out that Catholicism deliberately found supposedly Catholic replacements for the more ancient, household-type gods. Why? Because those who wanted the religion to succeed decided that people would be more likely to convert to it if it weren't too different from what they were used to. Why did these men want the religion to succeed? For the same reasons that people promote religions today: to gain money and power, particularly in the form of influence. Maher reminds us that the story of Jesus Christ included many elements of older heroes or gods, but the film presents this as a matter of fact, not pointing out that Catholicism was built upon the success of these preceding stories and histories. The types of dramas that move the human spirit have not changed over thousands of years--they have simply been retold and reinterpreted.3. My third point is more of a question. I was raised as a "nouveau" American Catholic, so I feel that I know a little bit about that religion, but I know next to nothing about Islam. However, it is my understanding that Mohammed did not want images of himself used to promote his teachings. Is this why some Muslims get so mad when an image, ridiculing or not, of the prophet is publicized? I wish Maher had included this, as he did talk a lot about the violence specified in the Koran.This is a terrific film. It is funny and has a great soundtrack. My hat is off to Maher for his nerve in interviewing people who become belligerent when their religion is questioned. I guess it partly comes from being a comedian--one must have guts and a thick skin! The message of the film, however, is not humorous at all. It is truly terrifying to think of all the murder, torture, and oppression that is perpetuated in the name of religion. Why then, is someone who calls himself "Godly" or "religious" considered to be a person with wholesome morals?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>clever and worrying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just come back from watching religulous. I had a great time. Bill makes a lot of fun of all those silly things people actually believe. Obviously since I am an atheist I really enjoyed this movie, and I know that most believers will reject it altogether. But there is one thing that just occurred to me as I read through the comments here, it's the fact that, yes, people like me do not go around advertising their atheism. And I saw someone writing that this was why the religious people would always dominate. Well there you have it now though... Bill Maher's movie is definitely a non-believer statement, and a wonderful one at that. I am also painfully aware that it won't change anything in the sad state of affairs in the USA. But at least it's one solid step in the right direction. Now, why do I say "worrying" in the title of my review, well it's because I think that Bill's got it straight regarding the dangers of religion. How can you expect people to make rational decisions when they reject the teachings of the very same science that provides them day in and day out better lives?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maher's Catechism; Questions, No Answers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 16 percent of the U.S. population, the un-/non-/anti-religious represent a larger segment than blacks (13%), gays (3%), or NRA members (2%). Never mind the exact figures (which vary from source to source), focus on the question what kind of lobby do the non-religious have, with impact approaching those other groups? None, alas. Why is that?It could be this: The militantly religious must be *right*, the secular - by definition - will not fight to the death for his truth (or god, not in evidence). My money is on the righteous, the fervent, the militant, the possessed. One day, they may even have an influence over the U.S. government! Meanwhile, in our corner, there is Bill Maher. His "Religulous," directed by Larry Charles, is an entertaining, funny, angry, thought-provoking journey from the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Via Dolorosa, the Qumran Caves, to Stonehenge, Habibi Ana (and a Moslem Gay bar), the Vatican, the Holy Land Experience Park in Florida, the U.S. Capitol, Mormon Tabernacle, and many others. Everywhere, Maher is asking a few simple questions: What do you believe, why, and how can you possibly...? Half Catholic, half Jewish, and fully agnostic, Maher is incredulous, in every sense of the word, but curiously warm and gentle asking questions about the "the final battle between intelligence and stupidity that will decide the future of humanity."In Larry Charles' words, the situation confronted is like this: "An old God, a very buff old God that lives in space decides to create the first man from earth dust, then makes a woman from that man's rib. They get to live forever if they don't eat the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge, but the woman is tricked into eating a piece by a talking snake and all future humanity is cursed." And that, of course, is just the basic tenet of one religion. Discuss. Maher goes on in his polite crusade to dissect some of the similar Star Wars/Disney scenarios in Scientology, Mormonism, among Orthodox Jews and televangelists. All interviews are interesting, but some are amazing and memorable. Father Reginald Foster - a senior Vatican scholar, principal Latinist for the Pope - will stun you as he agrees with Maher on some points. There is unexpected goodwill and kindness from a group of evangelists "attacked" by Maher; they pray for him, and really mean it. You may have chills running down your back as you listen to Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Arkansas), sitting in his Capitol office, speaking about his belief in Creationism and the literal interpretation of the Bible. You don't need to be a Christian to be offended (and amused) by the commercial Jesus impersonators Maher interviews, and you may feel a bit sorry for the Pentecostals speaking in tongues. (Gov. Palin and John Ashcroft, neither featured in "Religulous," are members of that church.)After comedy, irony, and sarcasm, Maher turns serious at the end of the film, and asks with deep concern if the future of the world can be entrusted to the many varieties of believers in the unreal, the illogical, the incongruous, the phantasmagorical. Looks like we are well on our way to that eventuality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Call to Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not just a propaganda piece, and more accessible than most of Bill Maher's creative output, Religulous still preaches to the choir (please excuse this phrase). However, the film does not seek to convert; rather, Maher wants current agnostics to gather their courage and preach their doubts. Deeply atheist and deeply religious people who see the film will likely be offended or feel as though their time has been wasted.While this film is not as funny as Borat, Religulous (which, at times is actually pretty scary) is a more powerful film because this film is true. For a project written by and starring Maher, the clips in the film are (for the most part) surprisingly fair. Maher does not try to make any of the people in the film look stupid (at least no more stupid than himself); in fact, he (usually) tries to help people consider the position not that their personal/religious beliefs are incorrect but that their personal beliefs may be incorrect. Most people in the film will not consider this possibility (these are the people Maher is warning us about), but several important and seemingly wise religious figures also featured in the film agree with Maher about the danger of certainty.I recommend Frailty to anyone who would like to see a fictional, story-line illustration of the main theme of this documentary/propaganda film. I recommend Religulous to anyone who is comfortable enough with himself/herself to doubt their personal beliefs, to consider the possibility that (s)he might be wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some food for thought but Maher undermines himself by being silly, picking easy targets and not being as intelligent in his approach as he is capable of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this film because the one thing I hate on Real Time is when Bill Maher goes off on one about religion, making massive sweeping statements about people not being allowed to vote if they believe in angels etc. It is not that I disagree with the basic argument he says but just that he doesn't seem to have a lot to back it up and, the odd time he is called on it by the guests he will move along and not really seem to have much behind his general opinion that people with religious beliefs are idiots. So for me this film was not an opportunity to get more annoyed by this but rather give him my undivided attention and let him lay out his case.He manages to do this here and there but nowhere near consistent or good enough to make an argument capable of changing minds ? although perhaps good enough to provide food for thought. At the end of the film he gives a very good speech that sums up his film and this is probably the strongest part of the whole film as it challenges and makes reasonable points. OK it is loaded with imagery that backs up his points in a very blunt way but I can forgive him for this. What I have a problem with is that the rest of the film doesn't have this same core of logic and reasoned argument. He hits it here and there but too often he is doing two things. The first of these two things is that he will never give up an easy joke and this is not helped that his goal often seems to be that he seems very keen to mock people rather than reason with them. Hence we get the personal barbed remarks that are thrown out for the audience but the interviewees either don't hear or don't get their response shown. The second thing he does is select really weak people if his goal is anything other than mockery. I do agree with a lot of what Bill says ? particularly about the role of religion in world politics. I do believe in the concept that religious tenants within people's personal lives as guides and moral foundation is something I can live with but when things are taken as fact and taken totally literally then things get out of hand. So I do want to see Bill present a more rounded argument and have that debate with people who can talk to him at the same sort of intellectual level.Sadly what we get are interviews with a priest who is a self-appointed doctor, a man who plays Jesus at the Holy Land theme park, a Muslim extremist British rapper (who let me say has ZERO profile over here), a man who is a reformed homosexual, a man who claims to be descended directly from Jesus and thus now leads the one true church and others of similar quality. We do have experts on the roster but they are mainly used to back up what Maher is saying. Now, I know many people do not like him, but to me Maher is too smart to need to be protected from reasonable discussion. The only exception I would give is the one priest he talks to who seems very liberal and open to taking the basics of his religion and getting away from dogma and ritual. Outside of him though Maher does not have a hard time showing them up but, when he occasionally gets someone who is a bit more careful with language and phrasing and can prevent themselves sounding like nuts, the film uses an even more cowardly trick. What we get are Maher filmed in the car talking about the interview, which very much gives him the final word and allows him to make responses and ridicule once the individual is not there to respond anymore. I do like Maher enough to watch his stuff, but this is a cheap trick and cheapens the film by extension. Of course this doesn't look as bad when you consider the heavy editing in of footage from other films ? some of it is fine to provide images, stimuli or just as a base but again mostly this is used to mock the subjects after the fact, the most unnecessary and annoying example being the use of Scarface ? the guy was doing fine making himself look crazy, it didn't need the heavy hand.I read a comment on this website that said if you disagree with Maher then the film is not for you, it is about you ? sadly I have to agree with that. This film will do best with those who are coming to watch Maher put the boot in without a lot of finesse or intelligence ? just like he often does on Real Time. There are plenty of moments where he makes very good points and allows his subjects to talk themselves into a corner but too often he is selecting weak targets (people at a theme park!), mocking them with easy gags, letting them make themselves look like idiots (which many are) and then standing back as if he has proved something beyond the point that this person, right here, is an idiot, which he has not. It is a real shame because this should be a film for everyone ? even if not everyone likes it. If he is serious about his plea for moderates to look in the mirror then he needs to make a film that does that and, sadly, this isn't it. It provides food for thought and I did find it a rousing challenge to religion but it is nowhere near the film that he should have made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only the Choir To Which Maher Preaches Will See This Film, But That's the Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One issue one could have with Religulous is that it doesn't seem reasonable to believe that the religious literalists who are the targets of the film will see it, realize the futility and archaic silliness of their beliefs and change. But, really, if you consider the way Bill Maher speaks to his interviewees, the way he comments as director Larry Charles interviews him during the film's road trip, and Maher's overall embitterment towards religion evidenced clearly in his stand-up act and on his show Real Time With Bill Maher, you will see that this film is not made to change minds but to reassure those who already understand that lack of necessity and the danger of futility and bigotry in religion that they are not alone and that there are hit movies like this that defend the viewpoints they are reticent to voice themselves.At a recent book signing at Joseph-Beth Booksellers here in Cincinnati, I spoke with screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who recently found Christianity through his dilemma with throat cancer. (Yes, that Joe Eszterhas.) He claims to find it nearly impossible to sell his new script about St. Paul to Hollywood, professing that it's because there is a bias against Christianity in the studio system. Maher feels otherwise. His admitted intention behind making this comic documentary is because religious epics that have poured out of Hollywood since the dawn of cinema have endeared audiences to religions that, especially in their organized forms, preach and imply startling aversions to scientific and historical facts, take advantage of certain texts as means of racism, sexism and homophobia and other such things.I am just now getting around to writing about Religulous, which I saw weeks before the Joe Eszterhas book signing, but I can't help but wonder about the differing viewpoints of a hilarious, righteously cynical Libertarian with whom I consistently agree and one of the highest-paid screenwriters who has worked for nearly half a century in the very system that he claims to oppose his newfound beliefs. Really, the truly surprising breadth of this film's release and commercial success (though I do know a few people in St. Louis who, last time we spoke, claimed it had yet to show there) should affirm Eszterhas's viewpoint, but actually seeing Maher's film is a different story.This admittedly and purposely biased documentary is about Bill Maher's view of religion. As I find that he usually is, he's very smart, shrewd and funny, and I found the film pleasurable, even if from time to time he's a little unkind to his interviewees, who come off as objects of ridicule. He goes to holy places in Italy, Israel, Great Britain, Florida, Missouri and Utah, and talks with fanatics of the religions he confronts there.A good confirmation of what I said earlier about opponents of Maher's views not being affected at all by this film is that he interrupts, talks over, spots subtitles and inserts movie and TV clips. The film's preaching to the converted and alienating of the non-converted is not a misstep by Maher and director Charles, but rather the intention. We relish his misconduct. The people he interviews are shockingly patient and tolerant, even most, not all, of the truckers in a makeshift truck stop chapel. You are dreading the point where one assaults Maher, but nobody does, although one trucker balls a fist and says, "You got a problem." Later in the film, there is an interesting moment where Maher walks out on a rabbi who favorably attend a Holocaust denial conference in Iran.Persistently, Maher's altercations regard logical inconsistencies of holy books. Did Jonah really live for three days in the belly of a whale? No, of course not! It was a large fish! There are people who believe it. Is the End of Days nigh? A rather decent U.S. senator thinks so. Will the Rapture arise in our lifetimes? Common accord. Mormons believe Missouri will be the place to be, to which Maher quips with impeccable timing, "Branson, I hope." Maher visits the Creation Museum, to which I've been, thus I can corroborate the diorama of human children playing at the feet of dinosaurs. He didn't even penetrate the surface of what I saw there.His two most logical guests, ironically, are Vatican priests, who with pleasure write off large parts of widely perceived Catholic beliefs, including the existence of Hell. One of these priests dies laughing as he mentions various beliefs that I was taught at Nativity Elementary. The other remarks that Jesus is polled sixth person to which Italians pray in crisis. The Hispanic pastor who believes he is the second coming of Christ will be disappointed.Maher also has ominous questions Muslims about whether or not the Koran orders the death of infidels, leading to a frightening climax where he ties organized religion to a premature nuclear apocalypse, leaving us with the feeling that religion must be overshadowed for us to survive.Religion is harmful to progress. Faith is the benefit of not thinking. Doubt is respectful. The Republicans I know personally all hate Bill Maher. No surprise there, but my point is this: There is little to zero chance that they, who tend to believe what this film ridicules, will see this film, and every chance that those of us, like me, who already love him, will rush to see this because essentially, it turns out to be a rallying of secularists who should be more alarmed and more active than they are. Maher's persona and his approach to the material are totally in sync with the midpoint of your any given agnostic intellectual young person, like me for instance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny For The Most Part But Shows Signs Of Moral Cowerdice While Tackling The Serious Bits At The End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing I believe to be the worst thing ever invented it's religion . Having been brought up in the west of Scotland , having traveled in the Middle East and the Indian sub continent I've not seen any evidence that religion is all its forms as being a force of good . I also find it impossible that after Marx stated that human beings are a product of conditioning and Darwin stated we're merely vessels to carry on our DNA to propagate our species anyone can believe in a creator or afterlife so anyone making a documentary putting the boot in to religion is only a good thing in my opinion The film with comedian Bill Maher giving the audience his background as being brought up in a mixed Cathoilc /Jewish background and any fears that RELIGULOUS was going to be more about Maher's rather than religion are soon dispelled as he arrives in a " Truckers Chapel " for his first set of victims who inform Maher and the audience that the Turin shroud was tested and was found to have female blood on it hence it proves a miracle has taken place . Hmmmm I can see why they're driving trucks for a living and not lecturing at Harvard on subjects like Astro-physics and logic . To be fair though this Chapel has a slightly more multi-ethnic flavour than you'd expect to see in a lot of mainstream churches in America The first two thirds of the film play along in this irreverent style . Maher interviews someone and the interview is cut with clips from Hollywood movies . Everyone will their favourite LOL bits such asformer singer Dr Cummingsfailing to remember the passage from Matthew that it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God , the Senator stating that you don't need to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate and my favourite moment Jose Miranda cheerfully telling the world that he is directly descended from Christ and is indeed the second coming . Cut to a clip from SCARFACE with Pacino saying " You know what I'm talking about you f--ckin' cockroach " . One thinks Dan Brown has the same opinion of Miranda and might find himself the subject of a court case . Miranda after all isn't short of money and his talent for spinning out unlikely stories is better than Brown's tall tales Some people have a problem with the way the interviews are edited . You have to take onboard that this is the curse of all documentary film making - you've no idea what has been left out and what's taken out of context . This is irrelevant since it doesn't matter what's been said - the subjects have said it and it's nonsense no matter what context it's been said in . Where the documentary does fail is when Maher takes on the Muslims and the whole tone changes . He interviews a couple of gay Muslims in Holland who enjoy Maher's jovial style but Maher doesn't seem keen to rip in to Muslim interviewees with his style . I guess the subject of Salman Rushdie being brought up might have had something to do with this . Likewise Maher suggests Muslims aren't keen to criticise their religion to outsiders . Why didn't you say this to the Muslims you were interviewing instead of saying it to your film crew Bill ? Somewhat unforgivably Maher interviews an Iman in The Dome On The Rock and and some Muslims in the background start speaking to one another . As the trivia section of this page says what the men are really saying isn't being translated on screen correctly . So much for the moral superiority of secularism Maher also lets himself down finishing with a montage of clips of war , carnage and all other types of apocalyptic imagery but both Maher and director Larry Charles should have picked these clips more carefully . We're shown clips that include both Yasser Arafat and Colonel Gadaffi both of whom were secular , leftist leaning leaders who unlike so many leaders in the Middle East at least didn't subjugate women simply because they were women . They murdered people and played the religion card when it suited them but even they don't deserve to be labelled as theocrats . Likewise is there a moral equivalence in showing clips featuring George W Bush and Mahmoud Ahmidinejad . Say what you like about America but at least it's a democracy unlike many countries in the Middle East Finally Maher ruins much of what has gone before by finishing with the statement that no one knows what happens when we die and anyone who does shouldn't be listened to . . The problem with this argument is that from a totally logical point of view the both the religious and secular point of view are of equal grounding ie " ! believe in an afterlife " has the same evidential argument as someone stating " I don't believe in an afterlife " . It's an agnostic argument . An atheist argument would be " People have claimed through the ages there is a creator and an afterlife but have failed to produce a single shred of evidence for this . It's more logical to assume eternal oblivion awaits us after death and that's why there's no evidence offered for an afterlife "</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think anyone who goes to see this film will not find anything they did not expect. If you appreciate Bill Maher's comedy and his programs you will enjoy this movie. Is he totally one sided? Sure. Is his approach confrontational? You bet. But that is what Bill is about. That is what makes him funny.As for some people's complaint that he does not go far enough to debunk religion; how could one expect that he would have the time to do so? Rather there tear down the walls of each of the main religions addressed in the film, he simply throws rocks at them attempting to crack the glass ceilings. He wants us to doubt. he wants us not to feel guilty about doubt. He wants us to question whether or not it is healthy for our political leaders to make judgments based solely on religious beliefs.In that regard, I think the film succeeds.</fullReview>

Especially the ending scene, it was the most important and powerful part of the movie. I even applaud for it in the end. Best movie I've seen this year since Dark Knight. Few things to judge was the people he found to speak with. I understand it wouldn't be easy or even possible to get interview with the Pope. I wish he had translator when he went to Isreal. I'll say it again MUST SEE!!!... If I had it on DVD I would copy it to all my friends and family. (and all the crazy christians.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a scary film. When you see the fervor of religious fundamentalism of all faiths, one fears for the future. I quote from an earlier reviewer above, "You may have chills running down your back as you listen to Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Arkansas), sitting in his Capitol office, speaking about his belief in Creationism and the literal interpretation of the Bible. You don't need to be a Christian to be offended (and amused) by the commercial Jesus impersonators Maher interviews, and you may feel a bit sorry for the Pentecostals speaking in tongues. (Gov. Palin and John Ashcroft, neither featured in "Religulous," are members of that church.)" A candidate for VP of the United States (not seen in this film) wants to teach creationism in the schools, wants to personally censor books in her town library, God help us. (Oh yes, forgot, I don't believe there is a God.) Bill Maher did not have to mock religion. The people seen in this film did a fine job of mocking themselves. A husky Latino impeccably dressed in a $4,000 suit with accompanying bling leads a large congregation who appear to believe him when he tells them "I am Jesus Christ returned!" He seems to believe it himself when asked directly by Bill Maher.And "Holy Land" in Florida? An audience watches in awe as the Crucifixion of Jesus is re-enacted. People are shedding tears, hands clasped reaching to the heavens, praying, (Oh yes, and rushing up to take close-up pictures as Jesus is led to the cross.) But wait, we are not finished. Believe it or not, there are dancing girls! Mel Gibson must have missed a bet when he made his film "The Passion of the Christ" when he did not make it into a musical. Never a believer, I always thought many hymns and all Christmas carols were beautiful, but I think this wonderful music is degraded when actually linked to scenes of Jesus being put up on the cross.Yes, true believers will be offended by Bill Maher's movie. Those who need to question their beliefs the most, will not. Atheists and agnostics can only shudder at the religionists seen in this film.Bill Maher deserves maximum credit, when at the end of the movie, he says only, "I am just left with doubt."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move Thee Reviews: A Hilarious Blend of Religions and Ridiculousness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religulous is a hilarious, comprehensive and thought-provoking documentary pinpointing the ridiculousness and terror of different religions.Some human beings, in the name of God, invade other countries, kill people, ask others not to use condoms, spread seeds of hatred for homosexuals and so on. Does God really exist? Is it likely that humans distort his words? Is religion detrimental to the progress of humanity? Is it good to have unquestionable faith in God? Out of many gods in the world, which one is truly the creator of the universe? Thanks to Bill Maher, a very humorous, eloquent and quick-witted comedian; the observant cinematography capturing the right moments and facial expressions; the effective soundtrack highlighting different tones of the film; as well as the witty editing inserting footage of old movies, speeches, news, etc, at the right moment, the movie guarantees hearty laughs among atheists, offended frowns among believers and, the most importantly, enlightened expressions among some human beings who begin to doubt (e.g. the virgin birth, a talking snake, a man living inside a fish for 3 days, etc), instead of asserting with arrogant certitude the existence of gods which cannot be scientifically proved.Believers should be forewarned that the movie makes jokes about religions and they may feel offended. Nevertheless, some find the jokes necessary because they hammer the irrationality and danger of religions into people's hearts. That is also why the film is called Religulous, a hilarious blend of ridiculousness and religions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the main reasons I became so disenchanted with organized religion as an adult was because I suspected that for all the proselytizing done by religious leaders from every stripe, it all boils down the same kind of mentality of a bunch of kids on a grade school playground talking smack. Only when you're addressing the subject of dissenting religions and their more fervent believers, these 'kids' talking smack have armies and weapons...and some of those weapons are nuclear.Leave it to Bill Maher, the driving force behind HBO's outstanding award-winning forum show REAL TIME to confirm my worst fears with a movie like RELIGULOUS...and to have me laughing even while contemplating the sobering and very tangible possibility of the human race's lemming-like march toward self-destruction, with such wonderful figureheads as Georgie Bush, Pat Robertson and Mahmoud Ahmedinijad (sp?) at the head of the parade. With a much more respectful tone than I would've expected from him, Maher pokes and prods several different religious leaders, scholars and followers from around the world with the not-completely subversive agenda of looking for answers, and finding that basically many of these dittoheads have no greater handle on the Big Questions That Matter than Bill himself or Joe Schmoe down the street. Only none of them will cop to it in the name of preserving their bottom line, which on the face of it, is about the same things that Politics are about: Money, Power and Control.Not quite a documentary and not quite an out-and-out fictional 'dramedy', what RELIGULOUS does is ask its audience to engage in something that most of the people for whom this film is intended are already doing: THINKING FOR THEMSELVES. Something most politicians and religious movers-and-shakers are hoping like hell you WON'T do.Overall, I don't think that just a little over ninety minutes is enough time to devote to the issues and questions that Maher presents here. Still, it's a job well done, and I only hope that the message reaches more than just those who are more than happy to listen and then discuss it afterward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" Religion is the Opium of the Masses " stated Karl Marx. Once said, dozens of professional people have tried over several decades to learn why. Upon their conclusions, their gathered facts have not impressed anyone already convinced they're wrong. Bill Maher, is America's popular stand-up comedian, television host, social critic, political commentator and author. In this interesting film called " Religulous " he sets out to learn if the leaders who profess to 'Know' or understand what they believe is actually what the espouse. A wide range of views on the various world religions are explored as Bill travels to numerous destinations, such as Jerusalem, Vatican, and Salt Lake City. As he stops to interview believers from various backgrounds, groups, including Jews, Christians, Muslims, former Mormons and Scientologists, we learn, what is often preached is not always what is practiced. But then anyone who has studied Religion from the inside, realize that religion and Faith are often two different things. The fact that more people have died in the name of religious beliefs, than any other reason, escapes the logic of people of the same faith. The result is a core of ribald humor to the extreme out-right comedic laughter produced when one listens to the heads of faith as they profess their beliefs. Maher allows the audience to judge for themselves the mental clarity of those who preach and the resulting torrent of confusion, thus becomes the source of the world's insanity. Many of these religious leaders all profess peace, but would gladly raise armies to destroy anyone who believes otherwise. Thus proving Maher's point of view. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Maher Fies Up The Atheist Contingent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religulous, the new documentary by Larry Charles and Bill Maher brings Bill Maher on a quest for knowledge about a subject that he is very passionate about debunking...religion. Religions of all types, but primarily Christianity. I am a fan of Bill Maher, so I enjoyed this film. many religious people are outraged by the film (what a shock) but I do think if you look at it objectively, Bill Maher is going to many different places around the world and simply asking questions about religion and why religions should be believed. My main critique is that sometimes he launches into his pretentious holier than thou pontification that gets boring if it goes too long.From the Holy Land Experience in Orlando, Florida to the Holy Land in Jerusalem, with stops at the Vatican, Amsterdam and even a trucker's chapel in Raleigh, North Carolina, Bill Maher explores the nature of religions and also looks to support his hypothesis that religions are dangerous institutions that should be stopped. From some of the people he was speaking to, he certainly has a point. His main targets are Christianity and Islam. Judaism gets some flack, but for the most part, I felt like they were given a pass. One of my favorite moments was at the Vatican, speaking to a zany priest, who actually was of the opinion that a lot of what we are led to believe is untrue, it's a great interview. Other highlights were his take on Scientology and Mormonism. It's also good to check out the deleted scenes because Bill and Larry found some pretty off the wall folks who believe anything from Presidents Bush 1 and 2 being part lizard to a pretty scary anti abortionist. Maher is preaching to the choir and I doubt he will convert many non atheists but it is entertaining and he does bring up legitimate points about some of the prominent religions of the world. I would've like to have seen eastern religions also explored as well.</fullReview>

This documentary reveals how the closed minded and ignorant dogmas rule millions of people's lives who blindly believe and subject themselves to be slaves to other men. From these blind beliefs stems mankind's ignorance, hatred of others with different beliefs, and the will to kill. As Maher points out without using extravagant or misleading vocabulary, the fate of mankind are in the hands of a few men who claim to be prophets and they propose that they can "talk to God." The bottom line is that they are just as greedy and ignorant earthly men as those are who blindly follow and believe whatever these men preach to them. Steve H. Chicago, IL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking on Digg for the latest episode of James Gunn's PG Porn and I found this free. What a deal, as I have been wanting to see it.Those who believe will not be fans of this movie. It ridicules their beliefs, and, quite frankly, exposes them for the frauds they are.Maher has done and excellent job of displaying just how ridiculous these beliefs are, and how dangerous they are to society. As he states, "If you believe that the world is going to come to an end - and perhaps any day now - does it not drain one's motivation to improve life on earth while we're here?" Excellent point, I believe.It is not just the fact that we are not focused on improving society. Maher makes a big point of the destruction and death brought about by religious people. "If the world does come to an end here, or wherever, or if it limps into the future decimated by the effects of religion-inspired nuclear terrorism, let's remember what the real problem was, that we learned how to precipitate mass death before we got past the neurological disorder of wishing for it." This movie will just reinforce the 13% of Americans that do not believe, and it may gain a few new adherents, but, unfortunately, it will do nothing for the masses of religious people who are steeped in bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, violence and sheer ignorance.</fullReview>

Who could ask for more? Bill Mayer is just asking questions -he says it himself. People don't have to answer. One guy didn't like what Mr. Maher was asking so he got up and left. Good for him.

		<shortDescription>The Real Joke is Calling This a Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This starts out as any typical documentary where Bill Maher presents that he is on a journey to find the truth about the validity or stupidity of religion. By claiming agnosticism (when clearly he is not) Maher pretends to be fair by acting like he is un-biasedly going to explore religion, saying "I have to find out." Shortly afterward one can clearly see that this is purely a Bill Maher ego trip and a Borat-style type of mockumentary. He doesn't really bring any debate, discussion of issues, or scrutiny to the table. Instead he just resorts to a religious joke fest which is all very entertaining and humorous, but then the real joke is calling this an intellectual documentary on the criticism of religion.To prove his points he finds only the most extreme or corrupt religious fanatics that are even considered nutcases in their own respective religious communities. He especially loves throwing loaded questions to people who are unlearned in their religion, or others who have skewed off-base and non-canon ideas within their own beliefs. He questions laymen and doesn't once acknowledge the experts or learned crowd in religion.Some of his subjects include pastors who don't even know what their bible says, a Jew who doesn't believe Israel is currently a nation who supports that the holocaust was from God, gay Muslims, a weed smoking church, and a Jewish inventor that creates contraptions to avoid Sabbath laws. These people are all extremely obscure and on the outer fringes of these religious groups.At one point Maher even tries to argue that the existence of the historical man Jesus was up for debate. I don't know if he actually believes this or if he was just trying to fluster the interviewee and make him falter (I think the latter). But if he does actually believe this he would be laughed out academia by nearly every scholar, theist and atheist alike.Bill does make many valid criticisms of religions but the problem is he leaves no room for any real intellectual rebuttal. He is mostly catching people off-guard and asking loaded questions. He had some good points like on the U.S. not being founded as a Christian nation, or the absurd idea that "Christianity is American." But there were other claimed "facts" completely false like his information on the Horus/Jesus debate or pulling despicable Biblical stories and not really addressing what those passages were actually about. Maher also asserts that all religion is violent, when in fact just as much or more violence has been done in the name of no religion. He eventually moves on to other religions, but really never far from Judaism based ones which really doesn't touch on most of the world.This is without a doubt a very funny piece (unless you are extremely offended by it all), but it would be completely inaccurate to call it an intellectual one. It's just Bill Maher being Bill Maher. Even to the point of him bringing up other irrelevant issues like his views on the environment and nuclear applications. He didn't actually do extensive research, he's mostly just shooting from the hip and catching dumb people off-guard. The makers even cut the scenes cleverly in the interviews (weird pauses, strange faces) for extra awkwardness and comedy.The only thing this "documentary" really proved was that there are a lot of people that believe strange things some of them being very stupid. Most people watching this already knew that beforehand. At one point Maher says: "Religion is arrogant certitude," which ironically also perfectly describes himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I'd call a documentary, but still a very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start this off by saying don't go into this movie looking for a sound, quality documentary because you won't get one. It is so choppy you really have no idea what the actual response is to most of Maher's questions. Maybe it was what the movie showed it to be, it is possible, but its just as possible that it wasn't really what they said. I'd definitely be very interested to see the full interviews with the people because a lot of the time they don't even look like they realize their being made fun and there's no way they don't know they're being made fun of when its that obvious.I gave the movie an 8 because it was an incredibly entertaining movie. It was a absolutely hilarious and really does raise completely valid points about religion and faith and god even though it does so in what some may find to be an offensive manner. It does a very good job at making religious people look like morons so who can blame them for being upset? However, even if you are religious you should see it. No one says you have to like it or agree with it, you can vehemently hate it for all I care, but you cannot intelligently say something is bad or offensive or anything else without seeing it.Final verdict: Whether you love it or hate it, it's worth the watch because it raises good questions that everyone should consider.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe it is courageous of Bill Maher to tackle such a big and personal matter as religion. This film is made with the pure intent to try and get an honest understanding on how religions work within the human psyche from the perspective of a non-religious believer.An intriguing piece of work which clearly shows you the inconsistencies in the fundamentals on which many religions are based. He challenges believers of all major religions (from Christianity and Judaism to Islam and from Mormons to Scientology) with critical questions and honestly tries to understand their view. Also he adds a little Maher-ish humor to this documentary which makes these heavily loaded discussions on religion easier to chew on.Some may say it is easy to criticize religion; I believe it takes some balls to get your opinion as a non-believer in the open. Allot of religious (fanatics) claim to have a "monopoly on the truth" which makes it hard for people who are non-religious to get their opinion out in the open. Maybe it is better to believe and even more important LET BELIEVE.all in all: very interesting documentary! Highly Recommendable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damn , I hate giving out 10s . I hope I do not go to hell for saying the word damn lol. But seriously , this movie was awesome. I wanted to wet my feet so to speak, so I saw it on Pay-per-view , at just 3.99. I will probably buy it in 4 months or so online, when the price is greatly reduced or in the bargain bin at a video store . The movie covered many questions I pose to so called religious people. For example, .. If afterlife is better why not commit suicide? or another favorite... Are humans too stupid to get murder is wrong on their own? Maher was truly golden and yes I admit I probably did not learn much from this movie , for I have been an atheist for close to 30 years of my 45 year old life. I do though find it fascinating that the virgin Mary concept and 'The Rising in 3 days ' is not new. So I did learn a couple of things. I also must give kudos to Mr. Maher for finding a Gay Muslim Bar and an orthodox rabbi that does not believe Jews are entitled to the holy land. Yes , Mr. Maher challenged the Christian Church for 85 percent of the movie, but he did challenge Jews, Muslims and even a pot smoking cannabis religion . It was a thorough ,powerful documentary that hopefully , at the very least gets people to think and open their closed minds. I would suggest this film to all .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rated 9 out of 10 just based on how hard we laughed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although as a documentary there were moments the timing was off, or I found myself wondering where they were going with this or that bit, over all I have to say we laughed throughout. Don't get me wrong, it was VERY funny. Everyone in the audience was laughing, it was funny like a night of stand-up, and rare for a documentary to be that funny.However, I have to say it was a little uneven. I get the feeling that the longer they were at it, the less patience Bill Maher had with people... and I also got the feeling that often, they were a) just making it up as they went along and b) didn't really resolve things well. Some parts of the film were carried off much better than others, and there wasn't a sense that the filmmakers were always in control of their subjects.On an 'it is what it is' basis, it was the funniest film of the year. It was great to laugh that hard. But, because it did present it as a documentary, documentaries have a point or tell a story, and with Bill Maher stating right at the outset that his point of view is "I don't know... " well, that's where it fell flat as a documentary... because the documentary style alludes to some sort of conclusion.And maybe if the summation was more lofty and philosophical I would not have felt lost, but I got this sense that Bill was over it, ready for the end of the show, ready to get on to something else, and perhaps even sorry he'd opened the can of worms.Part of what is funny is what real people said and did and were captured as being. Since I've grown up on the coasts, in the blue states, I was a little astounded to see some of the 'red state' lifestyle revealed as it was in this film.. but we've seen stuff like this before.I was reminded of some Daily Show segments, for instance. I was also reminded of cable network programs like "The Naked Archaeologist" and "Taboo". OK.. that's it.. it was more like a TV program than a feature film. I was happy to pay for it and everyone there had a great time, but it didn't feel like a feature documentary... didn't answer a lot of questions.I know this all sounds like I'm being terribly critical, but I'm THINKING about it. I need to stress and stress again: it was a blast, it was hilarious, and it did raise questions.. it did show aspects of religious behavior here and in other countries in a revealing light... but it was not as fully reconciled as I would have preferred. At the end of the day I felt like OK we're done now, Goodbye.There's a lot more I would have recommended doing with the subject matter, and I do believe things could have been presented in less of an aimless style...But despite all this criticism, OMG it was sooooo funny. The entire audience I saw with film with were totally side-splittingly cracked up. So I do recommend it, just remember: this was Bill Maher and Larry Charles, not National Geographic or 60 Minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Maher's audacious look at the hottest red-button topic of all, "Religulous," is a vastly entertaining and informative documentary about the craziest aspects of religion. Although most Eastern faiths were ignored, Maher found a number of interesting, loony, unhinged, bigoted, and, occasionally, rational believers of Christianity, Mormonism, Scientology, Judaism, Islam, and splinter sects to comment and opine on their faiths. No one will accuse Maher of impartiality. His questions are pointed, and he loses patience with his subjects when they remain obstinate. Only two Catholic priests show much rationality. Most of those interviewed express extreme, unyielding views, which can be entertaining, but certainly do not yield a balanced look at religion or its importance to many. The finale of the documentary is an anti-religion screed as strident as that of any televangelist.Despite its heavy handed, lopsided view, "Religulous" provides lots of brain food and will open viewers' eyes to the dangers of blind belief in anything. A few of the subjects interviewed are so evidently unhinged and hold such bizarre beliefs that most viewers will find it inconceivable that they have followers. From a Latino preacher who believes himself the direct descendant of Christ to a Rabbi who rejects Israel and embraces the president of Iran to a past-his-prime hippie who worships cannabis, Maher has dragged out a loony bunch to underscore his belief that religion is irrational. However, the parallels between the lives and works of pre-Christian gods with the life and work of Christ were illuminating, and some of the most bizarre theological aspects of Scientology and Mormonism strain belief that educated people could even entertain them, let alone embrace them. Maher injects some great one-liners into the interviews that keep the proceedings from sagging under the weight of the topic. His parting shot to a "cured" gay minister is priceless.Certain to offend many, if not most, people, nevertheless, Bill Maher's "Religulous" will be fresh and original to the 16 percent of Americans who are non-believers. With the cable channels filled 24/7 with the likes of Pat Robertson, a definite need and place exists for views from the other side. Maher does not pretend to know the Truth and that is his message: no one knows the Truth and anyone who thinks that he or she does is dangerous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and I very much enjoyed this movie! And yes, we are Christians. Even for those who believe, this movie is a must-see. It's not super in-depth. How deep can you go in 1.5 hours? But it's very entertaining and challenging to those who have never stopped to question all the pitfalls of structured religion. With ubiquitous religious fanaticism bordering on absurd and with the lines between church and state becoming more and more blurry by the minute, this movie will open eyes to the dangers of extremism and what I call "religion gone wild."Highly recommended to anyone concerned about the unholy alliance between Christian extremists and the Bush administration, as well as for all American patriots who naively believe there aren't zealots in this country who want to make America into a new Christian Theocracy, a quick google search of the "Constitution Party" and a viewing of this movie might just be the serious wake-up call you need. The showing I viewed was completely sold out and earned a raucous round of applause at its conclusion. Not only that, but also many people lingered outside the theatre to discuss the movie and their feelings about it. All in all, well worth the money - smart, funny, and informative - and others who watched felt the same way.</fullReview>

Now if Bill Maher wants to get across his point on religion, why would he choose to talk to these dim witted fanatics. You really don't have to interview them to make them look stupid. Surely, if he was confident of his own beliefs, he would have talked or debated with more "intellectual" religious leaders or followers, at least those who can present a counterpoint, engage in a reasonable discussion. Bill Maher would have earned a lot more respect had he done that, instead they resort to cutting off people's statement, editing and interspersing it with some pop culture moments and movie scenes, to take the mickey out these guys.I am sorry Bill Maher, you have ruined an opportunity to create some genuine discussion and reduced it to odd moments of "shitz and giggles".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie, I felt a bit like getting a wrapped-up roll of toilet paper for Christmas, accompanied by a card that says 'It's the thought that counts'.Any roundabout approach to a difficult subject will invariably have its shortcomings, but 'Religulous', in my humble view, never makes off the ground of its failed premise and overbearing protagonist, who is all but funny in his annoying showman attitude.I consider myself part of the target demographic group of agnostic academics with an alternative lifestyle, but I'm still rather offended by Bill Maher. It is usually more offending when a media product tries to pass itself off as smarter than it is instead of focusing on plain entertainment.Bill Maher's premise and ultimate message is that if the dissenting minority of this world does not unite against raving religious fanatics, these may bring civilization to ultimate ruin. He does not address the interesting question of how such a union could be achieved, and how it is supposed to vanquish fanaticism without resorting to fanatical methods. He also ignores the fact that conflict between intelligence and religion is not necessarily a latter-day occurrence, but can be traced red-thread like through the histories of all civilizations.He criticizes intellectual timidity in the face of ridiculous gibberish, altogether ignoring that such humble timidity is in fact a rather quintessential feature of intelligence per se. He resorts to scientific generalizations to counter theological generalizations of his (fairly unimpressive) interview partners, or better to say victims, as he wastes no time to rush into revealing them as frauds. In order to achieve this objective, he frequently jumps to irrelevant conclusions, confusing his victims so that a close-up camera shot may catch a puzzled face, thus the viewer may go ha!, there you have it, just another phony. As if anyone interested in the film's subject would not already have his or her own doubts on that. Inbetween these shenanigans, Maher and his crew have themselves evicted from the Vatican and the grounds of the Mormon temple in Salt Lake City, going oh! see how intolerant these religulous people are. As if any of us would not call the police if a camera team posted itself on our front lawn without prior notice.To justify my complete dismissal of this film, let me elaborate on one detail. Maher juxtaposes the pseudo-Christian statements of a 'reformed' former gay man counseling other homosexuals to that end with a two-second snippet of footage confirming with a scientist the existence of a 'gay gene'. That is to say: look, a scientist says there is a gay gene, so it's an established fact that gays are biologically preconditioned, and here you are talking about what the bible says. That is just as totalitarian an approach as saying gays are an abomination to god: if you want to eliminate the element of choice from such an individually complex field as sexuality, you're being as dogmatic as the haters. Another very critical issue is the treatment of Islam. There is some footage of a Mollah rambling 'In the name of peace, all infidels must die' or so, and Maher refers to the Fatwa against Salman Rushdie as a hint to a general intolerance of free speech in Islam, rather than fanaticism being the result of politics, as his Muslim interviewees say. He ignores the fact that the highest authorities of Islam dismissed this Fatwa and excommunicated its instigator Ayatollah Khomeini, and that Rushdie himself is of a Muslim background and has attributed the Fatwa to the political radicalization of Islam. Maher also alleges that Muslims would never agree to an outsider that something is wrong with their religion. Obviously Maher is not familiar with the works of Tariq Ali, Edward Said or even Rushdie himself, who all call for a reform of Islam. This makes me suspect that much of the criticism against religion in general is actually voiced in order to be able to bash Islam in a 'politically correct' way.Sadly, 'Religulous' points out that dogmas can only be replaced by other dogmas in public discourse. I give it to Maher that 'either you agree with me or you are a loony' is still a better statement than 'either you agree with me or you're an enemy of god'. But the fact remains that all there is to see in this film is the competition of attention-grabbing individuals too full of themselves to care how similar they are to each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religion according to Bill Maher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher, the talented television personality, takes a stab at organized religion in this documentary where he sets on a journey to learn what makes people believe in the convictions they identify with. For that purpose, he questions the sanity about almost every type of what is known as an established form of worship by asking the people interviewed to explain things that obviously have always been in his mind, which Mr. Maher considers puzzling, for lack of a better explanation.One of the main things that have bothered Bill Maher is how most religions swear the world in which we live has only been around for about five thousand years, when science has proved otherwise. He also goes on to ridicule Adam and Eve and the speaking serpent. Another topic that annoys him is the ridiculous tale of the man that lived inside a big fish.Bill Maher goes to America's heartland to show us those biblical 'theme parks' that attract people from all over. There is even an enactment of the passion of Christ done in what appears a serious way, where the tourists snap pictures and even applaud after the crucifixion concludes. We are also taken to a man who turns gays into straight law abiding citizens. This man, himself, turned his life around by marrying a lesbian and fathering children! The comedian examines his own family life. By right, he is a Jew. He was born from a non-religious Jewish woman who married his father, a practicing catholic. Everything for his father came to an abrupt end when he questioned the insanity of not being allowed to use contraceptives prohibited by his church. Catholics, Jews, Mormons, Evangelicals, Muslims, as well as other types of beliefs are questioned equally. Two of the best moments in the documentary have to be the conversation with the black minister that loves to wear flashy jewelry, as well as suits that are worth more than a thousand dollars. Another funny highlight comes in the shape of Jesus Luis De Jesus MIranda who proclaims he is the new Jesus Christ in his second coming. The rabbi that attended Iran's conference that denounced the existence of the Holocaust is too ridiculous for words. Same applies to the scientist that produces devices to help Jews to observe the Sabbath by not touching anything mechanic, or electric.The documentary was directed by Larry Charles, a man whose sense of humor serves well the material presented. Bill Maher is seen at his best. In a way, we kept thinking of George Carlin, a man obsessed in all those annoying things people take for granted that defy the rules of logic. Bill Maher takes it a step further annoying most of the people he questions and the answers he gets from apparently smart people. "Religulous" is an entertaining piece that might not be suitable for viewers with strong convictions about what they believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Maher makes a lot of sense. he says what he thinks, and what he thinks is usually very logical. I don't agre with everything he says, but his overall message is one i have waited my entire life to hear publicly. I cant remember if he said anything like this or not, if not i wish he had, its been my only "religion" for years; Don't speculate about things nobody, literally nobody, actually knows anything about. claiming to know what happens after life, for example. Bill does speak of the damage that organized religion causes and its true, its an extremely destructive force. Not that you asked, but my advice is don't believe anything without solid proof. Many people think they need faith, to keep them strong through a loss, or keep their sanity, whatever the reason. Faith has been known to help people cope with difficult times, but at what cost. millions of people hate other millions of people essentially because they have different beliefs. I have suffered much personal loss, and no amount of faith can bring back those i love. No, i had to accept that loss is just a part of life, i march on because that is all i can do. Its really no ones business what you think about religion. Please don't try and convert, judge, harm or ridicule other people based on what they believe. unless maybe its constructive criticism aimed at preventing them from doing these things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just hilarious. As a very outspoken athiest I really enjoyed seeing all the religious people get stumped when bill asked the questions.I think this movie was a great idea because there is far to many people in this world still believing in false rubbish. Even though gods basically been proved wrong.This movie is very simple. Bill Maher just goes around to different branches of religious people asking them questions about there religion. He pokes fun at them and asks them questions in which they have no answers to.If you are religious I highly recommend you watch this movie and grow up a bit. Like I stopped believing in god around the same time as santa claus maybe the rest of you should do some reasearch. Religion spreads hate and violence. It needs to end so please religious or not watch this movie you will love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie very effectively explains all the ways organized religions threaten our planet and the people on it. It does not debunk "god" but instead reveals the idiocy of organized religions and their fairy-tale like qualities that are no more provable than fairy tales themselves. It digs in to Mormonism, Christianity, Islam, Scientology, Judaism, etc. No religion is safe from Bill, as he attempts to get real explanations from true believers. He attempts to ask scientific questions and is repeatedly met with ignorant and moronic stares, and people who say things like "that's not true". Anything that doesn't fit into these people's religions is apparently "not true" even though there is physical evidence. The horrors of the violence that radical religion encourages is highlighted, and is frankly pretty disturbing. If you are one of the religious people you will probably be embarrassed. If you are scientific you will laugh the whole way through as people display dinosaurs cohabiting with people and the like, and try to explain why it is a valid belief system. I laughed so hard there were tears coming out my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie. It was not only funny but also had an important message. The message is that in the Free world you can practice any religion you want. But when looking at religions comparatively, it becomes obvious that all religions survive because they all claim to be the "one true religion." How could that be? Yet, the faithful swear about "their truth." My conclusion is, thanks Bill. Your title is right on, but is difficult to spell without some practice, which is ridiculous too. How about "Believe what you want but there is always someone who will want to kill you if you don't convert?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people just wont see this movie, that's the first thing. They see that Bill Maher, one of the most outspoken critics of religion on all counts (even going as far as to say it's a neurological disorder, which is pointed out at one point in the film as what defines 'crazy'), is presenting a film attacking religion and God and belief and with a final thesis that is basically a rant against all sects including moderate religious believers as enablers of what could be a self-fulfilled prophecy on the end of the world, and will steer clear. It goes without saying that 95% of the country, or just the world, has some level of belief in a higher power if not total unadulterated faith in their religion. If you don't want to get engaged in a dialog of doubt, or are too ignorant to do so, do look elsewhere.But if you've wondered if some of the things in Christianity or Judaism or Islam are strange, kooky, backwards, primitive, or just downright silly and stupid, then Maher delivers about as absorbing a discussion as one could hope for in a popular-documentary format. Popular in the sense that this is meant to be seen by a larger number of people than the average documentary (save for, of course, Michael Moore, whom there is some comparison), and that Maher is a fairly well-known public figure. What he sells, basically, is the belief "I don't know." He may come off as smug to some, but he isn't unfair. One might expect him to go after the simple truckers at their sermon in a Truck-stop chapel build inside of a truck, but he's actually understanding and sympathetic to why some people just need to believe in something if they have nothing else. Insensitive he is not, at least in entirety.With the bigger figures, however, Maher doesn't pull punches, and this is where Maher and Borat director Larry Charles get their gotcha-tactics in perfect swing. Interviews with evangelists, a Senator, an Anti-Zion Rabbi, a British Islam rapper, biggies where Maher asks flat out what they believe, to explain it, and often they're left talking in circles or just saying total malarkey. It's not out of bounds for Maher, as an intelligent interviewer and as a comic, to go for this as he's probing how much these people actually know about their faith (which is sometimes not as much as they'd like to let you believe), or if they are, color-us-shocked, hypocrites like the black preacher with a practical pimp suit tailored for him. Best of all though is a trip Maher takes to the Vatican (where, naturally, he's not allowed for big interviews) and at a Jesus-themed amusement park minutes from Disneyworld where a goofy 'Jesus' makes himself a fool and the park treats its viewers to mock representations of the Passion Play.So Maher and Charles (the latter often appearing in his long hair and beard) have their targets, their point of view, and they include a variety of clips from film and TV to slam in some great jokes and jabs (sometimes as simple as slipping in Mel Brooks as an Indian from Blazing Saddles). But they aren't just crazily throwing out statistics and ambushing people in their interviews, or going for schlock-film-making out of something like Loose Change; they want to engage the debate with the audience as well as their subjects, to inform in good measure (did you know nearly the whole Jesus story is ripped-off from the Egyptians?), and at the same time entertain along the way. It's intentionally provocative, and with a target audience that isn't huge. It's for those who want a little uncertainty expressed where it aught to be, and if it's in fun gimmicks like Bill Maher standing in the spot where Armageddon may someday take place in Israel, so be it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it is funny. Just like when Bill Maher is funny. Often but not always. One of the things I like about Maher is that behind every derogatory outburst there is, usually, a real thinking process. In his "Religulous" he commits a startling mistake. He doesn't allow the possibility of "faith" as a positive not even by mistake. Agree that organized religion has been monstrous in so many different instances that it is a bit of a miracle that it survives but there is also the other side, the positive strength that faith provides and it does in so many different and powerful ways. The one sided views are always annoying and "Religulous" sins of that. I did laugh though, God forgive me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mahar's Religulous is a scathing and usually hilarious look at how billions of people can accept the inanity of religion with a straight face. Mahar forces people all along the religious spectrum and up and down the hierarchy to face the irrationality of talking snakes, voices in heads, and imminent rapture.What I like most about the film is how Mahar picks the craziest religions with the silliest, most childish beliefs, and then demonstrates that mainstream religions are not really any less bizarre.And in case anyone thinks that Mahar is just a liberal, anti-Christian basher of evangelical conservatives, have no doubt that he is an equal opportunity atheist. He goes after Judaism as well, and his pummelling of Islam is merciless.However, the movie is "mahared" by plenty of cheap stunts. As others have noted, Mahar picks on easy targets, even ordinary folks who just happen to be on the street. He generally picks people with bizarre, colorful backgrounds rather than those with the knowledge to counter his thrusts. And he exploits editing and camera tricks to make his subjects appear especially stupid or dumbfounded. I consider myself a fairly rational, reasonably educated person, but if I were jumped on the street by a theist who was "out to get me," then surely I would appear ignorant or irrational at some point.Finally, like many atheists, Mahar criticizes faith generally. IMO, there is considerable faith in science as well, and ultimately human knowledge is limited and uncertain. Mahar makes that point himself, though I'm not sure he's fairly applying it to the non-religious as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I expected better from Bill Maher. Instead of getting into a solid intellectual debate about the merits and pitfalls of different religions and faith, he goes after the low-hanging fruit by debating people who are obviously going on blind faith instead of reasoned belief, and using cheap editing tricks and sound effects to poke fun. And when the real opportunities for serious discussion present themselves, Maher mostly laughs them off instead of taking the chance to engage them. (Watch for the senior Vatican priest in particular - a man willing to concede that there are many fallacies and ideas that should be discredited. Why Maher chooses not to follow this conversation further and ask how this priest reconciles his continued belief with his dismissal of old ideas is a golden opportunity lost.) t's extremely important to search for truths in this life, to question. I thought this movie would be a lot better, but in all actuality it's just Bill Mahar filming himself being a total jerk. In my opinion, it's extremely disrespectful. There's a way to interview people to bring out what they hold as truths and why they hold certain things sacred, but he doesn't even attempt this in the film. He's as closed minded as the people he interviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Maher did a great job with this documentary. Some people think that he unfairly poked fun at his interview subjects but I that was part of what he was trying to do; make fun of religion and the believers. I agree with everything that he says about religion because those were already my views as well.I do, however, think that he could have interviewed more intelligent people (still could have kept some of the dumb ones) but could have at least given the religious representatives a shot. Maybe instead of the weird black "Dr." who doesn't even have a degree of any kind he could have gotten a preacher/reverend with a good reputation who is actually thought of highly by many people.Also, some of the questions he asked seemed incomplete. The only example I can really think of right now is when he asked the store owner something along the lines of "If heaven is so much better, why don't you just kill yourself?" The store owner was speechless but even I knew that suicide is supposed to send a person straight to hell.So, I'm still a fan of the film and I gave it an 8 but I thought a little more could have been done to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start off by pointing out that Bill Maher is an arrogant and pompous a**hole. But for the purpose of this documentary skewering religion, no one could have done a better job of pointing out the hypocrisies of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Maher meets a guy who dresses up ad Jesus, and of course, he has fun with the 21st century messiah. Another discussion is with a self described devout Christian who is asked by the smirking host he actually believes that Jonah lived in the belly of a whale. The answer is predictable.A creationist gets the same mocking treatment for silly statements regarding the age of the earth and mankind. We ran with dinosaurs, you see; Kentucky is a scary place, with its' very own creationism museum. Another preacher comments on the sinful lifestyle of gays. We get a full spectrum of delusional thinking over the course of the film, and your opinion will be based upon personal religious views. As a retired Catholic and rational human being, I loved Religulous.</fullReview>

He gorges upon 5000 years of fruitiness but the results are the usual Maher self- satisfied flatulence.Maher wears pomposity well but seems to forget that a documentary in its' truest form tells its' story free from thesis. Sadly Mr. Maher as an intellectual coward and bully has zero need to let the chips fall where they may. Instead he dabbles in faith as he dabbles in documentary style and delivers insights profound only unto the muddled mind of Bill Maher.I came away from this film wondering if Mr. Maher has any world-view beyond intellectual and spiritual dumpster-diving for cash?As an agnostic, I ache for more insight and reach from our artists and in this film Bill Maher phones in a film, leaving the planet no richer than he found it. I have little love for those of faith except when compared to a bi-polar hedonist / nihilist who spent 101 minutes showing us the sodden melon of a mind and spirit in mid-rot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would consider myself an Agnostic Theist. I truly believe that there is something out there, however, I do not believe in organized religion. And that is what's wonderful about Bill Maher's documentary. The questions he asked, are the questions I throw out on a regular basis, especially when I am being preached to.While it is true that the documentary is very skewed, I also expected no less from Mr. Maher himself. In fact, I am pleasantly surprise at how mild he is with his interviewees, considering how opinionated he is on "Real Time".And while this documentary does not teach me anything new about the religions (I don't think it is meant to), it does show the humanistic side of it. The believers truly believe, and it is a rather touching thought, though a very scary one.The followers in the truck stop chapel were surprisingly nice, and it comforts me to know that there are big hearted Christians out there who allows the difference of opinion.And I am mostly unsurprised at the insights of the two catholic priests, one tells of how it is impossible to have science in the Bible, and another essentially stating that the stories in the Bible are 'pfff'. They understand that the stories in the Bible are metaphorical, and they are not to be taken literally (or literacy as the senator said). And that to me makes the most sense in the entire documentary.I liked this documentary. It's very Bill Maher, but it is definitely not for the believers. But for what it is worth, I actually hoped that he took on a more ridiculing tone in it. It feels a little neither here nor there. I would say that if he wanted to go all the way, he should have gone all the way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2008 brought us two documentaries dealing with religion. One was pro-religion "Expelled" by Ben Stein; the other is this polemic by Bill Maher. I saw both films this year, 2009, in the same week. "Expelled" I thought to be okay, no where near as bad as its reputation. But "Religulous"...this is the better of the two.For those familiar with Bill Maher, it should be no secret that he's not exactly a friend of religion. If anything, he's anti. And REALLY. Many times on his shows he's criticized it, but "Religulous" truly shows the full extend of his views.This film has been criticized for being biased and all that stuff, focusing on the nitwits of religion rather than the smartest and most dignified of it. Yes it's true that this film does focus on the likes of Ted Haggard rather than the more sophisticated theologians. But the thing is, there's probably nothing wrong with that. This film is called "Religulous," a combination of "religion" and "ridiculous." From that title, it should be clear what this film is about: it's about the ridiculous side of religion, and it focuses only on that. It should be noted that this is less of a documentary than a *mockumentary* -- while it documents about religion, it's also a comedy and satire about it. And as a satire, it's just so darn funny.Bill Maher is just so entertaining to watch. His quips are really witty and genuinely funny. But most of all, they illustrate a point. Maher does not hold back. His opinion on organized religion is clear, and he does a heck of a job commenting on it. This film targets Christians, from the Evangelicals in Middle America, including an appearance by Ken Ham of Answers in Genesis, to that scene in the Vatican. Orthodox Jews, moderate and extremist Muslims, Mormons, and scientologists are also not spared.In the style of "Borat" (and even having the same director), this movie features live interviews with actual people in actual places. In fact, it's this realism that makes it so good. The people being interviewed are portrayed as they are, and that includes the whackos of religion. This movie is candid. In fact, too candid. "Religious" isn't afraid to show the awkwardness of the scene. In the scene showing the crucifixion reenactment in the Holy Land Experience theme park, there is the sound of a jet airplane, and the camera immediately takes a shot of it in the sky. In the scene in the Dome of the Rock, the camera takes a shot of people vacuum cleaning he place. This adds a lot of the mockery of the scene, and the hilarity of it all. Heck, this film even shows people in opposition to Maher and his crew filming them, like the scene in the Mormon Temple where they get kicked out! Maher's interactions with the people are casual, upbeat, and playful, with a controlled mockery. The use of subtitles (speaking for Maher when he actually could not), an extra-commentary on the scene, was rather unexpected, and thus funny. The use of footage, from many different films, also adds a lot and do carry Maher's point even farther.If there's any problem in this movie, it's probably the end scene. Showing all the religious turmoil in the world, and the dramatic music playing in the background, and with Maher calling all unbelievers to come out, make this some sort of anti-religion propaganda. It's almost like a rant, and Maher is merely preaching to the already converted. It takes away this film's purpose as a satire. For that, I deduct a few stars.But overall, "Religulous" is a enlightening look at the crazy side of faith and a creative, witty, and genuinely funny comedy. It's a splendid mockery of what Maher considers laughable, in this case, organized religion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very funny, and it was at least slightly informative for those that don't know some of the details of the major religions that are in the USA right now. Pretty much every religion that's mentioned here gets mocked a lot, but they left out an examination of the Eastern religions of Buddism, Hinduism, Shinto, etc....not sure why. Maybe they are not that great an influence over the USA, but some of those religions are as numerous as Islamic people in the USA. The Islamic faith, IMO, got slammed a tad harder than the other religions mentioned in the movie though. It's important to remember that just about ANY religion can be perverted (like both Christianity AND Islam) to promote violence against "un-believers".The movie kind of jumps around in places, and it has some subtitles, quick movie clips &amp; news articles that flash across the screen at times. It might be better to wait and see it in the comfort of your own home so you can rewind what you might miss. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that is curious OR skeptical about religion in general. Be prepared to be offended though if you are a hard-core believer in just about ANY of the major faiths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Take it Too Serious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religulous (2008) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Bill Maher is one celebrity that I'd watch no matter what he's talking about. It could be sports, politics, sex or drugs. Maher is just someone I've always enjoyed because he wasn't afraid to offend people and that there certainly holds true in this incredibly funny documentary that has the comedian traveling around the world trying to find out the truths behind religion. Anyone familiar with Maher will know that he doesn't believe in God and finds all religion to be the downfall of man that will cause more harm than good. If that there is going to offend you then it's probably best you stay away from this film and while I don't agree with everything Maher does here that doesn't mean I can't enjoy the film. To me, most importantly, this is a comedy that takes a look at a certain group of people who of course are going to come off looking foolish because Maher is armed with questions that can't possibly be answered. Many are going to call this film evil, which I guess is fair. I'm sure many will say Maher questioned the "lower ends" of people instead of questioning people with a degree on certain subjects. That's a fair complaint as well. In the end I really don't think it matters because Maher is constantly saying no one should take religious too serious and if that's the case then no one should take this film too seriously. To me it's just a funny film with the comedian doing his thing and getting many laughs from it. This film isn't so much about religion but instead about Maher's beliefs in religion and that's what makes the film work so well. Maher is a very funny and very intelligent man so hearing him discuss his beliefs and disbeliefs makes for a good time even though the film starts to run out of steam towards the end. I think Maher would even admit he doesn't play fair since he throws in subtitles for jokes, cuts people off and even at one point walks away from an interview. Many are going to say this is him being chicken against the subject but the subject isn't religion. The subject is Maher's religion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Bill Maher, I had a non standard exposure to religion as a child. He is the product of a Jewish / Catholic union, raised Catholic until they stopped attending church when Maher was 13. I was baptized Church of Emgland, went to Baptist Sunday school, attended everything from the Methodist church and a giant revivalist meeting to the Quakers while at boarding school in the 60's (they were trying to prove their trendy 60's credentials) and ended my school career with 4 years in a Roman Catholic convent (despite being a non Catholic) because my mother thought they might turn me into a nice young lady. I was the only non Catholic on a school trip to Italy and I'm certain we attended Mass at every church in Rome, including the one in the Catacombs. Mass after Mass after.... you get the idea? It was the kind of religious upbringing you spend the rest of your life escaping from, and like Maher I ended up very, very wary of organised religion. Not of the concept of God necessarily, just of religion. All religion. Every religion. Religions of every type, shape, doctrine, geographic locale, language and ethnic origin. I hate them all equally; the silly rituals, the paternalism and the frequent denial of science. So I won't pretend that I went to see Religulous with an open mind; I was predisposed to love it and I did, even though it's a good rather than a great movie.Religulous works on several levels. It's funny and it should be thought provoking. If your thoughts aren't provoked by this, they should be. However I truly doubt it will change anyone's beliefs. If you're a skeptic like me, you'll have your skepticism justified and if you're a believer, you'll probably be outraged. As a movie, its closest comparison might be with the films of Michael Moore, but it's better than any of Moore's offerings to date, because unlike Moore, Maher knows when to stop. He knows how to allow people to say just enough to incriminate themselves, and then he backs off, leaving their words to hang in the air, where Moore continues to bait them. Maher knows he doesn't need to batter us over the head, unlike Moore who unfortunately completely overcooked the finale of Sicko. (Religulous is certainly heated towards the end though.) And as religious people seem keen to expound, Maher has to do little beyond asking some basic questions.I would guess that Maher has read enough of the Bible, Quran and Torah to be knowledgeable if not fluent, but when cornered, it's quite alarming how many of the people he interviews, while claiming to be religious, seem not to have read ? or at least digested ? the various user manuals which go with their chosen faith. It reminded me of that clown of a politician on TV a year or two back, who insisted the 10 Commandments should be displayed in public buildings but couldn't actually remember what they were. For example, it always amazes me how people can twist Christianity's clear and basic teaching against storing up worldly riches, into a justification for their own personal wealth. And Maher interviews one very happily rich TV evangelist.Some of what the religious say here is just astonishing. There's the Hassidic Jew, who thinks the Jews haven't suffered enough yet. He went to Iran recently to commiserate with the miserable bunch there, at some kind of Holocaust denial convention. (This is the only interview which actually causes Maher to exit in disgust.) There are the workers and visitors to the Holy Land Experience in the American South (Florida I think) who seem able to ignore the irony that the Holy Land is currently a battle zone, while watching bloody re-enactments of the crucifixion complete with song and dance. Want a real Holy Land experience? Here's your bullet proof vest and helmet. He gets evicted from the grounds of the Mormon temple in Salt Lake City, spars with the guy (did he sound Australian?) who built the Genesis museum, where dinosaurs frolic with humans in a primordial fantasy world, a kind of Flintstones meets Jungle Book diorama. He dons a mild disguise to expound the tenets of Scientology to a dubious crowd at Speakers Corner in London. He visits the Dome of the Rock Mosque in Jerusalem. Maher is certainly game.Interestingly, Catholicism comes out OK-ish, in a 'Well if you must have a religion, this one has some intellectual clout and history' sort of way. Was he overly gentle on Catholicism? In front of giant pictures of the cosmos, Maher interviews the priest who runs the Vatican Astronomical Observatory. None of that 'the earth was formed last week and fossils were put in the rocks to confuse us' stuff here. "Of course evolution is true" says a priest. "We accepted that 50 years ago." Whew! Well that's good. Now all we have to do is get past angels, no contraception and the virgin birth! Nice one Bill!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i didn't know who Bill Maher is, but i see now that he's a comedian who's been pondering the subject of organised religion.... you'll be glad he did, once you see this film.he has a unique way of interviewing people, and from being a comedian (and, from what i can tell, a bit of a smartass) he has his own way of dealing out the questions that are on his mind &amp; handling the answers. so don't expect the Micheal Moore touch.sometimes he says something that leaves the interviewee speechless, and those moments are MINT! it's great that he is taking his doubts and concerns around the world &amp; asking religious adherents what it's all about &amp; if they can see the inherent nonsense of adopting ancient texts on blind faith even when they don't add up.he is practically BEGGING people to apply even the slightest scrap of independent thought to what some base their lives &amp; decisions around. he tried to separate the concept of morality/goodness from a list of rules, or challenge what it takes to make a miracle.he comes in contact with some fascinating and/or bloody-minded people, who really give an interesting sample of people's interaction with their faith, and we see how it basically has to be sustained by faulty reasoning to keep propped up (as very little in the way of proofs of anything supernatural can substantiated).the world needs more missionaries like Bill Maher...the ending was a bit of a downer... truly there's nothing more frightening in this world than thinking you have all the answers &amp; acting accordingly. i don't know why people aren't more sceptical of following a deity or doctrine that approves of killing or stealing or enslavement or rape... that would tip me off right there that something ain't right or good or holy.P.S. if you thought that the people interviewed were being prematurely defensive, take a look at the forums! no one can stick to the goddamned topic or analyse questions about religion reasonably or rationally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maher Pokes Fun At Religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever films like Religulous are released, it is always difficult to separate the subject matter and one's personal leanings from the quality of the film itself. There is perhaps no more a divisive subject matter than religion. Bill Maher takes on religious belief and some of its manifestations around the world. Christianity and Islam occupy most of his time in the first two-thirds and last third of the film respectively. He even manages to get his mother in on the act. Many of Maher's targets are easy targets: Uneducated or religiously employed or self-employed. The film contains many predictable moments of Maher cynicism and ridicule, such as with the ex-Jewish artifact merchant and the Hispanic second coming of Christ via Puerto Rico. Those two individuals in contrast represent the harmless, sincere believer as well as the dangerous charlatan. Maher seems to despise both.Maher does manage to talk to several individuals with actual education and credentials, and the conversations with these folks are some of the more interesting parts of the film. Two Vatican priests denouncing many traditional Catholic beliefs for instance is a revelation for many, no doubt. A Jesus actor at the Holyland theme park in Orlando is the most successful at defending his faith and deflecting Maher's endless barbs. There are a few bizarre moments as well, like the Jewish Holocaust denial supporter who can't shut up. The film does become more thought-provoking as time goes by with Maher asking often simple questions (many of us have thought about at one time or another) which go unanswered by believers. Maher's final message is important, but I fear it's obscured by his religious skewering. If the film does nothing more than raise some doubt, it serves its purpose. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poignant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The following is extremely important; in his Septermber 30 interview with Terry Gross on "Fresh Air", Bill Maher stated that if one distills and otherwise strips the magical nonsense ("mumbo jumbo" if you will) from the text regarding Jesus Christ, the message of Jesus, the actual philosophy is a beautiful thing. Bill Maher whole heartedly believes this, and I agree.It is so that Bill Maher sallies forth with plenty of cinematic zingers to drive home a point of how faith-based scoundrels resort to religious-patriotism as a last resort. He shows how the fictional tales still have a terrifying stranglehold and impact on society, and the how the self anointed pious among faith-based circles espouses (though not always honestly) mixed messages that the purported son of the almighty would never have agreed with. In short, Maher exposes those who preach hypocrisy in the face of Jesus' teachings.If you're a devout born-again or fundamentalist, then you'll be insulted. Good. You deserve it. Because if you are, then you're missing the larger point of Bill's film. In an age of fact based logic, how can one invest oneself in legends that have their roots from before the bronze age? What do you believe? Do you not have qualms about the financial well being of churches? Is such opulence really in line with Jesus or the profit Mohammed? Maher brings in old video footage from his own stand-up and moments of those espousing "the word of God" on video-tape transferred to film. He brings in facts and tries to present them to the most devout, and even allegedly more reasoned among the faithful, in order to engage in a discourse about the notion of a "God" or doubt thereof.As expected, because Maher wants to introduce the notion of doubt into the realm of things, he's met with resistance. But therein shows the utter hypocrisy of those gaining wealth and influence by guiding those who honestly believe, for better or ill, in the existence of a supreme-being.Bill's film is a warning, punctuated with a lot of obvious fact checking. Unlike other films that try to expose hypocrisy Bill doesn't condescend to the people he's talking to. He truly does not. He brings in some challenging ideas to the people who believe in God, but he never truly ridicules them. He drives his point home with humor to show the ridiculousness of it all, but never tramples on the personal values of those who truly believe, but does appropriately backhand the stupidity of believing in fables, fairy-tales and legends as a means of reinforcing a kind of morality. And, further, appropriately backhands those who believe because they're scared of not making into heaven.My only quibbles with this film is that Bill himself doesn't come forward with some good news of his own. It's pretty gloomy, but in a funny sort of way. But, on the flip side, he does remind the audience, specifically the United States of America audience of the extreme reservations our founding fathers had regarding faith. Very appropriate. My second quibble is with the theory of how international conflict comes about. Wars are typically fought over natural resources (money). Religious rhetoric merely helps get the effort going to achieve an economic end through force of arms. Bill's fear that Armageddon may come about isn't entirely without precedent, but, in my opinion, resides more in the realm of "outside chance". Plausible, but not wholly likely.Be warned, there's a lot of swearing in this film and some pretty racy snippets from other films. It's definitely not a film for children.You must see this film if you are in the least interested in faith or religion, and how it can skew and misguide our futures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a moving film I am still processing it the day after seeing it. As a person who was raised with religion but has lost his faith in the organized aspect of it all, this film really spoke to me. Bill Mahr is able to excellently and non-judgmentally discuss religious matters with the most extremist peoples of different faiths and it not become just another shouting match which usually happens when I try to discuss religion with friends, family or co-workers. I plan on purchasing this film when it comes out on DVD and showing it to everyone I possibly can for many years to come. I was especially fascinated to be reminded how anti-organized religion Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin and John Adams were and how entwined in government today organized religion has become.

		<shortDescription>Falls Short of its Aspirations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm yet another person who agrees with Maher's message but who doesn't really have that much respect for the vehicle in which he delivers it. The decision to make this a comedy (presumably to get people to see it) is just one of its many flaws. Maher takes on the obvious phonies and extreme cases (which he justifies in the commentary track because many of these folks do have large numbers of followers), and does tangentially make the case that undocumented belief is undocumented belief, regardless of whether it is wacky or mainstream. But this kind of easy cheap shot isn't going to change the minds of the fundamentalist followers and it allows more mainstream religionists to discount his arguments. He may have had trouble getting mainstream representatives of religion to engage with him, but if he had it wouldn't have been particularly funny and wouldn't have fit into the film Maher and Charles wanted to make.One exception is a straightforward interview with Father George Coyne, a Vatican scientist, who describes the "fundamentalist approach to religious belief (as) kind of a plague." It's a plague worth fighting, one that many people of faith would join, and it's really the target of much of the film even though Maher says he is taking on all belief.There are certainly some interesting and fun moments here, the highlight being the interview with impish Vatican Latin scholar Father Reginald Foster. Another is the interview with "ex-gay" minister John Wescott, who holds his own against Maher while maintaining strong rapport and good cheer, a really interesting character. The scenes in the Truckers Chapel are especially good. Maher doesn't mock these believers but treats them seriously and with respect. The rapport that Maher seems to have developed with these men suggests that their discussion may have been much longer than what wound up in the film. At the end of the scene, Maher accepts their prayers for him in a generous spirit and says, "Thank you for being Christ-like and not just Christian." This sequence, coming at the beginning, gave me high hopes for the film, hopes largely not met.What I found reprehensible--and it happens several times--is the phony editing, where, after Maher makes his point there's a cut to the other person apparently chagrined or speechless. These isolated cuts obviously come from some other point in the conversation--really dishonest and cheap manipulation of film. All the interviews show evidence of being heavily edited, sometimes, one suspects, to somewhat change actual content. Maher has also been rightly taken to task in other IMDb comments for making some casual absolute statements of fact that are either incorrect or deserve more nuanced comment. One is the statement that there's a "gay gene," which is still under discussion in the scientific community (see "No, Scientists Have Not Found the 'Gay Gene'," dated October 10, 2015 on The Atlantic magazine website).At the end of the day, the problem isn't really religion, it's people. Religion can serve as a vessel for codes of moral and ethical behavior and empathy with one's fellow man. But, human nature being what it is, religion is also a vessel for all sorts of intolerant and evil behavior. Things can be just as bad, or even worse, without religious belief. I think Maher copped out when he said that, well, Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia, they were religions of a sort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Missing Elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Bill Maher and was interested when I saw that he had taken on religion. Having seen his routine live a couple of times I knew it would be humorous and cynical and that it is.What I found interesting was the "call to arms" for the logical people within society who hold a more rational approach to humanity and the human condition.The film does what it set out to do quite well and as a self proclaimed agnostic who is much more concerned with the evils propagated by religion than the benefits of there were two key elements Bill missed out on: 1. Other religions and belief structures...This film doesn't even acknowledge Buddhism, Hinduism, the Shinto beliefs, Taoism and other religions, focusing on the various types of Christianity and touching on Judaism and Islam.There's supposedly 2 billion Christians, 1.3 billion Muslims, 15 million Jews... that leaves over half of the worlds population that doesn't subscribe to any of these beliefs.Truly a missed opportunity to look at other social structures for the near 1 billion people who subscribe to no religion.2. A further look at secular people across different nations...What I really would have enjoyed is further discussion on why those who subscribe to no religion explain how they view humanity, be they scientists or just the average person.There was an interesting piece of the film where Bill, his mother and his sister talk about how they stopped attending church when he was 13 due to the churches stance on birth control. There's another section where 2 ex-Mormons discuss with Bill the tenets of Mormonism they left and why they seemed wrong to them as human beings.There are these types of discussions that could have been approached all over the globe that I thought would be very interesting to delve into as the film really is an attempt to empower those of us without strong religious beliefs to make our own voices heard.I also really enjoyed the Vatican Senior Priest and the Vatican Astronomer, though in general those at the Vatican seem to be some of the most level headed people in society today.Good film to take a look, but I feel it missed some elements that could have strengthened Bill's position.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Clever, Relevant -- Until The End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some have mistakenly called Religulous a "mock-umentary" but, no, the film is a legitimate documentary in that it documents real-life people and situations -- and then mocks them, much in the style of a Michael Moore documentary. The film has the feel of a travelogue, featuring Maher as a globe-trotting guide, sightseeing various religious sites and interviewing the "locals." With an iconoclast like Bill Maher along with Borat/Brno director Larry Charles at the helm of this film, no one should be surprised that Religulous is happy to give offense. For believers especially, Religulous will feel like an affront, perhaps even an attack. And that's to be expected, when your host believes that "religion must die for mankind to live."Religulous has plenty of genuinely funny moments, for instance when the senator says that you "don't have to pass an I.Q. test to be in the Senate," and it has some touching moments as well, for instance when the men from the Truck Stop church lay their hands upon Bill and pray for him. Religulous is at its best when it's gently or not-so-gently mocking religious extremes and religious extremists.Unfortunately, Religulous lacks any sense of nuance or shades of difference, as it irrationally lumps all religious people and all religion into one heap of dangerous wrong-headedness, never mind the fact that religion has inspired and still inspires great people and great accomplishments. While the segment with the pro-evolution Vatican scientist and the segment with the agnostic priest in St. Peter's Square indicate that Maher/Charles might be capable of recognizing shades of gray, the rest of their film sees things mostly in black and white.In addition, Religulous loses some credibility when it trots out the old Jesus-equals-Horus legend -- an idea that all modern Egyptologists deem laughable -- or when it misapplies modern standards of historical study to the writers of history in the ancient world. The movie also gives short shrift and a biased edit to biologist Francis Collins. (Viewers interested in giving Francis his day in court may want to check out his conversation with Richard Dawkins as recorded in the November 13, 2006, issue of TIME magazine.)Religulous's biggest sin, however, is the end of the film, when Maher/Charles switch from what was a pretty funny satire to a truly a sad mode of end-of-the-world sermonizing. The irony is that Maher's concluding sermon is no less fundamentalistic, intolerant, absurd, arrogant, preachy, and fear-mongering, than some of the worst sermons of the religionists he criticizes. Like an End-Times Doomsayer, Maher ends his otherwise fun film with the proclamation: The End is Near! Repent (of Religion)! If the message were delivered with clear ironic intent, it might have worked. But, no, his "Religion Must Die Or Else" is seriously wrought. Pious earnestness is never pretty, but it's especially jarring when it comes from an otherwise smart critic like Maher.Cut the sermon and you have a film worthy of the 7+ rating it presently enjoys on IMDb. Alas, keep the sermon and you have a film that is, in the end, an embarrassment to the freethinking cause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religulous is funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religulous is funny. But of course, that's its main intent: to entertain. In the style of Borat, Bill Maher films himself in a series of interludes where he makes simple people of faith look foolish by asking all the right questions about serious religious issues that are at the core of faith. Questions such as why are there so many different world religions, creationism versus evolution, is the earth only 6,000 years old, what's the deal with transubstantiation, what's the deal with the trinity, and so on. All valid questions that everyone has probably answered for themselves after a late night dorm room discussion while on the journey of forming their world view.The only problem is I don't think Bill Maher was looking for the answers or even looking for a level playing field on which to debate the questions. The goal here is to strictly to entertain rather than educate. And that's where this movie falls short. Bill Maher's political debates on his show "Real Time" are, for the most part, well represented by conservatives and liberals alike so as to have a fair and balanced debate of the political issues of the day. In contrast, Religulous is more like the Christians being fed to the lions than a fair and balanced discussion on faith."Are you not Entertained?" I have to say I was. Despite my beliefs differing from Bill Maher, I found the movie very funny. But I have a sick sense of humor.The movie fails to resonate any truth since the discussion was pretty one sided. In other words, this was a religious version of Jay Leno's Jay walking where you ask simple questions to stupid people to get a laugh at their expense.If you are really interested in listening to educated people discuss this type of material than I suggest the PBS special entitled The Question of God: Sigmund Freud &amp; C.S. Lewishttp://scottishtexan.blogspot.com</fullReview>

Not all are "spokespeople" for their faiths, but as people acting with passion for their faiths ... their view points and answers are still valid views, but more often than not soooooooooo mixed up it just seems so funny. Bill highlights this all playfully with his doubt, which really is more than doubt, its disbelief. Not all his facts are correct ... but then neither are those of the people he talks to ... and thats partly the point.I hafta say the Americans come off even more nuts than usual, not uncommon... not sure I'll ever see "Koran Land" theme parks in the middle east.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Does It All Mean?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religulous is a film that has a certain point of view (non-belief) and doesn't mind trying to debunk other religions and religious leaders. I feel if you don't like Bill Maher and his politics you probably won't watch this film, but you should. Religulous is an exercise in free speech and the freedom to express ideas that aren't mainstream.The element I enjoyed the most was the interview subjects speaking from the heart, uncensored, and very candid. "Blind faith" or irrational beliefs seems to be at the core of all religions discussed in the movie. Maher is a good counter puncher to some of the doctrine that is spewed at him and his visits to various religious sites takes away some of the mystique surrounding these historical sites. If you have the DVD, you have to listen to the commentary Maher and Larry David provide about the making of the film. It is funny and offers insight into the film making process.I think people have a hard time digesting the ending of the film, because if you didn't get the point Maher was trying to make during the film, he definitely lets you know at the end of the film. Some people had a hard time with the ending and felt Maher was "preaching" to them. I will say this is a valid feeling. I will also say, that the film also speaks to the danger of politics and religion co-existing in this world and the massive destruction it has and will continue to bring to mankind. I think Maher allows the religious to have their say, but also gives a strong voice to those who don't believe and makes no bones about it.My only criticism is that the guy from Amsterdam should have been left out. Either he was too stoned or not bright to begin with, but he didn't convince me of anything. I think this scene was left in because his hair almost catches on fire. Yet still, this guy doesn't freak out or barely move. His apathy to his life, beliefs, and hair is funny in a dark way.All in all try to watch this movie and take it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I respect Bill Maher, and got quite a few laughs out of this film. The ridiculous side of religion is captured well here, just by letting the cameras roll, and letting these brain-dead zombies speak their minds in defense of their fundamentalist beliefs. And I generally agree with Maher's main message - i.e., that we "don't know" - and that having a false certainty (that your religion is the truth and the rest of the world should change, die or go to hell) is extremely dangerous.However, these people - extremists and fundamentalists - are easy targets. Anyone who believes the Biblical stories are literal, as opposed to metaphorical, just doesn't get it - and is easy to make fun of.I would have liked to see a somewhat deeper film where he interviews more sophisticated believers. Maher did not address the question - why do so many sensible people (not the nut-jobs that he interviews) want spirituality or religion in their lives? The closest we get to this is the chat with the Vatican priest who cheerfully rejects the literal interpretation of the Bible. I wish Maher had asked the priest what the Bible and Jesus mean to him, then? Why is he a priest? If we strip away the nonsense, superstition and hate from organized religion, is there anything good left over? This question is not asked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freedom of speech has defined America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher and the free country of America decides to create probably one of the most controversial movies of 2008. Considering that it has to deal with one of the most touchy aspects of America, religion.If you do not know, Bill Maher is not at all religious. He grew up as a Catholic but once he became an adult, he decided to become an atheist. And finally, after expressing some of those views on Real Time along with his rebellious nature in politics and social issues in America, he decided to make a movie about that: about different religions that men and women believe in.A woman told me at my school that when she saw this film, she thought that Bill Maher was being kind of obnoxious to the men and women who believed in other religion besides his. And I can see that is the case in the film. However, you also see that Maher wants to understand the whole excitement of different religion and how it runs and manages their lives. The only problem is that since religion is a controversial subject, many men and women start getting angry at Bill Maher.For one thing, this movie is very funny, especially if you like watching Real Time. Also, I think that Bill Maher was absolutely right about having a movie about religion because in America, many men and women say they believe in God, but they really do not understand their religion or are just plain ignorant about it. Also, Bill Maher exposes some religions that actually potentially damage men and women around the world.You can say that this movie is a lot like a Michael Moore film, but instead, the main topic is religion instead of politics or social issues. And if you do like Michael Moore films or just films in general that expose the weakness in controversial and sensitive subjects such as religion, then you would definitely enjoy this film. I also want to give a shout out to the men and women who stick strongly to their religious views to NOT watch this film, because you might end up throwing your remote control to the television screen. The movie is just that rebellious.I give this movie a mid seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a big fan of Bill Maher, but I do enjoy his work and I love the way he mocks religions. Constantly making jokes and pushing it on his "Real Time" show. And I have to admit, he is doing a great work, but with this film, he decided to bite the big one. And to be honest? he made it, successfully.Now, for starters, Bill said, that when it comes to God, Devil, miracles, etc? those kind of things, you know, supernatural. He's keep saying "I don't know" (more like an agnostic) but from this documentary's point of view, he did it more in atheistic way. He was all over the world, asking questions to bunch of religious people, from different cultures. Bill Maher, with his comedy style, starts asking poignant questions, to corner theists in a very skilled, witty way.Here, Bill travels around the world (from US, to Israel, and some countries in Europe and so on) and bravely mocks and questions some monotheistic religions and some minor cults, he even visits the Vatican. Some did not recognize him, some did, and that was little troubling. I really loved Bill's way of asking questions and watching him affront of these crazy, uneducated, disgusting people who spews their crap at people, it's somewhat sad. But, thanks to Bill it was really funny.So, in conclusion. This documentary is excellent. A real hard hit to the religion's nuts. Bill gives an excellent one on the end of the film. I'll try to give my own. This world is tough enough without religions, but religions are here even today to make things hard. It is just sick to think that people are giving money to them? just to spread their poison all over the world. OK, today is little different, reason rules today. Reasoning, logic, reality and critical thinking. If you want to discover something, if you want to know things, how something works, or exists, then consult with the science. We are better and upgraded thanks to the science. But, if you are a religious man who denies science, than you are fuc*ed. Because religions are primitive products designed to control and manipulate people, let's call them the first attempt in politics? well you needed something to control naive, dumb people from that time. But when religious people saw the extremely large edge they have in their religious principles, they decided to take the entire world and to rule it. You know why? Because most people would do the same. When you have power, when you have a powerful position in society and you have money? what do you want? You want more power and more money to yourself and only to yourself. We are in 21st century, if you say that you are religious today and that you believe in God, that he created heaven, hell, humans, animals etc? you look like a retard, honestly, please don't get insulted, but you do? no, really, no pun intend, but? there's no proof for any of those things, there was never proof of God, or his existence, today people could easily say that there is no God at all, but, that would be harsh, it would be a pretty strong kick in religions people's balls. But, if there is a good, physical, strong evidence for God, then we will listen. But, please, no more empty stories about someone else's experience about God, or werewolves, or vampires? just give us a physical proof, but if you say that God can't be proved, than you are a dumb, brainwashed child that arrogantly won't accept the fact of reality. I like to communicate with religious people, not debating them, just talk, asking questions, and I was fortunate to talk with really decent and polite religious people. That I can appreciate. I can appreciate religious people who can keep their religion to themselves. Keep it to yourself, practice it in the church, or in your home. Nobody! And I mean nobody, will take that away from you. Keep your believes from state institutions, because you need to respect secular country. But, most of religions don't appreciate that. And who knows how long will religion exist in this world. But? not for long I think? It is over. Take a book, read it, be polite, inform yourself, think critically, question everything, accept and respect other people's rights and differences and? don't be a jerk.Great work, Bill Maher? great work? this documentary should be an imperative in the world all over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even A Twit Can Get It Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never liked Bill Maher much, but I get this movie. A lot of the previous reviewers don't. So perhaps the best way to comment on this movies is the context of previous reviews.Most of the interviews follow a simple routine. Maher interviews religious believers and asks them questions about their beliefs. He then points out 1) how ridiculous their answers are or 2) that they are contradicted by the teachings of their own holy books. The interviewee usually simply ignores the contradictions or else parrots some fatuous answer based on faith, I . e., an untestable assumption. Maher may press them a bit to examine what they have just said, but of course they don't. Maher ultimately laughs that can't they face the obvious irrationality and circularity to their beliefs.Apparently, a lot of reviewers seem to think that this is being mean or smug. On the contrary, it is the ideal ways to demonstrate the irrationality of religious believers: ask them questions and point out the irrationality of the answers. They spout the absurdities themselves. Maher didn't make them say anything.A lot of reviewers complain that is goes or the easy joke and does not engage in rational debate. I agree that he is a comedian so he will always go for the easy joke. But the charge of avoiding rational discourse is absurd. First, this is precisely what he is doing when he points out the irrationality of most answers. But it is obvious a waste of time in the film as it is in real life. Second, the interviewee responses to his questions confirming the obvious: religious belief is not a matter of rationality. As someone once noted, believing in religion is like being in love. No one is going to talk you out of loving your girlfriend by debating the merits of her big nose, bad breath and is missing teeth. It is a waste of time.A lot of reviewers also complained that he picked easy targets and avoided more sophisticated theologians. This criticism is misguided because the easy targets are by far the majority of believers. It doesn't matter what a few intellectual elites who don't believe in the literal interpretation of the bible think. They are a small minority. It is what the majority, the man in the street and the people who run the government think that matters. As the interview with the Vatican astronomer, moreover, the easy targets generally often don't even know the teachings of their own religion. Surveys of religious knowledge also show that most adherents have very little knowledge of their own religions. These are precisely the people who should be interviewed: people whose belief is based on a few simple-minded notions that they never question. As Maher notes, it is what the majority, the enablers, whose beliefs justify the extremists who carry the bombs and who may decide the fate of the world.A few reviewers have complained that Maher attacks mostly Christians and Muslims and lets the Jews off too easy. There are and 1.5 billion Muslims, about 2 billion Christians and about 14 million Jews. Gee, and Jews, .04% of the three religions, are the problem? If the time spent in the movie were allocated based on these numbers, Maher would have spent 2.16 seconds on Judaism.In sum, the movie's approach is perfectly sound: reveal the absurdities, hypocrisies and dangers of religions asking the believers to answer simple questions about the beliefs. On the other hand, the movie is marred by Maher's inability to avoid the cheap, easy laugh. I still don't like Bill Maher. He is a snotty, arrogant twit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Maher has never been one of my favorite comedians. I was never fond of his political views or his show in general. Despite my feelings for him, I found out he did a documentary called Religulous that focused on lampooning religion. I, myself, find religion to be overblown and unnecessary for today's world. So, the concept immediately struck me as intriguing, ambitious, and daring.It turned out that it was just as it advertised; an hour and a half long documentary featuring Bill Maher traveling around the world to the Vatican, different churches of all shapes and sizes, people who have been "saved," etc. All of them he mocks, contradicts, and criticizes. The concept sounds selfish and mean-spirited, indeed. But it's taken in such a serious and collective manner.I'm afraid to talk about religion a lot of the time because I feel I'm bound to offend someone. I don't need it in my life. If you do, wonderful. Don't force me to believe in God. People ask me if I'm an Atheist because of the way I talk about religion. I don't consider myself an Atheist as much as I do a very heavy skeptic. Or better yet, a free thinking individual who doesn't look to "God" or anyone of a higher power to solve my problems. I question a lot. Many questions I've asked over the years, about miracles and the teenage years of Jesus Christ, are even asked in the film by Maher himself. This shows I'm not alone in my beliefs.I taught myself at a young age, despite attending pre-school in a very, very Lutheran church, that when you have a problem you can't look to God for help. You yourself need to fix it. Waiting around for some being who hasn't even been proved to exist is not the way to go through life. Another thing that frustrates me is when people, like the actors/actresses that win Academy Awards or score the winning touchdown, thank God instead of their own skills. Last time I checked, God wasn't playing the game. You were. Give yourself credit.Once more, I'd like to reiterate, I am not trying to offend anyone. I feel that if you've "seen the light" or believe in God, that is perfectly acceptable. Obviously, you see something I don't and I can accept that. I wish I could fully believe there is a God, who gave us freewill, loves us, and wants to see everyone succeed. The problems for me is there is no hard evidence, all religions seem the same in my eyes, there are many holes in the world of religion, and it leads to unnecessary arguments and wars. It's not worth losing friends, readers, and it's just not worth my personal time.As far as Religulous goes, the title stems from combining the words "religion" and "ridiculous." A genius combination if you ask me. Maher is consistently funny as he questions and contradicts the beliefs of his interviewees and never strikes a wrong note. If I had to nitpick one element it would be he doesn't dive into the church I wanted to hear the most about; the Westboro Baptist Church. We see a blink-and-you-miss-it glimpse of them, but we never get an opinion or an interview on the subject.That being said, the film is very funny. Perhaps one of the most enjoyable documentaries I have yet to see. It's hip, funny, biased like them all, but satirical, and amusing. Many will hate it. Many will love it. It depends on your religion and how receptive you are to a political commentator criticizing your ways of life. I can see religious people taking it for a laugh, religious people hating it, and Atheists adoring the concepts brought to light. Some will call it ridiculous, some will call it propagandulous, but many will call it humorous. The whole thing is religulous to me.Starring: Bill Maher. Directed by: Larry Charles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Divinely funny, but devilishly preachy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time "Religulous" was released, it was about time someone had made a documentary on the dangers of the abuse of religion, and leave it to Bill Maher to pull it off. "Religulous" is a hysterical yet informative expos on what happens when people take religion too far and begin to ignore rationality. In spite of the documentary's comical nature, the results are truly terrifying.Through his journey, Bill interviews (and oftentimes insults) a number of different people, including but not limited to Catholics, ex-Mormons, Hasidic Jews, Muslims, Scientologists, "cured" homosexuals, the director of a "Creationist Museum" in Kentucky (if I ever move to Kentucky, my taxes better never pay for that), and a man who believes himself to be Jesus Christ. Among the most rational people he talks to during his journey are two Catholic priests, one of whom asserts that Catholicism can no longer take a completely literal translation of the Bible due to current scientific evidence, another who asserts that Catholicism has changed greatly over the years, but still has a way to go.Through it all, it was frightening to learn that almost more people in the United States deny evolution than in almost any other country in the world. For a nation that's come so far, there's still plenty who choose to remain in the Dark Ages. It's also frightening to learn how many people there out there who believe that homosexuality is a "choice" and "can be cured." Bill goes on to point out just how many horrible things are spoken of (under God's direction, no less) in both the Bible and other sacred scriptures; for example, Lot, a "good and righteous man" (2 Peter 2:8), offered his virgin daughters to a crowd of rapists (Genesis 19:8). Furthermore, he goes on to explain how the beliefs of Christianity are not unique ideas; Krishna, an avatar of the Hindu faith which predates Christianity by three thousand years, shares several similarities with Jesus, and Horus, the Egyptian god of the sky, is essentially the progenitor of all these Christlike attributes. While I already knew things such as this, it was nice to see them finally being told to a much wider audience. One thing that surprised me, though, was that Bill neglected to point out how so many things used in Christian tradition today actually originally come from ancient European paganism."Religulous" is not without its faults. Bill apparently takes the stance that there is no God and that all religion is bad, or at least that's how he comes off, whether intentional or not. About ninety-five percent of the world believes in a benevolent Creator or Higher Power in one form or another, and while I admit that the other five percent may be right, I'd hate to think that they are. Even Bill admits at least once to praying during his younger years and having his prayers answered in one way or another. I think the problem he's running into is that he's viewing God the way so many closed-minded people do, as a wrathful "god" who claims to love all creation while throwing people for minor things into a lake of fire. Had he studied near-death experiences, he would have learned that nothing could be further from the truth for most people who have come to the brink of death; I doubt it would have made him believe in God, but it would probably have shown him that not everyone views God as punishing or vengeful.The second problem is in viewing that all religion or spirituality is bad. True, there has been more violence and injustice done in the name of particular religions than of any other cause throughout history. Still, this doesn't make everyone who subscribes to a particular religion or spirituality irrational and/or bloodthirsty. I've met Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists, and various other people from all walks of life who are truly wonderful and loving people; I've also met those who are the polar opposite. The problem is not so much religion itself; abuse of religion is the problem. Religion can be used for good in bringing people together based on a common belief and granting them solace in times of turmoil. The problem we run into is when any religion spreads hatred or paranoia or claims God and salvation only for themselves. Obviously, not all religions fall into that category.In spite of this, "Religulous" is very entertaining and informative, and in spite of its flaws, Bill does maintain that his gospel is "I don't know." And when it comes down to it, that's truly the gospel of humanity; we can have a good idea of what happens to us when we die, but nobody truly has all the answers, and anybody who believes they do are deluding themselves and others. Contrary to what some may think, this film will not shatter your faith, whatever that faith may be. Only you can do that. If you feel your faith to be weaker after viewing it, then obviously you were already having doubts, and there's nothing wrong some healthy skepticism. The overriding moral here is to question what you believe. Don't just blindly accept it.On a final note, to those who claim to "speak in tongues," no, you don't. That isn't God talking through you; it's you babbling in gibberish, and you sound like an idiot. So do yourselves and everyone else a favor and shut up.</fullReview>

He tries to prove these religious people wrong and makes fun of their beliefs.I thought this movie had a lot of hilarious scenes although I'm not completely agreeing with Maher statements. It's nice to see this kind of movie once in a while, and it is true what people say, that comedians can get away with saying a lot of things as long as it is categorized as comedy. In my opinion everyone is entitled to express their view on things, also the extremely religious people.</fullReview>

In fact, new science, as revealed in, "Solar Plexus: The Secret Gravitational System" investigates, "G Theory" to explore how the mystery of gravity has a profound correlation with God and Law of Attraction, which are said to be related. Scientists say that without Gravity, NOTHING (and no one) would exist, and religions say the same thing about God; what is the difference, really?"With omnipotent sovereignty, gravity governs, organizes, forms, and deforms all mass, and energy in the universe; it is the ultimate creator - God. All mass, including humans, energetic organisms, and earth itself with its magnetosphere, have vibrations that play roles in gravitational co-creation; this is the Law of Attraction in Action."Joie Founder, G Theory "Synthesizer of the Science of Gravity with Law of Attraction"Solar Plexus: The Secret Gravitational System ISBN: 1456300474</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And on the 7th day Bill Mahr decided to think outside the box...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religion, the conversation most people like to ignore or try to steer clear of because of the controversy it can bring and cause such a fight. Mainly to those who are referred to as "bible thumpers", the conversation can be a bit scary to some. I consider myself to be agnostic, baptized Catholic, I'm not sure what I believe. I've met several "bible thumpers" who have turned me off and make me laugh, I even had the ignorance to say "how could any intelligent person believe in this religion?" But I realized something, people believe different things and that's the way it is. Now every religion can't be wrong, but can every religion be right? I have this talk with my sister constantly, she considers herself to be an atheist and was constantly asking me if I had seen the movie "Religulous", so I finally watched it the other day. While I found it very funny and entertaining, there is one thing that kept me from saying this was a great movie, it was way too biased.Bill Mahr goes around the world discussing different religions. Their rules, beliefs, place of worship, etc. You name it, he asked about it: Catholicism, Mormon, Muslim, Jewish, Scientology, etc, he asks and gets the answers. The only thing is, while I completely agree with Bill's views, this documentary comes off a little too pushy and you can tell very edited. I've met people who have very strong beliefs in their religion, either agree, disagree or agree to disagree, they don't come off as idiots to me. Not to say that there are not people like that in Bill's movie, like the Puerto Rican man, Jesus who thinks that he is the second coming of Christ. People believe him and he takes their money and faith and just sucks it all up and spits it back at them. There are people who also say, my biggest pet peeve, "I will pray for you". To me, it's like you cannot come up with anything better to say, so they just hide behind God's skirt thinking that's a good answer to the conversation.So as far as documentaries go, Religulous may not have been what I was expecting but still entertained me. I just think that Bill should have explored more than just making fun of religion in general. While I am very anti Religion, it's not right to just trash other people's views. But this documentary did teach me some things I did not know about certain religions also the comparisons to other men who were similar to Jesus Christ. Who's to say what is beyond death? What will happen to us? I believe miraculous things do happen, I believe some people's faiths to be so strong that amazing things do happen to them. But as far as the man in the documentary who thinks that just because he prayed for rain and it happened, I think that was taking it to the extreme. My father said that he had a headache and he prayed for it to go away and it did, again, I highly doubt that out of the trillions of prayers that God must hear in a day, he has time for the weather or a headache. So when this movie comes into play, I think if you're Atheist or Agnostic, you will get a kick out of it, but others may find it offensive who have a strong faith.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But not perfect in any sense. Or giving you exact answers. Sometimes not giving you answers at all. But that's the aim of Bill Maher and his documentary. He doesn't have any answers himself, which is why some will condemn this movie. But he does have some interesting perspectives and view points.And even though he disagrees with a quite a few of his interview partners, he always shows them as human beings as well. Which is really an achievement and also shows that the director of Borat, who is at helms here too, did evolve (contrary to his subject "Borat/Brno", who's still living in the caves, making jokes that are offensive and actually not really funny, rather tasteless and vulgar ... but then again, many people do like those things).While Bill Maher does go deep into some religions/believes or their misinterpretations, some others don't get any attention at all. Buddhism for example. Of course there might not be that many funny things to say about that, but it would've been nice to see Maher trying/testing every religion there is. Scientology gets treated in sort segment too, that is disappointingly too short. Other than that though, you get what you should expect. A man who knows his way around words and a director who gives (most of the) people the time they need to respond.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact is this film is pretty unsophisticated. Bill basically just verbally skewers people who are much less intelligent and insightful than he is (Larry Charles did Borat too right?). The whole thing is a little heavy-handed at times. I mean, no one would be impressed by a heavyweight boxer pounding a school kid's head in, now would they? The film is almost in two halves, the first two thirds is an easy-street lampooning of a series of small minded religious types, the last third a series of assertions followed by a portent of some religion-fuelled nuclear apocalypse. It is indicative of how very simplistically this movie grapples with its subject matter. It is easy to attack literal interpretations of religious texts, point out how unscientific and illogical religious beliefs and mythologies are and so on. He is right about this stuff, but it's a no brainer. Maher doesn't get close to the much harder questions: overall, is religion a 'good' thing? Is religion a cultural construct or a biological fact? And whether it is 'good' or 'bad' or cultural or biological, is it inevitable? And, if it is, what do we do about its negative byproducts? These are the questions that more advanced philosophers, scientists, theologians and FILM MAKERS have been dealing with for decades.What is so aggravating is that when he interviews intelligent and capable people who might provide some insight on these more sophisticated questions (e.g. the head of the genome project guy and the neuro-theologist) he doesn't actually listen to their answers properly, allow them to make coherent points or try to learn from their particular expertise. Or he edits it out, who knows? After reading all of this, you are probably wondering why this review has eight stars? Because it is just so damn entertaining. Laughing at pious lunatics and preposterous concepts brought to (animatronic) life is really good fun! Add in an experienced stand-up comedian delivering punchy commentary and brilliant one liners ("Are you God?" "Aaaaah, no.")with a relentlessly good natured (albeit a bit aggressive) interviewing technique and you are doing quite well. Add to that cheeky captions and perfectly spliced file footage ranging from Superbad to cartoons, classic movies and instructional videos, and you really have an awesome 100 minutes of entertainment. When he ran through the Mormon principles, spliced with the Mormon instructional video I just couldn't stop laughing. The fact that some 13.5 million people actually believe in the magic underpants and everything else that goes with Joseph Smith's delightful fictional tale is enough to make anyone cackle.The other thing is - he's right. He may be picking on intellectual lightweights and only getting to the first layer of the debate, but he's still right. And when you think about how right he is and how influential religion is, the whole thing is a little less funny and a lot more depressing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maher presents an interesting documentary on an idea that fundamentally I agree with, but does so often in a blunt and almost rude manner. The film frequently makes jokes at the expense of the interview subjects, which are often funny, but at time are insensitive and somewhat rude.Religulous also fails to summerise anything. We're pretty clear going in that the premise is that religion is stupid but many different facets are discussed and simply fly on by with no real wrap up or conclusion.While the addressing of Christianity is fairly straight-forward, other religions are not really well covered. Maher, with Jewish heritage, clearly finds it difficult dealing with an anti-Zionist Rabbi and simply gives up, something his interview subjects themselves were resolute enough to avoid. Similarly his dealing with Islam are somewhat one-note, basically amounting to "your religion is violent".Mormons are mocked briefly (and with good reason) and Scientologists get a brief tickle, but neither is really touched on mostly. Some religious pragmatists who have genuinely interesting and insightful things to say are given a brief showing, but their input is all too brief.In essence I found the concept and boldness of the movie to be great, but the execution, focused on quick laughs for the most part, failed to get into the meat of many things, and by trying to cover too many aspects never really delved deep enough on any of them.I was intrigued and entertained, but also disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nice and entertaining...but flawed in some (few) aspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher is right about many things. Nowadays, as it was in the middle ages, religion is a catalyst of violence and armed conflicts, the reason put forward to legitimize aggression, oppression of women and war. The holy books were written by people, not by god. We know, that the Old Testament formerly contained far more books than there are present today. It is scary to see a biologist who deciphers the human genome and therefore should know about scientific approaches and proofs not questioning the action in the bible but rather taking it quite literally. Religion clouds rational thinking and helps to find easy answers to complex questions which in turn helps to keep people stupid and naive. The world religions are basically sects that have succeeded in gathering huge numbers of followers. He's right.He also simplifies things though. Religion is not the cause of violence, it is a governing tool for a few manipulative leaders in order to achieve their very worldly goals: power, influence, resources. It is used to misguide people, thus provoking violence. So, if there were no religions anymore, I'm sure, those leaders would find other means to guide their followers. His analysis stays too superficial for my taste. The dangerous thing is not religion, it's the stupidity and lack of education of many believers. This leads to the next point. He doesn't challenge anyone who's on par with him intellectually. He rather likes to interview simpleminded "victims" and expose their shortcomings...can be really funny though.Furthermore, while really trashing Christianity and the Islam, he's amazingly shy when it comes to criticizing the Jewish belief. I thought Americans had more freedom in this matter than we Germans do.The ending is as manipulative and dogmatic as the religions themselves. Not believing is his way of believing (as is mine ;) ).Overall, this documentary sure is one-sided and flawed, but the arguments in favor of it are dominant. Religion has caused more destruction than ideologies like Capitalism or Communism and has introduced a new quality of irrationality that is frightening if you consider the possibility of Muslim fundamentalists acquiring nuclear weapons in Pakistan or the maybe less threatening fact that the Pope, while traveling Africa, condemned the use of condoms because they, in his opinion, are not protection against but cause of the spreading of AIDS. Religion is no excuse for ignorance and idiocy.I'd recommend watching and enjoying this (comic) approach on the Disenchantment of religion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's fun to read the reviews, because I found this movie on the safe side. Sure Bill Maher interviewed some people on the edge, but I've seen and heard extremists far more radical than any that Maher interviewed. I think he was more concerned with showing what the MASSES believe.Maher repeatedly says he doesn't know. He isn't trying to provide anyone "an answer" but rather showing how people find and cling to their particular "answer." He was also generally polite, although it's tricky because the more serious the believer, the less humor they seem to have. So they become the straight man to Maher's comedy. He basically just asked questions. If trying to answer those questions makes someone's beliefs appear silly - is it the fault of the questioner? Besides, he didn't twist anyone's arm to speak with him. Each person interviewed agreed to be in the film. I give Religulous a 7, because as a documentary, I'd have liked to see more information, and as for laughs, I was expecting something a little funnier. At least there were some gems under the special features (such as his monologues) that provided additional laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking me a while to come to terms with this movie's strengths and weaknesses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, here's the deal with Religulous.It's NOT about religion. Not really.It IS about irrational belief. It's a big topic, an important topic, and it deserves being addressed.But bear that in mind when you watch Religulous: It's a attempt to address irrational belief in a thoroughgoing way.Given that--given the restricted nature of the subject matter--does Religulous succeed? Insofar as it pretends to address the question of genuine religious faith; yes and no: Yes, showcasing bad religion stands to remind us about the goals and aspirations of good religion, by way of bad example. No, because showcasing bad religion says nothing about good religion.Religulous is an important movie because bad religion is a serious and seemingly intractable problem; one that all good people--religious or otherwise--need to take a good, hard look at.Furthermore, the medicine being administered in Religulous is sweetened with some very good humor.One thing that deserves special honorable mention--something that could possibly go unnoticed--is how Bill's whole act has a foundation of fundamental emotional wholeness. Yeah, Bill can fulminate self-righteously from time to time, but his real, central animating spirit of one of good nature. I loved it every time Bill chuckled in this movie! Don't fail to notice that.Bill is here attempting to mainstream agnosticism and critical thinking applied to metaphysical claims. While this movie is a unique expression of this spirit, it's certainly not a new idea. In particular, Thomas Paine attempts to achieve some of the same goals in "Age of Reason," and actually digs a little deeper, by recognizing the central assumptions underlying mainstream faith in his time (and certainly ours): "Revealed truth" and blood propitiation. Bill obliquely, sort of, gets around to tackling the former, and surprisingly never directly IDs and addresses the latter.The film is marred by a few weak inclusions (e.g., Muslim gay activists), and drops the ball from time to time by mismanaging other content (e.g., Dr. Newberg). Admittedly, it's a tightrope walk: You can sense that Bill and Mr. Charles wanted a loose, "off-the-hip" feel; but you still have to be careful; you have to handle the artlessness in an artful way; and sometimes Religulous fails to do this.On the other hand, there are mindblowing moments: When Bill nails the Muslim rapper to the wall with his reference to Rushdie, it's worth the price of the ticket. When he illuminates the irrationality which underlies the mutual dismissiveness of the waring parties in Palestine, it's beautiful.Then there are--believe it or not!--elements of quiet reflection, where the faithful are given a little breathing room in the edit: The interview with Ken Ham at the Creation Museum was a good instance of this... Although I'm aware that the raw footage was a little more confrontational; Bill and Charles's decision to produce a more nuanced edit was a good decision.Well, I could go on for quite a bit, but I'll leave it there.If you want get a more detailed analysis after seeing Religulous, I wrote a little bloggy thing, at: http://www.ronazajac.com/Religulous/ . Have a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although some would call Bill Maher's "Religulous" sacrilegious, it is not really a film that convincingly attacks religion, at least not the older monotheistic brands (it does a better job on the newer religious strands). Does it try and point out hypocritical positions? Yes. Does it use irreverent means to do so? Often. Does it succeed at times? Yes. But is it going to shatter religious views? No. It's just an entertaining film. While Maher does a reasonable job at pointing out inconsistencies and hypocritical positions of the Western religions (more successfully with religions that saw their founding in America), what harms the film is not so much what Bill says, but whom he chose to interview. Or rather whom he chose not to interview. Viewed properly, the film is largely an attack on extremist views of whatever persuasion as the majority of those interviewed are fringe characters who would likely embarrass mainstream members of their representative religions (with one or two notable exceptions, such as the Vatican's astronomer). If Bill chose to interview more mainstream representatives from among the non-extremist or non-fundamentalist members of the dominant Western religions (or simply avoid the fringe characters such as the anti-Zionist rabbi) -- which would arguably comprise the majority of adherents -- the film would have been more balanced and possibly more effective. A more balanced presentation with moderate monotheists who are at least as articulate and quick as Bill would have warranted this film at least one more point. As it is, the film, though well made and often absorbing, only rates a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a well made interesting movie exposing people's rationale (or irrationale, if that was a word) about their religious beliefs. It looks at several different religions and spares no one believer from Bill Maher's skeptical interrogations. I did appreciate that one religion in particular was not targeted and that several religions were exposed for their corruption, ignorance, intolerance, and role in war. It's a really thought-provoking subject matter and a brave expose on a subject that is often taboo to challenge or discuss: faith.My only problem with this movie is Bill Maher himself. I actually agree with a lot of his points but why does he have to be such a self righteous prick about it? Yeesh. Aside from that, he's clearly well informed about religion and religious history which I really respect. This is a great movie if you are ready to see faith challenged and learn of some of the atrocities committed in the name of religion. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am, as comedian Dave Allen once said, "A practicing Athiest." I despise religion on every level. Bill Maher is one of my heroes. This Documentary is one of the smartest films I've ever seen. Bill takes almost every aspect of religion and trashes it. He speaks to people of almost every religion about their beliefs. It is amazing at how in-denial religion can make people. We're talking about people arguing with Bill about some of the most fairy tale-ish tales from the Bible. It amazes me that people can look at the facts right in the face and still believe that the Word of God is the way to go. If you are against religion, I highly suggest this documentary. That being said, if you are religious, do NOT watch this unless you want a wake up call.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I joined IMDb to be able to write a quick comment on this incredible documentary. Most people who are speaking negatively of this film concerning the amount of jokes, pointless interviews and such, seem to be missing one thing: the interviews that ARE relevant are AMAZING. If you look (not even that closely) at the interview with the Texas Senator, you will realize that The US is being run by at least one, well, idiot. A man who believes in talking snakes and that the world is 5000 years old, should not be able to become anyone with power (as power should require at least general knowledge). His quote "You don't need to pass an IQ test to become a US Senator" says it all. The other two interviews were for me the most insightful. Two Vatican priests comment long and hard about how pretty much every religious person really is going at religion the wrong way. I find this beautiful. Religious people will not even accept critique from someone in the Vatican, but will base their faith on an old, old book. Makes sense, huh?Bottom line: WATCH THIS. It's really very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film exploring the absurdity of religion and faith is one of a kind and who else to do it than Bill Maher. Maher goes on journey across the US and over seas to explore why people need religion and how dangerous religion can be. Maher never really attacks religion or people of faith, he leaves that up to those he meets to make fools of themselves when they can't answer simple questions on the existence of a supreme being....all they can say is that its all about faith, and God tests our faith every day and you have to believe despite the overwhelming evidence against there being a God. In a lot of ways this film shows what a shame religion is and how it creates such a burden in peoples lives. One example is the guilt and fear people carry that reaches a point of not living full productive lives. After all God might be watching, and I need to watch what I say, eat, drink, think and do otherwise I might go to the pits of hell. Maher explores all kinds of beliefs and faiths from the Mormons, Islam and of course Christianity, and they think God favors them and the rest are wrong which leads as we all know to religious wars and hatred. This film not only shows how foolish religion can be but also how very dangerous it is, and that there are those among us that want nothing more than to bring on the rapture through violent means. So in a sense this film is a warning cause I feel religion makes ignorant fools of people.</fullReview>

The film seemed to lack a unified style, switching abruptly from a light, to funny, to contemptuous, to cautionary. Religulous switched between various sides of the issue of religion while remaining mostly on the idea of the utter ridiculousness of religious belief.There was nothing wrong with the films content, but I would have preferred if they had presented it more unified way.Otherwise, I felt the film to be great, using Bill Maher's unique humor and very intelligent mind to poke fun at one of the most hilarious aspects of our society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm one of those guys that is always watching the shows on the wacky religions, always reading news about Scientologists and the newest suicide cult. For some reason, religion and beliefs interest me greatly.Bill Maher's "Religulous" hits the nail on the head for me... there are so many religions that think THEY are the truth... so what happens at the end of time when everyone is wrong? Debates aside, the movie is entertaining because he interviews the wackiest extremists religion has to offer. A man who thinks he is Jesus incarnate, the founder of the marijuana religion, and plenty of others. Although these are all very extreme examples, he gets his point across.There are only two gripes I have about the film: one, it's really clear that his interviews are heavily edited to make the other guy look ridiculous. The other thing is that the ending is way too sensationalist... he comes out and says that either we abolish all religion, or the world will end at our own hands.Overall, I enjoyed it. I think a lot of people with faith, however, would squirm in their seats and really have a strong dislike for Mr. Maher afterwards.</fullReview>

Regardless of your personal beliefs, Bill Maher's RELIGULOUS forces the viewer to entertain an element of critical thinking, and a healthy dose of skepticism or doubt. I think that, in the end, Maher and company clearly make the point that as citizens of the world we are all at risk by the dangerous thinking of True Believers. And, it all seems to boil down to a simple matter of opinion. One man's Jack and The Beanstalk might be no more true than Jonah and The Whale.

The ridiculous lengths that people go through to follow ancient outdated scripture is hilarious, yet the dead seriousness of some followers is scary and real. Excellent questions and comments, though I would've liked more discussion about morality and how it has been hijacked by religion.The timing of the release of Religulous is important with vice presidential candidates like Pentecostal Palin with a world view that would delight in a nuclear holocaust to supposedly trigger Jesus Poppins to float down from the sky and sing his magic Rapture song.Liberalism, including movies like Religulous that freely ask questions, is wonderfully corrosive to religious extremism that sees the world in an epic us-and-God-verses-them mentality. Exposing the silliness of taking ancient scripture so seriously trips the extremist's righteous stride. Thanks Bill for helping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll leave most of my positive comments for the other people here who have already made them. This is a great and necessary documentary, comedy, and call to action all in one.It was quiet in the cinema at first, because we're all so used to being told that you can't laugh at this stuff, even though many religious folk laugh at the non-religious all the time (when they're not converting us, or condemning us to hell of course). Some of the edits weren't the best, some segments too long and others too short. But once the movie got going, the audience in my rust-belt city was rolling in the aisles with laughter at the bone-headed things people will say to defend their supernatural beliefs.The main point I want to make regards the end, which is the key point of the film. I've seen some criticism of the end, as if it somehow diminishes it. But how can you sit through the utter nonsense of these believers for nearly an hour and a half and then just walk away as if it's all a big joke. Most people in positions of power hold (or claim to hold) these beliefs. More and more of them have their hands on the most dangerous weapons of all time. But believers seem indifferent to whether they are actually used, wiping out humanity and most or all of the life on this planet, because they will all get their heavenly reward in the end anyway. Just as Muslims who stay silent while their brothers and sisters carry out terrorist attacks are enablers of Islamic terrorism, so are all of us enablers of religious violence when we don't call out nonsense for what it is, and demand a higher standard.It's unfortunate that Maher skipped over major religions like Buddhism, and Hinduism, as if it is somehow difficult to find followers right in Bill's own state. I think the movie does come off somewhat biased with its US focus, and inclusion primarily of religions that derive from Judaism. I'd like to see this extended into a series of films, because as the filmmakers also say, there is plenty of material that got cut. One film per topic is fair game.Anyway, Maher has thrown down the gauntlet. It will be interesting to see the response. Will it be censorship (certainly), protests (maybe), death threats (hope not)?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hoping for a logical, thought provoking, unbiased film on religion and the aspects of belief itself. What I got was some very suspect film editing and attempts to show how 'smart' the presenter was in comparison to the people interviewed. There was no real debate with scholars of the various religions, or attempt to explain what the different religions were or what they stood for. Most of the film was the presenter laughing at religion but not attempting to debate or deal with the real questions or issues. Some people were obviously hand picked due to their strong beliefs and then the footage edited to make Bill look "funny" and intelligent (if a little aloof and arrogant). I'm still unsure as to whether this film was in fact a documentary or a comedy (or a campaign reel to show how great Bill is compared to everyone else). I will say, however, that there were some semi-interesting points made, if the viewer could get past what the presenter was trying to ram down their throats. Overall I found this film sad and disappointing. Not because I'm sensitive, and certainly not because of anything to do with religion; but only because this film really could have been so much more.</fullReview>

Instead he focuses on how Muslims see women, and try's to show that Muslims are aggressive people. A VERY subjective documentary.Which brings me to the conclusion. Its one thing showing the "crazy" things you see in religion... But not exploring what evidence each religion brings as proof, changes this from a documentary about religion, to a documentary about things from religion that will sound crazy to you.It has its funny moments, and even though i only gave it 6 out of 10, i can still recommend this, but only to people who shares his opinion.

A belief that will eventually be the cause of the end of humanity, not because of a divine plan, but because people fail to engage in critical thinking. How can anyone believe in talking snakes and invisible higher beings who/that dictate how to live their lives. Evolution is evidence based, much more convincing, and has not been disproved for 150 years. Get used to the idea that when you die there will be no big party that will last forever and ever and ever and ever..... Don't worry, you'll be dead, and you won't feel any inconvenience. So get over the fact that there is no after life...and help put a stop to this delusion. When delusional people put my planet at risk, it is my duty to help put a stop to the insanity.

		<fullReview>I liked Religulous for a particular reason. Like Bill Maher I too was raised in a mixed marriage home although my siblings and I were given no religious upbringing whereas Maher and siblings were raised Catholic. Maher has a particular view that I subscribe to. That being I have no idea what to expect once life on earth is done with me. Neither does anyone else especially those in the business of affirming one view and telling you that every other view is absolutely wrong.In this documentary with footage of real people and brief clips of some Hollywood religious classics, Maher goes into the business of religion both from the seller and the consumer point of view. Some mighty strange folks get interviewed. My favorite is the anti-Israel rabbi who joined with the Iranians to declare holy war on Israel. Some of the anti-gay folks from all the western monotheist religions get their due as well. Imagine in this day and age people proclaiming that gays getting married is the biggest problem humankind faces.In that vein I want to dedicate this film review to the late Phil Zwickler who did a documentary history entitled Rights And Reactions concerning the fight for the gay rights law in New York City in the 70s and 80s. Those City Council hearings had some great theater in them, but the play sure had a happy ending. During a showing of the film Zwickler mentioned that his biggest problem was interviewing the opponents and finding some that made some kind of rational case. He was worried that opponents would say he stacked the deck by putting forward the worst of the other side and was deliberately making them look stupid. Kind of like Donald Trump today. Unlike Phil Zwickler in that different time, Bill Maher showed the crazies in all their glory.There's famous song lyric from The King And I in the Puzzlement song that Yul Brynner sang about the difficulties of kingship. It's one of my favorites and should have been used by Maher in the movie. In talking about belief systems Brynner says people when questioned a bit about their beliefs really couldn't answer questions. But if someone questioned said beliefs the line went "very quickly will he fight, he'll fight to prove that what he does not know is so".And in one song lyric Oscar Hammerstein,II exploded all the stupid reasons we've had for religious conflict the world over. Should have been the theme for Religulous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More anti-Muslim than anti-religious...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was watching the documentary (let's call it that), and being an anti-religion person of the Dawkinsonian type, I found my self actually enjoying it. That is up until he starts talking to the rabbi that was against state of Israel's apartheid regime. He was utterly disrespectful, and letting his Jewish background shine through, he starts bringing up the safety of the Jews. So being for the state of Israel is equal to supporting Jewish safety? And then he brings up Holocaust, as to justify the existence of the Israeli state. And here he starts his hate campaign against Muslims, stating Muslims want the Jews to disappear. As far as I know the Palestinians have been driven from their homes by the Israeli settlers since the state of Israel has come into existence. Are we being selective, when it comes to crimes against humanity? Does that mean the Jews want Muslims to disappear? No, I think we shouldn't put everybody of the same religion in the same category. It is unethical. For a guy portraying him self as someone against all religion, he sure takes a selective swing at Jews that are against crimes perpetrated by the Israeli government. The next thing that was striking, was how he was much more rude towards the Muslims he was interviewing than any other religious person in the film. He was constantly interrupting, saying right out that Islam was a violent religion, and showing films of explosions. How is Islam different from any other major religion when it comes to killing in the name of god? Violence in the name of religion seems to be repeating, if you look at the history. Christians are, and have been, murdering in the name of god for ages, and yet this was not the major theme when Christianity was on the table. Then it was enough for Bill to discuss myths in Christianity, and this politely letting people finish their sentences. The rest of religions were only slightly mocked with an amused air of 'oh you silly people'. Like the Jewish wheel chair that runs on air, and other such cute oddities. Not exactly the most credible film on criticizing religion in general when you seem to push certain agenda like making some religions sound like so much worse than others. I was shocked at the hatred and fear of Islam that was being propagated. In my opinion all religions are the same brainwashing and subjugating people in fear, and that's what I was expecting to be the focus. But I am disappointed at the lack of equal treatment of all religious beliefs as mere belief in myths. And what about the uses of religious excuses to plunder resources of other countries? No, I guess that is not an important issue. Let's turn to religious views on women. He is asking the guy in the Mosque with the golden dome why women are not seen as equals in Islam. I agree! But then he comments how they are seen as equals in his culture. Really? Are we talking about the American culture where there never has been a woman president? The western cultures where women are still being abused in their own homes? Where they get payed less than men for the same work? Why not ask the Jewish man that was gesturing at how crazy the notion of Mohammed having stepped a foot in Israel was? The women of Israel's most religious circles are not even allowed to touch other men than their family. They are seen as inferior and are doing their husbands' bidding. Love it when the same Jewish guy says Mohammed has never stepped a foot on soil of Israel, and that and that's a historical fact. Historical fact?! As all other myths both Muslims, Jews and Christians are surrounding them selves in? And yet this statement was not questioned by Bill... Last minutes of the film can be summed up thus: Showing pictures and clips of Christians and Muslims praying, Muslims shooting, Muslims with guns, Muslims burning stuff, George Bush (?), and two clips of Jewish people praying. Not one footage of Israeli soldiers shooting at civilians (including children). Plenty of those available on the internet, if you couldn't get a hold of any for the film. Bill Maher is trying to come across as an atheist, but clearly favors Judaism, while presenting Islam as the worst religion. No, Bill. You are most certainly not an atheist, but someone pretending to be to gain credibility in the sane intelligent circles of humanity. If you want a true atheist's funny and intelligent opinions on religion, I would warmly recommend George Carlin's stand up and writings. Or read some Richard Dawkins. Plus points for being funny at times, and showing some respect for your own mother. Love a guy that loves his mom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what to believe and what's real, the problem is not the Religions, or the followers it's Believing. Bill focused on followers that to me is the very smart because I always go to them to ask them the same questions, and the answer is what they read, or dad told me or I was born this way ....... I asked one of the followers if you do what they told you (sorry command) you doesn't that make you a Sheep?, he said yes and I accept. the real problem is the leaders of every Religions I'm not talking about Jesus or Moses or Muhammad, the followers did not see them or hear them but the people who speak in in their names, you see the three men were Shepherds, did anyone see a Rabbi carrying a stick and guiding his flock of Sheeps or a Priest or one of the Muslim leaders doing that, anyone??. No nobody seen that images, they all sits and (Money Comes) from every direction and their Trades is GOD. I recall a book to Kahlil Gibran called the Storms it's collection of short stories one of the stories called the Devil you should read it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film served for me but in the opposite way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(sorry for my English) I saw this film and It was interesting for me to see how those non-religious people think about religious people or religion itself. It demonstrates to me that a lie can be so influential and powerful to those who don't know much of the truth that they may form another belief totally erroneous and even dangerous. I think that the reporter in the movie really say what he thinks and that's why his comments and behaves are truthful and interesting. But in fact, he doesn't know about the God. With a narrowed prejudice and self-confidence, he believes that all the religions are absurd. It's not easy to explain why I think that exist God in short terms but I recommend you to focus on fruits. I saw some true Christians who appeared in this film and I think that although they couldn't convince with words to the reporter, anyway they are demonstrating that God exist with their behavior. They are sincere, joyful, peaceful, interested in other people's life, etc. Don't your heart say that they are in the truth? Don't you understand with your heart that the reporter is in error? Is this world of materials and coincidences only? Living rich is aim of our life? Is it all? Don't you know that exist good and evil? The truth is that God has spoken to us and If you listen to him, He will invite you to a new understanding far beyond explications of non-believers can do that you have listened until now. Listen to God and those who testify him. It's the way to understand God, the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Doesn't matter whether you have religions or not, you should watch this movie, it talks about how people see in religions and how much most of people understand religions, and what it brings to people in the end. This movie will show you the other side of religion which most people can not usually see. In a very funny way, well because of Bill Maher, so you can imaging the comedy impact inside of this movie. There are a lots of interviewed and smart talks in this movie, with religious people, the people work for religions, sincerest, workers, public speech man, and so on. You will have a chance to see what all of these people have to say about what the believes, its a very smart movie with a good point. It's opened my eyes, although I am kind of neutral at this point. This movie had changed some of my opinions of the view about religions, I understand it's maybe not everybody's thing, but worth to give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And then there is something called triviality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the questions were directed towards people who rely on their beliefs to take them past the challenges that are offered to them the next day. In that sense, what I see is a set of people who are being deliberately questioned and provoked.Then there is this belief that one person says he doubts everything and is so certain that there is no god. Not that there is no need to venture into "that question", but hasn't it become fashionable now a days to be so certain about what you say (judgmental) and still be not sure about what it takes to solve those problems.If Bill needs proof of why people believe in got, please walk into an Intensive Care Unit, or to the gutters where the less fortunate live and try solving their problems. To which, he can always say, "That's not my problem" or that "They deserve it" or that "I pay my taxes". What about the soldiers on the field. When they stare death in the face or as is common today, when death creeps on them in the form of a suicide bomber, what do you think they need most? What about the people who are on the verge of having their homes and houses torn apart. Why are so many people writing about the disparity between the rich and the poor? Do you have an answer Bill? To which you can always say, does God give an answer to them. Which leads me to think about what Einstein said "We can not solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them".There are also a lot of factual errors in the way he portrays Krishna. He was not a carpenter and neither was he baptized. As for Mithra and his birth date, no where in the bible is it written he was born on the 25th of December. Why then is there this pointless debate about the dates. And on checking about Horus, I find nothing that's similar, except for someone who wrote the stories up. You could say the same thing about the bible and about the whole stories, but then you are as guilty as those who you accuse of plagiarism.All the same, there are points we can always agree to, which is, there are people who exploit others in the name of religion and you need know about them. On this one aspect, I do agree with Bill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Maher is an atheist with a Jewish mother and a Catholic father. He was raised as a Catholic. The family quit church when he was 13. He travels around the country visiting a truck stop church, reverend Jeremiah Cummings, preacher John Westcott who is an ex-homosexual, an ex-Jew for Jesus Steve Burg, Senator Mark Pryor, a Bible theme park, Mormons, lots more and a few Muslims.The problem is that Bill is too stridden and too argumentative. It would be a lot more convincing for him to come at this with an open mind. It's basically an hour and a half of Bill berating these people or snicker at their beliefs. It even comes with snaky little subtitles. It serves no purpose other than to preach to the choir. Even Bill's believers wouldn't get that much fun out of it. It would either be annoying to listen these crazy people blather on and on.... Or it would be annoying to listen to Bill making fun of the crazy people. It's also edited like a high school project. There are some moments of interesting interviews but those come few and far in between. It would be so much better to have serious talk. That's where most of the interesting stuff comes from. The funny jokes don't work without a willing audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If God exists, he/she/it wants you to see this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For Christ's sake! Reading through some reviews here, it seems some people just don't get that even though the subject is serious, Bill Maher is a COMEDIAN. So, this is not intended to be a serious documentary, but a comedy that looks like a documentary. People who don't like this movie for its humor (because it supposedly makes fun of religious people) confirm exactly what Maher tries to say about religions and how they manipulate the minds. We shouldn't laugh about religion, because God has no humor, right? (Read the Bible and you'll know what I'm talking about.)A serious documentary, though, would come to the same conclusion as Maher, since it just can't be denied that religious people believe in FANTASY. It's grotesque, for example, that Christians ridicule the doctrines of "religions" like Scientology for being absurd, while they themselves believe in absurd things like a talking serpent or a God that has a son who is himself! Exactly this is what Maher, with humor, is trying to say: all religions teach NONSENSE.Who can deny that?How can people from one religion look at other people, from different religions, with disdain, if all religious people, no matter from which religion, equally believe in fantasy? Religions combat each other, because, as we all know, only one religion can be the true one. And here lies the biggest problem with religions, which Maher very well exposes: they are dangerous because they separate people from each other and make them hate and FIGHT, even though they think they preach "love".This is pure madness!And then there are those Christians who criticize Maher for showing Christians they say are no good examples of good Christians (literate, compassionate, etc.), which means THEY see themselves as better representatives of good Christianity. Really? They think they represent Christianity better, but nevertheless and equally believe that homosexuality is sin, the woman was made out of a rib, in devil, hell, end of the world, etc., etc., etc. So, where is the difference? Their "intelligence" doesn't seem to make them different from the illiterate Christians.Comedy or serious documentary, at the end the message would have been the same. That's why this movie is very important and everybody should see it, despite being a comedy, which was the reason I liked it so much.Note: if you want to understand, but really on the highest possible level, why religions are nonsense, read "Ethics" by Baruch Spinoza and FREE yourself forever from all religious nonsense!</fullReview>

You could make the same movie interviewing biology students. Since not all biology students are geniuses, most of them will give you bullshit answers if you ask challenging enough questions. Now based on that you cannot say that biology is bullshit. You'll have to challenge the most brilliant and the smartest biologists. Again, that's not to say that religion is equivalent to biology--what I'm saying is the film had nothing surprising or unexpected, or even amusing, to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Particularly Fun to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right out the gate, I want to be very clear on one point. I am an agnostic. Theoretically, I should be in this movie's target audience. I really just did not enjoy this documentary, and it's not hard to explain why.Bill Maher could have filmed this movie with the intent of exposing the comical excesses of some religious sects, or he could have written it with a more serious intention to understand the dangers presented by extremism and the relationship of extremism with more mainline religion. Instead, he tries to combine those two goals into a single film, and it really shows.For his critique of organized religion, Maher seems to interview the people least likely to be able to defend themselves against his barbs. Although some certainly deserve it, others seem more like they're being ridiculed because they are less educated, or because they're unable to properly articulate their beliefs. While debating Francis Collins, Maher at one point obfuscates the distinction between scientific and historical evidence while questioning whether the existence of the gospels presents a strong enough argument for Jesus' existence (note his existence, not his divinity).While a handful of good points are raised here, and while there is some genuine humor interspersed throughout, this movie overall just isn't very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Maher's documentary could have been so much better without his attitude</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this documentary again after seeing it in theaters when it first came out. It doesn't hold up nearly as well as I remember it.Even when I first saw it, I thought it was a good effort, but that Bill Maher was way too sarcastic to the people he interviewed, and brought up graphic sex references (including the word pussy several times without a particular need for it), for no real purpose; then laughed at his own wit. Which he does an awful lot in this documentary; as in, continuously. Meanwhile, as Roger Ebert noted in his own review, the subjects of his ridicule show remarkable forbearance and patience in dealing with Bill Maher's sarcasm and smugness. He's not being smarter than them as he laughs; they are being patient and respectful with him, and he mistakes their silence for his own answerable cleverness. They could easily respond on his level, but they choose not to.Bill Maher doesn't realize that by doing that, he completely undercuts the premise of his own documentary, and loses the argument, without his opponents doing anything but enduring his sarcastic and often juvenile language (as in his unnecessary references to anal sex and blowjobs to a couple of gay activists, who seem quietly repelled by his behavior).This is the central weakness of his film. It really can't be called a documentary, as he really doesn't go into detail about the different religions, so we don't learn any more about them than we already know. Instead, it is a long series of interviews, where Bill Maher sets up and delivers the punch line at his subjects' expense, congratulates himself with his own laughter, and is edited to make Maher look clever, and his subjects look stupid. Except that, even with the editing, Maher's smugness and disrespect domes through, making him look worse than the religious he is interviewing. Christopher Hitchens states that religion often makes people behave worse, not better, but here Maher achieves the opposite: by being a smug, cynical, disrespectful jerk who makes continual sexual references while not doing an honest interview, he makes religion look better; because his religious subjects don't match his behavior.I am an atheist myself and enjoy Bill Maher's show Real Time; it is very strange to me that I should find myself on the side of the religious. In that sense, Bill Maher's film fails as both a documentary and as an argument for his point. He should either have left the sarcastic attitude at home, or chosen a more objective interviewer to do the project. It's as if he thought his film had to be funny, or people would not watch it. Unfortunately he chose to insert insulting jokes at the expense of his subjects (including degrading sexual references), instead of letting the humor come out of the illogic of the religions, by letting it speak for itself. This film could have been and should have been so much more than it was; an actual documentary on the dangers of religion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maher Irreverent and Irreligious Look at Organized Religion in Amusing Albeit Occasionally Disresectful Comedic-Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two of the most vocal critics of modern organized religion at this writing in April 2012 have been the late Christopher Hitchens and Bill Maher. Hitchens was an intellectual and journalist who wrote a scholarly book called "God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything" in which he recounts recurring incidences of man's inhumanity to man in which religion was the basis. Bill Maher who is a political comedian rather than a journalist/scholar uses an irreverent comedy piece disguised as a documentary to make his point. Although most of the documentary is a completely irreverent and sometimes disrespectful look at religion, replete with old film footage and less-than-flattering photos, he begins his journey by reminding us that human beings are now capable of enacting Armageddon, not just God.The documentary is relatively unstructured which is of course Maher's style. He visits evangelicals, ministers, rabbis, priests, politicians, even former Mormons in no particular order and pokes fun at the problem of literalism and fundamentalism. In these interviews, he asks questions about biblical inconsistencies, biblical myths, biblical immorality, and why "faith" is so important. A very wide range of answers are provided by the interviewees, although a recurring theme of circular logic is constantly offered by the evangelicals: "We know God is real because the Bible tells me so, and the Bible is the Word of God." Sort of the equivalent of "George Washington couldn't lie about chopping down the cherry tree because he always told the truth." Although Maher's confrontations are aimed at a wide spectrum of religious and non-religious people, he does single out the Evangelical-Fundamentalists and the Mormons as prime targets, although he also takes a dab at Scientology as well. While at times, some of his interview style seems a bit disrespectful, I think there is an underlying message to his confrontations. Trying to reconcile the Bible as the perfect no-questions-asked document to history, science and morality is not only impossible, but shown to be a mixing of two entirely different ways of examining reality. Sort of like trying to find the square-root of a Da Vinci. However, the Fundamentalists for about the last century having been desperately trying to prove their interpretation of the Bible also reconciles with science, and therefore science is wrong if it comes to different conclusions. And therefore current understandings of science and history must be altered to fit with Scripture. Theme parks and pseudo-science have become fundamentalist tools for dealing with arguments they can't win except to those who already sing in the choir. However, they have convinced themselves they can win theological arguments on rationalists grounds, and that's what I think Maher is trying to expose. One theme park centered on Creation shows dinosaurs and supposedly early humans living together. There's even a saddle on a triceratops! I believe Maher demonstrates that unquestioned belief in certain key areas are part of how particular American denominations are structured. He even talks about how the Mormons believe God lives on a particular planet! This is Maher's entertaining means of exposing some of the silliness in terms of hard-core beliefs in religions. Two of my favorite moments are when a bona fide US Senator who admits there's no IQ test for getting a seat in the Senate when Maher asks whether he really believes there was a talking snake 5000 years ago. He then meets a rather maverick priest at the Vatican who admits frustration in regards to all the contradictions that the Bible and Doctrine pose. I don't think the documentary is meant to be taken too seriously, but I believe he wants the hard-core fundamentalists of all religions to take a moment, relax, breathe, and not take everything so seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as my religion taught me, never ever doubt the teaching. But as I grew up things in my mind started to change towards the concept of 'doubting'. Bill Maher has shown his points about 'doubts' in this movie and I think it's a good addition in a way where people who believe in their religion don't have to be afraid. Since I think doubting is not the main point here. But it's more into why do religious people seems to forget about what it is right to become human and treat others as equally as possible. And I love the way he brought the subjects and confronts the people behind it. Funny but in the same time sarcasm takes place, which is basically more like asking for the truth over a question.All in all I recommend this film for people who wants to see different point of view and also not easily offended by its contents.

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie, and as an agnostic who grew up catholic and is dealing with the hypocrisy of religion from people in my life who say they are Christian, and think it is OK to molest and abandon children and cheat on their wives but are "at peace" because god forgives, this movie confirmed my beliefs that religion is dangerous. Bill's comedy to me runs hot and cold, but he nailed it in this movie. I at first thought the people he interviewed were easy targets, and they ended up looking as such, but if you are willing to be interviewed for a movie, are opinionated, and yourself one-sided in your views, you better be prepared to answer hard questions or risk looking like a buffoon. Sometimes frustrating as Bill had to exit an interview and also deflect at other times a bit because he could not get a word in edgewise, but also intriguing, hilarious at times, and although possibly not historically accurate (I've heard both sides), does a great job showing just how ridiculous certain beliefs would be by simply changing dates and names. The interview at the Vatican was priceless by the way. Well done overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a documentary where Real Time host Bill Maher(who's fairly sharp and clever in his comments, and he doesn't let them get away with a lot of runaround) travels around the world to display both mainstream, and more fringe, religion, and the details thereof. A lot of believers are interviewed, and, of course, they are asked numerous questions that they can't give a satisfying answer to(sometimes they utterly refuse to even respond). It covers Christianity, Judaism, Islam and various subgroups thereof(including some Jews that support the Holocaust-denying Ahmadinejad(!)), and even finds a Vatican priest who flat-out admits that it's all BS. It's edited well, interspersing movie clips from both pop culture and specific proselytizing works, and keeps to a nice pace, covering a subject quite thoroughly before moving on to a new continent and another faith. I really only have one issue with this, unfortunately, it is a big one. Except for the threat of violence(essentially all placed with the Muslims), it doesn't particularly go into *why* we should fear unreasonable convictions(which we most certainly should), why this is such a rallying cry against such. Contrary to popular theist opinion, we secular humanists couldn't care less what you do as long as it doesn't affect anyone who didn't agree to it. Keep it in your own family and church(provided that no one is coerced in there, or to remain there against their will), and you'll hear no complaints from us. Well, a few jerks exist in every crowd, of course. But it's only when you make it political, when you try to, as you so love to accuse us of, shove your ideas down our throats. It's the human rights atrocities, the treatment of minorities, the disregard for whether something works or not(if it ain't in their holy book, don't expect it to be applied under their rule) that, when you're lucky enough that it isn't doctrine, is largely ignored and allowed, as they tend to be the obvious(to the scientific mind and inquiry) outcomes of trying to force people into a way of living that is not fit for human beings(do you think Catholic vicars would have molested children if not for them having to be abstinent, and being around altar boys more than women? And would it have been covered up if it didn't make this supposed "perfect organization" look bad, or if there was a realistic way to solve it other than going against scripture?). Without that critical aspect, a lot of people will sadly rightly dismiss this with "just leave them alone, they can think whatever they want". It really is too bad. There is a bit of disturbing content in this, the amount depending on your constitution and your personal perspective on the subject. I recommend this to everyone open to questioning theology. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Religulous is a fabulous documentary that will never ever get the credit it truly deserves. I would describe it as the mother of all "mockumentaries". But, like I said, it's basically impossible that it will be appreciated by roughly 85% of the world's population. Why? Very simple: 85 of every 100 people profess some kind of religion or other spiritual concoction and every single one of them will feel insulted and possibly threatened by the, not so subtle, suggestion their beliefs are total crap. The film states that 93% of the world's scientific community are atheists, something I suspected. Only intelligent people dare to question, analyze and eventually doubt the teachings most of us received as kids. The masses won't wanna hear a word about Bill Maher's doubts and the most fanatical will think he deserves to be killed for his "blasphemous" portrait of Religion in general. I personally admire Bill for the enormous courage he displayed in making this movie, I'm not sure I would have had the guts to do it myself. Once again I think it's a pity the vast majority of human beings won't even begin to understand his message. In this respect, this documentary is well ahead of its time. My best hope is that, a hundred or two hundred years from now in a more enlightened and open-minded planet Earth, this brilliant piece of human self-examination may broaden the horizons of those lucky enough to understand it.Kudos Bill Maher...you truly are one of a kind!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No atheist manifesto .. yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw Bill Maher's Religulous yesterday. Regular viewers of Real Time with Bill Maher and Bill's stand-up shows will know what to expect, and Bill doesn't fail to deliver. Religulous is a good-humoured attack on religious beliefs in general and the big religious organisations in the US in particular. Through a series of irreverent interviews with ministers, priests, rabbis, 'formerly gay' evangelicals and 'escaped' Mormons, Bill paints a picture of hypocrisy, lack of logical reasoning, evasive answers and rigid doctrine.The way Bill approaches these people is certainly a breath of fresh air. There have been other documentaries dealing with religion, but even the most critical of these usually display some (innate?) reverence towards 'persons of the cloth', whether they deserve any or not. Not Bill. When a 'formerly gay' minister decides to hug Bill farewell, the latter simply inquires about a possible hard-on. When a group of men in a truck stop chapel decide to bless Bill and pull him into a prayer circle, he claims to be missing his wallet afterward, etcetera. There are plenty of irreverent and funny moments like that.Still ? it isn't all good. It's quite clear that Bill took a leaf or two from Michael Moore's and Stephen Colbert's editing play-books. Asking a difficult or trick question and substituting a likely answer with a puzzled or stupid look just to make the subject look goofy has been done before. It is funny when it's not overdone. In Religulous it is used a lot, and although it serves its comedic purpose quite effectively, it does look like a cop-out when done to death. Bill Maher is a very funny person, and religion hardly needs any parody; using editing tricks to stress either point makes it look a bit forced.There is one other point that feels like a missed opportunity: Bill is so busy showing the downside and inconsistencies of religious beliefs that the case for atheism that he is clearly trying to make is underexposed. The documentary could easily have lost the UK rapper (who failed to utter a consistent thought), the Dutch cannabis guy (who failed to utter any thought until his hair caught on fire) and the gay Muslim guys (who failed to do more than sit there). That would have freed up ten minutes or so for people like Richard Dawkins and Cristopher Hitchens, both of whom are among the most eloquent and savvy defenders of atheism and critics of religious beliefs. They appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher numerous times, so they would undoubtedly have been happy to voice their opinion. It would have made Religulous into a more coherent atheist manifesto.The rather one-sided (albeit humorous) approach fails to put Religulous into the 'ooompf!' class of Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine. It is preaching to the atheist choir (people who don't need to be convinced) and it will fail to cause even a slight dent in the religious mindset (people who only respond to strong-armed manipulation or even propaganda). Adding Richard Dawkins and Michael Moore as executive producers to the payroll of Religulous II might be a good idea ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny and interesting, educational doc that doubts the existence of the all mighty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who knows or has watched Bill Maher(HBO's "Real Time")over the years knows the man is a committed left wing liberal, and he tells it like it is he doesn't hide his thoughts or opinions he holds back no punches. Though he's often skeptical and a doubter of political correctness he often proves his point in a funny and thoughtful way make no bones about it.His doc "Religulous" many see as an anti film that's against god, I disagree as you watch it only provides thought and theory as to question as to really if the all mighty exist. As Maher journeys thru the country and the world to holy sites and he interviews many hard core Christian believers. And even though he pokes fun and doubt Bill still respects their viewpoints, yet he provides good points and shows connected topics to showcase the holy stuff and religion as simply myths and fairy tales.As Maher interviews people who say that the bible print is actual work and word of god, yet many scholar intellects claim it's just stories and history of old time fairy tales passed down to make people believe. As many of the films hard core believers really don't have any evidence to show the prove of it's existence they say faith is all they need. Yet Maher proves the bad points of religion as it's montage clips show the bad side of how it's tied to politics and greed. Even Maher points out that our founding fathers believed religion and politics should be separate. And the clips of money and religion are so telling it's greed and money that promotes the gospel, and rightfully Maher points out that Jesus hated rich snobs and loved the poor.You even see how many believers have taken it overboard by creating a religion theme park for tourists to see something that simply just makes money and uses religion as a propaganda tool. Also Maher questions that religion has no right to question homosexuality as he feels many were born that way, and he clearly doesn't believe that God wanted war, yet as known and as the footage shows the holy lands have always been a place of fighting. The scenes interviews, and comparisons are well done they make you wonder about things.Really this is an interesting and educational yet funny doc, in which Maher is bold and brash in his questioning of religion and it's powers of faith. Still no matter what side your on this is not an anti-religion film it's just a film that raises reasonable doubt. So no matter how you see it Maher makes some good points about the bad side of religion of it's money ties and political greed, yet I'm still a believer I suggest no matter if you agree with Maher or not that you see this doc it's funny yet also highly informative, educational and controversial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Maher strikes gold. Now if we could get the right people to fill the seats this weekend, wars might end. People might grow up. And instead of Jews, Christians, Muslims, Wiccans, Buddhists or whatever, we might realize we're just earthlings, all on the same planet, and that we should play nicely. So my two cents worth is as follows.I agree with Maher that all organized religion is a poison to all peoples, all civilizations. It divides them unnecessarily. "If you do not believe what I believe in, I will kill you, for my God tells me so." Have you heard the phrase, God's Army? What? An intelligent being who can come up with 546 species of butterflies has to resort to bullying tactics to win supporters??? What entity would demand it's followers have blind faith, and then proceed to exhibit a litany of psychotic behavior. God plays games with people's lives? You need look no further than the book of Jobe for my point to be proved. God takes a good and honest man and destroys his life to prove a point to the devil? Do you really think a girl sniffed a flower and got pregnant? Might it be friend that like today's teenage girls she went out with first good looking guy to walk into her village. Logical, isn't it.Does any religion make sense??? No, none of them do, they all have plot holes worthy of a Michael Bay movie.Religion is for con men to make money off of the people who think they can buy their way into heaven!! I don't know what went on two thousand years ago, no one does. Regardless I'm not going to trust any account written by those people, a people who didn't know the importance of basic hygiene.If the majority of earthlings 200 years ago were ignorant, what were they like two thousand years ago? How did they react to a rainbow? Failed crops? A natural disaster? Was the Aurora Borealis a God to people 5,000 years ago? A comet -- an omen? A volcano -- the devil? Zeus, Jesus and prophets from all religions were legends, stories to help man behave correctly until countless con men figured they could get rich and/or control people through the fear! Religion is so heinous that it has the ability to divide its own ranks. A civil war launched by Henry the 8th still rages to this day!! Protestants against Catholics. They both believe in the bible and in Jesus Christ yet they still knock the snot out of each in his name.Millions have died in the name of all religions, more so than any war or natural disaster in the history of mankind.If you want to believe in what's important . . . believe in each other. And help each other. Love each other. Do the right thing. Do we, as responsible adults, require fear of the unknown and what happens to us after death to make us behave like good little boys and girls.Can we not be a peaceful people on our own volition.Where as Bill Maher does not elude to anything like my last paragraph, I will not reproach him for having no answers to questions he brings up . . . because, maybe there are no answers, unless of course the answer to Life, the Universe and everything is in fact . . . 42.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best documentary ever. I can watch this over and over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How did I never heard about this gem before? A friend that knows I am a convinced atheist told me I had to watch this and that I would like it. 8 years after the making of Religulous I finally had someone that told me about it and oh was I pleased! I literally had a smile on my face from beginning till the end. Bill Maher asks the perfect questions to the believers of any stupid religion and their answers are just hilarious. The fact that you can see that they know they are wrong, when Bill Maher replies to their answers with a silly but true answer or question is just hilarious. This is by far the best documentary I ever saw on any subject. It's not about getting a proof about the existence of a God, but just the opposite. It's about making the people see they are scammed since centuries and they continue being scammed now. Most of them actually know it but are just too afraid of death you could make them make believe whatever you want. Some are just eternal idiots that will never change their mind about religions, but those are also not the smartest puppy out of the litter let's say. If you are like me a convinced atheist you will adore this movie. If you are a believer of whatever religion, you will be or ashamed you ever believed in those nonsenses, or it will open your eyes and you will change your mind, or you will be scandalized and will continue being a dumb sheep of society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant work by Bill Maher. When I first heard about this, I was expecting a boring documentary featuring a lot of debates but Bill Maher has done a great job in making it both funny and thought provoking at the same time. Not only does he clearly refute their claims, he also does it in a way that makes it both hilarious and interesting.The documentary exposes the blindness induced in the common mass by religion and thereby points out why it is harmful.This documentary is a must watch for everyone. This movie is not just a mockery of faith, instead it is about empowering the average person to think, to question ideas and beliefs rather than blindly following it and also to show empathy and compassion towards others even if they are slightly different rather than condemning them with a black and white definition of good and bad just because it is said so in the religious texts.So, to conclude this movie is mainly against the social evils that is going on in the name of faith which hurt not only other humans but also the planet as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I "belieive" this to be the one and only great documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler - I'm an atheist. This film's biggest achievement is to show that Believers of all religions only see the positive aspects of THEIR faith for themselves, and just as easily dismiss all atrocities and contradictions as misunderstandings, politics, and propaganda.If you are of a "faith" I suggest you perhaps watch this film with eyes wide open. Yes that's an atheist suggesting you look into something, rather than the other way around for a change."Religulous" does not set out to destroy a dominant religion - it destroys (in a very simplistic way) them all. Jews, Catholics, Muslims, Mormons, Scientologists et al. All get the same treatment. I don't know of Maher. Never even heard of him. But after watching this film, would love to see more "Moore" stuff from him. The wit makes what could easily have become a dull, anti-faith rant a very funny, (admittedly, not thought provoking) enjoyable documentary."This is the Mount of Olives. A lot of Orthodox Jews want to be buried here. Because they believe that when the Messiah comes, he will raise them from the dead and march them through that Golden Gate and on to the Temple Mount. Which is why the Muslims have walled up the Gate. The better to keep out the Jewish Messiah and his kosher zombies from getting in. Although you'd think that if you had the power to raise the dead...you'd have the power to jump a fence." Very funny.The film jumps around a number of countries and continents, precis thousands of years of religious history and still manages to produce an extremely entertaining collection of interviews and segments in which people of different faiths all make an idiot of themselves. From any of them, there is no doubt, tolerance, accountability, guilt or shame. One message comes across loud and clear - whatever the belief - the Believer is innocent and righteous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While lacking certain aspects and qualities to make it a truly magnificent documentary, Religulous has a combination of both humor and brain power to make it stand up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The documentary travels to places most mainstream projects have not gone. Bill Maher does not pull any punches as he travels to globe interviewing people of different creeds and cultures asking about their faith. The humor found in this film will mainly only translate to those who personally have questioned religion themselves. If you have devout faith in God, then this movie isn't for you. However, if you do not this movie will have you laughing out loud, while also feelings empowered that someone else thinks and acts like you. Maher does something many Atheists dream of, and that is cutting down religion to the radical believers and watching them squirm as you do it. The content is great, but the movie is heavily one-sided and starts to drag a bit towards the end. Bill Maher seems to be less "ballsy" when confronting Non-Christians in the film, such as those of the Jewish faith or Islamic faith. This documentary certainly isn't for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Socratic questions, but betrays Koheleth's pessimism under the hilarious one-liners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maher is on a quest, but it is a personal quest. First, the meaning of religion. How can otherwise rational people believe in a talking snake, a virgin birth? Second, a search of himself.He uses Socrates's method: interviewing religious fanatics by asking simple questions. And getting confused answers which he turns into ridicule with hilarious impromptu one-liners.But the interviews can become tense. When one burly truck driver puts his heavy hand on his shoulder, one wonders. But it's only to bless him. Maher pulls away from the embrace and exclaims with feigned alarm, "Hey, my wallet!", defusing the heavy atmosphere, and getting out unharmed. However, Maher did get evicted from the Vatican, and expelled from the grounds of the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City.Maher loves to expose the incoherence of ordinary beliefs, nurtured only by ignorance and emotional insecurity. Larry Charles accompanies Maher's points with clips of great music and video from the archives to emphasize the punch line, amplify the joke. With famous figures thrown in, like George W. Bush praying for success in Iraq, saying that what he did was for God.In 2008 the fear of a nuclear holocaust was very real, sparked by Osama's terrorist threats. The link of religion and war could mean auto-destruction of the planet. Maher's apocalyptic fears are linked to his conviction that religion is a neural disorder. Religion naturally breeds crazy ideas, fanaticism, dogmatism, extremism, zealots, and terrorism. It is now the worst danger, because of the uncontrollable scope of modern nuclear weapons.Maher's ironical chuckling protects the documentary from boredom. The laughs defuse the tension caused by his criticisms. He pokes fun at priests, charlatans and hypocrites. Some are sincerely deluded ministers. Some are cynical observers. Maher ignores those apostate priests who denounce religion with serious books. They don't provide laughs.Some of the most striking scenes:- The truckers chapel (converted Mack truck). - The reformed homosexual, pastor John Westcott, who helps gays to reform as well.- The believer in little miracles, Steve Burg, who sees God's sign when it rained to fill up his glass at a party, and thinks that he is on a mission, like Jonah. Innocence and credulity have no limits. "If heaven is so much better, why don't you just kill yourself?"- The reminder that Jefferson and the Founders did not believe in establishing a Christian nation.- The Arkansas Senator Mark Pryor, who doubts evolution, supports a literal interpretation of the Bible and creationism, and the ten Commandments. "You don't have to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate".- The Christian creation museum in Kentucky and its founder, Ken Ham. The dinosaurs sport saddles, ready for riding.- The Vatican astronomer, Father George Coyne : there's no science in the Bible. evolution was accepted long ago by John Paul II. - The maverick senior Vatican scholar, Reginald Foster, who agrees that Hell is an obsolete belief. Biblical stories cannot be taken literally. Christmas is a fictitious birth date.- The Holy Land Experience theme park in Florida, with a lengthy interview of the Jesus actor, and a chilling re-enactment of the walk to Golgotha and the crucifixion. The audience even more revealing than the sadistic show. And mankind has been led to believe that this was the passage on earth of an all-powerful god! The absurdity is unfathomable. Future historians, studying this period, may wonder how such beliefs were at all possible.- The spoof of Scientology at Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park.- The Mormons, a favorite butt of irony for Maher.- The Pentecostals speaking in tongues.- The Ultra-orthodox rabbi David Weiss who believes that Israel should not exist, and attended a Holocaust denial conference with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. His refrain, "Let me finish", cutting off Maher. This rabbi had to fight for his right to speak. Maher ends up walking out on him "Not again, rabbi, not again".- The Jewish inventor who creates devices to avoid using electrical or mechanical equipment during the Sabbath, exploiting "loopholes".- The Puerto-Rican emigrant who passes for a reincarnation of Jesus.- The Muslim woman Fatima Elatik, who cannot admit to any violence in her religion.- The visit of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.Maher ironically summarizes the interviews in his car with Larry Charles. This gives Maher the final comment for the audience.He uses a few crude words, and a nude model to symbolize the virgin in an acceptance mode, but also terrifying images of violence and killing that punctuate the film as a leitmotif.Maher's documentary seeks to illustrate the major criticism that the German philosopher Arthur Drews raised (back in 1909), in his famous "Christ Myth" book that shook the world, holding that Christianity and Judaism are beliefs of antiquity that come loaded with ancient superstitions that we can no longer understand, and which have become obsolete in our modern industrial and scientific world.Maher's critics, to depict him, like to use abstract words in a figurative meaning, still colored by their original religious meaning. His strong interest and desire to expose the ridiculous in religion? - That becomes his "evangelical" zeal. His emotional fervor? - He is "preaching". His own valued principle of rationality and critical thinking? - His "creed", which indicates "faith". His manifesto? - He too has a "religion". But Maher does not fall into this trap of confusing opposites.Still, his search is imbued with pessimism about the future of the planet. "Grow up or die" is the final exhortation in his splendid final monologue of apocalyptic wisdom.If Maher follows Socrates in his questioning method, his spirit is a descendant of Koheleth, called "Ecclesiastes" in the Hebrew Bible.ROO BOOKAROO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie of a comedian doubting Christianity, Islam, Mormonism and Scientology on a basic level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is most impressive, as with most of Bill's work, in the number of influential people with whom Bill can get an audience with for his no-nonsense approach to questioning. Although this movie hardly skips across the deep theological questions behind faith, truth, and the meaning of life, it does hone in a few social issues impacted by an equal level of shallowness shown by leaders and followers of the major faith systems in the United States, namely homosexuality, literalism of the Bible vs. scientific reasoning, prosperity doctrine (the idea that Jesus wants Americans to be rich), sexism, violence, and intolerance among others.If you are a member of the Tea party, I suggest you watch this movie to open your mind. If you are an atheist or an agnostic, you'll only be getting a kick out of laughing at helpless victims of your world view, which ultimately makes you the oppressor, becoming the intolerant ignorant follower you accuse others of being. If you want a beginners guide to big questions in Christianity, then watch this movie and go talk to a pastor for some follow up questions. If you live in New York, I suggest visiting a sermon at Redeemer Presbyterian Church for a response, possibly requesting time with a Deacon or a small group leader.If you are a martian, no, Bill Maher's hair is not how all aging comedians where it, its just the way he is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In watching Maher's HBO panel discussion show for the past few years, I already know Maher's stance on topics ranging on everything from the legalization of marijuana to the covert diet of high fructose corn syrup that covers the United States. Another topic he beats to a pulp is his stance on religion. Maher seems certain that it is the frayed fabric of religion that is the cause of nearly all of society's ills.I guess after grumbling about religion for so long he finally took it upon himself to either expose religion for the fraud he believes it is or in getting someone, anyone to go toe to toe with him on why people believe in an all knowing and all mighty force in the universe.Considering that Maher was a comedian before he was a political entertainer, I was expecting a tad bit more of the humor in religion. However, a lot of the humor derived in this film comes off as mean spirited, especially towards some of the inarticulate flock that were good enough to give him an audience. This sort of venom does not do him or his film any favors. I feel that after however long it took Bill and his crew to get a lot of this footage for the film, it just wasn't long enough. The film feels incomplete, not whole.The movie is not entirely humorless, it does have its moments, but all in all the movie doesn't end up any better off for gaining anything it didn't already understand or (not)believe in the first place. It doesn't go anywhere and most of the time it appears to be lost in search of meaning, not unlike people searching for meaning in life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good - but please do some research</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is Bill Maher's attempt to show why religious people should have some doubts about the existence of god.In Sweden a lack of faith is the norm, so it's not a controversial issue here but in many nations - including USA it stirs up some emotions.It is a well told film, but it does borrow some of Michael Moore's ways which makes it less truthful than it could have been. My major criticism is Maher's lack of research in some areas and how he sometimes lets the people he intervjues of the hook and at other times pounds on errors in details. If you are going to criticise something as important to many people as religion you should have done more research than the people who put up museums where men and dinosaurs walk side by side or else it will backfire: how can you claim they are spouting nonsense when you are too? For the non-believers this is an entertaining little film, but if you are a Christian then I doubt this will do anything other than anger you: you've probably heard the arguments before and it's not likely you are as ill-informed as the proponents of religion are in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biased but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very funny and entertaining documentary about Religion, religions and faith from the perspective of stand-up comedian Bill Maher -an agnostic and devil's advocate- who interviews different pastors, priests, and religious leaders to prove his point.I share Maher's premises, thoughts and conclusions, but Maher's point get lost in his intransigence, which is exactly what he criticizes here. In other words, if you want to criticize people who preach mambo-jumbo and things that are not reasonable you have to do so from from the point of view of Reason (not of your beliefs!) with respect, and without preaching. Otherwise, you'll be doing the same thing you are criticizing. And that is what happens to Maher!!!! What annoyed me the most was that Maher doesn't show the same respect to Christians, Jews and Muslims, at all. For example, when interviewing some of the crazy Christian pastors he lets them speak while he adds his funny comments and points out to their bullshit in the intercalated super-funny visual montages. However, and despite he being half-Jew, he doesn't even let talk to the Rabbi who criticizes Israel, whose voice is barely heard. The same happens when he interviews some of the Dutch Muslim people. On the other hand, the only people who seem to make sense among the interviewees are Catholics, as only them seem to reconcile Science and Religion, and to self-mock(Maher is an ex-Catholic... ex?).However, Maher is very good and sharp other times, especially when he let the nonsense express in full and directs the conversation without superimposing his views. If he had made the documentary from a less personal point, without wanting to proof his point no matter what, he would have succeeded at doing so more convincingly.I especially liked the interview to the Arkansas Senator who self-destroys his credibility), the interviews to the re-incarnated Latino Jesus and the one to the black-rich pastor, and his visit to the thematic park "Holy Land".A very entertaining movie if you don't take it too seriously and forgive Maher for bullshitting the viewer now and then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not really on target</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher has always struck me as a comedian-pundit that somehow adds up to more than the sum of his parts. His jokes aren't that funny nor his observations particularly insightful, but in combination, he manages to be reasonably entertaining and interesting. This is true of "Religulous." It's really not a documentary or a satire or even a balls-out mockery of religion. It's a lot of cheap jabs at easy targets. It's pretty easy to wring a few snickers out of dimwit televangelists or a truck stop chapel or the guy who plays Jesus at a Holy Land-theme park in Orlando. Maher just looks like a smug bastard knocking down these straw men.Where the movie is better is in shining a light on the outrageous things true believers say to the faithful -- including a former U.S. Commander-in-Chief on a televised debate -- that almost make you gasp. You realize that these people -- be they Christian politicians, Muslim clerics, or Scientologists -- actually believe this stuff. Maher doesn't want to mock people who go to church on Sunday and don't think much about it. He wants to shock them into seeing that some of the folks who run those churches or draw support from their membership are seriously dangerous demagogues. In the end, he makes a surprisingly passionate and articulate plea for rationalism that I wish to God I could hear from a politician's mouth someday."Religulous" says all religion is bunk. It says it in ways both smart and smarmy, but it makes no bones about that thesis. That blunt declaration, along with some of the more egregious examples Maher trots out, provides ample fodder for thinking people of all faith stripes to chew over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Bill Maher but I don't necessarily agree with him on his religious views which are obviously atheistic. I think he tries the Michael Moore approach in this documentary but it doesn't work. First, I had to restart my DVD a couple times over to understand what he was trying to prove or state. Anyway, he takes his journey to Rome, Vatican City, Megiddo, Israel, Jerusalem, New York City, New Jersey, and Orlando, Florida where there is the Holy Land Experience. Of course, Maher is mocking those who are religious but I don't think he approaches it very well. People who are religious or spiritual have something that they believe in. I was troubled by his interview with the Hasidic Jewish Rabbi who was not a supporter of Israel in Monsey, New York. I felt he didn't approach the situation properly or informed to why the Rabbi met with the Iranian President last year. Maher tries to disprove God and religion as make-believe. But I believe and he's not going to change my beliefs in something else out there that cannot be explained. His documentary while he tries to be Michael Moore doesn't succeed on his own. Maybe if he did do research or work with those who are religious leaders than maybe the documentary would have been less insulting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my country (Finland), only 48 % of people identify themselves either as christians or atheists.The problem with Mahler's view is that he sees the world divided into two categories, the intelligent atheists and the unintelligent believers.This propably works in the US, where, if I am correct, the division between Christianity and science is more clear than in Europe, where most christians are somewhat moderate when it comes to questioning science etc.So it doesn't really work for an European viewer, who is used to people respecting each other's views rather than bashing them.But the real problem is, unlike many other more intelligent atheists who've written about the subject of religion, Mahler doesn't get the "big picture" of religion at all. He concentrates on nitpicking issues that are not that big a deal, at least not here in Europe. Sure, some of the beliefs are odd (hey, the oddness of these beliefs is already discussed in high school, so nothing new there). But what is worse than the utter lack of originality in the way he approaches the subject, Mahler misses out on all his chances to really get to know the motivation behind religious thinking - which should be an interesting subject for a documentarist regardless of his own religious beliefs! For example, in the beginning of the movie, he interviews a person who used to do drugs, used have a lot of women and a lot of money, but who then was "saved". And Mahler is like, "what was his problem in the first place?" - or something along those lines. He is not one bit interested WHY the person didn't want to go on living with lots of women and cash.I was interested in THAT! I want to know more about THAT, not about Mahler's own views which, frankly, are not very original - we've heard them all before. If you have nothing new to contribute, why contribute anything at all? Listen mr. Mahler, if you don't get why people find this sort of materialist women-drugs-money -lifestyle somewhat empty and shallow, and if you don't even want to know more about their motivation, then you will not get what religion is all about. And if that is the case, perhaps you should step down and allow someone else figure out what is good and what is bad about religion. Someone who sees through the lies and the stupidity of religious thinking, but who is also geniuinely interested in figuring out what motivates people into that sort of behavior. Mahler was not such a person.Important subject, bad film, wrong person making it. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religulous is Signififul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's call this film what it really is: an attack on faith. To call it a commercial for atheism or an attack on religion is not precise enough.Using his brand of comedy, Bill Maher interviews believers of various religions and asks them tough questions about apparent contradictions in dogma or practices of their faith. Give the interviewees credit for being, mostly, good-natured about his probing questions. In these interviews, Maher illustrates the circular reasoning that results from the "I believe whatever the book says" approach. And the destructive result of the "I don't have to make sense, because I have faith" approach.It would be easy to dismiss the serious intent of this film because it contains humor. But the final minutes of the film make it very clear that this is a serious matter.In turns, Maher shows himself to be humorous, honest, perceptive, penetrating, serious and brave. Though some reviewers say he treats his interviewees badly, I think he was extremely tolerant.Some critics ask why Maher or atheists spend so much time on the subject of religion. Did they not watch the final minutes of the film? Religious beliefs affect everyone on Earth. And sometimes--because they are based upon faith, which Maher says "makes a virtue of non-thinking"--they may have unthinkable results.Religulous will probably incite some interesting discussions among those who watch it--one test of a film's significance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant and Flawed--the Bill Maher Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher's documentary would be a tremendous, life-changing event in my life if he wasn't so gosh-darned misogynistic. I mean, really, how am I supposed to take a man who uses the word 'pussy' every three sentences? My vagina is not a cat, thank you very much, and if you're not going to bring up male genitalia every five minutes you really ought to think twice before you use a slang term for female genitalia. Otherwise, this documentary is clearly well thought-out. I think that some of Bill Maher's arguments are excellent, but at times he devolves into illogical, self-centered rants. The man needs therapy, and his me-first egotistic take on the 'personal anecdote' often interferes with his brilliant and incisive take on religion, along with everything else.I very much wish too that Bill Maher would separate spirituality, or the belief in some sort of Greater Being/force, from religious practice.Much of what we currently think of as religious practice has been oppressive towards nearly every people. I also wish very much that this had been discussed, as I find it to be the MOST logical argument against practicing Judeo-Christian religion.The vague aspects of Judeo-Christianity--for example, a sinner will burn in hell but someone who repents, which of course cannot be objectively known, will be saved? WTF?--are another of religion's weak spots which was not touched on nearly enough in this film, I think.I do think there is a difference between God, as presented by Christianity and other monotheistic religions, versus the concept that we are all connected via energy flows in the universe and that prayer acts as a general focus of one's energy on a desired outcome, which has been scientificially proved to create the specified outcomes.There is a scientific explanation behind so-called "miracles." I think it would be much more useful practically speaking to compare and contrast religious practices with practices shown to be effective to control certain aspects of people's lives. If only such a documentary existed...That would really be something to see. f this society were able to separate excellent music, group sing-alongs, prayer/meditation in groups, and the acceptability of hugging forty people in a row, perhaps our "need" for religion would simply vanish. Here's hoping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Maher and Larry Charles' RELIGULOUS is a funny and somewhat insightful look into the absurdity of modern day faith. Most "believers" will steer clear of this film even if they might actually embrace a lot of the ideas that Maher espouses ("They say that their guy found the Golden Tablets...Ha! OUR guy found the Golden Tablets!") I quite enjoyed the movie and watched it twice. Yes, the film is unfairly edited in order to maximize the awkward reactions of Bill's soft targets but the thing that brought the film to a screeching halt for me was Mr. Maher's insane, unreasonable reaction to the Anti-Zionist Jewish man. Maher never allowed the guy to get a word in edgewise before terminating the interview early...simply because the man did not support the state of Israel. It was an incredible display of hypocrisy on Maher's part since one could easily argue that the modern state of Israel is founded on as much of a "fairy tale" as any of the Christian and Islamic ideas that are attacked throughout the film. Most of the montages of news footage of various religious "extremists" also fail to include any footage of Judaism -- focusing instead on Protestant Christians and violent Muslims.The film never quite recovered its authority after this point although I did enjoy the end and I do actually appreciate Maher's point of view. But until he reconciles his hawkish and -- let's not beat around the bush here -- right wing views on Israel with his otherwise apparent religious skepticism, then I'm going to have say that Bill Maher is a humbug.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly enjoyed it, but either pure entertainment or Bill Meher just doesn't get it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is some of the funniest stuff I have watched in a very long time, even though the ending was a little over the top. I highly recommend it to anyone who is already an atheist or agnostic. It resonated in my old agnostic frame like a guitar string. Bill Meher uses his intelligence, wit and guile to shoot gaping holes in theism. Yeah, I happen to agree with all the stuff he said, but I'm not sure what the point is beyond telling me something I'm already in agreement with and making me laugh my ass off in the process. I really enjoyed it but I sure hope he's not expecting to convert anybody with this film. This film is sheer entertainment. Bill Meher will no more be able to make a religious person see what he sees and think as he thinks than he could take a crack-head home and turn him into a choirboy. People need to believe in something, and they just find and adopt what works for them. Some find atheism, some find religion, and at the optimum both find some semblance of inner peace. Who cares what anybody thinks, as long as he doesn't insist on me listening to him go on about it if I am an unwilling audience? Who cares what anybody thinks so long as it causes harm to no-one else? Ah, but there's the rub, and I guess that's the point. Could it be that Bill Meher doesn't abhor religion so much as he abhors the violence perpetrated by the religious lunatic fringe? I guess nobody's going to disagree with that. But surely he can't ignore that the worst atrocities in the history of man have been perpetrated by atheists who also happened to be psychopaths (and who also appear in his list of people baptized by the Mormons). The problem isn't religion, Bill, it's us. The human race is crazy. You and me included.Halfway through the film:Bill Meher: "So, how do you convince people of what's the truth?"Father Reginald Foster, Senior Vatican Priest: "You don't. Forget it. You just have to live and die with their stupid ideas."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to give a brief explanation of my religious background and religious status so you see where I am coming from. Bear with me, this is just to explain my position. If you think I am nuts or childish, this review isn't for you.I was raised United Methodist. After a stint in high school being evangelical, I went to college and opened my heart to a more liberal world view. I now believe in a God or higher power, I believe Genesis was a metaphor for evolution, I believe that Jesus was a great spiritual philosopher (though may not have been divine) and that organized religion can cloud people's perception of what it truly means to be moral and spiritual.Now that you understand my stance, I say this about Religulous. It was very entertaining, though clearly has an agenda. It's no secret that Bill Maher is critical of religion but this seems like a recruitment film for atheism. Bill has found the oddest of the oddballs in the religious world, and certainly not just Christianity (though he favors going after them) I enjoyed the humor that dotted the movie, whenever it got too preachy, he threw in a joke here or there to lighten things up. I also feel that while Bill is making a point against religion, he usually is a good sport to those he interviews and they usually seem to laugh with him. There are glimmers through out of how some religious people are more rational, ironically two people at the heart of one major religion.I feel overall, it's good this film was made. Bill shows how some people let religion get out of hand or go astray and corrupt it. But the last few minutes are pure shock value, which I feel was a terrible bookend choice. I'm sure atheists would agree with him, but I am not so black-and-white. I am glad to have Bill Maher in the world, he is creating an opposition voice to the established religions, which reminds me of some other figure in history that spoke against the ruling religion...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Maher shows his colors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maher considers himself to be an intelligent, funny man who apparently doesn't believe in God. In this movie he attempts to show how ridiculous it is to believe in God by interviewing average people and people who have beliefs out on the fringe. The reason he chose these people is because the average person isn't used to debating their faith with a quick witted comedian, and those on the fringe are...well...often batty.Maher is intellectually sparring with people who are not equipped to debate. He mocks them and their lack of intelligence, and at times, these people don't even realize he is mocking them. These interviews just feed his ego, and the movie will make some of you sick with the false air of superiority he radiates from the screen.Maher doesn't have the guts to interview someone equipped to address his challenges. My local parish priest would rip him to shreds in a debate about our faith and the existence of God.I love a very wide variety of comedy and comedians. I love the clean guys like Jeff Foxworthy and I can also laugh at Lisa Lampanelli and George Carlin. However, I have no respect for Maher. Maher's attempts to get a laugh by humiliating and embarrassing people.For me this movie fails in three ways. As a comedy, I can't laugh at the public humiliation of innocents. As an informative documentary it just doesn't offer any real facts at all. As a charming piece of entertainment it is spoiled by the arrogance of the host.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Occasionally funny, but a failure as genuine documentary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Larry "Borat" Charles' "Religulous" is little more than an extended Bill "Politically Incorrect" Maher-fronted opinion piece seasoned with highly selective interview snippets with a lot of easy targets, by and large. I don't necessarily mind a documentary that's biased (cf. Michael Moore), but "Religulous" practically wears its disdain for its subject on its sleeve. No attempt is made to present a balanced viewpoint whatsoever, and although I happen to agree with at least the thrust of much of what Maher and Charles have to say, I was not impressed with how they went about it. Christianity bears the brunt of the assault (no surprise there, given that it's an American production), while major religions like Buddhism and Hinduism are virtually ignored, and even Judaism and Islam are given pretty short shrift. It's easy to mock cults like Scientology (clams!) or splinter religions like Mormonism; it's a lot more difficult to balance the attack with a discussion of the positive aspects of organized religion (ephemeral as those may be). Charles and Maher take the low road, and the film's impact suffers accordingly.In short, "Religulous" preaches to the choir, and thus is rendered far less insightful than it might have otherwise been. Worth a watch, unless you're a religious fundamentalist (in which case, keep tabs on your blood pressure), but in no way indispensable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much of a God Thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The production team follows Bill Maher around the world -- rural America, the Vatican, the Holy Land, and so forth -- as he questions spokesman for religion, mostly Christians.Maher has a point when he repeatedly makes the claim that he is an agnostic because he simply doesn't know. (Who REALLY knows?) Yet it doesn't explain why he is so concerned about God, the Bible, afterlife, creationism, and similar questions. Why doesn't he just let the believers be? Something, some lingering motive, must be pushing him along this confrontative path that maybe he himself can't recognize.Most of the people he interviews don't seem to have had much of an idea of what the interview would be like. Some thought it would be a documentary promoting religiosity. They evidently hadn't been watching Maher's show on HBO. And a few of his subjects, when the penny dropped, ushered him out pronto.Not that Maher is arrogant or impolite. He doesn't fawn, but he challenges in a logical, good-natured way. He asks simple questions that any of us could answer, such as "How can anybody raise anybody else from the dead?" He tangles with preachers, priests, rabbis, Muslims, and lay promoters over issues like evolution and the authenticity of the Bible. Sometimes he gets intelligent ripostes. Not all his subjects live in the Land of Cockaigne or are confirmed rednecks or escapees from some kind of Home for Magical Thinkers. He even manages to find an affable American priest at the Vatican who more or less agrees with him.Yes, it's absurd. But Credo Quia Absurdum. I believe because it's absurd. None of his on screen targets comes up with this, though. Most of his subjects try to wriggle out from under the weight of Maher's attacks with counter-arguments that make them look even loonier, because logic has no place in religious beliefs.I never did understand why Maher is so worried about believers. I mean, so what? What's next -- the thought police? The problem is that convictions that aren't rooted in everyday reality, in the more understandable features of human nature, can in fact become dangerous. We tend to think of wars as being launched by conflicts over political, economic, and territorial conflicts, but Andrew Greeley has eyeballed the historical data and found religion inextricably wrapped up in the motivation for war, perhaps its chief contributor. You can look it up in Sociology and Social Research (1989). And Greeley is a novelist, sociologist, and a priest. Iran is unsettled today partly because two denominations of Islam simply cannot reconcile their conflicting beliefs about who was the natural successor to Mohammed a thousand or so years ago. Each side believes it is right, and is willing to kill to prove it.Maher doesn't really come to grips with the implications of "righteousness", as opposed to "religion." Most world religions endorse living in peace with one's neighbors, but all charter documents, like the Bible, are ambiguous enough to be interpreted in different ways. If they weren't, they'd be dated and discarded in a few years. (Imagine an Eleventh Commandment: "Thou shalt not impose a personal income tax rate higher than 35.5 percent, except for married couples filing jointly.") Any charter document, religious or otherwise, must be vague and self-contradictory to allow adherents to adapt it.But Maher sticks to finicky questions about the credibility of the gospels, because none of the many writers knew Jesus personally. So? That's beside the point. I had a crashing, thunderous epiphany that put me squarely in Maher's agnostic corner -- but I was a teen ager at the time and got over it.It's an interesting documentary. A little repetitious at times and one slumps in the face of arguments over nits. But it's also curious to see the variety in the subjects of Maher's interviews. Most of the duller ones must have wound up on the editing room floor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has always puzzled and amazed me the affect religion has on otherwise normal , intelligent people. What makes rational people live their lives by the way of a book that includes things that are so offensive and quite obviously could not possibly have happened. Religion is a highly emotive subject that divides people of all ages and nationalities to the point , that they will kill for what they believe in and because of that i dislike organised religion with a passion. Religulous tries to get to the bottom of what makes people believe in the one thing that threatens to destroy the planet we live in - Religion. The documentary "Religious" follows political humorist and author Bill Maher as he travels around the globe interviewing people about God and religion. Known for his astute analytical skills, irreverent wit and commitment to never pulling a punch, Maher brings his characteristic honesty to an unusual spiritual journey. Directed by Larry Charles , "Religulous" marks Charles' first feature project since the critically acclaimed, wildly successful "Borat." Being an atheist i have to admit i am not the most suitable person to review this film. I'm on Bill Maher's side from the first minute to the last , so my view is hardly unbiased but even the most ardent religious scholar must appreciate the humour , the irony and hypocrisy that Religulous exposes. Maher never insults the people he interviews and he does not have to , he just asks simple questions that should be simple to answer but as always with religion, there are no simple , or sensible answers .It's not just Christianity that Maher explores , he also questions the reasoning behind Muslim fundamentalists and orthodox jews and there is one question that keeps popping up and that is Why ? It is very funny at times and sometimes at the interviewee's expense . You do get the feeling that some of the people are never quite sure what sort of programme they participating in when trying to answer questions and maybe that's not strictly fair. This wont be everybody's cup of tea , in fact I'm sure some people might find it highly offensive because of what they believe in but then if that's the case , they are falling straight in the trap set by the film maker. I loved this film because it asks the questions that I'm not clever enough to ask and i thank the makers of this movie for that and also for highlighting the inner madness of otherwise normal human beings .Highly Recommended ( but i would say that wouldn't i).9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the most interesting films this year. Much anticipated and definitely hugely appreciated by anyone who has half a brain. As I am Swedish (from the actual country - not some god unforsaken town in Minnesota or such) It is with utter fascination &amp; interest that I have been following the current spiritual debate raging between non-believers and believers in the USA and of course other parts of the world. I think most modern "young" people in at least Sweden and larger parts of Europe (and probably the US) do not fully realize how much the religious mind set has influenced all generations of people habituating this earth. Furthermore, many contemporary people harbor the same views which is brilliantly captured by Mr Bill Maher when he uses comic "common sense" while mentally debilitating strength of religion . This is a highly efficient weapon in our mutual need to dis-enlighten the mind of these spiritually tormented souls. In 2009, I long to follow the quest of our saviors and three holy men; Mr Maher, Mr Hitchens and Mr Dawkins when they keep taking stand, in each their own way, against the tyranny of GOD.Happy New Year!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do people believe utter fiction when it is so obviously nonsensical? That's sort of the question Bill Maher attempts to answer in this movie, but it's not a stodgy documentary. It is instead a funny, in-your-face, well-reasoned examination of how religion is still possible.The answer? People turn off the part of their brain that works when they engage in religion -- as Maher shows us again and again with his various interviews. When confronted with reason and rationality, every single one of his subjects has to resort to utter nonsense. You can actually watch their eyes glaze over as they fall into the repetition of ridiculous double-talk they have been taught as answers. And the frustration on Maher's face as he continues to run into these walls of inanity makes it all the funnier.There's not much more to say. This is a great Friday-night date movie, a wonderful comedy about human nature, and more. It asks the big questions and then makes you realize we don't know the answers.Perhaps we should focus on things we do have answers to -- like getting along together and reducing suffering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being chutzpah for a million or two - a great American tradition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My spontaneous reaction to "Religulous" was the decision to write a long polemical essay but firstly my English isn't suited to such adventurous enterprises and secondly, this movie simply doesn't deserve it.I quite liked Larry Charles' satires featuring Sasha Baron Cohen ("Bruno" being my favourite of caustic portraits of what's wrong in the Western world) and there are funny/convincing moments in "Religulous", but as a whole it is way far from satisfactory. We watch a TV comedian on a crusade against the root of all evil - the world's religions. Bill Maher sees himself as a seeker-of-truth figure ; in fact hardly anything we see does support this image. The protagonist is evidently more in love with himself and with success than with truth, and moreover, seeking truth for him seems to equal mocking everything that he regards as wrong or impossible/that he isn't able to understand/that doesn't fit into his concept. As for BM's "reasoning", it's often hard to tell whether he is simply a narcissistic ignoramus or a clever populist manipulator. There are roughly 3 categories of his opponents (as well as 3 thirds of his own persona) : bigoted freaks, people who more or less live by religion, and respectable debate partners. BM uses them all equally ; unorthodox believers, such as two Vatican "maverick" priests, are allowed to take part in his show not to map the terrain of the specific religion but solely to demonstrate its failure. This is what some use to call chutzpah (in the original sense of word).One brief moment towards the end of the movie epitomizes BM's world view and "creative" method : in Amsterdam, an interviewed person mentions the death of Theo van Gogh. Immediately afterwards, BM is standing in the street referring to "Theeow Vaangow". It's as if he were saying, "I'll stick to my truth, whatever the Dutch morons may think of it." It's this kind of both cultural and personal arrogance, deeply rooted in the American history, which connects BM more with George Bush + Co. than with colleague Michael Moore, and which makes "Religulous" almost unbearable for me to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things That Make You Go 'Hmm...'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do so many atheists invest great effort into fighting against things they claim not to believe in? Bill Maher is a good example. Now, I have serious doubts about leprechauns, but you won't see me picketing the St. Patrick's Day Parade or calling for a ban on Lucky Charms cereal.Maher has a few doubts about religion, which he shares in this pseudo-documentary. It begins with a recap of his admittedly conflicted religious upbringing, followed by the assertion that he is now 'just asking questions', since he really doesn't know if a higher power exists. This agnostic viewpoint surely opened a few doors for him as far as interviews were concerned. Had the film continued as one man's personal journey toward spiritual enlightenment (or even just intellectual understanding), 'Religulous' could have been worth a watch.Unfortunately, Maher's true agenda soon rears its cynical head as he proceeds to take cheap shots at each of his God fearing targets. He argues against the historical existence of Jesus, but never consults a historian on the subject. He visits a Christian theme park, a Creationist museum, and a man who sells machines that circumvent the Jewish law not to work on the Sabbath. For added amusement, he feigns surprise whenever someone recognizes his ruse or asks him to leave a location where he has no permission to film.Christians, Jews, Mormons, and Muslims each get time in his cross hairs. However, no potshots are ever aimed toward Buddhists or Hindus. That would have made him come across as an enormous jerk to both the evangelical right AND the choir he preaches to... the secular (yet Eastern philosophy friendly) left. As a result, his quest to expose the hypocrisy of religion only serves to reveal his own. Maher shows that he is not the enlightened secularist he envisions himself to be. Rather, he demonstrates that he is just a bitter, selfish little man with a big grudge against his Creator. Hmm, perhaps that answers my initial question...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The concept of creating a film that challenges people's belief systems with regards to religion is a healthy one. Any dogma that you are supposed to believe that does not make sense to you is one to be questioned. However this film to me is a self-obsessed piece of propaganda. Bill Maher talks about the importance of humility and yet this whole film is anything but. As a filmmaker and editor, I also noticed strange cuts which to me indicated that some of the answers are probably not the actual answers that were given. Michael Moore has made this mistake in the past. This in my eyes is dangerous, because even though you are working for a useful purpose, you are in fact manipulating the public by not showing the true interview. And with that, unfortunately, he is making the same mistake that many religious authorities make.I was also disappointed in Bill's general attitude. To me a "humble" person has an open and questioning state of mind. Bill, however, had obviously already made up his mind and the documentary was a reflection of that. No ifs or buts. Bill wouldn't let people finish their sentences, he was blatantly making fun of people. Not very humble in my eyes.Belief is a funny thing. Truth can only be experienced personally. What resonates with one person, may make another person's hair rise up. That's what makes us all unique. It is not so much getting rid of religion that is important, but the realisation that every belief is welcome as long as it is not forced upon others.To live and let live?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Religulous" (what a terrible title), Bill Maher asks why otherwise rational people will freely accept the wild stories of the Bible (and Koran) without so much as considering the fact that they might be wrong. That is a good question, and in pursuing an answer, there are two options: 1) Engage religious people in a serious but respectful debate. 2) Be an obnoxious a**hole, making religious people not want to talk to you at all. Bill, for some reason, decided to go with Option 2, not the one I would have chosen, but whatever, it's his movie. At first I found this extremely annoying: why begin your address to a Trucker's Chapel with an insult if you're hoping to get the members to open up to you? Why schedule an interview with someone you know ahead of time to be a Holocaust denier, then get up in a big show of disgust before he's even begun to explain himself? (It's not actually clear from the interview that the guy IS a Holocaust denier; Bill walks off like a big old drama queen right when things are about to get interesting). Bill spends the movie acting bored and annoyed by his subjects, which is sort of like if I made a documentary about the ocean and kept complaining (loudly, to the camera) that I'm getting wet. HOWEVER, that's not to say Option 2 doesn't have its merits. It seems as though many of the people in this movie have never had their faith challenged at all. Bill's confrontational method leaves them at a complete loss for words. They are not even angry with him, just bewildered. After a while I began to find it quite interesting and morbidly entertaining to watch these people who have never even IMAGINED an opposing viewpoint (as any person of real faith would do) suddenly encountering the blunt statement, "You're wrong." Not everyone Bill meets is like this, but for the most part he is not dealing with the, um, particularly open-minded, and I'll admit it gets pretty funny. I am able to recommend the movie for this reason. I just wish Bill had taken his serious questions more seriously.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Religulous is an important movie. Bill Maher has struck upon something many have come to grips with but haven't vocalized clearly: that religion is nonsense. It's an extremely taboo subject, and Maher takes an interesting approach. Reasoning with a religious person just won't get you anywhere, and the movie has clearly demonstrated this. They're likely to give you a garbled version of what they heard in church, mess it up completely, and then revert back to "well, this is just what I believe."I think Maher realizes this, so he takes a different approach with his audience: comedy. As someone who has come out of fundamentalist Christianity, I can tell you the only thing that's going to change a person's mind is for them to realize, "ya, this is pretty outrageous." Maher throws in some evidence and logic here and there, but his main tool is just to say, "really?"Although I agree with his view of religion, I do think Maher is unnecessarily harsh in this movie. I admit, I was laughing the whole movie, but if his intent was to convince believers of their folly, I think he may have built up too much resistance with some of his jokes. He's consistently interrupting, rude, condescending, and trying to push people's buttons. But alas, I suppose we should expect nothing less from the people who brought us Borat; such is the nature of comedy these days. I say this is an important movie because so many Americans are head-over-heels into a book written 2000 years ago. While it's important to appreciate the value of religion to certain people (i.e. prison inmates, ex-drug users, and people generally that are emotionally unstable), as I Maher concedes to the audience, why should the rest of us still cling to it? It's fine as long as it isn't hurting anyone, but Maher shows us how, even recently, it is hurting people. It's holding us back as a society. This is the important message of the movie. There are certain obstacles we as a civilization cannot overcome while still clinging to this idea of a bearded man in the sky. More than anything this movie is a wake-up call to those who DO realize this, and as such should be as evangelical about their belief as those still drinking Christ's blood every Sunday.As a comedy, this movie is a winner. Will it reach the religious audience who need to hear the message? Probably not. Will it enlighten those of us who already understand about the legitimate threat this belief in nothing really is? I hope so. See this movie, laugh, and then THINK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snarky and on-message...but to whom?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be the first to use the appropriate word and describe this film as snarky. Snarky is just what Bill Maher DOES, and that is one of his great strengths, but it does kinda limit the audience you can appeal to to those who agree with your particular brand of snark.At one point in the film, Bill trots out the statistic that in America 16% of the population lists themselves as non-religious. THAT is the audience that Maher is speaking to. And there is nothing wrong with that, because a lot of those people in that 16% still are intimidated by the centuries of persecution in which it not only wasn't "proper" to criticize or poke fun at religion, doing so could cost you your life.His clear message is at the end of the film, and I agree with it wholeheartedly, snark or no snark. We live in an age in which many, if not most, of the predominant religions teach Apocalypse, and to followers who actually HOPE that it will happen, and that it will happen in their lifetimes.This is insanity. When you have millions and millions of people on the planet ALL believing and hoping that the end is near, well, I'm sorry, but the end really IS near. Consciously and subconsciously, they are helping to bring that fiery end to planet Earth about by dwelling on it each and every day. Maher is absolutely correct that we who are in that non-religious 16% should speak up every time we see some nutcase preaching hatred and bigotry and violence and Armageddon.I just wish that Maher had been able to find a way to speak to the other 84% of Americans, the ones who have faith. Many of us may find their faith ridiculous, and most of us 16%ers who have interacted with the 84%ers know that there is NOTHING one can do to talk a person out of even the most ridiculous religious beliefs. If they believe it now, they will believe it until they stop believing it on their own, and no amount of rational argument can change that simple fact.But we might be able to get even the most mindlessly faithful person to *think through* the ramifications of believing that the world is in its last days. That's not faith; that's ego, and really, really *dangerous* ego. That's an insecure ego shouting to the world, "I'm so important that the world is going to die when I die...or at least I hope so." All in all, Religulous is a flawed but interesting and at times very funny look at some of the silly sides of religion, and at some of the downright frightening sides of religion. In my opinion, as human beings we should not only be free to criticize and make fun of other people's religions, we should almost be required to criticize and make fun of our own. The most destructive dogma in ANY religion is that anything we could possibly say or do with regard to that religion is "off limits" to criticism and critical thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quick summary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie absolutely hilarious! I may be a bit biased as I love Bill Maher and his "Real Time" show (as well as his comedy routines) but my friend who has little idea who Bill Maher even is also found this documentary to be sidesplitting. Religulous really shows religions at their most fanatic and extreme, often resulting in hilarious interviews and dialogue that kept the theater laughing pretty much from the first scene until the credits were rolling. Some might say this documentary is one sided or that it uses only certain types of footage to portray religion in an unfair way, which I think is akin to the Chris Rock stand-up routine about how girls at the clubs never think demeaning rap songs about women are about them. Religious people who see this will likely think along those same lines. Sometimes it is hard to see the forest for the trees.This documentary absolutely splits organized religion apart at the seams with fierce precision and wit, mocking everything from the same story repackaged under the guise of various religions to the ridiculous rituals and outfits and everything in between. The funniest moments were the Creationism Museum (where a dinosaur sculpture is shown with a saddle on its back, insinuating humans used to ride dinosaurs a mere 5,000 years ago), the pot church in Amsterdam (where the leader, in an absolute stoned stupor, accidentally gets his hair caught on fire due to a candle sitting behind him), and a "Holy Land Experience" theme park in Orlando which included a recreation of Jesus' final moments, swarmed by elderly couples snapping away with their cameras.I think religious people are as eager to see Religulous as republicans were to see Fahrenheit 9/11. Truth hurts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected better of Maher.I liked his stand up, and his critiques of America are normally valid and well thought out, but take the man out of America and he slips into the clichd ignorant American views when regarding anything non western.A truly poorly researched program, and the studies of Islam? well Fox News would be proud of those.American extremists are portrayed as lovable village idiots, where as Islamist extremists come across as pure evil bringers of destruction. Can't help feeling that he is just a bit afraid here. And perhaps not as rational as he boasts.The editing in this is a major issue. It's no coincidence that everyone he interviews comes across as a babbling idiot. this is down to the way it's edited and of course the interviewees chosen.Of course the over-arching message is one of END ALL RELIGION. Well I'm fine with that... but the execution of this is poor and unbalanced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a refreshing discussion of religious doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film follows Bill Maher around as he interviews some colorful religious leaders or people who are involved in some wacky aspect of religion (such as a guy who portrays Jesus in a Holy Land theme park in Florida, or a Latin American man who thinks he is the second coming of Jesus). And ultimately he just wants to have his questions answered about the nature of faith and religion. He wants to stir up doubt in the institution of religion, which is steeped in certitude. He asks the question: what is so great about faith, which is meant to be blind and unquestioning, over rationality and reasoning? But this is not all serious stuff. Maher breaks it up with some on-screen kidding, a playfulness that at times made me laugh out loud. It is hard to listen to some of the people in here without wondering how anyone takes them seriously--like the people in the Creationism Museum or the church that advocates pot-smoking--but many do. My favorite part was Maher dressing up and getting up in Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park and spouting off crazy stuff while onlookers smile and laugh?meanwhile the subtitles show that everything he is saying is a tenet of Scientology. He sums it up at the end in nice little monologue that comes out on the side of a little old-fashioned healthy doubt. Maybe I just liked this because he's preaching to the choir, but I would really like to know how some religious people I know might react to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice to see someone have the courage to take on religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to believe in a higher power. I used to think that religion was something that would help get me through the day. And then something funny happened. I read the Bible. I read stories about Abraham being told to sacrifice his son for God's pleasure. I read stories of Sodom and Ghamora. I read stories about turning people to stone for disobeying. I read stories about God being jealous and vengeful and angry. Shockingly, this is not the God I was told about in Sunday school.When I questioned why God, who loved us so much, would let all this stuff happen in the world, I was told that God had a plan for us. And as Maher so cleverly pointed out, I wonder what the plan was for all those Jewish people who were being shoved into ovens. What was God's plan for them? Religulous is perhaps the most daring film/documentary i have ever seen. Religious zealots will preach peace and good will on one hand but if you dare say a bad word against their religion, some of them will physically confront you. Wars are predicated on religion. Bill Maher has made a film that will anger a lot of people. One, because a lot of what he has to say will leave religious people shaking their head when they see how absurd he makes them look, and two, because many religious loonies do not like you saying a bad word against their beliefs. This film pulls no punches and it makes fun of or questions all kinds of religions. Christianity, Catholicism, Mormonism, Islam and so on. It treats all of them equally when it comes to his disdain towards them. He meets a rabbi and asks him why he attended a Holocaust denial meeting with the president of Iran. He meets a Puerta Rican who says he is the second coming of Chirst. He has 100,000 followers. He goes to a truck stop chapel and debates with them about the absurdity of Christianity. It looks like they are going to take a swing at him, but instead they pray for his enlightenment. He goes to a Scientology get together and impersonates a Scientology's at the Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park, and says Scientology teaches that there was a race of Thetans several trillion years old, which is interesting because the Earth is only about 13 billion years old, and that we are born with Thetans inside of us, like the mitichlorians of Star Wars fame. These Thetans can be detected by getting an E meter, which can be purchased at a Scientology store. It is not free. Once you get it, you can audit yourself.He also has meaningful debates with opponents of homosexuality. He gets into the merits or lack thereof of the ten commandments. He goes onto to tell us that the commandments are mostly about worshiping God. I wish I could meet Bill Maher in person to thank him for having the courage to make a film like this, but seeing as that won't happen, I hope he reads comments like this one. You may not do a lot to change people's minds about their religion, they are too brainwashed, but you at least did a very commendable job in showing how silly religion is and how much of a charlatan the organizations of religion really are.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is terrible. Bill Maher essentially just spouts off offensive critiques of almost every religion. The problem: he only interviews those he can bully, and those that hold their ground against him, he doesn't talk to or include in the movie. He simply critiques the worldly aspects of religion, but doesn't ask the question "why do you believe" to those he interviews. Also, his claim that the Jesus story was copied from previous religions is completely untrue. Read the book of the dead and search for Horus, you will find no verse that supports his claim. Poorly done movie. It would have been better if he had actually done research rather than spout off a stand up show from a van.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soothing Trash Talk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those looking for intelligent, rational, or interesting discussion, this film is not for you. This "mockumentary" was clearly produced to soothe the shattered psyches of victims of religious abuse through mean-spirited trash talk. I'd never watched Mr. Maher's "comedy" routines before, but after spotting this DVD on the library shelf, I was intrigued by the premise, and decided to give it a try.Needless to say, I was very disappointed with this embarrassing work. Mind you, I don't agree with a lot of the fanatical points held by his interviewed extremist victims. But Mr. Maher has edited clips of himself mocking a variety of these religious personalities, both behind their backs and to their faces, and markets it as a documentary. As if this amounts to any feat of research or reason. As if we find this thought-provoking, or even entertaining.Mr. Maher's astounding immaturity and lack of sensitivity completely caught me off guard. (Spoiler Alert!) The most revealing clue into his character (and sadly the most meaningful moment of the film) is when Mr. Maher interviews, and finds a kindred spirit with, an Amsterdam heroin addict whose pastime also happens to be his religion. They share a smoke, and generally have a good time. Mr. Maher admits rather jokingly that he could get used to a religion like this...Ultimately, the film fails because it serves only as a vehicle to broadcast the host's personal vendetta and intolerance. He fails to observe the obvious reality: that one can find crazy extremists anywhere, in every religion, in every country, in every business. It's a crazy world. But the extremists represent a statistical minority. The presence of healthy, peaceful, organized religion, on the other hand, is huge. It's been here since the dawn of man, it's shaped and cultured human history, and like it or not, for better or worse, it's never going away.Maher's time and energy should be better spent by understanding his neighbors, rather than calling attention to differences by making fun of them. If he has real questions about apparent fallacies of specific religions, then those should be addressed or confronted in a serious manner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was blown away by this film. Finally, someone had the courage to speak for us who are tired of religion being in politics, telling us how to live, creating war and working toward a self fulfilling prophecy of Armageddon. Atheists and non-believers are some of the most tolerant, spiritual, rational people I have ever found. I'm tired of us being painted as evil and us having to hide in the shadows for fear of what those who are believers will do to us. It is not the atheists who kill those for believing, but the other way around. Bill asks us to come out of the shadows and return sanity to the world, tells us that we are not alone and are in fact a large part of the population! Freedom is live and let live, we're sick and tired of you believers trying to run our country into the ground and somehow believing that you have the moral high ground. Here's a fact, most of us live our lives to a high code we set for ourselves... we believe in treating people equally, doing the right thing... everything religion sets forth, WITHOUT hurting others.Bill does an excellent job juxtaposing all of the big religions. He doesn't even have to say how ridiculous they all are, any person that actually THINKS and asks QUESTIONS can see how ridiculous it is. He says we all have a right to our beliefs, yet shows how the religions of the world don't want others to have a right to their beliefs and how it's RUINING our WORLD because it doesn't allow for people to believe what they want!I can't believe someone finally came out with a movie that says ENOUGH is ENOUGH. It took amazing courage to make this movie and I'm sure Bill will be the target of numerous death threats and crazy goings ons. But Bill, you're my new Saint!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ill prepared and passionless Bill Maher takes cheap shots at belief. Its amusing to a point but far from deep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher's essay on religion is disappointing and not very good.The film is essentially Maher traveling around talking to people about God and religion in the most cursory of ways. Its Maher asking softball questions to people who fumble and stumble and look silly while Maher looks ill prepared.I wanted to either love this film or hate it. I wanted to walk out of it fired up about it in a pro or con way. Instead I walked out of it wondering why Maher bothered.This is not the Maher from his TV show asking pointed questions and leveling scathing observations, this Bill Maher the Wuss asking everyday people questions that aren't very good and then talking over their answers. The people all look like nice people who believe what they believe, even if its silly. There is nothing in the film, other than Maher's use of suicide bombers and explosions to indicate why he comes to his point at the end that religion is so dangerous.The first 90 minutes does not justify the last 9 (A final nine that is sorely lacking in passion). I found it troubling that Maher never seemed to do his home work. He could occasionally quote well known scripture, but there was never any sense he knew the history.(certainly his assertion that Jesus never lived is questionable since Josephus does fleetingly mention him, granted with out the details) The criticism thats been leveled at the film that its too Christian centric is right on. The Jewish, Islamic and Scientological portions of the film feel unformed and half thought out (actually a quarter thought out since the film is for me half thought out). Maher talks about what he knows, which is why I'm guessing there is nothing on Eastern religions.And I guess the Cannabis church, which preaches nothing, was there so Bill could write off the expense of getting high.(Why is that segment in the film? ) I'm also troubled by Maher's repeated assertions that people who are defending their religion, as they see it, or expressing how they feel are lying to him. Take for example the Muslim woman he speaks to in Denmark, who expresses her view of the Koran and her religion. There is a cut away of him saying that she's lying and covering up for her religion. Oh really, at what point did he gain the ability to get into peoples minds? It would be fine if he clued us as to why he felt this but mostly its just his word against hers.What I want to know is where is the passion? Where is the sense of drive to know? This seems to be Maher driving around in a limo asking people that are easy targets questions that he know will provoke a reaction. There is a real sense of cut and paste journalism in the drive for a quick answer. I would like to see the entire interviews of some of the people he talks to, especially the priest he talks to in the Vatican observatory, here's a guy who isn't a boob who probably could talk rings around Maher and yet we get scant time with him. (additionally I'm curious what the whole interview of the Rabbi who went to Iran was like since Maher simply talked over the man's attempts to answer.) I left the film wondering why I bothered in a neutral way. The film was just sort of there.In the end what struck me was that Maher's assertion that we should doubt (and we should) is just as religious and pigheadedly fundamentalist (just like a terrorist). Its also a belief that seems to come from the place of "if I can't have this no one can" or if I don't feel this no one can. After all he states in his final speech that since he doesn't have the answers no one does, which is a nice way to feel, but isn't necessarily true.Is it a bad film? Not if you just want an amusing, if jaundiced look at what we belief (there are some laughs). As viable commentary or criticism of religion its weak and insubstantial since had Maher really done his home work he could have used facts instead of jokes and stolen clips to make his point.5 ish out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It's an attack on Christianity and Islam. Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations, he really doesn't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called 'holy books' of organized religion. This is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film.I find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent. Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they're stupid. What makes him the "rational" person in the room? In a way it reflects how he really isn't and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those people.If you want to watch a good movie/documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization, watch Richard Dawkins' 'Root of All Evil?'. It is a brilliantly researched documentary, clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.Bill Maher's Religulous is not funny, poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic. It seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing. I almost feel sorry for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Maher tackles down religion in "Religulous"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religion is one of the most degrading and inspiring ideologies in human history. From Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism,Christianity, and Judaism, religion is a blend between insanity and beauty. Comedian Bill Maher from HBO's "Real Time with Bill Maher" has been a militant atheist for many years and now takes his passion to inspire the world to wake up and realize how effective religion is to human sanity and peace. Maher interviews people belonging to different religions and asks many questions. Many would assume that Bill Maher would ridicule and make fun of people for an hour and a half, but what I found surprising was how respectful and curious he performed rather than how critical and cynical I thought the would be. His approach allows for more constructive arguments that I would have liked to see even more of. Maher also focuses more on Christian denominates more than others. He only has one segment on Islam, one on Scientology and then all Christianity. I would like it if he found even more negativity in each segment rather than asking the same questions over and over again and not really getting his message about the horror and idiocy of religion. Maher also focuses a little too much on his personal views and religion as a child. He sums everything up in the end about why religion is bad, but could have used extra detail and went to other atheists to proclaim their views on religion as well. He doesn't share how the good of religion can be denounced as well. Bill Maher does do a good job of showing what people actually believe and how religion is not vital for morals. All religion does is copy morals mankind has invented before evolving. He makes sharp points about how almost every war was caused by religion, how many historians denounce religious views and shows what people do due to religion. It's all bad and the beauty is all nonsense about make belief material in the end. I agree with Maher, but would have liked a little better detail and expression as too why religion is terrible and more people to get commentary with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll make this brief, as many points have already been covered in the hundreds of reviews made thus far.I adored this film. Over the past year, I have slowly transitioned into atheism, and my self-confidence has grown simultaneously. Some may find it disheartening to be "without religion", but I prefer to live in a world of science, where phenomena are explained rather than discarded and where we as a species have real opportunities to improve our circumstances. Viewing from this perspective, this was a fantastic piece of cinema. It fulfilled the greatest possible cause of cinema: it attempted (and I would expect succeeded in many cases) to open it's viewer's minds in a way that has the capability to create a better world. At the very least, "Religulous" sparked great interest, as evidenced by the hordes of critics who felt compelled to share their opinions on it.However, I could not give this film a 10 for one acute reason: the persuasive methods used in this movie will not succeed in convincing those whom we as a society most need to be persuaded, though I concede that this may be an impossible mission.Over all, Maher et al deserve kudos for their efforts. I only hope that this film's celebration of atheism will help others to join me in achieving the motivated yet peaceful state of mind that can be reached through the scientific way of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If "Religulous" is labelled as a documentary, it is in fact a satire. It doesn't aim to objectively present the current state of world religion. Maher and Charles have a point they want to get to, and use all the satirical tools at their disposal : ironic or sarcastic humor, exaggeration, comparison, analogy.They interview very chosen people and systematically crash all their argumentation by pointing out nonsenses, making jokes or via other interviews. As a documentary, this film is pointless, you are not going to learn anything about religion, faith nor history. As a satire, I find this a successful attempt, even if the juxtaposition of scenes and interviews doesn't quite rise to the level of the message they want to deliver.Nevertheless, the film shows very frightening religious - even sectarian - excesses that fit very well Charles and Maher's conclusion. Whether you agree with it or not is clearly not the question. A sufficiently open-minded viewer will acknowledge that their standpoint might be of interest in the sense that, at least, it opens the debate. This is what our society is about : debating, letting everyone express himself so that ultimately everyone can feel at home.Not an educational documentary. Not a mockery. A relevant satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Maher is still Alive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Breaking news: Bill Maher is still with us! In 2008, he voiced his opinion(s) about the multiple defects in religions in a documentary/mockumentary/comedy called Religulous. And yet, he's still with us.Local film critic/blogger Steve Reeves has this to say: "Oh, thank God!"With the increased tensions in the battle of lands, territories, political parties, books, words and drunken debates, it seemed unlikely that someone, some comedic commentator would not be assassinated baffles experts."Well, anyone with an opinion, like myself ? I am a critic, after all ? is subject to revolt or being called an infidel," said Reeves in an exclusive interview. "And Billy flat out insulted these so-called 'Top Ranking Officials' during his interviews."Maher, who was unable to be reached for this story and apparently never goes by the name "Billy," did manage to get a number of clips for his search for the truth in Religulous. According to sources, or Reeves, Maher got all angles for the right, left, up, down peoples of faith to prove that no one really has the answers."It's only based on their particular faith," Reeves said in between bites of pizza. "I'm a Christian myself?and I would like you to print that. You will, won't you? I want that on record. Oh, you're taping this? Good. Well, I can honestly say: 'I was not offended.' For, I grew up questioning everything and anything. My dad used to get mad at me, even spank me, for the simple two-word question: 'What if?' Meaning, what if I didn't do as you asked, etcetera. Even though I still believed in Christ, I still questioned a lot of my own religion to make sure I understood it and could stand for it."Reeves, following his now-cold pizza after that long-winded explanation, went further to say (and we'll sum it up for lack of space here) that Maher clearly and utterly pointed out the inconsistencies within each religion and the surprisingly similarities between the "troops.""The movie was hilarious," commented Reeves who moved onto beer, we're guessing for desert. "I laughed from the moment the movie started to the end. His dry and under-the-radar humor had me rolling. I mean, he flat out mocked these subjects and simultaneously proved they weren't sure in their own convictions."Whether Maher was right or not, he wasn't given enough facts or evidence to follow any of the different religions portrayed here. In recent nonscientific polls, it was revealed that 50% believed in God, 50% in the possibility of God and another 50% in the Book of (fill in the blank.) In all, it's proved here, that we're our own worst enemy and not getting along with each other will lead to more death, destruction and the downfall of the only "intelligent" species on this Blue/Green (pick an environmental group to decide which) Planet.Maher may have not solved the problem and most agree it won't be until Star Trek actually happens. (Source: Scientologists.) But, he did bring to light that being blind isn't fashionable and in the most comical way. So says the only interviewee we could get for this story."If your faith is strong, your conviction in your God is unbreakable, then this will not detour you," says Reeves who now is liking water so he can stay awake until the end of his interview. "I was rolling from minute one to the end. It's sad how we're so against each other, when we can never, ever agree to disagree. God doesn't care about religions or denominations. And I highly doubt He is still speaking to people about killing each other. That's pre-Christ days. Anything people tell you, such as "God told me to kill my kids in my Geo Metro in the local pond!" was surely misled by the evil one. I'm sure Billy will agree: The Golden Rule should be the number one process we follow. I believe even Rodney King would agree."Reeves went on for another half hour and was cut short when he proclaimed he was in the (movie) industry and we could not verify that. What was confirmed was that this movie was absolutely amusing, even though, sadly, not much will be resolved despite. "They say" that it's up to us to get along, so says Rodney King, but it's unlikely with further bigotry passed down from parent to child."Are we still on?

		<fullReview>Bill Maher is a comedian who was raised by a Catholic father and a Jewish mother. Catholicism was Bill's religion as a child. Anyway, he makes for an entertaining and funny presenter on this documentary against religion and religious thinking. It's just that he can come across as an obnoxious prat at times...like Professor Richard Dawkins in "The enemies of reason", or Sacha Baron Cohen in "Bruno". Whereas Dawkins was cluelessly obnoxious, Maher seems to think that saying obnoxious things with a half smile makes him unprattish. Sure, some of the religious people that Maher interviews fully deserve his caustic interrogation (like the Mexican Jesus or whatever), but others, simple believers, are less deserving of this superciliousness. The smart ones walk out on him...like the trucker in a truck church (is that what you call it?).So, if the mixture of funny and what-a-prat is do-able for you, there is a lot to get out of this docu. E.g.* It was nice to be reminded that the Christian story is a plagiarism of a plagiarism. For instance, the question: "Who is the deity that was born on December 25 to a virgin and performed many miracles before dying and then coming back to life?" has more correct answers than you may have thunk. Maher often gets stuck into 'so called' facts by the religious, but you have to wonder if the notion of "December 25" had much meaning pre Julian calendar (or whatever).* Even though Maher is an avowed agnostic/atheist (it seems to depend...on something or other), he does let some of his interview subjects shine on occasions. E.g. the pretend Jesus at Florida's Jesus World (or whatever). The actor likens the so called 'Holy Trinity' to water, and Bill is as impressed with that analogy just as much as I was. Me and Bill ultimately dismiss it, but still marvel at its ingenuity. Not sure if Maher notes that the concept of the holy trinity is half as old as Christianity itself, but if he does't, it should have been included here, I think.* I'd like to thank Maher for reminding Americans that their 'founding fathers' had some narky things to say about religion...be cool if Maher had a website listing them, like Michael Moore did for his docu "Capitalism: A love story", I think.* Back to Maher pulling others up for not being historically accurate...he takes the view that there is no historical evidence for the existence of Jesus, outside of the bible. Whilst being no expert on this subject, I have seen docus where Jesus is said to have been mentioned in the works of Jewish historians...Josephus, from memory. Perhaps Josephus is the one such other source, but it gives the lie to the statement that only the bible mentions Jesus.* You do have to wonder about Maher's views if applied to religion. The classic BBC comedy "Yes Prime Minister" had this exchange about the appointment of a new Archbishop of Canterbury for the Church of England: SIR Humphrey Appleby: Here are the names suggested for the new Archbishop. First is the Dean of Porterhouse College.Prime Minister Hacker: What do we know about his religious views ? SIRH: He's a modernist.PM: What on earth is a modernist ? SIR H: He does not believe in God.PM: Isn't that a very serious objection ?SIR H: Not at all these days. He is a very good choice.* Maher does spend a lot of the end of the docu going on about Muslims and Islam. He is especially rude to an American Rabbi who is not a Zionist and met with the Iranian leader. Not being well versed on this issue, the only observation I have about the Iranian leader's metaphorical comments on pushing Israel in to the sea (or whatever his comment was) is "Is he talking about genocide or merely undoing the status of Israel as a legitimate nation?".- to expand on this, Maher seems to be focusing on the splinter in the American Rabbi's eye when he has a log in his own. Here's my take on Maher's position: 1) Genocide bad. 2) Victims of genocide deserve their own country.Now, that's fair enough, I suppose, but...didn't whitey in American attempt genocide against the native Americans (albeit badly)? Given that fact, don't native Americans deserver their own country? Presumably Maher would be aghast at this proposition. On what grounds though? Be interesting to ask him. However, he has no problem with the US and the UN deciding, unilaterally, over 50 years ago, to confiscate Palestinian land and give it to Jews. Doesn't the US have nutcases who hide in the hills scared that the UN is coming to take over their country? Did those same people have an issue with the US taking over another people's land and giving it to someone else? If the UN decided that the Mormon bible was a good enough reason to confiscate American land and create a new Israel there, what do you think America's reaction would be? There'd be a lot of talk about pushing this new native American country in to the sea, right? And you'd know that they meant it in the worst possible way...they did drop two weapons of mass destruction (you know, the ones worthy of the name) on Japan, killing tens of thousands of innocent civilians in the process.* Lastly, for all of Maher's attacks on Muslims, there's not a peep about those crazy American Christians who go around murdering medical doctors or engaging in acts of terrorism in the Middle East. These latter criminals desire Armageddon...the death of all non Christians in a nuclear holocaust or some such. Which is really sick. Bill doesn't mention these crazies, who are just as scary as the Muslims he attacks. But hey, they're American, and Americans deserver 'special' treatment, right?</fullReview>

Does Bill interview theologians, professors, apologists, or any leading scholars in faith? No, he picks on idiots. (Ken Hamm is NOT a leading Christian scholar.) This is called a Strawman fallacy. Congratulations Bill. You defended Atheism by debating truckers. Impressive. Now, in fairness one could argue that his point is that the average person of faith doesn't know much about their faith. I would agree that this is often the case for religion, as well as in Atheism, politics, cooking and so on. However this doesn't prove a religion wrong. It only proves that many people don't bother to educate themselves on the issues to which they ascribe. I feel that this film is deliberately deceptive and manipulative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arrogance peddled off as humble &amp; doubtful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religulous is a movie with an agenda. Bill Maher would like us to believe that he is a peddler of doubt and that doubting makes you humble. But Maher is a man with a plan. He doesn't really have any doubt at all about his views on God and the after-life (in his mind, they are both non-existent). For the lovers of sarcasm, the movie will deliver in spades. He sets up his interviews to catch for the most part those on the fringe of religious life; the freaks and cult off-shoots of major religions. But not always. He does interview Muslims and Mormons who are more "average persons" or leaders and therefore a better representation of their religion. He does not delve into Buddhism or Hinduism at all. He keeps close to larger religions in and around America (sometimes Europe). The editing of his interviews are all designed to take most statements out of context, for the purpose of getting the laughs. If you want to see someone who is trying to irritate others and doesn't play fair, this movie is for you.However, that is the precise weakness of this film. Maher deliberately goes for easy targets. Nowhere does he go for a John Piper or a Tim Keller. And who knows how many intelligent answers he may have gotten that were left on the editing floor because they didn't fit his mold? Maher is also incredibly condescending. He berates people. His little sermon at the end clearly demonstrates what was his purpose all along, to overthrow the "poison" of religion.This is a common view held by New Atheists. Religion is poison. They are unwilling to coexist with it. They see all evil coming from it. They believe that mankind, if allowed to evolve past it, will enter into a new golden age. In fact, nothing could be farther from the truth. Mankind is hardwired to adhere to something greater than itself. And when we pervert that desire and "worship" ourselves, then we begin to have the greatest cruelties ever committed on earth. The atheist Pol Pot's regime, Stalin's, Mao Tze Tong's are only a prelude to something worse. Religious adherence has also made its share of atrocities. Anytime anyone arrogantly says "I refuse to co-exist with you because you are sub-human" we are destined for societal self-destruction. Maher inadvertently would wish to take us there.Maher also does not do very good research. For example, he scans a few quotes from the founding fathers of the USA and jumps to the conclusion that the US was not founded upon Christian principles. But if you look at history, such as the public school textbooks used (The New England Primer - peppered with King James Bible quotes to teach lessons), the actual constitution, and other quotes of the founding fathers, it is quite clear the US WAS founded upon Protestantism. The founding fathers were very clear that in order for the country to survive, they needed a people that could discipline themselves. Therefore, Christianity was deliberately promulgated into all aspects of society, particularly in the public schools. The one positive thing about this film is that it should spur Christians to dutifully analyze Scripture and reflect deeply on the faith. Too often, we come up with pat answers to deep life questions. Immersion in Scripture with the Holy Spirit giving guidance on interpretation will return us to the heartfelt intellectualism we had a few generations ago. God commands us to worship Him with our whole heart, soul, and intellect. We recently have ignored the intellect. Scripture is sufficient to give us clairvoyance into the challenges of life.</fullReview>

I think it's a really good idea and a big issue that needs to be documented and researched. I just think that Bill Maher wasn't the right person to do it. A documentary needs to be objective, researching and taking into account facts, different opinions and different point of views, etc. He went into it with prejudice, with his disbelief put first and making fun of people he interviewed. I don't have anything against his disbelief and opinion but that is just not the way to make a documentary.

		<fullReview>Maher does a good job of pointing out the folly of faith without reason, but, like perhaps most what I will call rationalists, overlooks that reason without faith is just an inversion of common religious fundamentalism.When not all the facts are in on a question (and may never be), some faith is required unless one wants a full-time "job" as an agnostic.In any case, Maher strongly implies (especially at the end) that it is religionists who are responsible for the bulk of violence in the world, but what of official atheists such as Stalin and Mao? And all those nasty weapons were brought to us in the first place by: SCIENTISTS.Things like this are rather lacking in integrity (from the Trivia tab): 'During the sequence set inside the Dome of the Rock, Bill Maher and his guide are approached by two men who speak in Arabic and are supposedly objecting to Maher's presence. In reality, what they are saying is "We don't normally hang out here..." and "The boss only gives us five minutes..."'Disclosure: I am a panentheist with a "minor" in process theology.I rate average films at 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a religious person. I detest religion of all kinds to the point that it makes me physically sick to hear people spewing it like it's a good thing. No matter what point of view you have on this movie there is a simple fact that religious people damage society. Any person with any intelligence can look at history and see this. I have read a lot of comments and see people saying Bill picked people with lesser intelligence than him so he made them all look stupid or he picked on him. News flash - I have never met an intelligent religious person! They can't put down their bible long enough to come up with an intelligent argument. Any person that has gone to university and had an ethics class knows the first rule is that you can't use the bible in an argument for any ethical debate because it hasn't been proved. The fact is if you are religious then you take things on "faith" and have no proof. If you just believe anything someone wrote in a book as the word of a god...well you just aren't too bright. By this reasoning in twenty thousand years if men are still around someone might pick up the Lord of the Rings and say god wrote it. The books all religious people cling to for their defence are flawed. They have been tampered with by man and that is proved. From mistranslation to willingly altering content to make people believe what someone wanted. In history religion was used to put fear into the masses so they would obey their leaders. They made the consequences for not following the leaders acceptable through religion and not only were you usually killed but everyone considered you a devil or whatever the church wanted them to believe. Hell, the inferno most people believe in doesn't exist if you have any concept of the bibles that came before the medieval times in our history. Prior to that time "hell" was only called a "pit". In later translations they translated the physical place on earth call Gehenna into the word "Hell". Gehenna was a place where they were sacrificing people in a pit of fire. It is describe as such a place in the bible, and if you change the name of this place to "hell" well then you just magically created a mystical place of torment. The hellfire that burns you forever was translated from another city where they burned their trash and kept the fires going day and night. Really if you are going to believe in something, if you are going to stand up to someone and argue that you can give valid reasons for your beliefs, then you at least owe it to yourself to research what you put your faith in. If you don't well then you aren't going to look smart no matter who interviews you. Till this day I have never met an intelligent religious person because intelligent people don't take things on faith. They research it; they understand it and they can defend it whether caught off guard or on. This movie was aptly name in my opinion. Religion in the modern world has no place and is ridiculous. "Organized" religion is a kind way of saying "Mass Brainwashing" these beliefs are archaic and were conjured up by men that still believed the world to be flat and a mass population that was uneducated. As a whole the world should be smarter than this and people need to stop holding on to these tales of revenge, murder, hate, death and rape. Religion only glorifies death and the submission of one person or race to another. How can anyone with any knowledge of self, with any strength within them, with any love in their heart feel that religion serves any purpose except to divide mankind and create people that believe that they are superior to others? Religion is a disease, it is an illness that kills more people than cancer, aids, plague or any other you would like to say. It is deadly, and if you don't believe me than research our history for yourself. Look at every war started in god's name or that one race was more pure than another. Count up the bodies and then ask yourself, "How can I justify that any religion is a thing that brings love and compassion and is good for mankind?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, self-indulgent and Islamophobic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher certainly has some points to make in this very personalised exploration of religion. He spends the majority of the time focused on 'questioning' Christianity, although he is clearly more respectful of those who share his views, surprisingly, such as those who have been involved with the Vatican. For those who don't he often fails to return the respectfulness that they take his questions and criticisms, even if they often fail to answer his questions. I found much of this unnecessary since his point was already clearly made, and some of it quite childish. I was enjoying certain parts of this film and found it entertaining, though not brilliant, and certainly quite self-indulgent. However, I was deeply turned off this film when it singled out Islam as a violent religion (despite showing Christians with "God hates fags" and "thank God for AIDS" signs at the beginning). In this film, Islam is characterised by its extremists with one imam saying that Islam is a religion of peace juxtaposed only with footage of extremist murders and gun-toting decontextualised street protests. Given the number of murders of, for example, abortion clinic doctors, or the repressive ways that women in many religions live, I felt that this was very uneven handling of the complexity of the heterogeneity within every religion. In the end, this, and the film's need for a good edit (it is at least ten minutes too long given the material they have) tarnishes the film far too much for my recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill is a funny guy, and he doesn't always pick on somebody his own size. A lot of his humor is not unlike what Michael Moore and Rush Limbaugh used to do on their TV shows. He finds the most incoherent guy he can who disagrees with him and then edits the tape to make his foil look as stupid as possible. I had a bit of trouble with his premise. Certainly, religion has resulted in lots of stupid and appalling behavior, but so has fundamentalism of a number of non-religious flavors--free market capitalism, Marxism, nationalist triumphalism, etc. If you believe something utterly and unthinkingly, bad things will result, whether or not what you believe has anything to do with a deity. And if your belief is leavened with tolerance and humility, your religion (or support of capitalism or socialism, or whatever) may well do more good than harm. It was weird how he chose to pull his punches at times and go for the jugular at others. He found maybe the most appealing non-dogmatic Catholic priest on earth to talk to, but did not deign to approach any adherent of Islam who was not a bomb-throwing wacko. I know that they are out there--I live a couple blocks from a mosque and have wonderful Pakistani and East African neighbors. But the Islamic people I know would not have fit into the simplistic narrative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Openness changed to propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher himself is half of the theme in his satire-comic documentary, intended to target religion as a phenomenon, but naturally limits mostly to different forms of Christianity.With a warm sense of humor, but also blistering critique, Bill meets representatives of a few religious persuasions. Bill mostly stands in front of the camera, which makes us literally following him on his journey around the world (practically a few places in USA, the middle east and Europe).What at first seems to me like an open minded (despite the title, I will return to that later) atheist with a hint of catholic background and a genuine interest in religion, wanting to discover the nature of religion, soon changes to a considerably more negative figure.Bill Maher's documentary is not about meeting or discovering religiosity, it is about crushing it. And that is exactly what he does, first by taking a few cheap points against cult leaders he has an obvious intellectual advantage against.But the opposition is on a very varied level, and I find it sad to see how he refuse to step back when he actually gets a good answer in return.I specifically remember a scene where Bill quite self-confident asks about the trinity and receives a fast answer which astonishes him. In almost-admiration I watch this confident egocentric's jaw drop, and give his opponent a sincere recognition. But in that captured moment there is a cut, and frame change to a later car ride, where Bill just laughs the answer away by picking up another topic.Mostly I am disappointed at the, in post-production pasted, comments/answers - giving the interviewees no chance to answer and thereby destroying the dialogue. I think this contradicts the whole idea of open discussion, which the documentary is based upon since Bill takes a very clear stand.At once the "documentary" is transformed into a propaganda machine where interviewees are cut away in favor of Bill's own expositions.An element of the movie is set in a church where Bill, along with his sister and their mother, discuss their private experiences and views on religion. It is an interesting idea and even though the whole family left the Roman-Catholic Church, at least the mother shows an interest in and recognition for religiosity. But this is ridiculed by her children, who show no openness at all, which is also very sad for the movie.In summary I think this is a poorly designed film with an obvious propagating agenda and a distasteful amount of self-advertising for the protagonist Bill.And about the title Religulous - a mixture of the two words religious and ridiculous, indicating the view the filmmakers have on religion from the start; as something silly. This is by itself a misfortune and misinterpretation, since Bill also takes a (clear atheistic) religious stand. This tactless miscalculation and actual ignorance show pretty much what the whole movie is: An organized effort to ridicule religious representatives (put together despite the conspicuous differences between them) by imposing unprepared questions and cut into their answers to make them look bad.This one gets 2/10 from me, a point saved by the short moments of dialogue there was and a little research on shooting locations. The warm sense of humor is seen occasionally, but the mocking satire which dominates the movie leaves much to be desired.Finally I urge you to leave your religious views aside, as they often infect the judgement, and watch it as a documentary, I did...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make no mistake about it: if you have even a sliver of faith, then Bill Maher's latest documentary, "Religulous" is bound to boil your blood. Directed by Larry Charles ("Borat" and "Seinfeld"), Maher travels the globe, from the Vatican to the heart of Midwest America to interview people who believe in things he finds to be ridiculous. When some get too crazy for words, he'll slap on a subtitle underneath them or splice a seemingly random -- but fitting -- movie clip into their responses. But hey, no one said this movie was going to be fair, and for all the cheap shots it takes, it must be remembered that this is but one side of the story. Surely, there will be other documentaries attempting to dis-credit and debunk Maher's points in the future. Like "Fahrenhype 9/11" to "Fahrenheit 9/11," all is fair in love and war. And religion.Honestly, it's hard to write a review for this movie without scoring heaps of unhelpful votes from people who simply disagree with your religious beliefs or lack thereof. So I'll keep it simple and to the point: Maher's argument is that we are a modern society believing in irrelevant and unrealistic things, and that, ultimately, it will bring our doom. Afterall, our society is mostly run by stupid people who believe stupid things and make stupid choices based on such stupid beliefs. Maybe he's right, maybe he's wrong, but in "Religulous," Maher makes you think almost as much as you will laugh, which means he's done his job. It's worth watching even if you are deeply invested in the bible, if only to be part of the discussion. Maher flexes his rights by way of the first amendment with heaps of laughs and jokes, but the message is clear and simple. Take from it what you will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Fun. Good Points.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this mockumentary. It was fun and entertaining, and yes, I imagine religious followers probably hated it and want Bill Maher shot and Lionsgate films burned to the ground. If you fit in that group, then you missed the whole point of the entire film.I believe that human beings do have a spiritual side, and that we are all searching for something. Unfortunately, most of us don't know how to find it, so we'll turn to anything that provides answers. The biggest one of course is "What happens when we die?" Well, the truth is that none of us really know. So rather than grab for answers in "holy" books written hundreds of years ago by common men with no special abilities beyond what you or I have, people need to start looking inward and to each other.I say this because I've been on the same quest for answers and truth that we all are on, and while not an easy intellectual trek, we do not need to grab at the first (and easiest) answer that comes to us.Does God exist? I don't know (and despite what you think, neither do you), but I'm not going to waste my life on a religious throw of the dice just to find what I need to fulfill me. Instead, I'm going to turn inward?where the answers really lie.Maher's flick stirs controversy (just as it intended to) but it addresses all the questions religious followers can never answer because of the glaring flaws in the dogma of every religion. Questions like: If God is all-powerful and he loves his children, then why can't just destroy Satan and all forms of evil? Or, if the Bible is really God's book, then why isn't it completely credible, or at least infallible in its design? And so on? Regardless of your alignment, try to have fun with this film. It's a lot like Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, where you've got some truth mixed in with a lot of over-the-top silliness presented in a documentary shooting style. I think Maher's conclusions at the end of the film spoil it a bit (even though they're pretty self-evident truths and I fully agree with them) because it kind of morphs the whole affair into a bashing of religion rather than the tongue-n-cheek, crack-of-the-whip I think the film makers were originally going for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>whereas i have had many spiritual experiences throughout my life i so agree with bill's assessment that religions dogmas, doctrines, and fanatics have been the cause of more wars, deaths, torture, greed, intolerance, etc. in the world. it's hypocrisies are blatant and violent. books such as the bible, quaran, torah, ad infinitum were written by men whose motivation was to control, manipulate and repress huge masses of minorities. the totally and ruthlessly deny, squash, and almost totally obliterated the feminine divine part of the equation. the instances he used in this film were superb; his message clear. religions promote such a degree of violence intolerance, and downright stupidity...that along with politics, they very well could bring about the end of the world through a self fulfilling prophecy. there total disregard for the people that do not believe in their version of god is an outrage! how people, especially otherwise intelligent human beings, could buy into these trappings is almost incomprehensible. and another thing...i know it and bill knows it...those charlatans that are making a profit preaching at the expense of god, Jesus, and the goddess that gave birth to him (oh, that's right...they don't mention anything about any women) really do not believe in god, Jesus, and heaven or hell or they would not be acting, speaking, or living the way they do. and hitting on the eastern belief systems...how is it that they require so much pain and suffering to become enlightened...i believe some of us are challenged and evolved enough through our life experiences, love, guidance, introspection, and non violent discipline to learn to be nice, considerate,and kind. karma...let us stop the cycle of abuse...how many people are allowed to be beaten, tortured, and abused millennium after millennium before we feel safe from that convenient excuse that when bad things happen to good people and bad people get away with murder or worse it is god's will or your karma. instant karma, where one experiences the same degree of pain as they impart might have it's benefits. not all people of these different religions are as dangerous as the religious right and not all the clergymen, priests, popes are scoundrels...in fact most aren't. but they are inadvertently causing a negative impact on the big picture...how to restore the earth to a "garden of eden". put an end to these horrific wars, to establish peace through diplomacy, and achieve happiness through love, tolerance and a willingness to approach life's issues with an open mind. the issue of this documentary targeted established religions that have, out of the desire for greed and power, have caused such misery and grief that are future could very well be a dim one. fortunately, i am an eternal optimist's and have enough hope, faith and love to foresee a pleasant future for the planet rather than this Armageddon thing. kudos to bill and the people who had the courage to produce this documentary! thank you and blessings on you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a agnostic, this is the documentary I've been waiting for a long time to see and masterfully so. I love this guy and all he did in making this film. Its hard enough to do what most people consider taboo and question religion and its followers, its even harder for someone to publicly question and film their results focusing on religion. Its clear that many of the people Maher interviewed were more clearly uncomfortable with their faith being questioned than Maher was in being challenged in his questions, or even being thrown out of the Vatican. Funny yes, but Maher persisted despite it all and I am very pleased with the determination that went into this films production, the answers Maher received that made sense of it all. Well done and bravo, thank you, I've waited for years for a documentary or film like this to come out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Maher poking on religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get this said first: I live in Sweden. In a recent survey 23% of Swedish citizens replied that they "they believe there is a God". However 53% replied "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and only 23% really defined themselves as atheists by stating "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force".So fundamentalism and religion isn't a real issue for us. Not as it is portrayed in Bill Maher's Religulous.Maher does bring some valid points however. A recent case in Sweden involved pastor ?ke Green who was sentenced for hate speech because of a sermon where referred to homosexuality as an "abnormal, a horrible cancerous tumor in the body of society". He was later acquitted on grounds of freedom of religion. When religion are held above the laws of the nation you have a problem. Fortunately for us in Sweden as a democratic nation these religious beliefs aren't laws.When religion even goes above the laws of a nation we have a problem. Not only nation-wide but worldwide. Religious people can preach hate against non-religious people. Mahers documentary makes the very valid point that atheists and agnostics shouldn't tip-toe around and be more vocal about their doubt. Especially when we see history repeating itself.However and this is my criticism, this documentary ended up more like a mockumentary. Maher mostly mocks and ridicules the mere notion of belief. Which, is pretty funny to see, when his victims start displaying classic cognitive dissonance but it becomes something different when he starts going after religions which he seems less familiar with. When he comes to Islam we get to see pictures of suicide bombings in Jerusalem. Here is where I think Maher starts getting it wrong. Over 13 000 Palestinian homes have been destroyed since the Six-Day War. Not a singe Israeli settlement has been destroyed. Not to mention that suicide bombings make up less than one percent of the attacks by Palestinians against Israelis.The facts in this documentary gets a bit skewed when it comes to the discussion of Islam. Maher seems to do his best to portray this as a violent religion preaching hate and violence more so than any other. If Maher had focused his eye on Sweden he would have heard about Ecce Homo, portraying Jesus as gay, which spawned numerous death threats from the Christian community. On top of that islamist terrorism accounted for 4 of 583 terrorist acts according to Europol during 2007. Giving Islam a different treatment than any other religion as a "terrorist" religion is plain wrong. All religions have spawned violent acts.What can be said about Religulous in the end is that it's too short, biased and doesn't quite follow through on the core issues.Still, worth a watch, but keep in mind that this is more of a statement than a documentary.</fullReview>

I was wrong, 7.5 + on IMDb proves that there is at least some amount of thinking in here. This movie is not all about the stupidity and the craziness of religion, it is about the possibility of extreme consequences, those which can be caused if religion is not put to an end. Look at past 10 years and name one place not affected by the religious extremism !. There are people around us who even put atheism into a separate religion, proving the amount of ignorance creeping into their brains because they simple do not what to think rationally.

Plus, I love the way that Bill Maher has, without any hesitation, confronted religious figures and basically told them that they are wrong. He isn't afraid of any consequences of this approach as he knows that if he uses logical understanding of the world around us, then he can prove to these people that what they are believing in will bring the world to it's knee's and eventually end it all.- Harry Whitehead</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gentle approach to questions of faith.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher takes us on a trip to explore doubt in the face of belief. The journey is a gentle but relentless pursuit of interviews of people of different faiths from around the world. The sum of the stories draws a picture for the viewer of how important faith is to everyone. Maher himself carries his faith openly throughout the film.It is also an exploration of blind faith, ritual and emotional devotion. What his painting shows us is the more emotional investment a person had in their faith the more blind they were in their interpretations of it's doctrines.Many of the followers seemed completely locked out of any capacity to question or doubt any aspect of their faith. I admit I'm not a psychologist but that does not seem like a healthy behavior. Especially since it lead to strange though harmless behaviors. Like building a museum showing humans and dinosaurs together. It was the only way they could reconcile their faith without ignoring too much reality.There was also a sadness in the picture, because that discordant behavior seemed in every case to directly follow and grow along with the strength of emotional commitment.The documentary ends with a monologue by Maher as images and videos are green screened behind him. He points out the horrible acts in history driven by blind faith that seem barbaric today and contrasts this with the present. Will our great great great great grandchild read about us in history as brutal and barbaric is the question he left us with.I wish he had taken more time to contrast with the positive nature of faith. Faith it appears is everywhere and doubt seems the perfect medicine. Even Einstein depended on faith in science, a reporter once asked him how he knew relativity was right. He answered he didn't and no experiment could ever prove him right but single experiment could prove him wrong. He had strong faith, but not at all blind.Maher seemed to express the character of a healthy mix of faith and doubt but never discusses it. I wish he had given some of the comments left the viewer feeling they had witnessed an attack. Or maybe the doubt and questions were too discordant for them.It's just one man's perspective of one prospective tour of interviews. It paints a complex picture but not the big picture, no movie nor movies can. But it struck a chord in me and it wasn't at all discordant.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well when it comes to this considered a documentary it doesn't really fit to become a one that is able to reach the message to you, actually I didn't know what is exactly the message ? is it just to make fun of religions for the sake of being funny,showing my pride of being a non religious or trying to get people to become more rational and skeptical. this movie could be funny to some people and there's some points where I laughed but at the same time there somethings that were ridiculous more than funny and it didn't have a point like the 2 guy Muslims and the Jewish rabbi who doesn't believe in Israel.there's also a point that most of the religious people lack information about their religion so its normal to ask them questions and they cant answer it so whats the point from getting normal people and amateur religious men and ask them questions that are beyond of their knowledge and then make fun of that its just lame.the whole idea of going through the religions around of the world and all that but at the end of the day the way it was portrayed is not that effective for the subject you have in hand, you discussed only the Abrahamic religion only three of them while you have other non Abrahamic religions that contains things that are ridiculous and even more ridiculous.if you want to laugh a bit watch this movie but don't try to get anything more from that but laughter</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am considered by myself and some who know me personally to be spiritual. I have been to the Christian church as a child/youth and baptized at the age of 33. I have done much studying of the bible, a little of the Koran and some of various world religions.It is about time a documentary put all of this into a somewhat rational and interesting perspective - than to simply tow whatever religion viewpoint one belongs to. Seems that happens far to often - so in reality(good word for this whole idea) this documentary is a breath of "fresh air".Bill Maher did a great job with Larry Charles. I actually think they could have done better but I believe it was easy because all these "crazy" religious nuts seem to convict themselves to the viewer with ease.I laughed so hard at one point I was crying. I think it really is 2 sides. Funny and painfully f*ckin sad. Bill puts it quite bluntly. I believe it was his "awakening" through or after the film was done - that religions may be the end of "us all".RIGHT ON BILL MAHER and LARRY CHARLES. This movie is a MUST HAVE FOR ANYONES top 30 DVD's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Maher is clever enough to show how new religions like Scientology are not different than three main religions. Actually, your first impression could be: "Hey, these are extreme and absurd examples of religions and it is so superficial". However, if you have a chance to watch the documentary closely, you realize that, Maher implicitly tries to show, how these extreme examples like "new Jesus" or "ex-Muslim, new Christian" are same as our old holy characters. We can laugh to any people who say "I'm the descendant of Jesus of Nazareth", but what about real Jesus of Nazareth, if he actually exists, who say I'm the son of God. Doesn't sound like bullshit? Hey don't be angry. "I am just asking questions" =) He certainly produces doubt, however, as a person who has Jewish father, he clearly does not criticize Jewish people enough compared to other two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More a Mockery rather than a Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, after watching this documentary, I winded up with categorizing this movie more in Comedy blended with mockery and not a factual documentary that is based on research over the religions (except for the last five minutes of the movie, of course). Bill Maher would like to mock and ridicule the interviewers belief instead of rejecting them on a logical and reasonable basis. Which proves that he did not study and research a lot about the Monotheist religions before shooting this documentary about religions.Having said, on the other hand, that I am not a religious person and would prefer to carve the words of John Adams about religion in my mind "This would be the best of all possible worlds if there were no religion in it!" rather than reading those outdated chapters of gibberish to deviate myself.I think, another real and factual documentary is needed about the religions and should be spread throughout the world to aware the people about the disastrous consequences of the religions in conflict. The high ranking religious scholars should be interviewed instead of some general public like in this movie (the drivers and workers or passers-by) who have vague or no information and knowledge of their religions.This movie is a good "intertaining?" movie for the atheists but can not be accepted as a logically and scientifically researched documentary about religions.I rate it 7/10 just because of the last 5 minutes when Bill Maher beautifully starts to conclude this documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He should have covered more ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think instead of attempting to discredit what is taught by religion, Bill should strive to discredit religion itself. What I mean is, this is a nation of supposed Christians when the truth is, most abandoned it just as he did but they still have their foot stuck in the door. The basis of Christianity being the nations biggest religion is based on lies. The government uses the census and countless other deceitful surveys, such as those issued by schools and employers, to get our citizens to check the box next to "Christianity" under religious affiliation. Meanwhile you will find that easily 50% of these people haven't been in a church for a decade or more. What's even sadder is, about half of those that no longer practice religion, still believe in a lot of fundamentals whether it's whole or half heartedly. Bill, your next documentary should be an attempt to level the playing field. Attack the lie that America is a nation of Christians because we're not. Most of us are ex Christians that unfortunately still harbor a handful of religious convictions but in essence, in truth are not Christians though religious leaders will convince otherwise. At this point, religion allows for people to behave as decadent as possible while believing they can be forgiven for all of it. Catholics have got to be the worst in this regard but I suppose maybe the Mormons might very well take first prize here as well. Just as sad, many will return to religion once they have children or grow in age out of fear, guilt, responsibility etc.Some clever surveys, random group polling and approaches such as this will really shed some light on the fact that most people haven't set foot in a church since they were kids. In my town, I'd say we have under a dozen churches or about a dozen churches yet the population is around 3,000 people and it's still a clich, small town in most respects. You couldn't fit HALF of the population in all those churches! But, I can guarantee the people that do fill those churches, are the very lunatics running the town with a conflict of interest favoring their minority religious group. Just imagine trying to represent the majority at a town or city meeting against the minority of Christians running the show! There needs to be an organization dedicated to the majority who do not have a voice because we have no logical way to assemble as an individual entity as these religious lunatics do!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching Religulous. This is without a doubt one of the best documentaries I have ever seen and I expect I ever will see. Now,I'm not going to go into too much detail as I'd rather let you experience it for yourself, but Bill Maher is funny, intelligent and charming as a voice of reason in a vast land of religion which is far crazier than we as a world, atheist or otherwise, are prepared to admit. He makes some beautifully made arguments and points and is unbiased to anything besides rationalism. Despite the religious element it is also very funny and makes great use of on screen captions. But what is nice is that the humorous element never gets in the way of the fact that this is still a documentary. Also, it is brilliantly directed by comedic heavyweight Larry Charles and the use of archive footage is really the cherry on the cake. So to put is fairly briefly, if you are open minded and rationalistic and want to see a well made, witty, smart documentary that really makes you think, go watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore Lite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine, Religulous ranks as one of the most deceptive portrayals of any subject matter as presented in a modern day mockumentary. Since he seems incapable of simply presenting a compelling case directly, he relies on video manipulation and sarcasm to pretend he is making a irrefutable point. Many times Maher asks someone what he wants viewers to think is a "gotcha" question, then cuts the scene before the person can fully reply or even reply at all. Other times it is apparent that a scene has been modified so that the person he is interviewing just sits dumbfounded and speechless after another Maher "zinger", when it is obvious that a clip from a different part of the interview has been edited in instead of the response.Add to this using some of the kookiest representatives for different religions, as well as overlaying mocking text to distract from a half complete interview and you have one of the most pointless attempts of examining a subject that really does need a deeper look.Viewers who are fans of Bill Maher or those who already follow his philosophy will be profoundly moved by this massive cow pie. But anyone who is looking to further understand the topic of religion and it's flaws will likely be staring at the screen with their mouths agape by the time the end credits roll.</fullReview>

I honestly did believe that he was just chatting sh%t at some point but he wasn't ! Obviously, you could see him as very one-sided and arrogant person but he is just putting facts (he does come across a bit cocky). He is not here to say that religious people are stupid, he is just saying that the "religious facts" are because they contradicts themselves ! I watched the movie a second time with friends and two of them were quite religious but they did not feel offended...why..maybe because they tolerate other people opinions (my mate are cool anyway). However, I understand that some religious people that are very very very insecure about their belief and intolerant, don't want to be contradicted and will react quite violently to this documentary...which kind of explain the mess we're living in</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Religulous is a much needed, and a must see film! It is brilliantly shocking, scary, and funny! I'm a pretty conservative southerner and not really a Maher fan, but he is dead on here! This film is exactly what is needed. I've hoped for something like this for a long time, and Maher delivers. Why didn't Jesus, Muhammad, or God himself ever mention that the world was flat? Or that germs existed? Or that the universe existed! Why? Because the writers of the Holy books lived thousands of years ago and therefore could not include information of which they were ignorant in the fictional tales they created to further their own political agendas. And that's what this movie is all about: "Wake Up World, It's 2009! The fire isn't going to go out for good. We can move on now!" The only flaw I see in this film is simply that Maher could have interviewed some astronomers and physicists that really embrace a devout and rational view of existence that is along the same lines as what Maher hints at: that the world is a magnificent rock traveling around a great ball of fire in a great capsule called the universe. Existence in and of itself is mysterious and fantastical, beautiful and wondrous. Human beings don't know anything more than that, and that is a positive thing. It makes life precious. But that is simply my not-so-humble opinion. And Maher is not so humble either, which is what makes this the best damn social documentary I've ever seen. This needs to be shown in middle schools all across America. Can you imagine that! Freedom of Religion means freedom of choice, and this film reveals that one choice (apparently %16 of the US) is agnosticism. And as Maher points out, that's a powerful minority! Sign me up! Im a lawyer. Do you know how many religious (mostly Christian) laws exist in America that are blatantly unconstitutional.Mr. Maher, there's your next film!</fullReview>

While he did spend some time on these, his attention was chiefly on Christianity. Don't get me wrong, there is material enough to make a dozen movies like this on Christianity alone.But Bill, if you're conclusion is that the world is a more dangerous place because of religion, how do you only give 15 minutes of film time to confront the issues with Islam? And how do you confront only the crazy couple of Jews who say the holocaust never happened? What about the behavior of the Jewish state Israel in promoting instability? Instead, you take easy shots, finding goofy splinter Christian groups out in the middle of nowhere.The film was fascinating and entertaining. But, it could have been a whole lot better. You had a chance to put together a hard hitting sociological look at how religion of all kinds is used to promote political agendas. But in the end, you settle for a kind of Michael Moore-like "Bowling for Jesus". Too bad. You're a lot better than that.</fullReview>

Bill Mayer uses his humor to target the audience and hit it right where it sticks. He sticks it, and uses it. He uses it well.We are presented with the opinions of various "credible" sources for religion, that is, Bill gathers the whos-whos of religion and asks them a few simple questions: How do you know your God is real? Do you have proof? How do you expect others to believe your religion? What about Horus? That story was written a thousand years before Jesus, yet it is the exact story of Jesus. How do you explain that? Don't you think that the story of Jesus/faith in general is a little far-fetched and hard to believe? He then shows us some of the more ridiculous sides of religion, including a man who claims to be the second coming of Jesus -- because he is Jesus's descendant. And further, Bill kind of traps him into saying that if he were the descendant of Satan that he'd be doing Satan's work too.... and this Jesus descendant agrees! HAHAHA!! Genius! This is a must see for atheists because it gives us something to laugh at while giving us great new facts to corroborate our intelligence. It is also a must see for theists because it sheds light on the ridiculousness and absurdity of religion."If I were a boy, I think I could understand, how it feels to love a girl.

To start off with I an a fan of Bill Maher so if you are not, give me the "comments were not useful" if you even made it this far past the eight out of ten vote. It is a documentary so it is basically him stating his point and showing interviews that support it. People throw around the word propaganda a lot these days but all the people in the interviews say what they want to say freely and have no problem with it because it is what they believe. That is the heart of this movie, if you believe something but you can't prove it, can you claim absolution? A lot of different faiths are represented and they all lay claim to being the "one." The thing that really struck me was that the representatives of these faiths did not put up good arguments and were visibly upset that they even had to. After three or four legitimate questions they would fall back on the "I Just Know" answer. There attitude was almost universally a dismissive "Youre an A hole" or a dismissive "I feel sorry for you..A hole." The film brings up many thought provoking questions. Does faith make you a better person? Is that on a personal level? on a scale with your fellow man? Both? Can you think around a personal belief? Is your personal belief more or less important than someone else's? I found this movie to equally funny and scary. I know most people who see it will be "the choir" but I think everyone should see it. And discus it constructively.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very enjoyable. Honest search for truth. Mr. Maher interviewed so many of the people I currently know, not gross caricatures, real people I run into every day. Bill Maher did not just seek out the select few that came off as idiots. Naturally, an entertainer has to use what he has available to tell an interesting story, but I know people every bit as convinced of their religious rightness as many of the people in this film. Of course, this movie does essentially preach to the already converted. I can't imagine any religious person that I know going to see it. I think the ideas and scenarios are compelling. This movie could help anyone who is sitting on the fence and doubting the worth of their religion. I wish I could have taken my kids. There is a sex reference, but it was really rather tame. My only criticism, may be at around the seventy percent mark, the movie dragged just a little. Three or four minutes could have been edited out. Otherwise, this is an important work. I'm very glad it got made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a documentary. Bill Maher travels the globe making fun of religious people in their own churches. I am not religious, but I found Bill to be extremely smug, unintelligent and absolutely ignorant went it came to this subject. If he took the stance that war is often caused by religion then it would have been easy to agree with him. His stance, however is that anyone with beliefs is stupid (most people on the planet) and that he is clever and that we should all join the congregation of Bill. He preaches worse than any religious leader and promotes the same ignorance he complains about. The ending is actually really creepy, as the camera looks up to him and he asks you to join him, making him seem like he is starting his own cult. Maybe leave the atheism to the professionals (Richard Dawkins...etc).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedian turned social commentator Bill Maher does it well in this investigative documentary. Unlike most of the recent "new atheists" like Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, Maher asks simple but penetrating questions about religion, without pretending to know all the answers. Maher is most effective when he confronts religious believers and their "leaders" alike with the most elementary contradictions in what they are saying, and receives a staring blank in return. You can't help but think that at least some of his interviewees must have felt like "oh, you darn infidel, you got me here!" Particularly precious are the bits where Maher interviews a Jesus impersonator at a Christian- inspired amusement park in Florida, and even more when he goes to a London park to shout the tenets of Scientology. As he told recently Jon Stewart (of The Daily Show), it sounds crazy, but it's simply what Tom Cruise believes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have the time, there are two great, very recent, documentary films to watch. "With God on Our Side" is a documentary that is propaganda for the evangelical/right-wing political movement. It is well done and terrifying to me. "Religulous" is a documentary by Bill Maher, the famous, politically incorrect comedian. He travels all over the world visiting sacred places of the major religions, their sects, and their leaders and their followers. It is simultaneously hilarious and profound. Viewing and listening to his interviewees gives you insight into the utterly absurd beliefs common to all religions and the extraordinary, and often dangerous, influence they and their leaders hold over huge segments of the earth's innocent, ignorant, gullible people. I found it helpful to watch "With God on Our Side" first and then "Religulous". Looking back from the latter to the former helps give me better perspective on how sinister political and economic motivations meld with deep religious convictions. In all, or at least most, of these religious 'covens', you dare not question lest you be cast into hell upon death. It is also amazing how intransigent such beliefs are to rational refutation. It is amazing how language and human needs for meaning and immortality work to convince people of beliefs that are pure figments arising from human being's astounding mental faculty of imagination and ability to hold totally incongruous, contradictory information in their minds with equanimity. "Religulous" is now showing in a limited number of theaters across the country. It is, to me, the most important documentary ever, even more so than those of Michael Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Religulous - Bill Maher's documentary about his desire to end blind religious faith. I enjoy Bill's Real Time program, and find him to be a likable host of the film. I also admire the lengths he went to, and hope no harm comes to him from making this film. The mere fact that I am including that statement should scream to you how dangerous religious beliefs are when acted on.I have never reviewed a documentary before. I can only judge it by three standards. How well it informs, entertains, and will it reach it's intended audience.It informs pretty well. It was nice to be given insight on Bill's homelife as a boy. And he has certainly done his homework on religion. I had no idea how many faiths created earlier than Christianity had told the same damn story on the creation of Jesus. The main message is not that every religious person is stupid, but that religion is a lapse of judgment that does not belong in a society where our technology is so far ahead of our minds.Religion no longer stands for morality. It stands for corrupt men that hide in its curtains. Why is everyone so certain of what is going to come? When we have cruise missiles and nuclear weapons in the hands of evangelical Christian politicians, so many of whom believe that the end of days is within our lifetime, I would prefer a little doubt and uncertainty. We are on the way to a self-fulfilling prophecy with these people. The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a false definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the original false conception come 'true'. This specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.As for the question of whether this film entertains, that is irrefutable (or not). Cuts to various clips of explosions, and various religious films/cartoons are good and humorous but unfortunately undermine the film's tone from time to time and may affect how it's taken seriously by critics harsher than myself. Bill Maher began as a stand-up comedian, and makes numerous witty observations, jabs, and even plays a couple of hilarious pranks on the priest of a "cannabis religion". Many of the interviews are prime examples of an unstoppable object meeting an immovable force. But all roads lead to humor, as Maher quick-wittily cuts several people away at their feet. Is it easy? Very. Do they have it coming? God yes. For eons religion has had reign of the world, with uncountable atrocities done in the names of hundreds of deities. People have been unable to exhibit true free speech out of fear concerning religion because it almost universally operates under "Do what I say or I'll hurt you". If it looks like Maher is picking on religious people, it is only because it is easier to hack at the joints of a fallible system than it is to defend them. All Maher has to do is say "I don't know and neither do you". And that's extremely difficult to argue against.One of many great moments occurs when Bill, decked out in street cloths and silly glasses, tells the exact premise behind Scientology to a circle of pedestrians. He is laughed at, and given a balloon hat to wear. He also visits a Muslim gay bar, in one of several times when I feared for his safety. The place was empty for Cripes sake! What does that tell you about people's options for free speech? Finally, will this film succeed? Well, you can't force people to watch what they don't want to (unless you make a religion out of it) and unfortunately this film won't reach the religious audiences it hopes to help. I suspect that Religulous will get boycotted in many states, largely because many people disagree with Bill Maher and hate him. It's much harder to make a successful film denoting religion than it is to make one praising it. (nuff said concerning Fireproof) Even some that agree with him may dispute his techniques in this film. Some professional reviews I've read just seem to disguise their contempt for his message. But it's a valid point, and even if you dislike Bill (I don't) you can't argue with his message. How could anyone validly argue with uncertainty? Hilarious, scary, and provoking, Religulous gets an A.Now go and see it. Not because someone told you to, but because the world is in trouble. We need saving from ourselves.</fullReview>

Being someone of no particular faith (I am not an atheist and neither is Bill Maher) I found this movie to be very interesting. It definitely reaffirmed a lot of my beliefs already surrounding religion.Being raised Roman Catholic, I definitely was only told to view the world a certain way for quite some time.

		<shortDescription>well done movie -- both funny and upsetting at the same time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike Bill Maher, I am not an agnostic. Rather, I am a scientific materialist, a description that I found recently in reading Edward O. Wilson's "On Human Nature." Although I had already crossed the bridge from the agnostic to the atheist or Bright side of the a-religious ravine, Wilson's book, with its analysis of the evolutionary origins of, among other things, the human need to believe, heightened my comfort with my own conclusions about the nonexistence of a deity. Against this background, I found many things to laugh at and agree with in "Religulous." The friend with whom I saw the movie is not religious but is hopeful that there is an afterlife and clings to the notion that the positives in religion (comfort to the sick and bereaved; a source of moral and ethical guidelines) outweigh the negatives (the violence and bigotry that all faiths--except maybe the Jains--support to preserve and defend their myths). Throughout most of the movie, she was laughing and enjoying Maher's well done documentary. As the credits started to reel, however, I saw that she was crying. She was very upset by Maher's accurate summation of the threat to the world that religious belief poses (of course, she has a 17 year old son whom she loves dearly and she would like to believe that he has a future).The movie is well done and fair IF one is capable of any objectivity. The proofs that religious texts, particularly the Old and New Testaments, The Torah, the Koran and the Book of Mormon, etc. were written by men with their own agendas and no scientific or experiential basis for their writings were well presented and documented. Jesus was certainly a repackaging of earlier Egyptian and Mithraic gods intended to make co-opt the earlier faiths and to gain converts.In reading the reviews by other viewers, I noted a tendency for the so-called agnostics to lump people like me, whose lack of faith is not a creed, with atheists (for whom non-belief is a faith and who need to preach and convert) and religious extremists. To claim to agree with Maher or to be an agnostic and still believe in some kind of supernatural power and/or to practice rituals based on myths that science and reason have effectively dispatched as ridiculous is to support the extremists of one's particular faith. I wonder how many of the viewers in the theater, even those who applauded, had just finished their celebration of the Jewish holidays. How many will go to church on Easter to sing about the corporeal resurrection of the man named Jesus? How many of the 16% of non-believers cited by Maher cling to the vestiges of their mythology but talk about their respective scriptures as metaphorical?Maher apparently believes that people can be reasoned with and change their behavior (a belief he shares with other writers on the danger that religious belief poses to humanity and the earth--Sam Harris, e.g.). He is wrong. The need to believe is in our brain as what Wilson described as one of the "product(s) of genetic evolution by natural selection acting on human populations for hundreds of thousand of years in their ancient environments." Thus, religion is a subject that for most humans is beyond reason. They are genetically programmed to believe, were effectively brain-washed as children and do not have the strength or education or intellect or whatever to transcend their biology. And if the myth weren't a religious one, it would be a political one (Communism, Socialism, Nazism, Maoism) which is the same thing. We would still continue to kill one another based on unifying myths that we are genetically programmed to accept.Like the mockery of our presidential and vice-presidential candidates, this movie makes me laugh until I sit back and think of how serious it is in terms of the consequences for our nation and the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did you know there are actually anti-Jewis Jews? Its true. Anti-Zionist Jews they don't think that the Jerusalem Jews should inherit it because they have not been righteous enough, or maybe it's because they have not gone through enough tribulations (guess the holocaust was not good enough for them, or maybe they just didn't believe it happened).Did you know that there is actually a person with 100, 000 followers who claims to be the second coming of Christ? It's true. He claims to be a descendant of Jesus, or a reincarnation. He claims that when he was younger he was visited by two angels who told him it was his duty to be the second coming; however he also admits that if he was met by demons who told him he would be the anti-Christ he would do his best in that role too.Did you know that there are certain actions you can not do on the Sabbath that are punishable by death? It's true. Untying a knot, tying a knot, lighting a fire, animals can't work either, some people don't even have electricity in their houses on the Sabbath day. Some people have invented complex gadgets that could do these chores for them. All this because God supposedly rested on the Sabbath day.It's all "religulous". Even the basic foundations of the religion are strangely reminiscent of fairy tales, and just like fairy tales they get more complicated when you find out more about the original stories. Haven't you ever felt that the events in the bible were like fairy tales? You know; talking snake, walking on water, man made out of "dirt", humanity being cursed because they ate some fruit, someone's wife being turned into a pillar of salt for "looking back" after being told not to. And then there's that whole thing about going to hell simply for not believing. One thing I feel indebted to Bill Maher for is that he quoted that guy from the left behind movie misspeaking. I don't know his name I just know it's about time someone took a shot at him, even though I must say it was too brief. Let me explain why. It's because I was watching the religious channel and he was going to random people explaining to them that they were going to hell for the smallest reasons, such as looking at another woman with lust for her when they are already married... it's adultery in their hearts. Some people were brought to tears.Bill Maher's movie is his gift to humanity. It is a wake up call to us to drop these ridiculous beliefs keeping us in shackles for all these years. Unfortunately some people won't listen, and those that check out the movie might be turned of by Bill's smart ass remarks at the beginning. They are the reason I'm giving it a 9 instead of a 10. But I still liked it because I learned something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top-notch expose on religion in the nuclear age...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent comedy/documentary from Bill Maher and Director Larry Charles. I haven't heard a packed theater laugh in unison like this in a while. Essentially, it's just Bill traveling the world and asking a various assortment of religious peoples a wide array of questions concerning their specific beliefs, which are often contradictory and always absurd. In most cases, the answers and reactions are exactly what you expect; denial, anger, attempts at recusal... although we are treated to some surprising honesty, specifically when Bill visits the Vatican in Rome...or rather, after he gets kicked out of it, as well as some well-meaning near-illiterate folks who just agree to disagree.It's interesting to watch the reactions of officials at some of the American locations he visits, such as the bible-themed amusement park he visits in Orlando and the Mormon temple. They're on heightened alert or whatever code they signal each other with... In Invasion of the Body Snatchers they used a creepy, high-pitched scream. I KID the Body Snatchers! But seriously, the religious "officials" are creepy.Many of the interviews are intercut with some hilarious clips from various religious broadcast sermons, religious themed films, and cartoons. I was kind of hoping Bill might actually be able to track down Ted Haggard for an interview, but he does at least get a few clips. There was one clip that only I laughed at. In a moment where Bill is kind of poking fun at himself, he shows a quick clip from the 80's cult classic 'Cannibal Women in the Avacado Jungle of Death', in which he stars alongside Shannon Tweed. I love that movie.My only criticism is that Judaism, or perhaps more appropriately, Zionism, goes by virtually unscathed with Bill innocently questioning a Rabbi about the strange Sabbath rituals forbidding certain activities with the punishment of death, and another obnoxious Rabbi who is very EXTREMELY opposed to Zionism, but he all-together ignores the pervasive, oppressive and largely destructive role Israel has played in the Middle East since its establishment by the U.N. in 1948, which has been somewhat akin to the notion of "manifest destiny" which the Europeans used as the excuse to wipe out most of the Native Americans while colonizing North America. The byproduct of which is much of the terrorism we now see today targeted at countries that show unwavering support of Israel. This isn't surprising considering his interview on Real Time with Michael Scheuer, though, as well as the 'anti-semitic' stigma stuck upon anyone who dares mention this flagrant hypocrisy. I personally find Israel's idea of "implied ownership" or "divine right" to be a completely baseless, exclusive, supremacist ideology, really no different than the sense of entitlement shared by Christians who worship the Biblical character Yaweh, who supposedly granted them this divine right. He does cover Israel's slightly more insane opposition, Islam, at great length though...That somewhat understandable omission aside, Bill's knowledge of the subject of religion as it relates to factual history is comprehensive, and it far exceeds most of the the people he interviews. The documentary takes on a more ominous tone toward the ending, and then Bill's final message at Megido, supposedly the place of Christ's return at the prophesied, though some Biblical scholars would say mistranslated, Second Coming (and also the setting of a great scene from 'The Omen' [1976]), is outright terrifying... and it drives the film's message home in a way that is clear, concise, but above all, correct. Religious fundamentalism, state-sanctioned end-of-the-world theology, and nuclear weapons just don't mix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biased and cheap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher is clearly a man who hated what Catholicism had to say to him when he was a young boy and has spent a lifetime mocking and denigrating Christians and Christianity in an effort to make himself feel better and gather like-minded people around him to reinforce his agenda.This isn't a serious documentary with genuine questions: rather, it's an exercise in mockery.Maher deliberately chooses interviewees who are most vulnerable to ridicule. If he can't ridicule them immediately, then he uses snide diversions ("Look at that!" he says to the ex-Jew for Jesus, pointing to an angel figurine, while his subject is five seconds into answering Maher's question. "Expensive, isn't it?") He chooses individuals who aren't articulate and sharp-witted and capable of providing intelligent and insightful answers to his crude questions. I get the sense that many of his subjects were unprepared for the kind of questions they'd have to answer, but were misled about the thrust of the interviews.Islam is given far less attention than Christianity, the real target of his campaign. Using simplistic straw-men, he demeans and mocks his subjects - or has the movie edited to create this effect - with the clear aim of arguing that religion is dangerous and all those who follow religion are morons.It's interesting to note that Maher never interviews missionaries who help third world communities to rise above poverty or Christian orphanages in third and second world countries that save street-children from becoming life-long sex-slaves. You don't see him interview people from all walks of life who have had out-of-body or near-death experiences. Maher takes no real leap of courage and instead concentrates on religious believers who live in their own small world.In short, Maher is not asking genuine questions at all, but just using the religious as the pi?ata of his jokes. Very low blow, Bill Maher. Very cheap.The only thing this shoddy piece of journalistic film-making proves is that Maher is easily as much - if not more - a bigot and zealot as those he interviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Maher's voice is needed in this age of extremism. I agree with much of his premise stated in this movie that religion does more harm than good. I too am afraid of mixing religion and politics. I too think that extremists may very well bring our world to an untimely end.It is too bad, though, that Mr. Maher has too much ego and cynicism and not enough journalistic sense. In this movie he goes after the easy targets: extremists, nut cases, idiots and the obvious inconsistencies of the major religious writings. If he was a serious journalist he would be interviewing the very brightest of spiritual minds and trying to tackle some of the more complex spiritual questions and events throughout the ages. As his comedic background suggests, he goes after the easy laugh. Yet in his egoistic stance, he believes we should take him seriously.Mr. Maher uses his key line "you do not possess mental powers that I do not," at least twice in this movie. This is an inexcusable and lame excuse for his conclusions. It is so weak it makes all of his questions into the area of religion suspect. He thinks he is as smart as anybody. He thinks that if he hasn't had an experience then it isn't possible to have that experience. He thinks that if you don't think the way he does then you are an idiot. This puts him in the same category as his political polar opposite Bill O'Reilly ? a half-way intelligent, bombastic know-it-all who can't be trusted to give you an honest and impartial report on whatever topic he is looking into. He's too busy protecting his ego and going for the laugh.Mr. Maher also likes to say, "I don't know." But then he follows that up with, "since I don't know, you can't know either." What? That is so absurd that it almost seems like a set-up line to a joke. I don't even think it is necessary to make a long list of all the great minds throughout history much less those of the last 100 years that Bill Maher could not hold a candle to. He is certainly not going to take on someone who is going to make him look the fool which should not be too difficult. In this movie he goes for the easy mark so he can give the sideways look into the camera and give us the wink or the ironic smile. Always the comedian and rarely the serious journalist.The topic of this movie is very serious. It is too bad that Bill Maher has wasted much of his opportunity to really make a meaningful statement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a documentary where comedian Bill Maher goes around talking to people of different faiths trying to find out why they believe what they believe. Bill does not preach that there is no god, he simply speaks of how he hasn't gotten enough proof to believe in anything. He points out how ridiculous many faiths are and how the most amazing things in religion are taken so serious even though it is just simply not proved, often extremely outrageous and fantastic and how people live and die by their faiths.I for one am an atheist, and I have no problem with religion when you keep it to yourself and don't try to judge people or throw your righteousness in peoples face. I do however think religion is the cause of all the hate, all the wars and all of the stupidity men face. If there were no religion and we lived as one, life would still be bad and we'd still face things we face, but on a much smaller scale.This movie talks to Christians, catholics, Jews, Muslims and many others. It talks to people who are scientists, and politicians, and preachers and all sorts. It touches the subject of evolution vs. religion. It touches on things like homosexuality and contradictions in the bible. It touches on religion as a hate breeder in 99 percent of the cases.I found the movie to be funny and informative, but I found it held back a lot of times. Bill didn't care to speak his mind and to spit his sarcasm, but he also seems to have held back a lot. I found more offensive material in Larry Charles' Borat movie, than here. I mean I guess Bill and Larry wanted it to seem balanced, but I wanted a much more raw and honest documentary which really harassed and ripped apart religious values and this movie didn't do that. I do think it is good and should be watched by EVERYONE.6/10 stars for at least attempting to show how stupid religion is and how it hurts more than helps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An On Demand Miracle for Bill Maher ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to see Bill Maher going round in the first half of the movie, trying to prove that what most people believe to be holy scriptures are nothing more than just man made text; It's also interesting to note that from Billy M's perspective a man sticking his glass out of the window and asking God for rain and it actually raining would still be a coincidence. For him a miracle constitutes something more improbable or impossible like chocolate frogs raining from the sky, or actual frogs for that matter... So going back to my first point bout scriptures being nothing more than man made texts, I would like to ask: God mentions in the Qur'an, that as long as this world lasts he'll personally make sure that his word is always kept in its original form.Over 1400 years and 1,500,000,000 people later they're still on the same book.

		<shortDescription>A funny documentary with lots of good points, but just a tad one sided....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religulous was a good documentary.It was funny, it keep me interested, and Bill makes some good points. Religion is indeed ridiculous when it comes down to it, but I felt the film was one sided...Bill chose perhaps the most retarded group of religious people to interview, and sit's and turns them into fools and ridicules their faith.Bill didn't go to anyone who could hold their own in a religious debate, which in a sense, is propaganda that ALL religious people or anyone with a personal faith are dumb backwoods hicks.The film ends with him stating that religion is the #1 cause of all evil on earth and if we all get rid of it, we'll finally have world peace...I found this message to be quite ignorant. Sure, let's get rid of religion, people will just find another stupid reason to kill each other. Humanity is a violent and war obsessed species, and we'll find fight with each over anything, religion just happens to be one of big ones...With that all said, this is a very good film with lot's of great points (the comparison between the story of Jesus and the the handful amounts of ancient God's was eye opening).In the end, this film probably won't change anyones opinions. Atheists, Agnostics, and just irreligious people in general will get a kick out of this, and the religious people will most likely be heavily offended. But hey, that's the point :D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this was certainly an interesting documentary.Bill Maher stars as himself,as he goes on sort of a journey to different places both in America and abroad,where the people have different religions.most of the big religions are skewered equally.i like the fact that Maher doesn't play favourites.he also says what he means,which is refreshing.he brings up a lot of thought provoking questions,most of them valid,and he's also funny.if you do belong to one of the big religions in the world,this might not be your cup of tea.if you're on the fence about joining a religion,this probably won't make your decision any easier.if you're not affiliated with any of the big religions,you will probably really enjoy this documentary.i give Religulous an 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Good For What It Was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher travels the world, talking with figures from a variety of faiths. Letting them share their views, he asks pointed questions and delivers a scathing attack on religion as a whole, arguing that it has done far more harm than good and that religious beliefs are by and large silly (or "ridiculous", as the title implies).Be aware that this film is only a "documentary" in the sense that it's interviews of real people. Little effort is provided to be fair and balanced -- Maher intends to make religious people look foolish, and does a fine job of accomplishing this feat. No serious defense of religion is offered. Mysteriously, the best point made -- one that even stuns Maher -- comes from an actor rather than any religious scholar or theologian, when the triune god is compared to the forms of water.Some aspects of the film are refreshing. The Catholic priests offer a very liberal Bible interpretation, focusing on metaphor and accepting the teachings of Darwin. The interview with Mark Pryor, American senator, will probably come back to haunt him. Other segments were funny or at least informative. Surprisingly, I thought, the humor was more mild as a whole than Maher's usual antics. He did joke around some, but this was not the focus.Besides being anti-religious, the film showed an odd pro-Israel, pro-Jew bias, I found. Odd simply because I wouldn't expect Maher to come from this angle. When a rabbi attempted to defend Iran's president, he was shut down by Maher for being nuts. Specifically, the rabbi wanted to correct Maher's assertion that Iran's leader called for Israel to be "wiped from the map". Many notable scholars, including Juan Cole, have attempted to correct the mainstream media on this. That Maher would accept the media's claims without even hearing a dissenting voice seemed out of character. Maher, of all people, knows what it's like to have an unpopular viewpoint and understands the importance of freedom of speech.If you enter this film being aware that Maher's presenting a one-sided film, you'll appreciate it. If you agree with him, or at least have an open mind, you'll likely find some humor in it. Other reviews have commented on how one faith may find the other faiths presented in a humorous way, but not their own. I think this is likely true. I am not of any of the faiths presented and found them all humorous, or at least odd. If this was Maher's goal, and I think it was, he succeeded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Serious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would give this a 8 as a comedy and a 2 as a documentary so I stick to the 5. Religulous was funny but as a serious documentary supposed to seek for the facts and find the truth its a plain joke here are the 10 commandments used to make this: 1- Gather a bunch of dumb/lunatics (exclude the wise or the articulate)2- Catch them totally unprepared (never tell them what you gonna ask before the interview because getting decent answers is not the objective). 3- Show an arrogant attitude always try to ridicule them and don't ever let them speak if they start to make some sense. And of course, lie or distort facts anytime it fits your interest. 4- Exclude any religion like Buddhism/Hinduism that can actually challenge you in any rational debate. 5- Always focus on the most irrelevant and odd parts of the bible (never focus on the message) 6- Add any kind of video or sound effects that would make them look even more ridiculous7- Delete any conversation or any part of an interview when they actually make some sense or they look any less ridiculous. 8- After you manipulate everything just for the sake of making your point in a great and spotless fashion end up telling people is time to grow up and act like the Saviour of the world. 9- Cash Out your check and spend the money on Amsterdam Coffe Shops.10- Collect the awards from the atheist community and get praised by all the "intelectually advanced" people of this world (not me).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what it says on the tin: Ridicule religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title should have given me a clue: Religulous - a mash of ridiculous and religion.Almost the entirety of the movie involves Maher setting up cheap gags to embarrass and ridicule his interviewees. It wasn't funny, it wasn't informative, and I really can't fathom why it has such high scores.I have no love for organised religion, but I am always open to intelligent discussion. Apparently Maher is only open to being a smart alec. Many of the interviewees seemed chosen specifically for the comedy value and it was a rare treat to see sensible religious figures. I especially enjoyed the discussion with the Vatican astronomer and I'm greatly disappointed that there weren't more like this.I understand that the goal of the movie was to highlight some of the ridiculous religious beliefs that still persist in the modern world, but the message loses much weight when presented alongside Maher's own views. At the beginning of the movie he says he preaches "I don't know." Yet later he's claiming he does know, he's right and they are wrong.Quite frankly, the summary at the end is the best part of the movie. It's a very strong message backed up by powerful imagery, but for me it lost a lot of potency after watching Maher's antics for 90minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will give this documentary 2 stars because it was funny.. thats it.. I thought this documentary would be enlightening, perhaps even answering a few questions, but all it did was make fun of religion.. I am an agnostic. What really hurts is that Bill Maher an atheist turned agnostic goes on about how religion sucks and its evil but doesn't realize that even he is an extremist much like some of the people he makes fun of...Sure he may not bomb a place or kill anyone.. but he always has the view that religion is stupid and only ignorant people believe in it.. There are ignorant people and there are stupid people.. No one can do anything about it, just the way the world is.. When you're tackling a subject such as religion you should always provide both sides...the perceived bad and the perceived good..There are a lot of nut jobs in religion but then there are a lot of kind hearted,intelligent people too... The truly religious people know and understand the metaphors in the holy books, they never take it literally..They believe in leading a life where you help your fellow person and do everything in their power to avoid hurting another person... Any real atheist or agnostic would find this docu distasteful..In reality most extremists of any religion are people who were not given the choice of free thinking, they were brainwashed from an early age to believe in so and so and only to live life in a certain way.. We human beings unfortunately have to be force fed into a particular way of thinking.. We can never think for ourselves, we have to be taught how to by a parent or by elders.. Ignorance breeds extremists..not religion.. If religion wasn't there, people would find something else to latch on to with their crazy beliefs. Instead of ridiculing religion and forcing people to accept your views by only showing the stupid parts and add to it a little bit of clever but obvious editing.. Some shots you can clearly see that the idiocy shown was not created while shooting but in the post production lab.. show both the sides and let people think for themselves..Isn't that what you always say..People accept things without questioning them..well you're not exactly following your own advice, are you Bill Maher? Watch this documentary if you want to laugh a lil.. But if you think this is a serious documentary..then you better go look elsewhere...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a celebrity and film that represents my point of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The amazing thing watching Bill Maher on his Real Time show and in this film is not to find someone who shares my life philosophy (agnosticism), but someone who actually comes out and says it loudly and clearly.As Bill Maher points out in the movie, 16% of Americans are non-religious, a very large minority. About time this minority got their message out! Now to actually talk about the movie. I thought Bill Maher did a good job of exposing how patently ridiculous the tenets of so many religions are if you really think about them in an objective fashion. The beliefs of the REALLY out there religions like Mormonism and Scientology are not that much more wacky than mainstream religions. They are all fairy tales! In the case of Scientology, we actually know for sure why and how the religion was created (to win a bet with fellow science fiction writers).I subtracted one star because he uses the one tactic I despise in documentaries, which is editing in footage of people he is ridiculing in unflattering moments, such as testing their mikes or putting on make-up. Michael Moore did this in Fahrenheit 9/11, and it's a cheap gimmick to automatically sap the authority of a person.I think overall Bill Maher succeeds in making his points in the movie, such as the fact that so many religions are designed to further the goals and expand the power of the religion.I don't think the movie is anti-God, it's anti-religion. That's a big distinction because I don't think Bill Maher is a gnostic atheist, he's clearly agnostic.There were some moments in the movie that I thought were actually thought provoking, such as the interviews with the Catholic priests, and some religious people articulated their views in interesting ways.Overall, the movie was funny, thought provoking, and quite cathartic for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bible Borat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religulous isn't as much a documentary as it is Bible Borat. Bill Maher isn't researching or objectively examining the history of religion; as such, anyone expecting the film to meet the basic criteria of documentary film-making will be disappointed. It's more undercutting and opinionated than even the most passionate work of Michael Moore. But Maher's finest attribute, from his days as a stand-up comic to his late-night talk shows, has always been his smarmy, self-assured pseudo-intellectualism ? we're never quite convinced that he's nearly as smart as he thinks he is, but that's okay, because it's part of his act, which happens to be extremely funny. Whether or not you agree with Maher is irrelevant, because half the fun is seeing the rise he gets out of people with his very presence. (In one of the film's most amusing segments, a "Holy Land amusement park" manager interrupts an interview Maher is conducting with a fake Jesus to chew out an employee for not alerting her of Maher's presence in advance, "because of the type of movies he makes.")Much of the humour in Religulous is rooted in the same awkward social contrasts as Borat, which was also directed by Larry Charles. It's situation comedy at its finest.If anything, Religulous is more consistent, because it is spared the great disservice of introducing a tiresome theatrical subplot for its last act (remember how old the whole Pam Anderson thing got in the other movie?). This film approaches its content as a documentary, without a narrative tacked on, which incidentally makes it far more engaging.Most of Religulous is spent with Charles and his crew following Maher around America as he interviews various everyday people of religious faith. The first half of the film is centered on Christianity, with Maher interrupting a truck stop church service to do Q&amp;A with its followers, and eventually interviewing an "ex-gay" man who runs a center to help "cure" the sin of homosexuality for its clients. Maher has great fun pointing out how silly the whole thing is ? even going so far as to tell the reformed homosexual that he still looks rather gay. "You're handsome and clean, not at all like me," Maher explains. "If I saw you in a bar, I'd think, That guy looks gay." His subject finally starts to catch on to the sarcasm midway through the interview.Some of the laughs are cheap, to be sure. In fact, almost all of them are. And there's no denying that Maher pushes some of his willing participants way too far (the "ex-gay" man being one of them). You almost begin to feel sorry for them, because they exhibit a great deal of patience and respect for their interrogator ? except for one or two people towards the end of the film (one of them being a Jewish radical who attended a holocaust denial conference with the French president, who rambles endlessly, refusing to let Maher intervene until he eventually just gets up and walks out). Bill Maher interviews Fake Jesus #1Maher has a habit of undermining his subjects with sarcastic subtitles, amusing video clips or out-of-context segments (for example, after interviewing the "fake" Jesus at the Holy Land theme park, we immediately cut to footage of a crucifixion re-enactment that the park apparently stages every day, showing the previously interviewed Fake Jesus stumbling towards a Fake Cross, being whipped by a Fake Roman Guard, as an active audience of tourists applauds, many of them moved to tears. The applause is quite obviously inter-cut from other moments and not synchronous with what is being shown to us ? especially not as Fake Jesus mounts the Fake Cross, when the camera cuts to a crowd of people cheering ? but manipulative editing makes these moments more overtly humorous and ironic; it's very poor form for a documentary, sure, but it certainly gives Charles' film an acidic bite and is a perfect accessory to Maher's acrimony).The movie's first half contains more laughs than the second (which is when Maher begins globe-trotting). I'm not sure if this is because Maher finds it easier (and, hence, funnier) to antagonize Christians as opposed to, say, Muslims, or if it's the language barriers he encounters, or if it's just because the second half becomes a lot preachier and bogged-down with dramatics (the last five minutes are either self-consciously bad or just plain bad).Regardless, the film is very entertaining, and ? in spite of what some may consider to be a poor approach to documentary film-making ? ends up being one of the better comedies I've seen this year; one that doesn't necessarily raise a balanced discussion, but a discussion nonetheless.</fullReview>

He harasses a Rabbi for believing that the Arab inhabitants of modern-day Israel deserved to keep their land before the Zionists arrived. He actually walks out of the interview because the Rabbi disagrees with him.He harasses a Muslim woman, and claims that Islam considers non-believers inferior, or even worthy of death, when Judaic texts claim basically the same thing. He harasses the same woman for believing the texts should be intepreted in light of modern events and that perhaps the harsher passages should be reinterpreted- when Judaism has consistently done the same thing.I as an atheist have no stake in this issue but I was disappointed that Bill showed little regard for reconsideration of what he obviously believed prior to this filming.And seriously- two out of two didn't find this review useful? More like two people had an agenda that didn't agree with my review.

Maher's "revelation" that the Bible cribbed from prior existing texts comes as no surprise to those of us familiar with ancient mythology. Perhaps the most egregious omission, when it comes to the self-appointed self-anointed, is that quintessential con man cum mass murderer, Jim Jones.

		<fullReview>Comedian-cum-pundit Bill Maher, the son of a Jewish mother and a Catholic father, never labels himself an atheist or an agnostic in the course of this questioning-religion documentary, which he also produced--could be why the finished results seem smirking rather than cutting edge. Bill rankles some feathers (i.e., egos) when challenging devout Christians and their followers on the "fairy tales" in the Bible, but that's about as angry as the movie gets. It's too blobby to make much an impact, and unnecessarily padded with movie and news clips (and nastily prodding subtitles in tiny white print) used strictly as punchlines. Standing on hallowed ground in Israel, Maher says, "The Book of Revelations says God has the capacity to end the world...but today, man does too." He sees the irony of this and other statements, but doesn't allow us to revel in the humor of it. Interviewing his slightly-comfortable subjects, Bill Maher complains about the content inherent in the Ten Commandments, the mismatch of the Old and New Testaments, the insanity of religious profiteering and, that old argument-causing standby, Evolution vs. Creationism, all the while preaching the gospel of I Don't Know. Challenging topics, to be sure, and yet the film isn't challenging. Maher, who must always have the last word, doesn't give us good debates, and at one point includes a not-cleverly edited montage of defensive believers chanting "no, no, no." The thrust of the film--that people will defend their own religion, their own beliefs, to outsiders no matter how ridiculous their arguments--is very amusing, but would be much more so if we could actually hear what they're saying. The sound quality of this documentary is lousy, it looks terrible...and just because Maher is a quick-thinker, a fast-on-his-feet raconteur, this does not make him a charismatic host. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Mahers Religulous is the most offensive documentary I have ever seen. The whole film is based on following the man around while he bashes on different and mostly extreme religious groups. I was raised catholic but I am not religious. I understand first hand how crazy it can come off but is that any reason to run around falsifying everyone's beliefs? Faith is a powerful tool, capable of erasing a trouble past or providing a reason to live on, but Maher somehow thinks he has the right to mock those with it anyways. What I find even sillier is the fan base this film has developed. People love watching others get put down. It's a sad truth about American culture but I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon. In my mind, a bunch of Atheist must get a hard on seeing someone oppose all the beliefs that have been thrown in their face over the years. Its no secret that no one should have religion forced on them but in this country it doesn't ever happen outside of a household. And if it does, nothings stopping you from walking away. We have it made compared to countries where people die every day for not conforming. If someone gets in your face about god, feel free to happily tell him or her off. But innocent people practicing in their small town churches and minding their own business should be left to do so. This county was founded on religious freedom and although many religions have their issues and radical tendencies, no one should be put down for what they choose to believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Need for Better Discourse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film, both as a non believer and as a fan of Bill Maher and . The film is ultimately a large disappointment as it's too flippant to possibly convert any believers and not funny enough to warrant repeat viewings from secularists. The most unfortunate realization regarding this film came when I watched Ben Stein's cinematic abortion Expelled. While Stein's film is an abomination it uses a lot of the same cinematic techniques as Religulous. The open ridicule of interview subjects and intersplicing of archive footage was almost exactly the same in both films. Ultimately, it's a shame that both these films should fill the same spot for their respective positions. At least Religulous operates openly as a comedy.If Maher had simply produced the last ten minutes of the film as a special comment appended to an episode of Real Time it'd be worthwhile but the preceding content is mostly useless and unfunny. Speaking of "Real Time," his interviews on that show are almost universally more intelligent and much, much funnier than those contained within the film. I keep waiting for the Michael Moore style of documentary to die out as it's mostly a plight on any attempt at intelligent cinema. While I applaud the level of intelligence that "Real Time" brings to late night television, Religulous is a festering boil on the taint of documentary cinema.Rationalism is best promoted by increasing the level of public discourse. This does nothing for the cause and provides few laughs in the interim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning of his documentary, Bill Mayer lets us know that he wants to cast doubt on religion. As an atheist he interviews religious people and asks about dubious subjects in their religion. He expects people to explain why they believe certain things. Yet, he doesn't have an open mind himself. He discards almost every topic as ridiculous.Someone who wants to cast doubt on should take an objective perspective and give reasons to doubt religion. Mayer doesn't do this at all. He just tries to make fun of people and their religions as he is talking with them. I don't think this is a very good or respectful approach. Even though I don't believe in God or Allah, I still respect people who do and I respect their religions. It seems to me that Mayer doesn't do this.If it makes people feel better to believe in something, why shouldn't they? Even if it is ridiculous. This documentary focuses to much on the negative side of religion. But this doesn't make the things Mayer says untrue. Indeed some things that people believe are ridiculous, but Mayer shouldn't laugh at them right in their face.Even though his approach is a little disrespectful, Mayer did make me laugh and I enjoyed watching the documentary. Also the editing was done well and made me laugh a couple of times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Religulous had the potential to be a great film, a provoking documentary, a conversation starter. And it fell far short of all that. I finished this film disappointed that all it basically amounted to was -ironically- 2 hours of preaching to the converted.I'm an atheist, so this was probably aimed at me. And I should have known that with a name like Religulous, it probably wasn't out to get religious people thinking critically about their faith. Quite simply though, this film is useless. It didn't entertain me to watch Bill Maher have the same conversation with 20 different people, each amounting to nothing. He would simply talk to someone until they said something ridiculous, then cut to him travelling to the next nutjob.Let me clarify that there were a lot of crazy beliefs in this film, and I agreed with none of them. And Bill Maher's arguments for atheism were all pretty spot on. But any atheists watching will know those arguments already, and any religious people watching this will have just felt alienated, ridiculed, and worse, they'll have been offered no alternative. And ridiculing someone is a great way to cemented their opinions. So this movie helped no one. If anything, it's strengthened a few people's faiths.Not that Bill Maher cares; that means more people to mock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill 'Meh'-er</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a former fan of Bill Maher's stand-up comedy--having seen his "Victory Begins At Home" live on Broadway and read his fictionalized account of being a stand-up in the eighties--I have to say, more recently, he has been a disappointment. Somewhere along the line Larry King mistook him for a serious pundit and he mistook Larry King for a serious journalist. Ever since, Maher has been taking himself increasingly too serious for a comedian. Why he even tries to maintain the comedian moniker is beyond me. So he can say anything he wants and toss it off as a joke? Probably. (When any audience member would groan at his Broadway show, he would counter with something like, "Pull the stick out of your ass, it's comedy.") I am not religious but I have known many religious people of all beliefs and denominations. I believe that faith probably stops as much aggression as it does incite hatred. Buddhists, for example, in modern times, have generally stuck to a peaceful path. In the film, Maher is clearly on the lookout for the most extreme and laughable folk he can find, which would be well suited to a comedy, if Religulous were actually trying to be a comedy. It is evident, by the end, however, that it is actually intended to be a sermon. Too bad, because in my mind, if you are a "comedian" you can get away with making a joke about coming out of a tuna and smelling like "p****." But if you make that joke in a film in which you are seriously trying to call people of another group misogynists (as in the Muslim discussion) then you muddy the waters with just a slight bit of hypocrisy. Of course Bill, your misogyny is just comedy not tied to any scripture. But guess what? Just as many men who want to physically or emotionally degrade women, can be just as inspired to do so by your fishy genitalia joke as they can by a skewed or outdated interpretation of a historical text. And in this film you are putting yourself in a position of authority so they can degrade women AND believe that an intelligent person agrees with them on the issue.And the side note about 93% of Scientists not believing in God? That was also irksome. Were they the scientists who were paid to say that global warming didn't exist or at least not as a result of the burning of fossil fuels? Were they the scientists who said a few years ago that a glass of red wine a day was good for you? Were they the scientists who last week said that a glass of red wine a day can actually cause cancer? My point being that scientists release conflicting studies every other week. Indeed, there may be no God/gods or even "Intelligent Design" but if you base your argument on the beliefs of scientists then you are trying to replace God/gods with a field of study that is riddled with just as much doubt, conflict and corruption as religion. I would really like it if Bill Maher meditated a little before he spoke again. At least if he is really wants to be serious.</fullReview>

He actually explains that this is the reason why Friedrich Nietzsche spent his last days living in an asylum and thinking he was God Himself.Well, I am a big fan of Bill Maher's show on HBO, but knowing how cocky he is and where he stands on religious issues, I was not surprised with my disappointment regarding his movie.I am virtually agnostic, I am pro-choice, in favor of gay marriage, I believe that moralism (I am not talking about morality) is a cancer, and that the one of the worst things that ever happened to this country was to have a president who claimed to hear the voice of God.I agree that there are the likes of ultra-conservative Patrick Robertson; there are ministers who exploit the faith of naive people, pedophile priests who prey on altar boys, hypocrites such as Ted Haggard, the deranged Muslims that threw planes at the Twin Towers and kids that tie C4 tablets around their bellies to explode buses in Tel Aviv. I despise the evangelicals that bombed abortion clinics in the US, the fanatics who think they have a divine right over a piece of land regardless of the wellbeing of who was living there for nearly 2000 years, Jim Jones, The Inquisition, The Crusades and the witch-hunts. It upsets me deeply when religious people try to micromanage someone's sexual life and I hate the fact that they want to control what I can see, hear and read on the media. Yes, and I am quite angry at the LDS Church for interfering on the voting of prop 8 here in California.However, it's just fair to say that during the course of my life I had the pleasure to meet and talk with priests, rabbis, ministers and all sort of spiritual leaders or followers who were nothing but intelligent, open-minded and well-informed and I simply cannot deny that there're people such as Martin Luther King, Mother Teresa, Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, the priests who fought for human rights in Latin America during the cold war, etc, people who lived their lives for others without asking for something in return and often died for it. Really, nobody can convince me that a nun who spend her life locked in a convent praying for humankind or a monk meditating atop a mountain in Tibet are dangerous to our liberties and I wouldn't like to live in a society without freedom of religion.At its substance, Maher's movie is a lame attempt to show how clever he is and how he can outsmart some humble folk in a small country church, a store owner or an actor playing Jesus on a theme park. The movie is a display of intolerance and arrogance simply aimed at proving that God does not exist and that we should worship Bill instead. It misses the point and a great opportunity to raise some important questions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the worst film about religion. But this guy doesn't even have an open-minded approach. He basically goes to all these people who are actually open minded and listen to his criticism but not in order to learn, its to bash. I am not a religious person, but i do believe that religion brings a lot of good and solidarity in people(i don't expect an American to understand this because of what Christianity has become over there). Pretty much everything this guy said, i doubted, he takes all his knowledge as absolute, like the gay gene... he said or implied it was proved... its not... and he was calling everyone ignorant. This man has a mediocre mind at best, and i think he inspires the younger audience that are so easily led astray. I can only recommend this movie if you are fan of the Bill Maher, otherwise, theists will find nothing new to reflect upon and atheists won't find any new arguments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Give Maher That Old-Time Religion As He Spreads the Gospel of Doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scabrous political satirist Bill Maher states that 16% of the country identify themselves as secular humanists who don't believe in God. It is to this group which he targets with this 2008 diatribe against organized religion. In the process, Maher actually makes Michael Moore appear comparatively subtle and fair-minded when it comes to making provocative documentaries. There is a passing similarity to approach with Moore's "Fahrenheit 911" and "Sicko", but the tone here reflects even greater hubris and more outward comedy given the polarizing subject. The tone should come as no surprise since Maher recruited Larry Charles to direct, the man who helmed the fish-out-of-water mockumentary hit "Borat" and several episodes of HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm". Like the set-up of "Borat", this film has Maher talking to regular people and making fun of them in alternately clever and condescending ways. To some degree, it's difficult to watch the film without feeling sorry for these poor individuals who just happened to have stumbled in front of the camera.What offsets the attitude is Maher's dead-serious intent in spreading the gospel of doubt. The film follows him on a globetrotting series of interviews with various representatives of the Western religious faiths - the Vatican, the Holy Land, Salt Lake City where the Mormon Church is headquartered, a Christian-themed amusement park in Orlando, and even a truckers' church in the Bible Belt. Maher even interviews his own mother in the Catholic church he attended as a child in order to discuss why he didn't find out she was Jewish until his teen years. Some of the brief segments are quite entertaining like the no-nonsense opinions expressed by Father Reginald Foster, a Catholic priest, senior Vatican scholar and the Pope's principal Latinist. Others are subject of justified derision like Jos Luis de Jess Miranda, the pompous founder of an international Ministry in Miami, and Pastor Jerry Cummings, a former member of Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes and the leader of the Amazing Life World Outreach congregation in North Carolina. Probably the most intriguing person interviewed is Senator Mark Pryor (R-Arkansas), an avowed creationist who calmly defends his beliefs to Maher's constant haranguing by admitting that "you don't have to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate".For the most part, Maher lets his subjects talk freely but ultimately forces them to answer why they hold onto beliefs that cannot be proved empirically. Much like his HBO show, "Real Time with Bill Maher", he talks plainly and fearlessly; but unlike his show where he parries with celebrity pundits of equal or greater stature, he receives responses that range from indifference to anger to a complete shutdown in acknowledging Maher's way of thinking. The latter holds especially true in a scene with a fundamentalist, a formerly gay man married to a former lesbian and now dedicated to converting gays. This approach also points to the film's biggest drawback, that Maher didn't choose subjects who could engage him in a more spirited debate that could make him reconsider his position if only for a single scene. The use of old footage from the movies works intermittently as comic relief between the sometimes heavy-handed interviews, but I think Maher and Charles could have done without them. Even less necessary is Maher's angry closing monologue about the dangers of mixing religion and politics since he loses his sense of humor to underline his seriousness about this topic. This documentary feature is a worthwhile viewing experience but just falls short as a thoughtful rebuke against organized religion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Themes of Religulous (IMHO)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no surprise that a few people are curious about this movie - You've got to expect that when Bill Maher dedicates an entire feature-length film to religion that it will at very least be "interesting".The movie covers a hand full of different religions, starting with Christianity, and then moving through Islam, Mormonism and Scientology with a brief stop in "Canthiesm" (a set of beliefs apparently based on the smoking of Marijuana). The movie was pretty funny and there were a few major themes that I walked away with: 1) Religious beliefs are generally varied, and are often based on some pretty wild stuff. Regardless of the religion, you can find things like Jonah and the whale (or fish), parting seas, virgin births, etc. It's certainly not a feature unique to Christianity, but these teachings require some serious imagination if taken literally (see item #4) 2) It is more than a little presumptuous to think that your religion is the "right one" and the others are wrong. The assertion here is that strict adherence to any religion's teachings would directly dispute the teachings of other religions that don't believe the same thing. The "if we have different positions that are in conflict, we can't all be right" argument.3) Double standards abound. It is interesting as Maher talks to people from different religions that some things appear to be "OK" for them to do, but not for those of other faiths. For example, Maher interviews a militant Muslim rapper who considers his violent lyrics free speech, but doesn't think that right extends to folks like Salman Rushdie in his criticisms of Islam.4) Literal interpretation of religious texts is probably not a good idea. Here, Maher interviews a very interesting guy who used to be the head of the Vatican observatory (George Coyne, I think). Coyne points out that the Bible cannot have any consideration for, or reference to, science because science as we know it did not exist until relatively recently (long after the period when the bible was written) 5) There is no allowance in most religious texts for the accumulation of wealth (especially by religious figures). Despite much discussion to the contrary in the New Testament, many churches and religious leaders have "found peace" with becoming very wealthy through ministry, though that notion is in conflict with the core tenets of religious teachings.6) Religious texts allow for violence toward "non believers" or "infidels". Correct or incorrect, these references ares frequently used as justification to commit violent acts.In summary, the movie is a position statement about religion that may offend many devout religious followers. For that reason, I would not recommend this movie for people who are set in their religious beliefs and not open to dissenting opinion. To atheists, agnostics, or religious people who are still "searching" or who can otherwise tolerate counterpoint, I think the movie is very worthwhile and entertaining. I could actually see watching this movie with the Pastor of my old church back in Bentonville, AR. I think it would generate a lot of good debate with him, and he was never afraid to talk about other religions or to challenge his own beliefs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was such a waste of time!!!! All it does is give old Billy a soapbox to stand on to give his own personal opinion about "religion". It is painfully obvious to see that there was A LOT of editing done to his favor and in my opinion, I don't think he interviewed one "normal" person on the whole show. Then, I think my "favorite" part was the ending with him ranting like he had made this huge scientific breakthrough or something and showing images of nuclear explosions, prominent church leaders and Muslims to somehow tie it all together or something. Anyone with any kind of sense can see that he tailored all the little clips he showed from his interviews to fit exactly the way he wanted them to. Not to mention his selection of the "top of the food chain" for his interviews. I am a Christian and I am willing to discuss any of the topics that he "in his own mind" proved to be all a big hoax with anyone. Let's not forget people, Bill is a comedian, not a scholar or something and I think he needs to stick to making people laugh because he is only a genius in his own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A call to action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film on its opening day, Friday, and I was greatly impressed. But I should first qualify my stand: I'm a former Christian turned atheist and the author of the book Christian No More, which I wrote in hopes of forwarding the cause of atheism. Does that bias my review? Perhaps, considering I'm in agreement with Bill Maher on the topic.But I went into the movie a little unsure of what to expect: Would it be a rational breakdown of what exactly is wrong with religion? Or would it be just a comedy making fun of religious people? As the movie progressed, it was clear it was leaning towards the latter; I became a little uncomfortable as Bill spent most of his time interviewing people who could be considered buffoons -- people who clearly had limited knowledge of their own religion. He rarely talked to trained theologians and the couple times he did, he didn't give them much chance to explain their thoughts. I began to worry that this would result in lots of bad reviews; and indeed, looking through the reviews online, it has. People aren't happy about that.But for me, as the movie continued, I started to realize Bill's real purpose in creating this movie: It's a call to action. He's not trying to change any minds. Rather, he's talking to those of us who already agree with him. Bill wants to mobilize us non-believers and forward our cause. As such, I left the movie feeling inspired and excited. And because of that, I give this film a high rating. I didn't give it a 10, however, because I do think it would have been a benefit for Bill to interview more intelligent, knowledgeable people. So for that I give the movie a 9.I definitely recommend this movie to all atheists, agnostics, and freethinkers. But if you're a Christian, then you probably won't get much out of this movie. If you're a non-believer, then by all means go see it.Jeff Mark</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brave and necessary message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a big fan of Bill Maher for years so when I heard he was making this film, I was very excited. Being a rationalist myself I agreed with the theme before going into to film. After seeing it, I agree even more. The film focuses on asking questions about religion. Questions that yes, make the people who try to respond to them look stupid. Which may not be nice, but are at this point well past the time to be asked. Irrational believers cause harm. They don't want to admit it and often do understand what they tacitly enable. But they do cause real harm and this film brings that correlation to light. It is not pleasant for fervent religious believers. But it is time. And Bill Maher is as tolerant and kind as anyone can be while listening to people explain such things as no one is born gay and that dinosaurs and people lived at the same time. But hopefully some of the comedy he injects into these absurd conversations will make the message more palatable to a wider audience.The fact that he covers a variety of religions and shows that they ALL are based on fundamentally flawed beliefs makes his point much stronger. Although his inclusion of some pot smoker in Amsterdam just seemed strange but also provides a highlight of unexpected humor.If you are at all curious and a religious person this film should provide you with some great topics of discussion. If you are a staunch irrationalist, you will likely find this film hostile. But that's OK, you are the problem anyway. Hopefully, as Bill Maher pleads at the end, those of you who are rationalists will begin to step up and demand the rights we deserve. I can only hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We forgive you, Bill Maher, for you know not what you do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Presented in Larry (Borat) Charles' slapdash ADD-edited film, Bill Maher's critique of religion ruins its many valid points by choosing easy targets and continually adopting a manner so arrogant, condescending and preening it makes you sympathize with his victims.The film follows Maher around in quick hiccups of brain-damaged editing from the real Holy Land to televangelists, hucksters, quacks, a truckers' chapel, Holy Land and anti-evolution theme parks, and rude interviews with offbeat Jews. There's little discernible logic to this jerky progress, except that at the end a visually loud and bombastic sequence seems to suggest that apocalypse is now, and is what fundamentalists want. Sadly this is largely true but should be the subject of another, not at all funny film.Maher is the heir of the nightclub comic provocateurs of the 60's, Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce, with the late George Carlin as his mentor and intermediary. These are humorists whose focus is intellectual and whose targets are the conventional assumptions of mainstream American society. Maher has a difference, in that he comes from a Catholic father and Jewish mother and was raised as a Catholic till he was in his mid-teens, when his father lost interest. He therefore begins with Christianity and pokes fun at such irrational assumptions as the virgin birth.Maher, who's unquestionably quick-witted and smart, seeks here to critique some of the major tenets of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam as well as some of the most reprehensible aspects of these religions' institutional behavior. His method is more relentless than systematic. The contents of Religulous are parceled out in sound-bites. Even when the film follows Maher's dialogue with, say, the truckers in their chapel, hardly a sentence is allowed to go by without cutting to Maher commenting further while driving along in a car. One thing that is not permitted is for an argument to play out or speaker to finish his point. Since Maher's agnostic approach to religion is all about argumentation, the dislocated style sets a poor example.At one point Maher teases a man who has his own religion, worshiping cannabis, playing on his paranoia while they smoke a joint together. The friend I watched the film with suggested that the filmmakers themselves had smoked too much dope. In fact the trajectory of this movie reveals zero attention span, and though Maher purports to be selling doubt, he never questions his own smug rationalism.There are only a few intelligent or convincing or arguably sane persons engaged in conversation with the smirking, self-satisfied Maher. One of these is the Holy Land theme park Jesus, who, rather surprisingly, is very quick on his feet in defending and illustrating a religion of love and a holy spirit that is as omnipresent as the wind. There are two ex-Mormons who cooperate in listing the beliefs of their former church, and say nothing foolish. Still another is Rev. Reginald Foster, said to be the Pope's unofficial Latinist. Interviewed outside St. Peter's in Rome, he readily agrees that hell and heaven and the virgin birth, December 25 as Jesus' birthday, are all things that are outdated or unknown; he doesn't get a chance to explain how he still nonetheless remains a firmly ensconced part of the Vatican.Dr. Francis Collins, the former head of the Human Genome Project, has said that he was filmed in a lengthy discussion with Maher in which he made "the case that acceptance of evolution is entirely consistent with belief in God," but we only get to see Collins for a few minutes being interrupted by Maher.Other expert spokesmen are similarly misrepresented. The Rev. George Coyne, the former director of the Vatican observatory, gets talked to to rebut assertions made by Ken Ham, a proponent of Intelligent Design and curator of the Creation Museum in Kentucky. Coyne gets left a line about how "the Bible is not a book of science," but his argument about how evolution can be interpreted as not contradicting a belief in God as a creator is cut out. Dr. Andrew Newberg, a research neurologist who's done a study on brain activity associated with religion, is cut in walking through Grand Central Station and talking with Maher, but Maher's attitude that religious thought is some kind of nuttiness isn't Newberg's, though from the movie you wouldn't know that.Clearly Christianity, Islam, and Judaism have perpetrated atrocities and perpetrated absurd ideas But these major monotheistic religions are too central to human culture to be simply dismissed as a form of crackpot thinking or oppression. What about St. Augustine, the gnostics, the Sistine Chapel, the beautiful English of the King James Bible and the Arabic of the Qur'an?. Perhaps Bernini's columns aren't exemplars of Christian humility but they're magnificent architecture. Moslems come in as believers in absurd claptrap or terrorists. Visually Moslem prayer is even made fun of by being run at high speed. Even a serious adolescent wouldn't be long satisfied by the level of criticism here. And though some peculiar sects come in for mention--Maher recites Scientology concepts dressed as a nut case at London's Hyde Park Corner-- Buddhism, Hindoism, or other major world religions are not even mentioned.Though Bill Maher substitutes shouting down and interrupting for polite debating, Larry Charles is to blame for the film's trashy look, its visible mike booms and grainy video, its preponderance of clips from bad "Greatest Story Ever Told" flicks, it's brain-damaged cutting and lack of logical structure. I am not one of the many fans of Charles' tasteless Borat. Notably, that is another film whose subjects protested they were crudely misrepresented. This time, Charles is cutting up arguments that involve central aspects of human culture It's fine to poke fun at religion. I'm all for it. But if you're going to take on Christianity, Judaism, and Islam in a single film you need to show a little more class than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The prevailing problem with Religulous is that it&#x2019;s neither funny nor provocative. I mean, it does try its best to poke the angry beaver that is organized religion, but for the most part it fails to evoke anything stronger than consternation and irritation. Bill Maher is far too smarmy, too full of himself, smirking his way as if everything&#x2019;s a big joke that only he&#x2019;s in on. You get the feeling that Maher desperately wants to be like Michael Moore, who - love him or hate him - works hard to prove his points. Maher seems content with just doing cut-rate standup.There really isn&#x2019;t a lot else that can be said about a psuedodocumentary about religion. Maher can&#x2019;t keep out of his own way, constantly interrupting his interview subjects with witless, almost mirthless humor so that they can&#x2019;t even make their points cogently. Where Moore might allow his subjects to rant on and on, allowing them to either make their case or his own for him, Maher doesn&#x2019;t seem sure whether he wants to laugh at his subjects or discuss religion with them. He comes off as abrasive, obnoxious, and thoroughly condescending, and it&#x2019;s the latter that really kills the mood.Maher&#x2019;s lofty pontifications would carry more weight had he exhibited even the tiniest amount of empathy for his opponents&#x2019; - and essentially everyone in the movie is his opponent, save for his film crew - point of view. An honest discussion on what religion means in the 21st century would have had far more merit than a blanket &#x201c;everyone who believes in God is crazy&#x201d; mantra that serves no one other than the self-aggrandizing host.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some funny bits, but come on Bill! A documentary film about religion? Quoting Zeitgeist? Keep doing the TV Show and the interviews, but a documentary film? I am probably overreacting but what an unnecessary provoking film... I don't know. I laughed, disagreed, agreed... this film is very confusing and inconsistent. This is what religious people will use to claim that there is "religious persecution" going on from media.Bill's a funny guy... but also very cocky... Bill's rhetoric is similar to Bill Hicks, a brilliant comedian. But like many comedians, the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying. I think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility. This might be just a personal taste, but comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as funny. It's bigotry. Bill is obviously emotional when it comes to religious fundamentalism. I agree with Bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible, but the response to it cannot be ridicule. It will create unnecessary turmoil. We can do better than just react to fundamentalism. His conclusion is that "we don't know" and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything, to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion. His "humility" that he only knows that he doesn't, is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non-sense.I had great trouble seeing bits of Zeitgeist, the movie in Bill's film. All the astrotheology-influenced non-sense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing. Zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable Religion Studies scholarship. It is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources. Astro-mystic sources that reduce everything to "the stars say it all" seem to be from the Middle Ages, and honestly, pseudo-religious as well. This film is a confusing statement from a confused "agnostic". Agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically grounded than defending every single issue as "we don't know".This film is an obvious evidence of how postmodernism plus mass media has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history.Watch the film (it has hilarious interviews and bits) but PLEASE do not behave like Bill. You cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments every other line. His arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting, provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation. There needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues.</fullReview>

However if you're looking for something that is educational, that will make you think and show you something new about why religion is perhaps not very relevant to the world we live in today, you will not find it with this documentary. Bill Maher goes from one religion to another bulldozing his ideas and at some points refusing to listen or gain any insight from the interview. This will not teach you anything you didn't know about religion it is just a man who has become disgruntled and angry about the lack of proof of religion and the amount of people who are religious. He does not put forward any sort of hypothesis or come up with many interesting points. I am not a religious person however I feel the way he went about this documentary was pretty poor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is really ONLY Bill Maher's interpretation of religion. There are several funny moments, and some interesting points, but don't go into this expecting an even-handed discussion of religion. This is what I consider to be the worst kind of documentary - Everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director, rather than letting you make your own decision.EDITING - It's very chopped up, inter-spliced with clips from pop culture and the media to reinforce the point. The interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing. The only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say. Once someone deviates from the gospel according to Maher, they get edited.INTERVIEWEES - They are meant to represent the absolute MOST extremist religions. From the TV evangelical to the ultimate Jewish stereotype, to a TRUCK STOP chapel (Seriously. A TRUCK STOP CHAPEL). He's picked the worst money-grabbers, the heavy extremists, and those who don't have the budget to say no to pick on. And when he does get a good person to interview, he edits the hell out of them.STEREOTYPING - All religions are portrayed as stereotypes. Especially hard hit are the Muslims. During the Muslim segment, he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them either himself, or through editing in pieces with suicide bombers. ALL Muslims are portrayed as gun-toting extremists through the editing, and none of the people interviewed is edited fairly.ENDING - The message at the end is INCREDIBLY heavy-handed, and while it is an interesting idea, it's not presented with fairness to the countless people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground. This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous, and that it will destroy the world. He also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid.With the faults to the film, it has some good points, and the humor, while very unfair, is actually funny. But know going in, it is a very one-sided view, Bill Maher's view, of religion. He's not discovering anything. He's telling you what he thinks.4/10 - Some good moments, but heavy-handed with an extremely irresponsible documentary style.</fullReview>

It could be classified more with "Borat" - something that resembles a reality TV and is supposed to shock the viewer due to its offensive content.The biggest problem I have with this movie is that Bill Maher does not try to get into intelligent discourse with the religious leaders. He just asks provocative questions to people who do not seem to have proper grip over the philosophy of Christianity. He picks the interviewees that are most vulnerable and easy to poke fun at. As with any movie, this seems to be edited to include only the portion that gels with Maher's belief. It fails to show the other side of all the arguments. He also confines himself within the comfort of his own country most of the time, with few takes here and there in Holland, Britian and Israel. IMDb's plot summary describes this movie as "Bill Maher's take on world religion". However, except for poking fun at Christianity and Judaism, he hardly confronts any Islamic leader, and totally ignores Hinduism and Buddhism. He seems to be oblivious to the fact that civilization does exist in Asia, Africa and South America.(a typical American trait ;-))The second problem I have with people like Bill Maher or Richard Dawkins is that they are so firm in their belief in Atheism that they themselves become fanatic like any religious zealots and seems to get provoked when anybody questions their disbelief in God. This is an another extreme of fanaticism. Why does your bad experience with a certain religion makes all the religions evil? Why can't rationality and faith exist together?This movie is a popcorn flick and should be watched purely for its entertainment and shock value. For documentaries that deals with more serious issues, there are always CBC documentaries on Sunday nights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another lapsed catholic whining about religion?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing is Bill Maher is a smartass. That's his line of work as a comedian. All the right-wing talk-show hosts anathematized bill as evil or something following his comment about the 9/11 bombers. He called them courageous or fully-committed or suchlike. Leftist schlock of course. The most winning part of his philippic is that he attacks(questions) many religions,ecumenically, so to speak, leaving out the Buddhists, Hindus, Bahais, Zoroastrians,etc. citing time constraints. He is an iconoclast-tearing down religious icons. He is obnoxious and a little charming once you get to know him(on film). Are his questions theologically, or better, spiritually important? A Founding father of America, perhaps Franklin once said: If America is this bad with religion, imagine how bad it would be without it? The Irish,it is said, with their monks, copying ancient texts, saved civilization. They brought Europe through the very Dark Ages after Rome's collapse. Is that not worth a little praise? I think this film has a touch of genius. It does not tear down religion for sport-but out of a real search for meaning-i.e. logical stories about our purpose in this world. Maher finds only 'talking snakes'(The Garden of Eden)and the obvious silliness of Mormonism-fireproof underpants?- and Scientology-laughable schlock, on its face. Tom Cruise, get a clue. Ultimately, this movie is just another Bill Maher comedy monologue.Always another punchline....I said Bill is charming. An ageing hipster troll, if I were unkind. This movie is intellectual and snarky and fun. The fact is, religion saves people from falling into the defects of badness, and evil and stupidity-when it is successful. Not a bad goal-yes?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would certainly enjoy a critical, comparative outlook on world religions that really explores the issue at hand and forms an in-depth assault on dangerous fundamentalists. I have yet to see that film. "Religulous" touches upon some interesting issues, but passes over most of them without engaging the most serious implications. To take an example, Maher brings in a scientist to let us know that a certain part of the human brain becomes active when somebody is "speaking in tongues." We do not hear whether this part of the brain is connected with schizophrenia or whether it's connected with theatrical performance, or whether it's used for no other apparent purpose. It just name-drops the scientist and hurries the show along without delving deeper. This superficial treatment might be permissable if it was genuinely entertaining (Likewise, with the man who claims to be Christ, antichrist, and John the Baptist in one, a few weak banana jokes were all the film delivers), or if it covered any breadth of world religions. As it is, the film bases it's unilateral statements on religions of the world based only on a handful of Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Islam, Christianity, and the Church of Mormon), ignoring all new age faiths, open polytheisms, and faiths such as Hinduism and Buddhism. The narrative jumps around, the film is too dodgey for a documentary and not amusing enough for comedy, and Bill Maher is obnoxious and condescending enough to make somebody become a born-again Christian out of spite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating but fatally flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be the first to admit I watched portions of this, hanging in when I could and jumping back in when I felt I could take some more. When PBS starts calling everyone who isn't a Darwinist an idiot and a Nazi you know it's hard times for Christians in the "enlightened"/intellectual media. Christian-bashing is a major sport for the pseudo-intellectuals of the new millennium. I could go a little for Maher in general if it wasn't that he has such a liberal agenda but tries ever so hard to come across as just a logical free-thinker (which he really isn't, he's just another Rush Limbaugh able to effectively articulate his decidedly different point of view). Maher is very much like FOX News saying unbiased and unafraid, or whatever garbage it is they say. And he does have a penchant (like his conservative spiritual brother William F. Buckley) for saying things and then laughing at his own joke, being of course the smartest person in the room at the time. Some of his stuff IS smart, his comment along the lines of dropping bombs on people from 20,000 feet being akin to terrorism was I thought thoughtful and thought-provoking. All that said I think this movie is junk. So it's difficult using conventional factual analysis to prove the details of Jesus' life 2,000 years ago. Faith and traditional scientific analysis are not an easy mix BY DEFINITION, in this instance I rest on faith rather than the provable about facts 2,000 years old. But I find this position piece (I shudder at the term "documentary" used by some one else here, please get real) loaded with skewed facts and lame or straw opponents, not unlike Bill's TV show. And - follow me on this - just because there are flawed and blockhead Christians out there doesn't mean that Jesus doesn't exist and GOD ain't around. As far as I saw, this ignores the truly wonderful work done by Christians in this country and abroad, and the wonderful morals and values of most Christians. Bill is free to feel like he wants and say it as he wants, it's a free country, but this is the blind leading the blind. I feel sorry for the people less intelligent than Bill following him down the wrong road.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I begin I must say I always liked Bill Maher and I still do he's funny. I remember watching his show "real time" every chance I could before I joined the U.S. Army and sacrificed cable. So when I was looking for a movie to stream the other day it screamed out " Hey you click here!". So I clicked and began the biggest waste of time I actually watched all the way thru. I figured it was the least I could do to watch it 100% before complaining about it. I think it is kind of weird that Bill is trying to predict the future first off, because last I checked psychics are Bullsh*t Penn and Teller proved that in the show of the same name. Where I am fairly certain Bill got the idea for this movie. Don't get me wrong I like that show but Penn and Teller did a better job because they are the masters of making the people they interview look like jackasses plus they have fuc*ing magic to back up their claims. Then again who consents to an interview when you don't know what it's about? There are a few laughs in this piece of sh*t film that's why it has a 3. To sum up the film Bill thinks religion is going to end humanity. He finds a few idiots to "prove it". Then he ends the film with chilling music and him looking into the sun. Oh by the way if this film gets you thinking about the dangers of religion please spend some money on a history book and look all the destruction atheists have caused. Violence is not just a religious thing it is a human thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like Bill Mayer you'll like the film, if not you won't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't like Religulous at all. It was largely because of Mayer. He has a constant overwhelming presence in the film. His attempts at humor take the front seat over the subject matter. I did not laugh or feel the urge to smile once during the film.Here is a list of the things I really didn't like: Mayer's sarcastic jokes throughout the film. (Like the title of this review states if you don't like his wit you won't like the movie). The unnecessary use of on screen subtitles mocking comments as people talked. (His comments were really juvenile and disrespectful. Someone could do that to what any of say each day. I have no doubt Mayer thought of each subtitle shown. It's the same sarcastic witless humor.) Mayer's constant interrupting to tell a joke. (Their is one scene filmed in a shop where he asks a question of someone "What miracles made you believe in Jesus?". Mayer then ignores the person's reply. He instead looks at a statue points out the price and asks aloud "2600 dollars?! How much is the one without the baby Jesus and shawl for Mary?" I was waiting for a drum's rim shot but it never came. He was just there to crack his really stupid jokes.) There are off screen comments by his crew which provokes more lousy jokes by Mayer. (The film was cut so badly that you can hear the crew being cut off verbally as Mayer chimes in with his thoughts on something or to attempt another lousy joke.)The best scene for me was his interview of the senior priest at the Vatican. Mayer played the straight man and let the priest be the funny person.Bill Mayer is not funny for me and the film was done very amateurishly. I can/t even like it from the viewpoint of being a documentary film. I gave it a 4 only because I would like to see another company try to examine religion critically and in a humorous way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good documentary...had it not been for it's hidden Zionist agenda...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been a truly great documentary...if it weren't for it's blatant pro-Zionist structure. I used to have a lot of respect for both Bill Maher and Larry Charles, however, this film completely destroyed that. I was really enjoying this until the pro-Zionist stance of this film started to seep through - especially with it's clichd propagandist editing ? e.g. showing an image of angry Arabs (usually Palestinians), then quickly following up that image with footage of an act of terrorism - such editing is an insult to one's human-intelligence. One has to ask why they didn't show footage of Israeli Jews then follow it up with footage of Israeli soldiers murderously rampaging through Palestinian towns? Or Israeli F-16's dropping white phosphorus on Palestinian schools? Ultimately, this type of documentary making is as bad as the religious zealots that Maher and Larry Charles wish to mock - like them, they have their own agenda, and it's a pro-Zionist one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Important Side-Note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, and reading many of the comments regarding people's opinions on the documentary-like film, I've come to the conclusion that most people are retarded.The majority of complaints coming from people after reading comments argue that there was no professionalism, nor any informative interview with someone of importance or intelligence. Neither of these points matter.What I believe Maher tries to instill into viewers is that it doesn't matter what scholars, or professors of religion believe- The majority of religious people (randomly selected- apparent in the movie) are complete baboons. He's not warning that religion in general is a bad thing, he's arguing that religion in the hands of imbeciles, or almost every single conformist lemming that follows organized religious beliefs is the issue.I may be wrong, I may be right- But the movie was by no means a one- sided depiction of a non-believer's views, but more a target at organized religion as a whole. People need to stop believing what other's believe, and focus on what makes sense to them. After seeing people make complete fools of themselves, I have no other conclusion than to believe that he's targeting the retarded and unintellectual people because they're the majority- And the real problem.As for my review of the movie, I believe it's definitely a must-see for anyone, whether being the targeted audience of atheists, or the made- fun-of party of believers. There may be a lack of details here and there, but the message is clear- Follow your own beliefs, not someone else's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved how rebellious and intense this was. I read the criticism on Wikipedia before i watched it so was well aware of which parts to look out for as i put it on. Bill Maher is one of my favourite American presenters and its criminal we don't have someone with his cynical and punchy attitude in the UK to take the same kind of perspective. In a country like the US with its fundamentalist Christian base, it's a brave thing to do.As a Christian myself i found myself getting more and more angry the longer i watched - but not with Maher at all as i agreed with him on almost everything. It was obvious he'd gone out of his way to pick the worst examples of ignorance he could find to make his point as dramatically as possible. Nothing wrong with that, but i was frustrated i couldn't just reach out and give him the answers. Maybe its a US thing but the majority of religious friends i have are all evolutionists and have a very grounded view of the politics, scripture and a love of science that doesn't lead them to the same ridiculous asinine viewpoints.The narrative is very strong, especially the intro and outro. The film shows how utterly stupid, self-obsessed, ignorant and stubborn mankind can be once it adopts religion as its flag. Many of the characters were fascinating and i couldn't understand how they could believe the things they do - that they were Christ reborn, that they had been converted from being gay, that Cannabis was religious and more. If Maher wanted to prove a point that a lot of religious people are crazy, ignorant, dumb and completely delusional, he completely succeeded.I loved the idea of keeping things humorous as the subject is very difficult, and taking no prisoners to make an exceptionally strong argument, as its what good films should be about. I did find one thing distasteful and slightly dishonest though: Maher had added his responses as titling onto the screen in the edit afterwards, as well as flash graphics being placed as sarcastic interstitials and the interviews clearly being heavily edited. That smacks of cowardice and a lack of journalistic integrity/objectivity in my mind, which slightly ruined the overall impact. In the original Wikipedia entry many people seem to have been critical of him "obtaining interviews by deception".I can imagine the meeting room when the film was being planned and it seems that what they essentially did was decide to attack religion as a whole one-sidedly (fair enough), but then simply made a list of nutcases/renegades to interview and juxtapose serious commentary around to give it some kind of credibility. Don't get wrong - it's extremely funny and makes some powerful points, but if you're looking for a serious and objective take (what we'd normally term a "documentary") that would present the issues on balance to you to challenge you to make a decision, this isn't it. It's a one-sided argument that is equally challenging, but is simply singing to the choir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short on humor and almost devoid of facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this shortly after renting Ben Stein's "Expelled" and thought it would interesting to compare them. Before I go further, it seems only fair that I point out the following so a reader can see if I'm prejudiced or not. I'm trying to be objective, for the record.I tend to enjoy Maher's HBO show now and then, though I rarely think he's the source of the humor. I don't really care for his stand-up either. But he makes some good points on the show now and again, and I liked Politically Incorrect, though he was still fairly politically correct (which I deem a negative because the very term sounds Orwellian or at least fascist). As for my religious views, I'll say for simplicity's sake that I'm a non-denom. Christian with some views that are objectivist and some that are agnostic mixed in.That being said, this a bad "documentary" for reasons that haven't been touched on yet by many reviewers--though the ones mentioned are valid too. The reason it's not convincing isn't just that he argues the main point without letting others talk (and his point boils down to nothing logical either, it's just "come on, really?" which isn't a point, just a question. Try David Hume if you want a decent argument.). The reason this isn't convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter. I saw this about 2 months ago and I only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he wasn't a clergyman. There are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with Masters or Doctorates willing to do a bit of verbal sparring, particularly in the fields of History, Anthropology or a host of others.If one compares this to Ben Stein's "Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed" he'll find that Stein interviews about 30 credentialed professors, professionals, clergy, etc. He does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds. He also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education. Maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by theocratic rules throughout centuries or persecutions from this. Instead he idiotically refers to the 20th century's secular totalitarian regimes as evidence of why secularism needs more socio-political power!!!! (it's in the bonus features where he's standing in front of the Anne Frank house I think.) This is a true Orwellian head-trip. He blames Christianity in particular on many pointless deaths--which has had its share, though far smaller than most!!--without even including a basic view of the evidence. Perhaps this is because that argument is dwarfed by secular humanism's miserable record of the 20th Century ALONE.Another glaring weakness is his unwillingness to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or "average" practitioner. He picks out the weakest gazelles of the herd. How difficult is that? How does proving the existence of exceptions move toward disproving the general rule? It does not. Wow, so people in cults think outside of the norm? How enlightening to know this. Great work Maher! Again, it would be fairly easy to interview someone like Laurence Vance and include his work on refuting the idea of "patriotic duty" that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in.Beyond all that, he's just not that funny here. Some of the clips that are overlaid in "clever" out of context/irreverent ways might garner a laugh, but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from Maher will NOT be forthcoming, much less convincing. He spends most of his time bashing Christians, spouting inaccuracies, and interviewing fringe groups that he doesn't allow to really answer his questions.For the record, there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves. He touches on almost none of these. I get the feeling that I could've responded much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed, but the whole thing reeks of deck-stacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and funny, but hypocritical in its attempt to address mainstream commonsense and morality!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an atheist, I give this movie a very good rating. It was funny, but not hilarious! There're so many other aspects of religions and religiosity that the movie could have tackled, and more profoundly. The movie is not particularly well made. Besides, there was some hypocrisy in it and some attempts to court mainstream viewers (somehow understandable for a comedy!). The way Maher addressed Islam was not very balanced though, maybe because he comes from a Judeo-Christian culture, which prevented him from having deeper knowledge of Islam and its various cultures. You have the impression that he portrays Jews and Christians as lunatics, but he doesn't portray Muslims in the same terms (as lunatics!) but as inherently violent people because they stick to this "inherently violent" religion. The movie thus falls into essentialization, which it starts off in the first place trying to combat, completely ignoring the political instrumentalization of religions and religiosity. One major trend in the movie is this trivialization: religions and religiosity are just lunacy, they're not manifestations of political, economic and class struggles! This, to me, was absurd! Moreover, in his interview with the orthodox Jewish rabbi, Maher shows that he's a strong sympathizer of the State of Israel's as it is stands now, which is not consistent with the agenda of the rest of the movie, seeing that the land of Israel was chosen by the early Zionists because they wanted to strike a religious chord inside the Jews of the time, and the state of Israel remains a religious state that discriminates actively against non-Jews. Also, during his interview with the ex-gay preacher, he uses almost the same argument many homophobic people use, which is "poor people, it's biological", though homophobic people extend the line to "they're sick and should be treated!" Nowadays, especially in Europe, no one defends homosexuality as a hopeless genetic case (which has never been proved for sure!) but rather as an active choice by people who are equal to heterosexuals, both in reasoning capacities and in rights. Bill Maher asked atheist viewers in the end of the movie to come out of the closet and defend their views. But Maher does not come out all the way. He comes out halfway trying to court mainstream morality and commonsense and, thus, ends up being somehow hypocritical and disappointing to hardcore atheists or agnostics!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He misses one thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What bothers me a bit about this fairly entertaining documentary is that most of the people Mr. Maher talks to are intellectually on a much lower level than he is. They haven't got any prepared arguments, because they really don't care about arguing rationally, which sort of makes him the winner even before they begin.Like most intellectuals of today, I haven't the slightest doubt that evolutionary theory is accurate and arguing against it with the help of the Bible is a mistake in that it applies your inner most precious emotions and hope to something purely rational and logical. I would like to claim, though, that what Mr. Maher is doing is basically the same thing in reverse. He applies a logical, scientifically point of view to peoples love of god. I'm not talking about some money loving preacher or some guy thinking dinosaurs coexisted on earth with homo sapiens; they are just too obviously dumb and cannot be taking seriously by any thinking person. I'm talking about that black guy, who, about ten minutes into the film said that "it's a faith thing". Me, being a non religious person, cannot help but noticing the radiance of some believers, which makes the whole thing with the biblical stories seem of less importance. Maybe Jesus wasn't the son of god, maybe there where no miracles and maybe nothing in the bible is based on facts (this is what I actually believe); but still this doesn't change the love of god within a believing person, I mean the phenomenon of loving god. Even if the god he or she believes in doesn't really exist, the love is still there and there certainly is something true about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blindingly obvious, incredibly one-sided - &amp; I'm not even religious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just open by saying, I'm not overly religious. I'm sure there'll be plenty of comments here from staunch proponents on both sides of the argument. But the idea of this site is to critique the movie itself ? not the opinions expressed within. And while personally, I tended to agree with almost everything the film was trying to get across, I really wasn't impressed with the way it was done. Let's face it, making religious zealots look crazy, is like trying to make the North Pole look cold. Any decent documentary maker would try to go a little further, push a little harder and get some slightly more interesting insights or arguments. Bill picked ridiculously easy targets with little or no authority on the matter. It felt like his team hadn't had enough time to organise interviews with anyone that might actually have something to say. Where were the religious scholars? The theologians, the professors, the psychologists and historians? These people could've given us an insight into why this crazy thing called religion exists and why our society clings to it, even when rational minds are screaming in protest. And it has to be said, while he might be a half-decent comedian, Bill Maher is a terrible interviewer. He manages to get almost everyone's ire up within 2 questions. A good interviewer would give people the rope to hang themselves. Fein interest, get people to open up and really tell the camera what they believe. You need to build a rapport, get people to trust you. Bill just launches in and attacks, cracking jokes that get missed or cause offence. From the word go, the interviewee is on the defense and we don't get to hear just how crazy they really are. The entire documentary is very one-sided. A huge amount of time was given over to Maher's personal rants on the subject of religion. And even if you agree with him, that gets old after about 10 minutes. If you don't agree, I think it would be an incredibly frustrating movie with nobody to hold up the side of the more moderately religious ? who surely outnumber the nuts a million to one. Also, I would've liked to have seen some social or political philosophers putting up a few solutions. Yes it's nuts to trust our leadership to some guy who believes in talking snakes instead of evolution. But what's the solution? If religion is out-dated, how do we progress? Throw around some ideas, delve into some issues. Don't just say all religious people are crazy. I had to laugh at some of the cut scenes from old movies (they did a great job of finding those), but again, it was all too easy. Some of the interviews were so lame they had to superimpose jokes and one-liners over the top. That's like coming up with a witty retort 10 minutes too late. Like Bill Maher, I used to have debates with my mum about religion. I always won. And in a way, I was hoping this movie might be able to put up some interesting arguments. But no. All in all, it was boarder-line watchable. A bit boring for doubters and just plain frustrating for believers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is totally overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Bill Maher is one of the front runners against religious dogma and hypocrisy but seeing him on his own show you soon realize that something is wrong with how he follows this. And "Religulous" shows this VERY clear because what the heck does Bill Maher want? Is this a "documentary"?? Sure... you can tell that to an atheist who's only goal in life is proving god does not exist. He will jump on that wagon. But the whole movie is edited in such a typical TV entertainment way with goofy inserts, answers cut and empty facial expressions edited in. The line between a documentary and a comedy is so heavily blurred that it hurts and Bill Mahers cynical ways of telling he is a comedian do not help because the way he asks questions and replies to answers its too damn obvious he takes all this damn serious and the clichd Finale with nuclear explosions and religious fanatics edited on top is absolute proof.And this is the key point where Religilous falls flat. Lets face it... we get a bunch of selectively chosen religious hypocrites from various groups. Most are presented like idiots, many of them surely are... but they were selected and heavily edited to get the message across and this is wrong. Damn Bill.. decide if you want to be a Comedian or if you want to be serious. It already hurts enough to see you retreat into jokes and cynicism on the Realtime show as soon as you reach the boundaries of your wisdom. But with this movie its just plain annoying... just read the comments. Some call it a comedy, others call it a documentary... picking parts of it they like and ignoring that it uses the most despicable flat out elements of propaganda, throwing in hard-on and "you stole my wallet" jokes. A lot of this is pretty boring, the information level is pretty low and the jokes are not funny enough to make this a comedy. So what the hell is it then??Don't get me wrong... I think the call to arms against religious Hypocrites demanding respect for their ridiculous beliefs while shouting at others is needed and I think the time is right to unite skeptics, agnostics, atheists and everyone who trusts in scientific rational discourse against an obvious enemy that is growing in numbers. BUT if you do it by means of selective information, editing tricks and propaganda that links every Muslim in this movie to suicide bombings, 9-11 images and similar hypocrisies then its wrong and far from scientific discourse. And at this point Bill Maher will make sure to retreat behind his cynical facade as a Comedian.I think Bill Maher shows pretty straight that he is not too informed on various matters when you watch him on the "Realtime" show. Here he is saved by editing, yet he manages to come across like an idiot when uttering stuff like "Without the anal sex you just got the blow-jobs" to 2 Muslim gays. Cynicism, cheap jokes, shock value.... and then call it a documentary and run through talk-shows like a missionary. Sorry Mr. Maher... something doesn't add up here. So make up your mind because the core of what you were doing here is important and doesn't deserve to be such a mess of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap and poor indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is classified here (as of today March 14, 2013) as documentary and comedy. A documentary - per dictionary - gives facts about a real situation or real people. A comedy is - per dictionary - film, play or book which is intentionally funny. When one tries to be intentionally funny, facts start getting twisted and cease to be facts. Well, having watched the movie, I have to ask myself "What was the authors' intention?" Facts? How factual can a movie made by religious bigots be? Definitely no. Funny? How funny is ridiculing and undermining other people's religious beliefs? Bill Maher's slimy performance was rather sickening. Obviously, he could not say overtly and sincerely what he thinks of religions as that would be banned as hater's propaganda (although I believe he's crossed that line), so here we have got this slimy, low and cheap attempt to ridicule religions and blame all bad on them. It is not factual, it is not funny and it is not convincing. The so called funny "document" covers basically mainly 3 religions Christianity, Islam and Judaism and points out that Christianity and Islam have got involved in wars, violence and intolerance. The authors omit facts that WWI, WWII, wars in Korea, Vietnam and Iraq and the whole Cold War to name a few had nothing to do with religions. As most one-sided biased anti-religious propaganda does it, this one - as well - focuses on Christianity and Islam - only 2 religions - to convince us that all religions are bad. It skips all the Far East religions like Buddhism, Confucianism, Shinto and other that proved to be perfectly capable of co-existing peacefully. In this fashion, it does not differ too much from Zeitgeist movie and its 1st Christian part which is entirely dedicated to Christianity and yet makes claims about religion generally. Nevertheless, I would rather go for that than the Redigulous. Bill Maher's slimy and slick performance made me believe that snakes do speak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well all i can say, that the biggest reason why religions (at least the 3 major ones) clash all-too-often is because of lack of understanding, if not that then the existence of extremists and this movie doesn't help. It clearly is 110% pro-atheist while making all other believers look like monkeys, we certainly do not need content like this going around, and I'm glad its not too popular,. Problems only arise when members of one religion openly show their superiority over other, this will ALWAYS lead to clashes. Im a Muslim and I'm clearly more than 'moderate' but i also RARELY clash with the more-than-moderate Christian, it gets easy with the rare self-superioring/self-imposing Ethiopian Christian, If you must know in my country (In East Africa) its tough to call which religion is a minority since the BOTH (u know what i mean) are almost equal halves of the population.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rails Against The Religious Right Just As Bad As The Right Rails Against Us...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being both an Atheist and a liberal democrat, I was looking forward to seeing this documentary that lampoons modern-day religions. The title alone should send the conservative, evangelical right screaming into the night: religious + ridiculous = RELIGULOUS. Although I've only seen snippets of Maher's comedic acts, and never having seen his political pundit show REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER, I now believe I might have skipped this documentary for a couple of reasons.I firmly believe if you want to make a point against a person or group or ideal, you need to let the other side have its say. Maher continually interrupts those he "interviews" and even when he does allow them to speak a few sentences, he mocks them in true, unrelenting, Rush Limbaugh fashion. Let me say here, too, that I completely despise Limbaugh and his loud-mouth antics. I would hope that those of us who are truly democratically inclined (as Maher claims to be) that we would let our detractors come at us and then knock down their logic with our own (Jon Stewart's THE DAILY SHOW is much more topical and respectful by comparison).Maher's disrespect isn't obvious from the get-go as he visits a church inside a truck trailer and begins asking questions and challenging a group of mens' beliefs. One man became upset enough that he stormed out of the church. The others remained, however, and Maher and they left on semi-amicable terms (they even prayed for him, which is what I picture good Christians/Muslims/Buddhists, etc. doing). But after Maher's trailer visit, things head downhill rapidly. He gets thrown out of the Vatican (big surprise), and is often refused filming privileges at various locations, including around Salt Lake City's Mormon temple. I wondered why this was, and then quickly learned of Maher's terrible antics; religious leaders were told that the title of the documentary was A Spiritual Journey and didn't know of Maher's affiliation with the film until he arrived for the interview. Kinda slimy.That said, I do agree with most of Maher's views on religion. More blood has been spilled in the name of God than by man alone. Television evangelicals have been busted for scheming their flock, sexual predation, and many other despicable things; true hypocrites. But simply railing against these acts doesn't bring us any closer to understanding one another. Atheists and those of the god fearing nature need to be able to sit and talk without pointing fingers and without condemning the other for their beliefs (or lack of belief). And Maher doesn't do that. He's just as bad as the extreme right. Guess I should've checked out Maher's show before watching this...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arguments against the religious and their theology are nothing new, and Maher isn't treading on any new ground here. In this self-acclaimed 'promotion of doubt', which comes across more like travelling around having a pop at people and editing it to make them look even more stupid then they already are for believing the things they do, Maher doesn't even pretend he's presenting a partisan perspective. His arguments are ill thought through, badly articulated and delivered with an aura of smugness that makes for very uncomfortable viewing, and I'm on his side! There's certainly a need for fundamentalists and more moderate religious people to be challenged on their integrity and morality for believing the things they do, but this isn't the way to do it.Oh sure, it's funny - most often by the often horrific own-goals the interviewees make themselves, but there's no engagement here, no debate, no attempt to conversate in a real or progressive way, just atheistic point scoring that serves no purpose other than for atheists to giggle along to, and religious folks to dismiss out of hand. Nobody wins.The case against religion has been made before, and made better.</fullReview>

To say that religion is a bad thing and that even the moderates are entering something bad upsets me. Look at the Bhuddists! There are few atrocities that can be associated with them, their religious leader, the Dali Lama, said himself that you don't need to be a Bhuddist to reach enlightenment. But going beyond that, the other religions are capable of good as well. Christianity, Islam, Judaism. All have been the banner for many charity organizations. They do not kill those who disagree with them. They do not say all others are damned to hell. The MAJORITY of religious people do not think that way. A few do, but they are not everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are great documentaries - "Triumph of the Will", Humphrey Jennings' British films during World War II, all of Robert Flaherty's movies. There are adequate to good documentaries such as Michael Moore's attacks and the like. Then there are poor documentaries which fail as films, and this one fits here. The film rambles - it has no discernible form at all - and it ends up not only with no conclusions, however shaky, but no message at all. It leaves us in the air.I have no quarrel whatsoever with the subject material. I have no religion to speak of and little or nothing of this kind offends me. But I like to think about things and this film doesn't encourage thinking at all. It is a series of disorganized pot-shots at traditional religious thought and a feeble attempt to tell the same jokes over and over in hope they will stick. The scenes in the car were interminable. The "interviews" were nothing but rude interruptions everywhere in order for the comedian to stick in his one-liners.Of course, the bottom line says it all. Aside from a much-needed film about religion gone awry as it has in the last few years, particularly in the far right of the Republican party, it is simply not amusing. In fact it is boring. It reminds me of bathroom humor: a little goes a long way and a lot goes way too far. That says it all.Curtis Stotlar</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is ridiculous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start out with the only good point in this movie. It's actually pretty funny sometimes. Unfortunately, that's the only one. This movie contains such a lack of professionalism, it is similar to a high school documentary. Apparently, Bill Maher didn't even get the facts right when he started this documentary. He makes many false claims in this documentary like when he says there is no historical basis for the existence of Jesus. Actually, the existence of Jesus is recognized by almost 100% of historians whether atheists or believers. Also, notice the lack of proof Bill Maher brings to this documentary. Does he have any proof for God not existing? Absolutely not. He merely spends an hour and a half making sarcastic comments and blatantly insulting the people he is interviewing. Apart from that, there is a definitive lack of objectivity in this movie. Did he question an expert on the subject of the existence of God? No. He interviewed a man dressed as Jesus and a scientific. Now these are not really people deemed experts in this subject. Perhaps Bill Maher should have went out and interviewed Lee Strobel, a former investigative journalist for the NY Times and atheist turned believer who makes a much better case for the existence of God than Bill Maher does for him not existing. Lee Strobel would tear him apart and expose his lack of arguments and idiocy. By the way, Lee Strobel has written many objective and precise books on the existence of God, Jesus and faith in America. Finally, notice that Bill Maher only interviews extremists and attempts to make Christians look like racist and sexist. Fortunately, and this Bill Maher should know, it is only an infinitely small amount of Christians who believe things like the fact that "God laughs when homosexuals die", a quote shown during the movie. I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie but if you really are interested, I can't say it's entertaining, only in an ignorant way though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that I have been waiting for,for the last couple of months since I saw the trailer for it. I am happy to say that it delivered the goods. Bill Maher is to be awarded a medal for having the cajones to tell it like it is. Let's face it. In the last two thousand, plus years,religion has done more damage than good (think in terms of wars,countless examples of any and/or all forms of abuse by the clergy, physical,mental,sexual,not to mention the propaganda that it's spread worldwide &amp; it's collateral damage). Maher interviews followers &amp; leaders of the Christian,Muslim &amp; Jewish faiths,and leaves some of them gobbling &amp; yammering about the same old rhetorical bulls**t. He also locks horns with fundamentalist Christian truck drivers,gets thrown out of the Vatican,and other eye opening moments. After seeing this, I thought to myself...."I'm so glad I jumped ship from the S.S. Christianity when I did". As this film has received an "R" rating from the MPAA for rough language &amp; some rather disturbing footage of various religious zealots re-enacting the execution of Jesus Christ (with some fairly real looking blood),you may consider leaving small children out of this (even though them finding out what a genuine threat that fundamentalist religion really is).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting film expressing the right to doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyway you slice it, religion is inherently irrational because it is based on the real world applications of purely conjectural faith (e.g. I have a soul and/or I have a god who wants to dry hump that soul) which, in turn and ultimately, can not be supported or validated with anything more substantial than "because I want to believe it." Also, monotheisms pride themselves on having one, true path which ultimately leads to the implication, if not the direct belief, that all other philosophical paths (other monotheisms especially) are, at best, incorrect, or at the worst, pure objective evil.Bill Maher's point is found within the question, how can people, especially people with great amounts of political power, be trusted to make valid ethical decisions when they not only use, but prioritize these inherently irrational philosophies as a validation for their ethical decisions in their daily lives? The answer he provides is simply that it is acceptable and becomes necessary to doubt those people who live without doubt. Because those people without doubt are shown throughout this movie. They are given their chance to explain their thoughts and then their beliefs are shown as total idiocy.While this movie extends itself to the global lunacy that religion breeds, it really is especially embarrassing to see Americans hold their bibles and their literal translations so tightly when even Vatican officials are stepping forward and exposing that anti-scientific clowns like those in the creationism museum in Kentucky, for example, are crackpots and that the scriptures hold no science whatsoever, because even they acknowledge that the scriptures were written by men, before enough science existed to show how the universe really works.This is a good film. Its not a serious debate, even though it does raise some serious questions. Its light-hearted because as of this moment, we can still afford to be. It also drags a bit when they are exploring the various Jewish aspects of ridiculousness within religion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I must state that I am a Christian, but in keeping an open mind, I decided to try(key word being "try") to watch this film, and I just couldn't. Not because he was fueling any doubts I may have, or offering anything important that might upset me. In fact, this movie offers nothing of real value to anyone; atheist, believer, undecided, etc. There really is nothing to gain from this film besides an unrelenting desire from the pit of your stomach to take back the time you wasted in front of the screen listening to this man throw words, phrases, and ideas that he doesn't have a clue about at the audience. The vast majority of this film is Bill Maher taking a verse in the Bible and twisting it to his advantage. He takes everything out of context, and makes it sound like something completely different, when in reality it has a logical reason to it. He exaggerates Christian beliefs and traditions to make them sound totally absurd, and he confuses the audience into thinking that symbolic traditions are actual, and literal beliefs, when they are the complete opposite. Another thing he did to "spice up" the film and truly sell it, was to take video clips, sound bites, and interviews with religious fanatics and make it seem like every Christian is like this. It's just not true, and it's very typical Hollywood. Don't waste your time on this one. You want to see Christians vs Atheists? Youtube search Richard Dawkins debates. The man has a brilliant mind, and he's open to dialogue with Creation scientists, such as John Lennox(Prof. at Oxford where Dawkins teaches) and others. Save your money and time; skip this film, and I guarantee you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but superficial and misleading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy Bill Maher. I agree with much of what he says and stands for. His film Religulous exhorts us to question, to not take things at face value, to start from a place of not-knowing, to at least try to be humble. This is the stance he aspires to. But here are my thoughts on why he doesn't achieve this. While there is much that is terrific in the film, Maher's own lack of humility gets in the way.He fell into the same trap that Richard Dawkins did in making The God Delusion. I admit I didn't read the book, but in the film he undermines his own case by interviewing the furthest out, most "crazy" people involved in religion that he could find. For example, how many young Jewish people are there who have become Muslims and who vehemently denounce their former affiliation? Maher does exactly the same. How many Christians ultimately declare themselves to be a kind of reincarnation of Jesus? Why has Maher chosen to spend so much time with this fellow? His choice of people to interview seems rather capricious, especially outside the Vatican. True, he's limited by those who speak English, so the American priest he found to interview just happens to come off as a good guy. The other Catholic he interviews also comes off as pretty sane, especially compared to the others. So why doesn't he bring up the question of the horrific child sexual abuse in the Church with these nice guys? Interview styles are important if one actually wants to hear what the interviewee has to say. Maher makes Michael Moore look like a paragon of low-key in this area. He interrupts constantly. The one person who insisted on being heard, an ultra-orthodox, anti-Zionist Jew, got abandoned by Maher in what seemed to be a few minutes (editing makes it difficult to tell exactly how long). So if Maher couldn't interrupt, crack jokes, and give his own opinion, he isn't interested in the interview. His is not the give-people-a-rope-and-let-them-hang-themselves type of interview style.Last, I'd like to point Maher towards what the current religion in North America actually is: money, materialism, and hedonism. What makes our secular life-style so much better or saner than that of the peaceful religious (which we didn't hear much of in a real way). What makes our gas-guzzling, superficial, concrete-slabbed, GMO-poisoned world better? What's sane about allowing ourselves to be ruled by corporations, which are owned by the 1% extremely rich who pretend to care about their 99% fellow humans less fortunate than themselves? Who relentlessly lie to us with greenwashing tales of care for the environment? This is better? This is movie with a good idea. Period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The subject matter is too broad to cover within the time Maher has hence a 8 out of 10. I wish he went with a sprinkling of other religions (Asian, Indian, African which all are &gt; 5000 yrs BC), but this documentary was a breath of fresh air in asking the question--it is OK to doubt others and even one's self? And the fact checker says he spot on in his questions, where the answers are hilarious. In the end, he proves his point and asks the question that faces a younger generation: do we want religion in government? The current generation says yes if you look at the last 25 years in the approval of religion in politics, business and gov't. He then moves on to the question: has religion been the cause of the current turbulence in America, and the world? The answers are not simple, but interesting. He gives his opinion at the last 5 minutes of the movie, love it or hate it, but it is compelling nonetheless.Compared to all the confusing G. Clooney and over the top S. Penn political movies over the last 2 yrs, this one kicks butt hands down. Compared to sell-out Oliver Stone's "W", this movie still shows there's a some intelligence in Hollywood and that you need not be on the 'left' nor 'right'. Just open. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now don't get me wrong. If you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to brighter future for mankind, who better to turn to than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture? If you need a healthy dose of all the solid, sound reasons why religion has outlived it's usefulness then turn to Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER for God's(?) sake! That's a good point in and of itself. Maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society, art and science is rooted in it.In this film, he relies heavily on his keenly-honed skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect isn't up to the task.Maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box. As an example, he responds to an interviewee's (and I use the term loosely as they were clearly all "ambushees") assertion that the existence of Jesus is historical fact with a deadpan "No, it's not" followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subject's naivety (a device nauseatingly overused in this film). The problem is that the person was correct and Maher dead wrong in his assertion that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically- suspect gospels. I guess Mr. Maher has never read the contemporary historian Josephus.But the masses will flock to this pseudo-documentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore, and they will loudly bray and guffaw (they certainly did at my showing).It's doubly telling, however, that the loudest and most mule-like braying occurred during the approximately 70% of the running time that the film devoted to it's anti-Christian tirade while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10% devoted to criticizing the self-described Religion of Peace. Hmmm. Either criticism of Islam is off-limits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh. Very telling, either way..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it, I agree with him 100%, but I didn't care for his delivery. He just came off as an asshole in a poorly edited, contrived juvenile smear campaign. Edit cuts galore, etc... The camera would be focused on him, and you'd see 2 or 3 edit cuts just over the course of a minute or two of dialog. Add in the constant boom mikes in the camera shot, which is a film no-no.This documentary hits a topic with so many angles, so many interesting stories, that the movie is just so easily done. Picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded kid. It is so easy it is just wrong. I mean how hard is it to make these people look like nut bags? To make them contradict themselves, you just let them recite more then a verse or two. I do like when he jumped back in forth between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradicting themselves.I just think he could have done something a little more creative. The part with the neurologist talking about brain activity was never fleshed out. It could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious fits compared to drugs, or sex, or ???? He could have played more on the women all rejoicing over the Passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new Rob Zombie movie. More could have gone into the history of John Smith, the Mormon founder who had quite the colorful past. Delve into science v.s. religion. One is a very methodical, very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories. It builds on itself from a solid bottom up, a new layer on top of a more proved layer. An enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way. The other starts at the top and comes down with unchallengeable claims. It is so, because well? I said so.Done right? I'd say turn it into an HBO original series? hit a different religion every week.It was an eye opener about one thing. I must have been blind. Good ole G.W.Bush... no wonder he got elected.

		<fullReview>Comedian and Intellectual, Bill Maher presents us with this comedic and dramatic exploration of the insanities and dangers of organized religion, while preaching his rarely-heard yet valid gospel of "I don't know". It is his plea to the world that it is safe to admit we don't really know things like what happens to us when we die, and that emotional certainty leads to terror, oppression and doom. Through most of the film, it's all laughs, and ends explaining what Maher (and folks like myself) thinks is a serious problem, partly citing how those who believe in the biblical "End Times" don't care about saving the planet from either war or pollution, and in some cases are driven to kill because they use a voice in their head to justify their actions. Some of the most profound moments for me, without giving away too much, includes a scientific priest, a Vatican priest who bashes Catholicism, the entire Muslim world worships a meteorite that they think is from "paradise" and not outer space, orthodox Jews who are so obsessed with the rules of the Sabbath that they invent and sell machines that avoid using electricity that normally would, and best of all, a giant landscape drawing of a naked man with a huge penis that is maintained by people to this date for centuries, yet they don't know why it's even there. I think one of the most powerful moments was Maher saying to the audience, "I don't know what happens when we die, and you don't either. You know how I know that? Because you do not possess a mental power that I do not.".</fullReview>

That's bad taste.Bill Maher is pretty amusing sometimes, and I'm pretty liberal, so mostly I appreciate his bitchings. But this movie is offensive on the most basic level: it investigates a subject of some gravity with the most shallow of tools, sarcasm, for no better purpose than a cheap laugh or two at the expense of some pathetic folks and, worse, at the expense of Maher's credibility.The sight of a snide hipster casting aspersions from the pulpit of a church whose congregation has invited him in good faith is not funny. It's sad. Worse, it's boring. The movie might have gotten interesting if that fat guy had beat Maher up instead of leaving in a huff. Instead it just repeats itself while Maher laughs at his own jokes.Yes, lots of religious people are worthy of ridicule. That ex-gay guy, sweating bullets, crouching behind his desk like a center waiting for the pass rush, is about as ripe for mockery as anybody I've met lately. So is the self-anointed preacher in thousand dollar suits who can't remember the sermon on the mount. And that dope-worshiper in Amsterdam provides one of the most universally recognizable stoner moments in cinema history.And maybe, as my friend says, this is just payback for all those self-important crusaders who proselytize about my damnation from pulpits, street corners and my own front porch.

It was like being trapped by that couple who wants to show you their slides of their trip to Tampa. I kept waiting for the punch line. There are great punch lines, but they are thinly spaced.Maher finds the expected whackos, and prods them to say the weirdest things. If Michael Moore had made this film, most of what he said would be edited out. It would appear as if Michael were beaming at his crop of deliberately deformed gold fish, smiling beneficently at their weirdness. Mahr holds them in contempt (as do I). The antagonism for these misfits is uncomfortable, and also their angry antagonism to him. It does not make for great humour.Maher attempts to debate some of these subnormal people. They argue back and forth with tis/taints, and Maher adds subtitles supposedly to resolve the argument. This proves nothing. There was no evidence presented on either side.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of all things Bill Maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting. Of course, I am Catholic, come from a well-educated family and go to church of my own volition, which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of Bill's opinions.Bill's problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative. He's correct to document the sociological aspects of it i.e. one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion (or, more accurately, by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of God), but that said he never looks at its positive side. Quite frankly, I think that hell would freeze over before Bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of Calcutta where Mother Theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor. She's dead now of course, but he could easily visit the Jesuit priest in East LA who runs Homeboy Industries, which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills, get their tattoos removed, and to become responsible members of society, or he could visit USC's Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies, which has brought together some of the world's finest theologians, diplomats, and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world's poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world's people who live on less than $1 a day. Of course he won't do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion, and it's so much easier to continue to make snide, superficial jokes.That fits into the other large problem with Bill's movie, which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is. In this movie, you have Maher the Cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational Christian truck stop service, in a night club with a Dutch guy who smokes pot all the time, with the minister of a storefront church in Miami who claims to be the reincarnation of Christ, and with an actor playing Jesus at a "Holy Land" theme park.What you won't see in Bill's film, beyond some superficial speculation alongside a Ph.D in Grand Central Station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses, is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like Notre Dame, BYU, or Wheaton College, who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter. You won't see any serious discussion of any of the writings of C.S. Lewis, G.K. Chesterton, or any papal encyclicals, and of course you also won't find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non-Abrahamic (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) faiths whatsoever. All you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending, snobby elitist from the west side of LA who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut-level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of America that elected George W. Bush (twice) lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it.I get a lot of what Bill's saying, but for someone possessing his intellect and influence, this film was nothing less than pathetic. Anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the Teletubbies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an awful excuse at trying to cover a real topic. I am a liberal and not religious and still felt like this movie made no sense at all. I feel like there are several moments where you ask yourself if it's going to make more sense or get to the point he is trying to make, but it fails miserably on all accounts. This is not a documentary and is not a movie I care to ever have to watch again.The people he chose to have represent the various faiths is not anyone I think is worthy of talking about the religion and he makes fun of them throughout the interview.The way this movie could have been saved is by not calling it a documentary, but a sensationalist look at religion from the eyes of an uneducated entertainer that knows how to reach an audience. Jesus Camp is a good counter to a poorly produced work like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: I have not yet seen this movie! (But I plan to.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I look forward to seeing "Religulous." I'm a Christian by religion, a Progressive by politics and a philosopher by inclination. I've seen lots of people get angry in reaction to this movie. Some are angry at religion, or at the human race for being so gullible as to fall for religion. Some are angry at Bill Maher for ridiculing and renouncing their religion.I know that with so important an issue as whether or not God exists, it would be very hard NOT to get angry discussing these matters, especially if your innermost beliefs are what are being challenged. After centuries of corruption in various churches, the appropriation of religious sentiment by people using it for political advantage, and the utterly destructive stupidity that is televangelism, I think we've asked for this battle. Whether waged through a comic process of argument like in "Religulous," or through metaphor in a work of fiction like in "His Dark Materials," yeah, it's time.But it's not time for anger. It's time to show whichever side we're not on that we've not been prodded into proving them right by abandoning our ability to think clearly under the influence of (righteous or unrighteous) fury.Still, like I said, we all feel strongly about these things. And we're going to be the people we're going to be. And maybe not only religious leaders have made it hard for us to think clearly -- maybe political leaders, world leaders of all stripes, benefit from our confusion too.So if you choose the sane, calm, rational route in dealing with Religulous, whether you agree or disagree with it, I can see that you have a difficult row to hoe. Here's hoping the rest of us screaming zealots don't get you down too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That was a film laughing at the crazy theories of modern religions. Talking to people devoted to them, asking logical questions none who truly believes has ever thought, as religion has nothing to do with logical questions.But today, with so many problems because of religion, a documentary's first goal should be to make people understand how leaders of all religions use their believers in order to achieve political or financial goals, which is approached very externally.Another part that all modern atheists point is to connect religion with terrorism, so as to show the importance of punishing these people, even with nuclear weapons, before they kill their punisher. No, terrorism is not a product of deep faith, terrorism is just another excuse for imperialism.The final part that is not even touched in this documentary is a solution. Which is the solution, how can people really persuade other people that there is no god. No answer is given either.This is a good film for people to know the crazy stuff of religions, so they can simply stop believing. But for an atheist, that's nothing more that amusement..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another pitiful attempt to discredit almost every major religion in the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mediocrity of this movie brought me sadness and desolation. "Religulous", as the title suggests, is a shallow try to appear intelligent, by mocking people's religious beliefs.Of course, picking easy targets (uninformed people, people with poor intellectual abilities or just hateful people who use misunderstood concepts from the Bible to back up their discrimination against others) could be an effective strategy. Pick an idiot from the US who wishes the death of all homosexuals and make him a representative Christian. Then do the same with a Muslim. And so on. Then, once the movie is done, you hope for a little scandal, to make your bank account happy.This movie shows distorted aspects of sociological realities, mixed with true ones, examines peripheral aberrations around the phenomena of faith, in order to push the viewer to a pre-established conclusion: believers (Christians and Muslims that is) are stupid; or primitive; or maybe both. Of course, no one says that in the movie; it's what all the movie is about. The script and editing speak for themselves and more.Another strategy this movie employs is lying to make a point. For example, the fact that Mithra, Krishna and Horus are all born (like Jesus Christ) on the 25th of December from virgin mothers and they rise 3 days after their death (and so on) is simply false. It is a lie. Of course, we, as viewers, could search Wikipedia or any other source of information, to see if there's any truth in that proposition, but unfortunately, very few of us do. That is why manipulation often works. We see a documentary and we imagine that the guys who made it are relatively honest, or at least they mean well...It would take too much time to write about the other lies and cheap speculations in "Religulous" and I guess no one would really be interested in analyzing all of them.Whatever perspective on truth and decency is emphasized in this movie remains elusive. And that is why this movie fails. One cannot really set himself up by trying to bring others down. No decent person - Muslim, Jewish, Atheist, Christian or other - could rely on Bill Maher's speculations. Not because he's bad, but because he didn't understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i'm a fan of bill maher and always liked his bush-bashing on his real time show on HBO but this was doomed the moment maher couldn't decide whether this should be a comedy or a documentary. Larry "borat" charles has no experience at doing this type of movie and its showed. Michael Moore films are usually over the top and ridiculously biased but they have a point, influential, important people are interviewed and even if you don't agree with him, you come away at least feeling there was a meaningful discussion. There was so much potential here as after all, religion is such a contentious, emotive topic but Maher didn't interview anyone of any note in the 3 religions of Islam, Judaism and Christianity and under Charles's direction I guess, He went to some obscure places like a trucker's chapel and a mock holy land experience in Florida, whilst there were a couple of amusing moments, it wasn't funny in a Borat way and it seemed like Maher was provoking arguments for the sake of it. There was no continuation or rhyme of reason in the movie/documentary and once he got bored of talking about Christianity with no real conclusion formed, it was onto Judaism and an extremist rabbi with a particular viewpoint and then a lapsed jews for Jesus shop owner! And for some reason, Maher could only speak to muslims in Amsterdam, and what about Buddism, sikhs, hindus etc, and while I didn't expect to see Billy Graham interviewed, if this was in any way a serious documentary, it would have been nice to see an interview with someone you had heard of at least! Maher tries to sum everything up at the end in an impressive montage but with a diatribe that doesn't really make sense with all the lightweight nonsense you have seen in the previous 90 minutes. Maher tried to belittle and make fun of religions and the people that attract them, there is a funny, engaging movie that can be made about this, bill maher just failed at it, don't give up the day/night gig bill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generation Split for Religulous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently conducted a focus group for a writing class that I am taking and I showed them the trailer for this particular film. Their responses were all quite similar which was surprising considering they all came from various religious backgrounds. They all said they would not go see this film. They did not find the trailer amusing and at least one person in the group implied that Mr. Maher had an agenda with how he asked the questions. An utter lack of identification with Mr. Maher and people of similar beliefs as him occurred. I think this was due in large part to age. People of my generation are not very interested in seeing a documentary, even if it is funny. I am drawn to films of this nature because I think they point out serious flaws with our society that has been put on the backburner. What I take away from my experience is that maybe people around my age only care about a few social issues and spend most of their time focusing on material wants rather than social needs. I think that maybe twenty years on the majority of people in America will be ready for this sort of film, which really is somewhat sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie was funny but the conclusion was false</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest I laughed my head off throughout most of the movie... until the interviews became redundant and Maher comes to his false conclusion that religion causes all of the problems we face. Moreover, Maher portrays entire Muslim societies as nuts because extremists blow themselves up "in the name of religion." Maher becomes extremely pretentious in his interviews and will not listen, rather dictate the course of the interview. Maher concludes one man's death in a scene was caused by religion. The man he was interviewing wanted to make a point about the guy being disrespectful - and how that had as much to do with his slaying - but Maher wouldn't hear it. It's like Maher did some reading and became knowledgeable about religions repeating the same stories, and falsely turns to the conclusion that because these guys believe in something that is fake, they are all nuts and religion is bad (because some blow themselves up). He never ponders the fact that their are extremists in every faction of life, and without religion to conclude that everything would be peachy is ignorant. I will give him a thumbs up on the history lessons and for noting that religion is nothing more than a fairy tale, but a big thumbs down on his conclusions. In my opinion, as an atheist, the world is better off with religion, as the vast majority of religions teach good morals.</fullReview>

I'm a big fan of Maher's work overall, and I think he stayed within his framework (comedy from observation) while making some serious points. Good social satire is comprised of both. If faith and religious beliefs were indeed "personal", there would be no need for the very large organizations with rules and membership fees, economic wealth and political power. There's good that's come out of religion, but bloodshed in its name continues, and it's not likely to stop anytime soon. One of Maher's wisest observations is that doubt is a luxury afforded to the comfortable - I see that as an argument supported by the the impoverished and downtrodden masses that historically fall in line with the extreme fundamentalists of every faith. RELIGULOUS is not an indictment of any particular religion, but of blind faith in general, and the perils of it. With some really good laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If, like me, you consider yourself an agnostic, or an atheist, you may find this film amusing. I had a good time, but Maher doesn't really bring up anything terribly new, and he goes more for laughs than serious discussion. When interviewing people, he can't seem just to listen to them for a couple of minutes; sometimes he won't even let them finish a sentence. Sometimes, he'll start on an interesting discussion, but cut it short as soon as he has the sound bites he needs.If you're religious, but willing to listen to some arguments against religion, you'll probably do better with a good book; look into Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens to begin with. This movie will probably just offend you; you'll be able to say of the more ridiculous religious beliefs exposed in the movie, "well that's not my religion." This movie is not a serious intellectual discussion, although Maher does go into serious mode when he sums up at the end. It's a moderately funny attack on religion for the benefit of people who already agree with its point of view. That does include me, but I still can't rate it all that highly.</fullReview>

Then when he meets people who probably have actually something sensible to say he interrupts them, cuts out scenes twisting their words and so on. He quickly loses all journalistic integrity and it becomes clear what this movie is all about; its about Maher's somewhat fanatical abjection towards religion.OK, there are some funny scene's and there are some good points made here and there. But it has to be said that there are some profane insinuations which made the movie not just bad but dangerously propagandistic.I think its best put like this: Maher's frantic twists to show the religious believers are blind to the truth have blinded himself in the process.

		<fullReview>A very well made documentary, Religulous is an enjoyable look at religion through the eyes of Bill Maher. As a Christian Fundamentalist I was not too offended at his premise that religion is dangerous to humanity, mainly because of the examples he selected to validate that idea. I could have offered a few more examples about the obvious hypocrisies and intolerances that have plagued all religions. But Bill didn't call on me. Nor did he interview anyone that might have better challenged his beliefs. I am acquainted with one of the characters interviewed and personally feel that this person's approach to Christianity does more harm than good.Also, his political bias is revealed with the images of George Bush and John McCain as Christian advocates. With the upcoming presidential election it reduces a hopefully enlightened perspective to that of mere propaganda.Bill Maher, like so many that hold to his philosophy, was apparently influenced by a sour, religious upbringing. Bertrand Russell, perhaps the most formidable to contradict Christian thought was just such a fellow. It is easy to understand their biased approach to religion in general. But many have endured the spiritual inadequacies of their institutions. No better example than those Christians who risked their lives to hide the Jews from the terror of Nazi Germany, or the Christians who saved thousands of blacks from the cruelty of plantation masters.We live in troubled times. It is too easy to point fingers at those we think are responsible. But, we shouldn't be afraid to look at history. It is a better teacher than Bill Maher. Many injustices and much cruelty can be attributed to religion. But, the one religion, the machinery of which murdered more than one-hundred million of its own people in the twentieth century is conveniently overlooked. That religion is socialism. It has been far more crushing to liberty. Its dogma reduces man to subservience. Any objections to its postulates are dealt with promptly and without mercy.It is sad that America is following Europe. They now mock their religious heritage, as if they've ascended to a higher level of consciousness. I see nothing in their recent past and nothing in their present that suggests any enlightenment whatsoever. But why expect anything different from America, whose people are predominantly white and of European ancestry?</fullReview>

(I know, right) alludes to Anakin Skywalker. Bill Maher was comparing the story of Jesus to childhood fairy tales and somehow, Star Wars rears it's head. You know that thousand year old story about a savior born of a virgin, healing the sick, walking on water and dying for our sins... yeah that one. Well, it threads to many different religions.Maher's point was lost in the cuff of carbonated spittle, dropped popcorn and laughter that hit the crowd right after the kid utters "The Phantom Menace". We all knew where he was going. We all knew that Anakin Skywalker = Jesus and The Emperor = Bush. Yoda is still Yoda... anyway that heft of cultural insight translated well into our socially apathetic and inept neurological misfires and Bill plays on or off them in this film. No finger pointing, just ask hard questions and let interviewees hang themselves with their own answers. To note - one money grubbing black pimp of a pastor and one ex-gay, reformed, lesbian loving married pastor who ignores the fact that yes... he's still gay. And he has great hair.This film is a spoof of religious extremism across the globe. To cut religion and faith out of spirituality becomes a matter of splitting hairs as applied to the irrational, sometimes erratic behavior (see: Vatican priest with no collar) of the folks in this film. All religions take a hit, even Maher's own family gets some with a catholic past life that voided his own Jewish mother. Maher labels himself apatheist (a mix of apathy and theism/atheism) which alerts one's mind to apathetic agnosticism, pragmatic agnosticism and practical atheism. Not to be confused with anti-Catholicism or scientology. Yeah, it got a little heavy handed but Larry Charles manages to reel it in. I expected Maher to browbeat the audience with a rabid stream-of-consciousness rant of indifferentism as if he had an infection of "Dennismillerism". But, much to my surprise - he steered clear of that. And it works.Indeed, somewhere Dennis Miller sits in a dark and lonely room, suffering from conservative pumping chagrin and right-wing ascension depression. He has to be innately bitter about his hip laden social quasi-political rhetoric going into the ears of 10 million dumb ass Americans (specifically football fans just didn't get it) and thinking... screw Bill Maher. I'm better than Bill Maher.By the hour mark, Maher makes me forget he's a comedian. He knows the word restraint... sort of. This film was cerebral pushing, no abstracts allowed so every Maher nonresponse to his on screen foes yanked a big response from the audience I sat with. A lot of liberal freebase independents, curiously quiet religious zealots, some cute chubby lesbians and left-wing, new wave Obama lovers sprinkled with a gay guy here an there. There was one lone black guy and he laughed his tail off.Yeah, that was me.</fullReview>

Another problem I had watching this film (unbeknownst to me at the time) was my collegiate religious studies degree. I guess my analysis and prior exposure to the material confounded Bill Maher's superficial glossing-over of complex issues with his snippy attempts at humor. The soundtrack was probably the best thing about the film and that was only marginal at best. You know you won't be rating the film high when, upon reflection, it becomes shockingly apparent that the trailer had so far surpassed the actual film that this simple fact almost forces you to subconsciously wander over to the ticket office to request a refund before you realize that you have to take the bad with the good. My problem with this movie can succinctly be stated as taking a complex issue (religion) and slanting the end-product to satisfy non-believers while not adequately allowing the opposition's most-learned adherents to clearly state their case. Bill Maher can make the film any way that he would like to, ***but*** you can't call it a documentary if you aren't telling the whole truth from all perspectives making up the whole. This should be relabeled as an attempt at theological humor. Most of the questions are just and worthwhile, but the answers shouldn't have been coming from the Jesus actor at the Orlando Holyland amusement park or from Arkansas's senator.

		<fullReview>This documentary was recommended to me by a couple of friends, so I checked it out a couple of minutes ago.I must say I'm disappointed. I expected a film that would seriously question the origin of various practices and beliefs that exist within many religions and delve deeper into how these practices and beliefs relate to the concept of god.But instead we're treated to a film that parodizes the (religious) habits of various people of various obscure groups (trucker's chapel? mormons? the Latin guy who is the descendant of Christ?) and Bob then questions these people about sometimes fairly complex interpretations of scripture which they then unsurprisingly fail to answer satisfyingly.There are a few times that Bob does actually get sensible answers to parts of his questions but these subjects are unfortunately questioned for a very brief period of time (the first catholic priest that's also an astronomer, the second priest at the vatican, the human genome project scientist that believes in god); he actually avoids their interpretation of religion and god because it conflicts with his key point: religion should end.If you're looking for a funny documentary about how silly some people can act when questioned about their religion, then by all means, have a laugh, but if you're looking for a more serious film about the underpinnings of the reason for religion, the reason for how religious groups evolve.. look elsewhere.Also, the fact that he interviews Geert Wilders, a extreme right-wing politician in the netherlands as a source to say something negative about Islam is just cheap. Wilders has been preaching hate against Islamic people in the netherlands for the last three years and in my opinion the worst possible source to question! Obviously it is not surprising that he would say something negative about muslims.A mediocre docutainment at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't worry about spoilers, don't bother. Maher speaks like a petulant, fearful child wanting attention. It's clear in everything Maher does that he's afraid he won't be liked, he seems terrified. Just don't give Bill Maher any notice. Maher is just a barking pit, frothing at no one. His conclusions are all unfounded and ridiculous. Maher's attitude reflects a consuming fear, it stinks up all his work. He's on the verge of a breakdown with every breath. He probably needs serious counseling. Bill Maher's conscience must be working overtime for Maher to work SO HARD to quell it with this dumb movie. Don't support Maher, just pray for his soul. Religulous is only for the self-loathing. All others can pass on by Religulous with a sigh of relief they dodged a real waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this film 4 out of 10 just because Bill Maher is a funny guy, but I think he should stick to comedy!! I was really disappointed by the film itself. I mean he was preaching all film long that he is agnostic/atheist, &amp; the minute he met that Rabbi who is 'Jewish but not Zionist', who did not fit into his classic half-Jewish upbringing ideas, he just stormed out of the room!! how is that any different from the catholic extremists that stormed out of the room when Maher was confronting them with ideas that did not fit THEIR ideas! From that point on, I could not see him as a credible presenter at all. Jumping at several points to throw the holocaust card for no reason at all! Mixing religion and politics at so many points, a pitfall of all people who either 'did not read their books' or are 'spreading propaganda'. putting images of Qadafi and Arafat along with the commentary 'religious extremists'!! these guys are socialist atheists that show up at mosques from time to time when they are sober with a TV camera! Being of a Jewish upbringing myself, now agnostic, I felt that this film was made by another Jewish guy, not atheist or agnostic as he wants us to believe, i just could not buy it! I did not find his film well researched or credible at all. Too shallow for my taste. It is funny if what u r looking for are some laughs, but that is all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Global Ambiguity Addressed; Incomprehensible?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the reviews posted by people here is quite compelling (to review as well, that is) on it's own, just due to the hypocrisy of their claims in spite of a movie warning of just that. It makes me sick to my stomach to be entirely honest (the people that are discounting this movie here on IMDb, that is, not the movie). Have any of you even considered that you might be wrong?FYI (relevant): A review for a movie, or anything else for that matter, is supposed to be unbiased, in that it allows the reader to gather their own perspective of the movie, from your facts. However, those of you who discounted this movie, have yet to even self-diagnose, especially in the regarding matter. And for this reason, not only are your "texts" a waste of time and a degredation to yourself publicly, but also an impowerment for this movie - you truly are blind within your mind, and you have proved it publicly. I feel terribly sorry for you, and hope that you find peace of mind in the future... with, or without, religion, whatever it may be. Good luck - sincerely.On to the review... As many have already mentioned, the movie has a limited scope in that those whom Bill interviewed are not exactly the most credible sources for debate. However, the movie's point remains the same... Again as stated by others, the point is to attempt to get the ambiguous set of people's state of mind (globally), into a less subconscious state of presence at a mental (and national!) level. Obviously, it is something that needs addressed. To what extent, appears to be the most bothersome portion of this movie for most people (Heed this statement).This movie, alike others of it's genre, intrigue and invoke deep thought into one's own being. If you aren't ready to explore those depths, then this movie is not for you, and it will very likely offend you. A good way to know where you reside ("conscious" versus "unconscious"; alternatively &amp; respectively: "watch the movie" versus "dont watch the movie"), is to first realize that your human - unique in that you are self conscious, self aware, and therefore able to self diagnose, unlike other organisms on Earth (think about it for a second). Does that mean you have a purpose, or does that mean you NEED a purpose (Consider the differences between the two)? What's wrong with not having a purpose, and where does that lead? Scary isn't it? Hence religion.In all literal senses, this movie gives an audience a taste of the perspective of logical, neutral, coherent thought on religion, unbiased by culture or other mediums. It is agnosticism, mixed with chilling humor (funny, but deep - listen to the Senator scene), and has a finale providing all the evidence required for proving it's necessity to be publicly viewed. Truly, this movie, assuming you can comprehend it's context, is a shocking documentary revealing the fear within each of us, as varied as that specific fear may be.I recommend this movie to everyone, but as with all things in life, consider the opposite as well. That is my recommendation.For the reason that there are (apparently!) still so many people blinded and biased by culture and religion within IMDb.com reviews alone, even after watching this movie, I feel it's absolutely necessary to give this movie a 5 out of 10, as it has apparently failed it's central purpose. Such a misfortune. Hopefully there are still many people out there that have the mental capacity to take an unbiased view on their reality, and own mental state. Not everyone, it would seem, can think without acting first (that's right, acting - as in charactarizing their output based on beliefs, prior to developing a conscious thought). And this document so labeled for this reason: "Global Ambiguity Addressed; Incomprehensible?", with emphasis on "Incomprehensible?".On a personal level however, I'd rate it differently. Father George Coyne, PhD. 'Nuff said. He gleans with intelligence and experience, and his interview should have been so much longer, in my opinion; the one source that was, without a doubt, credible. However the movie addressed very important issues, that should be given much thought in the coming years by mankind, globally. Thus, I give it a 9 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Selling Doubt, in a local theater near you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film hoping that it was educational. The introduction it self admits "I am selling doubt." Wow. What a powerful statement. I am not a religious person. I claim no religion and yet I also speak against the root of most religions. I personally believe that what most religions teach -the ones that teach selflessness, is "Hope." Hope that even though you may live in a world corrupt with greed and gluttony, there is some good and there is a greater power that rewards those who are good in the end. If that alone guides someones life so that they strive to be a better person, then I have to say that particular religion is good, for that individual.What this movie does is point out all the obvious flaws in the religion, mostly the inaccuracies of the bible from a scientific point of view. Congratulations, captain obvious. Do you expect an Oscar for such trivialities? Everyone on the outside can quickly point out whats wrong. How about a film about what is right? Do you really have to depict President Bush as a religious fanatic? Was he not democratically elected? Do we not use popular vote (yes, I know how the electoral college works)? I get your not so subtle point, Mr Mathers. That we, the United States, can not continue to elect our nation's leader based solely on religion. Or maybe the point was more about how religion is just plain stupid, from your point of view, and that Bush must be stupid if he is religious. I get your point. I just think that your point is weak.It becomes obvious that this film is not only Anti Christian, but Anti Conservative. How much of this film was dedicated to defending homosexuals? I am sorry, but what exactly does that have to do with religion? Homosexuals, Jesus Christ, and the Jewish Holocaust are all about the same...right? The execution of over 6 million Jews, a god sending down his son, and homosexuals not being able to get tax breaks...that's all of equal importance. Hundreds of years from now, we will read about how those poor homosexuals weren't permitted to have a Christian marriage... right? Wow. So anyway... he uses the word "homophobic" several times. Because anyone who is not tolerant of homosexuality is obviously 'phobic', afraid of it. Well using the same line of logic, wouldn't that make this a "Religi-phobic" movie? I mean it just seems that he has such a huge intolerance for religion, especially Christianity, that he even made a movie to express his dislike.What I find most interesting is that the interviews are mostly conducted with apparently uneducated individuals. Why not interview someone with some intelligence? Ask some poor back woods, high school drop out, drug addled, individuals a few questions and I am supposed to act surprised that you stumped them? I only took one class on Stat's in college, but I learned enough from that course to know that the observation on his survey sample was not an accurate representation of the population. Go ask 100 US Marines what they think of the US Navy, and act surprised when the unanimous results are that they think the Navy are all limp wristed sissys.Whatever. Unfortunately I watched the movie in its entirety. My conclusion is 4 stars. Why four, because even 'Leprechaun 3' got 4 stars, and that's about where this film ranks with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw trailers of this movie before release and was intrigued and amused. It seemed to be an intelligent and insightful piece of ripping apart basic beliefs that do not stand the test of scientific examination. I was disappointed after seeing the movie that Maher took the easy way out. While the segment on Catholics and Mormons is well researched and intelligently laid out, with quotes from the gospel and scripture and the holy book to substantiate the theological beliefs, the section on Jews and Muslims is based on opinion and footage, and is ridiculously biased. Very few scientists were brought in to provide the alternative view point. And Maher spends a lot of time with crazy people advertising crazy cults. What could have been a breakthrough documentary became another opinionfest. What I find interesting is that while Maher spends plenty of time talking about war and organized religion, there was no mention of athiesm and war...ala communism in the 20th century......My question to him: just what is he selling, doubt or a dislike for anything different from himself? If the latter is true than what makes him different from a jew, Muslim or Christian?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>View of Religulous by a long time Bill Maher watcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**I saw the film today. The theatre was almost full and well received by the audience,with much laughter ensuing. Although I've watched Bill Maher for some time,I am ambivalent about his persona in a number of ways. I do find him very articulate.and very succinct with much dry wit.Perhaps this is why I enjoy watching him albeit frequently disagreeing.His overwhelming hubris and supercilious attitude to others can be a turnoff.Bill made a number of good points about the obvious fantasies and flaws of the monotheistic faiths,although completely excluding the far eastern beliefs of Buddhism,Hinduism,etc. probably because of time restraints;and this is understandable.He appeared to deal for the most part to the fanatical fringes of monotheism without giving an evenhanded view to the benefits.Fortunately,most human beings are endowed with a superego or conscience that helps them to perform the "right action",and the proper religious teaching can ameliorate this.I see no harm in teaching young children "creationism", and then allowing their young minds to sort out the rational when they mature. The first century(c.e.)teacher,Hillel, when confronted by an apostate to describe his religion while standing on one foot, simply replied that "what is distasteful to you do not to others.The rest is commentary." A sixth century pope described the "seven deadly sins" that were probably taught centuries before,and if followed would improve all humanity.Religious fanaticism can be evil,but so can extreme forms of socialism,communism,and fascism.Agnosticism can be appreciated, but the agnostic or atheist must also appreciate that the "big bang" theory or the accidental arrangement of myriads of atoms and molecules into a form of meaningful existence leaves much scepticism also.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is nothing more than a guy who really, really, hates religion going round looking for people who fit his view of it. He purposefully seeks out the crazy Evangelical nutcase minority and attacks people with pre-prepared arguments until he finds someone who looks stupid on camera. I mean, seriously, what kind of Biblical education do you expect a trucker to have? They aren't truckers because they are massively well read. It is downright exploitative to pick on them. It isn't all that hard to make anything look stupid if you use the techniques Maher does, especially if your director is the same one who did Borat (another incredibly manipulative film that indulges in fakery).His editing is highly manipulative and his attempts to seem impartial and balanced are entirely phony.Overall, I am appalled at this film, Maher sets out to paint every religious person on the planet (i.e. almost everyone) as believing the same things as the crazies with their anachronistic animatronic dinosaurs. He presents none of the good that Christianity does, the focus on education, the charity work, the staggering number of people helped and brought back from the brink, and instead sets out to build what is nothing more than a crude caricature. In the end Maher comes across as nothing more than an unpleasant, elitist, hate-filled, manipulative bully without the courage to challenge anyone who matters, not even with a truly devious editing team behind him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not particularly funny... but we can't have everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher is known for his irreverence as a comedian, and that is perhaps where his strong point is in comedy. But this movie seems less like a comedy of errors or religious comedy and more like a chance for him to rant and sneer. In that sense it's tone is very similar to Ben Stein's "Expelled" - about as equally biased as well. The difference is, Ben Stein's bias was based on unfounded, moronic, and completely deceitful work whereas Maher manages to actually create a story with some degree of integrity.It should be no secret that Maher's film is going to upset many deeply religious people. However, being religious myself, I wasn't particularly offended (although to be fair he didn't cover my religion in any real depth). His interviews are the focal point of the film and where his comedic nature really seems to come in - but only so much. He manages to pick a fairly diverse bunch, including some anti-Zionist Jews (which I was aware existed, but wasn't aware of any particular interviews done with them). I was particularly pleased to see that he had chosen to interview the man in charge of AnswersInGenesis.org - a hackjob website which for some reason is still considered a legitimate source by creationists.I felt like Maher was trying to go for the easy stuff, unfortunately, as the vast majority of his interviews tended to be with either the ridiculous or the foolish. The answer is probably very simple - a genuine religious leader wouldn't give him the time of day and would probably not give him an opportunity to be portrayed like a fool. His inclusion of Scientology and Raelians seemed rather stupid, as it (a) first implies that they are even legitimate religions, which they clearly are not and (b) tries to distort the idea of what other religious beliefs are. There's plenty of things you can make fun of in Judaism, Christianity or Islam without having to resort to recruiting the most socially retarded elements of humanity.All in all, a very average movie but not a bad one. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religulous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religulous is a new documentary where comedian Bill Maher travels across the world and more or less dissects some of the biggest and most well known religions in the world and states his own problems, disbelief and feelings that they ultimately can sometimes do more harm than good to people. The film has some very good comedic moments and it makes sense since Maher is a comedian and wrote the screenplay for the film. I think this film will ultimately divide audiences. I think there are those that want to go see it because of the sensationalism of it and to have a good laugh because we all know that anything controversial brings in a lot of money at the box office and really perks up people's interests regarding said piece of art and in this case it is a film. I think that there will be some religious people who do decide to see the film, just to hear Maher's atheistic views on it and to see if there is any ground or proof to what he is saying and also to after the film discuss their own values and what makes faith so important to them. And lastly I think there will be a group of people who would deem the content of this film to be blasphemous and would in no way ever consider seeing it, or supporting it's theatrical, or DVD release. I myself am a Christian and have been going to church for most of my life. That being said, I wanted to see this film to get Bill Maher's views not only on my religion, but other religions out there as well that I may not know enough about. I also thought that this film would help me to realize just how much my own spiritual faith is important to me and would get me to have a long think about it afterwards. After, I did see this film the friend I saw the film with had a quite long conversation with me regarding religion that I found to be fascinating and this is one of the reasons I decided to see the film is so that I could get into a good conversation with someone about what I had just seen. At the same time I can see how this film could be very offensive to many people with different faith backgrounds. Maher takes a lot of easy shots at these religions and often makes the people he interviews look ridiculous and like they do not know what they are talking about. On the other hand, I have to give Maher credit because he seems to be well versed in many different scriptures and have enough knowledge about religion and theology to have the arguments that he brings forth with this film. I am sure than even people who have a religious background such as myself will often have questions regarding our faith walk, or just religion in general that we wish we could have answers to right now, but a lot of the time we will just have to wait and see because the answers are not right in front of us. I think the main problem Maher has with religions is that there are so many different denominations of one faith and it can overall become quite political. I also think he is strongly against all the violence that has been done in the world because of, or for religion. I personally enjoyed that this film made me examine my own faith and appreciate it even more and I liked the questions and discussions the film led to after I had watched it. Overall the film is quite thought provoking and does have some humorous parts and for being as daring as the film is, I have to give it credit for that. As, I said before this film will not be for everyone, but after reading this review, or even watching a trailer for the film, I think you should know what category you fall into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying, uninformative, and on the whole not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed in this movie. I live in the deep fringe of TV hinterland and so had seen Bill Maher only briefly. I had formed the impression that he was intelligent, well informed, and amusing, and so I was looking forward to some enlightenment and humour.As an atheist, I agree with almost all of the conclusions. Unfortunately Mr. Maher's arrogant, smug, flippant, bombastic, and patronising style robbed him of all credibility. Thinking atheists will be, like me, appalled at his superficial and dismissive treatment. Devout persons will dismiss him as unworthy of notice.His style aside, errors in fact undermine his conclusions. For example, he states that no eyewitnesses wrote books of the present bible. I was taught that two of the gospel writers, Mathew and John, were apostles and so accompanied Jesus through much or all of his ministry. Another gospel writer, Mark, probably followed Jesus closely. Several writers of epistles (Peter, James, John) were also apostles.In his discussion of Islam Bill implied that the Kaaba was a rock in Mecca. No, it is a building attributed by the faithful to Abraham. There is an odd black rock, possibly a meteorite, in one corner that is regarded by some as originating in the time of Adam and Eve. The building once contained hundreds of idols of several tribes, these were destroyed by the Prophet Muhammad in 630AD since which time Islam has considered the building its most holy site.So, with appalling style, wrong information, bigoted interviews, Bill has produced a movie that is uninformative, annoying, superficial, and not even funny. It is not worth anyone's time of money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mahr asks: Why do dinosaurs and people living together in a time period have any effect in your belief in god?Ham replies: Are you god? *(cut away to a completely different scene)Seems cut and dry right? The problem is that you cant trust someone like Maher to produce a fair film.I cant recall one time when Maher sat down, asked a question, and let someone speak for more than 30 seconds without the scene changing, interrupting them, or scoffing/chuckling while rolling his eyes. Anyone competent enough to give a legitimate answer such as Ken Ham, was cut off or edited to all hell in order to make them look foolish. While Maher on the other hand was given ample time to elaborate on why he hates religion or how intellectually regressive it is to believe in god. To top it all off, Maher purposely avoided any creation scientists or religious scholars, and instead chose to feast on bible thumping middle aged women/seniors. Many times he would ask a really specific scientfic or historical question that few people could be prepared to answer on the spot, and watch these people crash and burn trying to come up with something. Even if someone did come back with a reasonable answer, we likely would not have seen it due to the editing.Something that also set off my deception meter was when Maher referred to god as selfish and jealous while talking about the ten commandments with the actor Jesus at holy land. He went on to criticize god about feeling a petty human emotion. Unfortunately for Maher, the word jealous meant something entirely different back then. In the times when the bible was written, Jealous meant zealous or over zealously. So when the bible says our god is a jealous god, what the real meaning of that is god is a zealous god. He protects what he loves with fierce passion and devotion.The last thing I will touch upon is some pretty obscene quote mining I happened to catch.Thomas Jefferson's quote about Christianity was taken grossly out of context and only for face value: "Christianity is the most perverted system that ever shone on man."Jefferson had quite the affinity for the teachings of Christ (minus all the bogus supernatural and miraculous claims). As such, he edited the New Testament to glean such ludicrousies out; which Religulous correctly explained. So, when Jefferson speaks on being a Christian or Christianity, he often doesn't refer to the church or its teachings as "Christianity," unless he explicitly states it. Otherwise, it would be confused with the teachings of Christ, which he did not despise.Jefferson confirms this in a letter: No doctrines of (Jesus) lead to schism. It is the speculations of crazy theologists which have made a Babel of a religion the most moral and sublime ever preached to man, and calculated to heal, and not to create differences. These religious animosities I impute to those who call themselves his ministers, and who engraft their casuistries on the stock of his simple precepts. I am sometimes more angry with them than is authorised by the blessed charities which he preached.All in all Maher was hilariously funny (and douchey), and kept me entertained throughout the duration.Unfortunately, this is not a fair representation of any religious belief whatsoever, and its clear that Maher is out of his element when it comes to unedited debate.</fullReview>

That to me would seem self-defeating. It seems to me, someone more enlightened, or on a higher level of consciousness would see the good religion does in peoples lives all over the world, and how any religious belief system has inherent truth and wisdom that can be used toward the good of mankind. It really doesn't matter what is true or not. It's a paradox anyway and designed that way. To quote from the highly spiritual television program 'Futurama,' God says, "If you do everything right, nobody will ever be sure you did anything at all."

		<fullReview>"I truly hope religious people are not quick to brush this film off." This was said in an earlier comment. I found it interesting as it pretty much exposes the ignorance that folks like Bill Maher suffer from. Ignorance that is most obvious in this mockumentary.Maher gets one thing correct -- religion sucks. Unfortunately, in his typical manner, Maher produced something without really researching the matter. If he had, he may have found out that, according to what is written is New Testament scriptures, Jesus himself hated religion.And if he went back to the Old Testament scriptures he may have found where they tell us that God wanted nothing to do with religion.So honestly, Maher isn't telling us anything new. All he's doing is what's typical of us humans, and that is putting his own spin on it -- for his own gain.But back to the comment I quoted...I believe Maher also used the word "hope" when referring to what he would like to see take place in the future. Therein lies the the ray of enlightenment that so many like Maher, in their haste to prove their own religion's (institutional thinking, of which atheism falls under) rightness, fail to notice."Now faith is the substantiation of things... hoped for,... the evidence of things unseen." Hebrews 11:1...To hope is to have faith, and faith is the intrinsic essence of God. Not religion.Religion actually robs people of faith. Religion is simply a man-made institution. It comes from the Latin word ligo (or liga), meaning to tie -- specifically, with many small cords (e.g. traditions, rules, regulations). "Re" simply means to repeat.Religion is therefore a form of bondage.That said, ignorance which results from the blinding pride Maher has in his beliefs (although he hopes humans humble themselves) is as bad as religion. Actually, it's what leads to and empowers religion.Faith, which is the evidence of our hope, and thus as real as real gets, is a deep matter that requires a lifetime of consideration. Which is way too long a period of time for people like Maher, where making a movie (i.e. making money) is concerned.So, Maher's movie -- no more than another example of the blind leading the blind in an attempt to sneak some shekels out of your pocket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh yes Bill Maher (the interviewer) in the show tried his best ( with his prepared questions ) to launch his interrogation with the unprepared respondents.In summary, Bill Maher seem not to believe at all in Christ while claiming that he wasn't sure ....in the plot.Bill Maher, just because the miracle has not happened in your life, that doesn't mean is not true at all. Its just the same for those who don't believe in ghosts just because they have never encountered one.I did not witness the events in World War 2, does that mean World War 2 did not exist at all. You can show me all the historical sites, history books, photos, witness and etc. I can say its all a conspiracy.Yes, some viewers applauded for your documentary in hoping that's the final truth they have discovered.But the truth is that you are making assumption based on what you have encounter in your life and turning it into an answer and the truth for your audience.I pray that you ( Bill Maher )will have an encounter with Jesus and have a different opinion by then. When you believe, do it make into a movie and let the world know so that your audience will not continue to be in doubt.www.spiritlessons.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible. Maher at his worst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Religulous" (2008) of Bill Maher is simply terrible. The way he interviews different people, religious people, around the world is deeply disrespectful. He never tries to understand them, but always shows in the movie that only he, Bill Maher, is right and everybody else is wrong. Sarcasm is a completely separate story. "IN MY STRONG OPINION" it is a very bad offense against society to have sarcasm. Maher, with no surprises, is full of sarcasm. It is everywhere in the movie, starting in the very beginning. The thing is that the movie's creator miserably fails to understand that religious people have the right to believe. You can disagree with religion, but you have no right to offend it. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arrogant and condescending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridicule can be an effective tool whether it is used in a political campaign or a film that promotes a particular point of view. In Religulous, a documentary directed by Larry Charles and written by comedian Bill Maher, the ridicule and put-downs are used to convey the message that religion is an irrational and dangerous force in the world. Much of what happens in the film is quite funny, especially the interweaving of film clips from overblown religious extravaganzas that underline the absurdity of the theme. Unfortunately, however, the film's snarky humor and willingness to tackle sacred cows are negated by its use of straw men as fodder for its attacks, its selective and arbitrary editing, and a tone that is arrogant and condescending.Maher begins Religulous by telling us about his upbringing. We learn that he is half-Jewish and half-Catholic and was raised as a Catholic until the age of thirteen. He interviews his elderly mother who confesses that she does not know what the family believed and never discussed with her husband the reason why he stopped attending services. From this relatively sane beginning, Maher deposits us in various fun houses such as the Truckers Chapel in Raleigh, North Carolina, the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, the Holy Land Experience in Orlando, Florida, and the Growing in Grace Ministry in Miami where we meet mostly fringe elements. The people Maher interviews are not individuals who can articulate a coherent theology or speak from their experience in a convincing manner.They are TV evangelists, threatening rednecks, a Jew who is in denial about the Holocaust, a Democratic Senator from Arkansas, ex-gays and ex-Mormons, and Jose Luis de Jesus Miranda, a preacher with 100,000 followers who believes that he is the second coming of Christ. Maher even impersonates a Scientologist at the Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park in London, but has no room for Hindus or Buddhists, two of the world's biggest religions. Interviews are edited to produce the biggest laughs not the most thought. Captions are inserted on the screen that contradict what an individual is saying while the interview is still going on and derogatory comments are later made about what was said later.Other sequences offer just as little food for the mind: an actor in a theme park reenacts the Passion and is duly whipped and beaten to the applause of the spectators, Maher debates Muslims on whether the Koran calls for the death of infidels, and talks to an Israeli entrepreneur who has devised the technology to subvert the laws of the Sabbath. He makes some good points about the absurdity of a literal interpretation of bible stories such as Jonah and the Whale and the lack of evidence for the historicity of Jesus, yet for someone who proudly proclaims that he is an agnostic who does not know, Maher is not looking for answers ? he believes he already has them. Nowhere in this film is there a hint of a serious search for knowledge or an understanding of the essence of the religious experience.While a strong case can be made about the excesses of religion and the wrongs conducted in its name throughout history, Religulous does not develop a case based on historical events but demonizes a few eccentrics as an example of how "dangerous" it is. The spiritual experience is more than organized religion or an ancient scripture. It is a very personal experience that tells us that reality is not a vantage point we can perceive through our sense perception, but is "a dream for which there exists nothing outside of it.", a much vaster experience that allows the ineffable beauty of the universe to sear into our souls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what is and what should never be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading the first few comments about this "documentary" and I have thus decided, as objective as possible, to dissect and examine the real issues. Warning! This will not be something about personal beliefs, as they have no relevance here. This is about the movie itself.First of all, this?footage - in lack of a better word - is not a documentary. By definition such a work should try to explain a point on some matters, without inoculating certain conceptions or thoughts. However, "Religulous" tries to show (I expect) the ridiculous in religion. And as religion tends to comprise, in its general denomination, the faith of different cultures, it should have a pluralist approach. Which basically resumes to the following: if you're doing a documentary that talks about religion, you're on a treacherous path.Basically you are expected to make fun of the so called "differences", but before you do that, you might actually want to research what these are about. As a person who reads about religion, I can asses this footage as being insufficient, badly-put and misguided. (e.g. while making indirect allusions to Judaism throughout the movie, Maher avoids it conveniently, which can only be explained by the fact that nowadays it's not fashionable to make fun of Judaism. Thus he sadly falls in what his own trap and he turns out to be not the ecstatic preacher of "I don't know", but a product of the neuro-religious symptoms he so tries to cast away?Instead, it would have been more religulous to try to explain why the trends in society, those he very well follows, have a certain religious tendency in themselves.)Secondly, I very well despised the numerous threads that were brought into discussion and never pursued. He starts on an idea and abandons as soon as the next laugh comes along. Not only this, but with few exceptions, he does not exploit the religious issues themselves, as the people who believe in them. The selection includes a variety of persons that are not only inclined to have mad beliefs or preconceptions, but a very false approach. It's basically you general average exploitation of 1) people who are week, 2) people who are seen as outcasts 3) people who do not have English as a native language (and by the way, half of the time I'm not sure that they really understood what he was babbling about)and 4) senators (yes, they sadly make a category by themselves).So what I would have expected was to have reasonable opponents, with a downright capacity to explain and sustain what they believe in. Therefore, if we do not accept this as an error, it only means that this show was about how religion influences the masses, which is not the same as extracting the funny facts of religion at its raw core. This brings us to the third and final point. It's true I'm being critical, but I have hardly received what I was expecting when I've heard about this. The positive aspects: it was funny, his eloquence is really something to look at, I enjoyed the general combination. Still, this is not a documentary.It should be classified as an essay? a prospect or even a sort of wicked stand-up and make fun of, but not a documentary! The information it provides it's at its minimum, it makes fun of dogmatism but not of religion, so it could have been much more than it really is. I suppose we'll just have to wait until someone produces a real show?</fullReview>

I can't imagine, but. . . what we get in this film is basically this strutting smirking brat making idiotic arguments with people who don't "reason" about their faith to begin with but even if they did how compelling are arguments like, "if mary was a virgin why was it only in two of the gospels what did the other guys say 'oh that wasn't important' fughetabbout it?!" HAR HAR HAR. What sort of logic is that? He isn't one whit less ridiculous or moronic in his own way than the people I watched him interact with he's just really intolerant and rude and after a very short while I really couldn't stand his face! What does he prove? What does he disprove? OK there are a lot of idiots in the world and Bill Maher is one of them, only he thinks he's really Hot Pockets? And his parents seem to have no idea why they raised him the way he did, but hey he's got the millions and so he must be smarter than the people buying tickets to this shebang. I couldn't parse it. And for the record I was raised catholic but "lost my faith" as they say at about age 12-13. Maybe when I was about that age I might have enjoyed this kind of thing but I doubt it. A better film that had a point I think is. . . Thy Kingdom Come... Thy Will Be Done which examined the rise of the moral majority in 1988. However, disclaimer: I did not watch a whole heck of a lot of this movie. I really couldn't bear it. I'd rather see someone try to reason with people that if God has laws don't you think it's up to God to punish people for breaking them, not for people to be so concerned about what other people are doing to p.o. God? I don't know, did he ask that? That's all I want to know! They can believe whatever the heck they want and I"m not going to waste my time arguing the points or watching this arrogant fool argue about it.</fullReview>

In my opinion i had a feeling that he himself targeted Muslims &amp; christians.

When you take a person's religion and then bash it, poke fun at it, and call it stupid is demeaning and unnecessary. Just because you don't believe in what other people believe doesn't mean that you can tear them down. If Bill was trying to figure out why people believe in what they do, then there is a better way to do it. I also didn't find the film funny at all. There is only so many times I can watch him ask somebody a question and then give a smug look when he doesn't agree with there answer.

		<fullReview>The movie was funny. I must admit, but there was so much deception and manipulation to the film and it enforced bigger propaganda and stereotypes.Jeremiah Cummings DOES have a doctorate degree, i don't know why it said otherwise in the film. Maybe to make him look even dumber? When the lady says we have visitors from Gaza, first thing you see if a bunch of extremist shooting in the air and people yelling and gun shots everywhere. What kind of education is that...Than he speaks to the Hasidic anti-Zionist Jewish and he manipulates the film just like he did to just about everyone else to make them look dumber and make their answers seem that much stupider. Ahmedinejad never said he wanted to "wipe Israel off the map" and yet Bill Maher insisted he did without even researching. Please go look that up by yourself if you honestly believe that he did say that.I also notice that many times he interviews many ignorant people about their religion, does that make sense... Also, it seems as if he has never read the Qu'ran and hes criticizing Islam, he needs to learn more. And he also only shows the extremist of Islam; he should make it clear that he is because many people will fall for it. He also shows suicide bombings and extremist Muslims when the imam speaks about peace, no matter what everything will have an extreme side to it. Atheism has had itself extremism, Stalin Mao Pol Pot... so it applies to everyone. Another problem is that its not JEWS that aren't allowed on the temple mount but ISRAELIS aren't allowed and its not Islamic its because of the politics that are involved with the West bank territories and Israel. He also mistranslates the guy in the mosque, i speak many languages and one is Arabic and he said absolutely NOTHING about Jews, comedy or anything. even more deception.The movie also contradicts itself in the end because he says that we must end religion is we want to continue, but than again i thought it was a man-made thing so it would be almost impossible to abandon it because something else would replace the extremism.In conclusion, the movie is funny, but don't take anything anyone says into consideration or seriousness because most of this movie is deceptive and manipulative; and also, bill maher doesn't give time for the person to think and answer the question properly, while bill maher had days to think of come backs and hard questions to ask.</fullReview>

Did it ever cross your mind that there's a really big difference between sincerely held beliefs, no matter how outlandish - that are not hurting anyone - and those who use religion for profit and/or to control others?Bill, you also came across stupid yourself. The Ex-Gay clergyman who believes being Gay is a sin - "looks Gay" because he's "neat and good-looking!" Give me a break! What you unwittingly succeeded in doing was make this bigot look sympathetic, instead of scary, because you came across as such a jerk!

		<fullReview>Maher's premise is typical of atheists. they are unhappy and you should be, too. He tries to blame all human misery and the potential for destruction on religion.What he skips over is that the worst human atrocities in history were committed to 'rationalist' regimes that rejected or shunned a higher power. Mao's China, Stalin's Russia, Hitler's Germany, all put themselves above a God, and killed on a far greater scale than had ever been seen before. It's human nature to treat each other badly, religion, if anything, mitigates it.Not to say that the movie doesn't have its funny moments. Like all Michael Moore style documentaries (which are nothing of the sort) the use of ambush interviews and selective editing with the most extreme characters do have their sad and funny moments.Honestly, though, the documentary is self-defeating, as many of the people he interviewed came off as relatively nice, while Maher himself came off as abusive, condescending and really not that funny. If the purpose of this documentary is to make the other guy look like a jerk, Maher fails.He uses a reductionist argument to claim that Jesus was a cheap knockoff of other gods, by pointing out disparate similarities in thousands of myths in dozens of cultures, you can actually find a few parallels in other religions.Other misinformation abounds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an agnostic and a loather of strong polarized views, I cannot help but be a little weary of the way the movie tries to shock the audience.This is a powerful documentary that points to some of the seemingly absurd religious sentiment that is prevalent in the US and other countries. However, what makes it uncomfortable is the fervor that it is conducted with. It reminds me of the same strong rhetoric that religious groups utilize to strengthen their hold - by being condescending, forceful and stirring up anger.For someone who is 'devoutly' anti-religious this film will be entertainment. In the Borat/Farenheit 911 style of documentary - shamelessly edited footage to spin the message to suit Bill's views is just too much.For a more open minded person who is religious, this movie will probably not open them up to see how some of the tenants that we accept are absurd. It would most likely cause them to close down and dismiss the message as tabloid hype. That being said, apart from some of the manipulative interviews that Bill held, there were plenty of hilarious moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>False Premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Christ follower who just watched this movie. Bill's premise at the beginning of the movie was "I'm seeking answers." It immediately becomes obvious that this really WAS NOT his motive. Of all the credible places he could find good answers in this world, he chose to go to a TRUCK STOP? He then uses who COMMERCIALIZE Christianity as his source? (Instead of going to credible theologians or believers who were helping victims of hurricane Katrina) Didn't he have an agenda? Didn't he seek people who he could exploit to "prove" his agenda? Bill argued that faith makes "a virtue about not thinking." I don't personally know anyone with this type of BLIND faith. I know thousands of dear believers who through archaeological evidence, reason, tried and tested, well-thought out faith that has brought them peace, joy and abundant lives. Bill did ask a few good questions: Why doesn't God talk directly to the world instead of privately choosing a prophet? How can smart people believe in talking snakes, 900 year old people, and the virgin birth? Why is faith good? I think he would have found better answers by asking Christian professors of theology.Things Bill was so WRONG about: Did he think the Immaculate Conception is believed by all Christians? (it's only a Catholic belief, so is Popes) Virgin Birth only in two gospels? It was repeated several times in these gospels and made clear that she was a virgin. It's also in the Old Testament. It seems sufficient to me. Why does Bill need more repetition? Bill tried to argue that the New Testament was written by people decades after Jesus by people who "never met Jesus"-this is WRONG. JOHN, who wrote a GOSPEL, REVELATION AND 3 OTHER BOOKS in the NT knew Jesus intimately for years. He saw the miracles. He saw the love, the integrity, the power. He was an eyewitness of these things. PETER knew Jesus and wrote 2 books in the NT. JAMES, Jesus' half brother, knew him his WHOLE LIFE and wrote a book about it in the NT. MATTHEW was another disciple who wrote a book in the NT and knew Jesus. Plus, Paul had met Jesus on the road to Damascus and wrote most of the NT. Luke was a Physician who wrote a gospel/ACTS from eyewitness accounts. Luke knew some of these writers of the NT, but was humble about it, mentioning them in "we" passages in the book of Acts."People who preach faith are intellectual slaveholders, keeping mankind in bondage... solace comes at a terrible price."Tell that to the tens of thousands of victims in Haiti who are now getting medical care, housing and relief from Christians. I know that my church alone has sent $170,000 to Haiti and 3 medical teams. I personally know several people who gave up very comfortable lives in the US and moved to Haiti to feed, clothe, house, love and teach orphans. They have been eating one meal a day since the earthquake. A few girls were in my youth group, one was my babysitter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically, Bill Mahen goes against people of all religions, accusing them of different kinds of intolerance, while being far more intolerant himself. It ridicules other people's beliefs quoting religious scripture from cue notes and expects people to present scientific truth to whatever their beliefs are with the same standard of rigour. Of course it's easy when you have cue notes researched long time in advance and people have to respond to you instantly and on camera. Most people he attacks simply don't respond to him because they clearly respect his beliefs more than Bill does theirs. This angered me very much.Even myself, as an atheist, find his attitude disgusting and shameful. If he wanted to present a good documentary to make people reflect on their religious choices, it's a definitive failure. This film will largely only appeal to those who already think like him and are as intolerant as he is, while being offensive to those who believe in respect.</fullReview>

In comparison to a much better (part of a) documentary about religion, Zeitgeist, Religulous doesn't spend a single second on the origins of religion. It just rants on and on about religious people being stupid and contradicting. Even when Maher 'gives them a chance' to tell their view, he cuts them off and declares the discussion closed. If you really want to know where religions came from, and in such why they are so deliriously ridiculous, go watch Zeitgeist. If you want a funny view on religion: go watch George Carlin.

A true documentary is meant to gain a deeper understanding into a chosen subject, not interject one's own opinion on it.

For every religious extremist who grabs the attention of the world there are a million more who are good mild mannered people who are just trying to go about there day based on the beliefs and values of there faith.To think for a second that the absence of different religions would suddenly propel us to all get along is just naive and short sighted. Yes, wars are fought over religious differences, as well as territory, resources, economics, politics, civil rights, and sometimes just because people don't like each other.If you really want to call a movie a documentary try and look at the subject matter with a more open mind, give a fair representation of it and don't just focus on the negative, and don't get some quick-witted comedian as the front-man</fullReview>

The more I think about it, it was not very good. Quarantine was way better.This film is the opposite of Expelled. Expelled explains the flaws of evolution while this film is a theory that Bill Maher proposes about various religions. Maher speaks of tolerance frequently. Maher is consistent in his belief that all religion is not tolerable. Most violence in world history is caused by religion according to Maher. He sees no difference between radical Islam and all Christian churches. He smashes baptists, Catholics and all churches.Maher crushes the Mormons but everyone does that. He despises Evangelicals also. What can you say. The funniest part is when he tells some guru that his hair is on fire and the guys goes running. Most of his positions against religion are based on humor and he does not really go into the deep logic of a film like Expelled which is way better than this. Maher is a funny guy who seems torn up without showing it. Maher argue with a lot of people. An actor who played Jesus and gets into a theological discussion with Maher actually out dueled Maher at times. Another film out there right now that is a must see is American Carol. That film is the opposite. Can you imagine the Pope hijacking an airplane? Not likely. If you see the Religulous stay till the end of the credits.</fullReview>

I'm not talking about if I decide to invade your personal beliefs or not, separate issue, but if I practice it for myself, and at most say 'hey this works for me, wanna know more?' I really think people should shut up about me believing in it. If I chuck it in your face and say you are going to hell, then hey confront me, but please I am sick of all this crap where Christians get lumped together because the loud ones are jerks. I'll tell them off with you if I was there. I would give my left nut to tell the westboro baptist freaks what I think of them. My point is people are held accountable for their actions, not the whole of them for the actions of its stupidest, that is the basis of most prejudices. This movie serves one purpose, to do exactly whatever one hates it that Christianity does, and that is shove its message down your throat and calls you a idiot for not agreeing. This attitude does nothing but widen a gap in our culture, and it is not all the Christians fault.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed in Maher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Maher leaves no doubt that this is a work of total and complete Israeli propaganda. A propaganda against the 3 main belief systems in the world. I highly doubt that he was raised as a Catholic. His Jewish last name and extremely biased opinions in the movie- and the fact that his main focus was only Christianity and Islam, and only a hint of Judaisism where the one Rabbi he interviews is the one who is against the state of Israel. Btw, whom he portrays as foolish and then walks off saying he doesn't want to converse with him anymore. Highly unprofessional. And hypocritical. Because he should have the courage to hear a man refuting his belief, when he can go and do the same to others he's interviewed.I also noticed his main focus was on spin off/rebellious groups of the two main faiths- Christianity and Islam. And not the mainstream thinkers or theologians. This means that the movie is then not a refutation of main stream beliefs but their offshoot branches. Moreover, he never allowed any one of them to complete their arguments, always in a rush to pass a judgment of his own. A true documentary would have allowed arguments from both the parties to flow. Again, highly unprofessional.I think the movie could have been made better had he left the question about doubt and uncertainty open. That is what uncertainty defines. An open dialogue to question. Stating his biased opinions in the end for a long extended period was dry, to say the least. It confirmed my hunch about the movie being a big nonsensical drama/propaganda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary is one of the most non-professional piece of work i have seen in my life,It Looked Like he don't have any kind of faith but he should have respect others. He was denying everything like people believing in their own respective believes are some kind of dorks who have been believing in their religions for centuries without any kind of evidence, Things he brought up in his documentary were bull sh*t he did not reach for any well known scholar, and it was clear that he has added things of his own personal choice, it was not an open debate, scholars he showed in this documentary did not even knew what they were saying, an average person knows more than them, most of the things what scholars said in this documentary clearly clashes with the real one's, so i will recommend people not to get influenced by this documentary it was a total fake based own his very own view, you wanna know something about any religion read up any book on religions you will be much more satisfied or do try to reach scholars who know what they are talking about. Lots of Evidences are there in the history which will truly amaze you, as far as for Larry Charles ask him why does he even wear clothes???? thats the kind of questions he was asking in his very own show...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Maher: "Gay Muslim activists. That is a very rare job description. You guys have big ones."Religulous, Ridiculous, whatever. Bill Maker's irreverent take on major world religions?Catholic, Jewish, Islam are the most prominent--makes no pretense of admiring religious devotees.As an interviewer of some well-known religious fanatics, and some ordinary believers, Maher can't contain light disdain for their certainty when juxtaposed with his agnosticism. His biggest mine of laugh-lined skepticism is the virgin-birth doctrine, which he points out was not sufficiently important to be included in two of the four gospels. How could such a miracle be left out? Maher asks. The reason to him is obvious: It is probably made up.Maher is so good as an easy-going reporter with impeccable comic timing that he finds a Vatican priest to claim the bible as not history but morality tale. He in effect allows the didactic importance of such stories as the creation of the world and the transubstantiation without the encumbrance of proof. His interview with a man portraying Jesus in a Bible park is a characteristic Maher humorous moment.For Islam, Maher juxtaposes a few too many explosive (literal) images to emphasize the jihad-nature of the radical element. For Jews, he reserves his most caustic sarcasm for such fiction as the history of circumcision because he had a Jewish mother and Catholic Father.Director Larry Charles of Borat shows both the zealots and Maher sharing equal interest. The only sequence where the conditions appear to be equal or Maher has a modicum of respect in the Trucker's Chapel, where the big boys give and take with him in mutual respect.Don't expect the manic, tasteless, often hilarious pieces in Borat because Maher actually seems serious in his irreverence, an agnostic with edges of atheism. But this is Maher's film, and his purpose is to lampoon, so serious argument need not apply.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill Maher managed to proof that his "non-religion"/"doubt" religion is as ridiculous as any religion. He tries so hard to make his point, screaming and interrupting people, that the only solution is to sleep. We all know the problems of different religions, and it's not anyone's fault not to have the change of being illuminated. It's not a movie for kids, c'mom. We all have a reason to be where we are, and aggressive attitude does not educate anyone. It is very interesting to hear all these religious guys, ex-gays, pro-holocaust people and observe their contradictions, but we don't really need anyone pushing it. People with a little bit of intelligence, just a little, gets it. This movie would be much better if Mr.Maher just managed to shut up. If you have a little bit of brain, please, don't waste your time. It's like preaching for children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religulous is Ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last time I checked, taking the audience's level of intelligence for granted is the big faux pas in movie making. This is especially true when people are paying good money to see a film. If you agree with the previous statements, then Bill Maher and Larry Charles are criminals. But not just any criminals, the worst kind: the kind that not only takes your money, but makes fun of you while they take it. I felt taken for a fool and I didn't even have to pay to see the film! In this "documentary" that makes Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" look like right-winged bipartisan bed time story, Bill Maher trots the globe intending to interview people regarding God and religion. Big problem: he doesn't go to the source of the religion for any intelligent or even plausible answers; instead the movie quickly gets off course because Bill only finds the craziest most out of context examples with regards to personal worship that he can possibly muster. I can stomach this once or twice, but the whole movie? I suspect this was done to add shock value and hopefully a few laughs, of which the film ironically accomplishes neither. In the end Maher's shtick is as old as the unanswerable questions regarding God and faith which he purportedly is trying to answer. In reality he is not after any answers, but just wants to take some jabs at people who are at least giving it a shot. Thank you Bill, the choir has officially been preached to.Maher's notoriously flippant wit is demonstrated in what the movie producers are oddly calling a "fascinating spiritual journey". I agree. There are fascinating aspects to the film. For example, I find it very fascinating that Maher can be in a film for 101 minutes and expect the audience to laugh at a joke for the fourth, fifth, and even sixth time, when very few people laughed the first time around. We get it Bill, the "talking snake" and the "virgin birth" is at times difficult to conceptualize. Religion is kooky sometimes. It takes faith. We get it.I also find it fascinating that the abnormally long and overplayed scenes in the movie slipped through the quality control cracks. Isn't there a quality control person for movies? Someone who can nudge the director and wake him up every so often? He must have been at church when he should have been doing some nudging.Another fascinating aspect to the film is that it is far easier to make fun of people from the outside looking in. Making a film about religion without actually letting the other side present their point of view is bad journalism, which only makes for a lopsided argument and a film that is neither amusing nor clever.It really is a shame that the film turned out this way. It had potential in director Larry Charles, who previously directed the hilariously funny "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. How can "Borat" be funny, while "Religulous" is not? "Borat" seemed to be poking fun at the broader spectrum of ridiculous people, not isolated extreme examples like in "Religulous", which few people can relate to. That is unless you've already taken the cynical approach that Maher takes at the end of the film when he basically says all religions are evil. "Don't be religious or suffer the consequences!" The irony is that Bill falls into his own trap. He tries to end with a big bang, but only ends up with a big flop. He ends up sounding just as crazy as the people whom he "interviewed"! After the movie was over I tried to figure out whether Maher did this on purpose or not. In the last few minutes of preaching, did he intentionally try and look foolish in his rant on religion? Was it just a not so subtle example to demonstrate the unorthodox behaviors of the Believers in his film, only to try and make them look even dumber? I don't know if he did it on purpose. I'm not quite sure what Maher was doing, which probably wouldn't surprise him at all?him taking my intelligence for granted in the first place and all.</fullReview>

Relentlessly he succeeds in his attempt to prove that he's incapable of intelligent thought. Which might be funny had it been a spoof of anti-religion bigotry, but instead his mania to prove his untenable point leads to an uninteresting exposition of a dull and frustrated white man's inability to comprehend the world around him. Never answering the question, why should we care, we're left with no reason to watch this movie. Thats the difference between this and Baron Sasha Cohen's Borat.</fullReview>

Those who believe in Maher are just as futile to our society as those religious one. Do your research and ask the proper question after each documentary. What is Zionism? Why are walls being build in Jerusalem? What was the reason for the creation of ANY religion? Maher only touch the surface of these issues, but failed miserably to expose the truth behind it. Or worst, express his own propaganda driven point of view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shady, underhanded, dishonest anti-Christian hate propaganda movie in which the legitimate Christians utterly destroy Maher's arguments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religulous presents itself as a 'documentary,' but it most certainly is *not* one. Religulous is a shady, underhanded, anti-Christian hate movie. The ironic part of this is, all the legitimate Christians that Maher interviewed in this movie completely destroyed the arguments that Maher tried to bring against them. Maher artificially tries to make himself look smart - and give the audience the false impression that he 'won' the interviews he conducted. Right after Maher makes a snarky comment, he cuts away to a different scene (I.e. cutting from the interview scene, to him driving in a car ) instead of showing the people he's interviewing having a chance to *respond* to his snarky comment. Obviously, anyone can 'win' an argument about *anything* if after he says a comment, he does not give the other side any opportunity to respond. This is the highest level of 'discussion' that the interviews in Religulous attains. The academic community, and moral persons everywhere, have no choice but to frown upon Maher's immoral dishonesty in this regard.A *very* telling example of this: in one interview, Maher keeps trying to cut off the Jew who said Jews in general have departed from Holiness. This interviewee keeps telling Maher, 'Let me finish'. Then, a second later Maher *still* tries to jump right back in to interrupt with another snarky comment so that he can then cut away from the interview and pretend he 'won'. It's *hilarious* how that Jew humiliated Maher so badly, that Maher walked out of the interview solely because the Jew repeatedly refused to allow Maher to interrupt him. I'm sure Maher knew he couldn't get the upper hand in that conversation due to his inferior intellect, so better to cut his losses rather than be made an *even bigger*fool of. It's very shady how Maher interjects footage of the Jew at a Holocaust conference hosted by Iran's President, yet doesn't give him a chance to *explain* what his purpose was for going. Thus, immorally leaving the audience with the *false impression* that he went there to deny the Holocaust when chances are, he went there in order to *educate* people about the Holocaust. This is a great example of Maher's unscrupulous MO for all the interviews in the movie. Religulous shows an old Rabbi answering the phone and saying hello 3 times when no one was on the other end; which is an artificial means to try to make the Rabbi look like an idiot (since Maher had no *legitimate* means for doing so). There was *absolutely no reason* to include that footage in the movie, other than to showcase how shady &amp; dishonest Maher and the director are.Before watching Religulous, I was under the impression from reading media reports, user comments on IMDb, and forums, that Christians were humiliated really badly in this movie; their faith made to look ridiculous &amp; insane. But that didn't even happen! The heavyweight Christians didn't falter for a moment; Maher couldn't make them look foolish. They made *Maher* look foolish. The Christians in Raleigh destroyed Maher's arguments.Ken Ham - founder of the Creation Museum and Answers in Genesis website, which use real *science* to *prove* that the Bible is true - destroyed Maher's arguments.The Jesus actor of the Holy Land theme park destroyed Maher's arguments. I don't even know why the Holy Land manager wanted to kick Maher off the property, considering that her employee, the Jesus actor, was *drastically* overpowering Maher in that conversation. The manager should have invited Maher to stay all day and talk to that actor while shooting *their own* footage of it and making a movie out of *that*. That would have been *far* more educational and interesting than *this* movie is, and Maher wouldn't have had the luxury of relying on shady editing techniques to artificially make himself appear smart &amp; victorious. If you are observant while watching Religulous, you will see that Maher gives *very little* screen-time to the interviews with Ken Ham and the Jesus actor --- because he had no way to beat them in conversation due to their superior intellects to Maher's. The *only ones* Maher was able to make look foolish in this movie were the crazy cultists like the Mexican guy who thinks he's both Jesus, *and* the anti-Christ; and the guy who invented a weed religion. In other words, people who everyone *already knew* were crazy long before this movie was made. The legitimate, serious Christians remained totally unscathed by anything this movie had to throw at them. Maher devotes a *ton* of useless screen-time to the crazy cultist and weed religion founder, because he *can* hold his own vs. *those* crazies. But so what? Who cares? So could me, you, or *anyone*. There are a few nutjob cultists out there, sure, but they do not have a significant presence in society, therefore they are moot.Religulous has no comedy, nor educational value. Which begs the question: what is *the point* even supposed to be? There isn't a single funny moment in it. Maybe Maher *thought* it was funny because he kept smiling at his own banal 'jokes' that he spouted after cutting away from conversations in which he got destroyed. Someone needed to send Maher a memo that he isn't funny. In fact, I don't think Maher has ever in his entire lifetime even said one funny thing. He *needed* to get that memo 40 years ago. It is mind-boggling that anyone ever actually *paid* to see Maher do stand-up. I think Maher is more delusional than the craziest people he talked to in this movie; because somehow Maher deluded himself into thinking he has comedy talent when in reality he has none whatsoever. Someone should make a documentary about how such an unfunny hack made a living out of being a 'comedian'. *That* would be a Maher documentary worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pro War Movie ? Bill Maher the Warmonger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with a comedian posing as documentarian, or posing as an intellectual in pursuit of knowledge, is that he is unaware of what a boob he is in the hands of the film maker and editor. Bill Maher is front and center as the cheerleader in the Christian holy war against Islam. He is the star of a film that justifies the xenophobia of the current thinking that pits the Christian World against the Muslim World. The film starts with the goal of showing the irrationality of religious faith, but spends a considerable amount of time portraying the Christian faith and Islam locked in the final battle of end times, ostensibly supported by verses from the New Testament and the Haddiths. Great job Maher. You start out with a diatribe about self-fulfilling prophesies but you participate in a movie that does just what it warns us about. I suppose you believe you struck a blow against irrationality ? you didn't -- instead you've made a propaganda film that supports the war parties' irrational views for a 100 year war. You beat a very old drum that dates back to the crusades.</fullReview>

If you are looking for a goofy silly movie to laugh at then this is the movie for you, but if you are looking for a movie that well give you facts about religion this is not for you. I did have a couple laughs but for most of the time I was just thinking this is stupid. The whole film they just blast every religion and nit pick it so much that it gets old after the first five minutes. The movie was however well made, it had good quality film making but that is the only upside of the film.

Why should they care? If there is no God, Maher shouldn't give a flying flip what anyone else thinks anyway.
