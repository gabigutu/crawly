		<fullReview>If you watch this movie expecting it to be as advertised, you may be disappointed, or at any rate bemused. The thumbnail summaries that I have read, as well as the movie's own introductory passages, all present it as an exploration of how different people create different stories from the same event. I think this may be what the director set out to do. But in fact, in the end everyone pretty much agrees about what happened, with one or two notable exceptions.What Sarah Polley ended up creating is a meditation on what breaks families apart, and what holds them together. The insights are important, and often counterintuitive, and sometimes startling. What captured my interest, and moved me deeply, was not the detective aspects of the story -- not the revealing of family secrets -- but the gradual unraveling of their causes and effects. For this, the format of the film -- interviews with many family members and family friends -- is absolutely crucial. Some reviewers have complained that the interviews become boring and repetitive. I admit that some patience is required in hearing them out, but it is amply repaid.I am also grateful to Sarah Polley for trying to do something different on screen. In the featureless landscape of contemporary cinema, Stories We Tell is a landmark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sarah Polley's touching documentary wallows in greatness both in cinema and emotion...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sarah Polley continues to become one of the most innovative and inventive directors working today and its proved by what she spills out on the silver screen in her newest endeavor Stories We Tell. A compelling and personal documentary about her own life, Stories We Tell blends and fuses the magic of non-fiction with the imagination of the cinematic mind.Telling the story of her own inception, family life, and personal struggle with her own sense of being, Sarah Polley invites the audience into a world that otherwise would seem shameful and dreary but ends up rising triumphant and inspired. While documentaries often take a very serious, somber, and issue-driven approach, Polley's film proves that real life can be just as magnetic without an epiphany of theatrics or cheap camera tricks. Stories We Tell takes cinematic risks that pay off tremendously in both execution partnered with Iris Ng's stunning cinematography. This is one of the best things that the movies have offered this year yet.When one takes on a personal subject like their family, you always run the risk of starting your film with a wall between you and the audience from the first frame. Family is one of those things that you can only appreciate when you're a part of the madness. If I sit here and tell you countless stories of brothers and sisters bickering, falling in an apple ditch, or simply the origin of our creations, a disinterest may become prevalent because what makes my story any more real than yours? Unless we have some extraordinary circumstances, family is all relative and subjective. Polley's family feels real. While there are painstakingly clear alignments between my family life and hers, the film goes beyond anything that documentaries have offered viewers before. It's not too often you grow to care about members of a family in a 108 minute stretch unless your last name is Brady, Seaver, or Winslow. It's amazing to watch one story, told from different perspectives, yielding different results and emotions. Why Polley decided to do it, I'm not so sure. Maybe it was her own way of making sense of her unfortunate hand that was dealt or perhaps it was a way of release, living with so many unanswered questions, possibly still until this day. I'm grateful she let me in to tell her story. We should all be grateful.There are surprises, innuendos, and things that the film embraces that must be saved for anyone on the first viewing. All I can say is, Polley has likely set a new precedent and encouragement for filmmakers to do similar experiments in the future. A film such as this that follows the life of people like Jack Nicholson or Angelina Jolie would definitely build an anticipation for many to see. Stories We Tell is kind to soul and heartwarmingly relevant. A film to be remembered. The film played at this year's Montclair Film Festival and is scheduled to be released May 17, 2013.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sarah Polley is one to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at the Canadian top Ten Film Festival at the TIFF Lightbox in Toronto in early January of 2013. It was preceded by a "Mavericks" Q&amp;A featuring Director Sarah Polley with the Festival's Artistic Director. Polley is best known in the USA as an actress in films such as Splice. This is her third feature as director, all of which have been chosen for the Canadian Top Ten. Even though it is a documentary about her family, it is quite riveting, with more than a few surprises. The interview style, camera work and narration are both innovative and effective. One of the interviewees asked her if she has any idea what she is doing, and she said no. After you see this, I think you will disagree. Sarah Polley is one to watch . . . as a writer-director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Stories We Tell" is rich and affecting storytelling at it's finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sarah Polley has set the stage in mind for many years to tell a simple story. Much like the process of forming a story, things are always taken back to the storyboard and new influences are introduced. Sarah ultimately made the natural choice to deliver this story by simply setting the basis and allowing each party to tell the story as they know it, in every detail from each individual memory.Stories We Tell works a unique twist on the documentary format and allows the audiences into the life of the family and friends who knew the filmmakers mother, Diane Polley. An eccentric ball of energy with the appearance of an open book, she might have really been a big mystery and her secrets could cause a rift throughout all those connected. Family and friends from all corners step up to the plate and what's heard are a melding of scripted order and the unscripted nature of each individual and their memories of the events that unfolded. At times it's an interview, at others it's a humorous interrogation; we witness the mystery unfolding in a truly compelling, warm and emotional fashion. It's a wonderful case study on human beings and how we shape ourselves throughout a lifetime and the events that can change our lives forever. It's fascinating to see how we all perceive moments and how our memories contain them. Different characters have different takes and yet the feelings resonate the same.Sarah Polley took the right path and remained on the sideline and behind the camera until it was absolutely paramount. The real people tell their stories and actors portray history with an uncanny authenticity. It delivers the reality and the real people involved without bogging down the narrative. This is rich and affecting storytelling at it's finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sarah Polley contemplates her navel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading about the great reviews the so-called expert critics gave this movie, this was a huge disappointment in so many areas. Which mostly are: 1. One of the themes of this movie (articulated by Polley herself) is that, "does the truth depend on who does the telling?" That implies (at least to me) that there would be some disagreement on different aspects of the story. There are no disagreements...everyone doesn't know every single detail, but everyone is consistent. And Polley keeps repeating this theme towards the end of the movie. She's a smart woman...what the heck is she talking about? Did she think that if she didn't bring this up that all that would be left was a story that was too thin and too self-indulgent? I thought that while this is a very interesting story for the Polley family, it was not an interesting film about it. That leave us with a very self-indulgent film.2. The film was too long. This could have been wrapped up about 20 minutes earlier, or the film could have been 20 minutes shorter. Again, self-indulgent.I don't know Sarah Polley, but she seems like a good person, and her family seems like good people. But the film just didn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What is this documentary REALLY about?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STORIES WE TELL is a quietly thought-provoking exposé of how difficult it can be to clarify even the simplest truths regarding human relationships and how "truth" can vary a great deal according to who you talk to, even when everyone's doing their honest best. The extended family in this documentary film is a most interesting one, and each individual member is a fascinating character in her or his own right, in spite of, perhaps because of, the fact that there is nothing truly weird about any of them. The extensive use of home video footage from the 60s, 70s, and 80s really carries the film. The small details--e.g., the father's musing on the lonely fly on the wall--are also significant, as are certain fine points in the dialogue between Director Sarah Polley and the family members she "interrogates."Some true surprises occur during the course of the interviews; STORIES WE TELL goes deep in its own subtle, quiet way. Still, at the risk of sounding like a vulture, I was hoping for some darker--or at least more unusual or startling--revelations. While it's easy to understand why the real substance of the film--I don't want to give away the specifics--is critical stuff for Sarah Polley, it's nothing the average person hasn't seen or read in other works, factual or fictional. STORIES WE TELL also takes too long to show what it has to show. While the multiple perspectives are intriguing, they become ponderous and repetitive after a while.In any event, this film functions well as a simple yet meaningful think-piece. Those who want a lot of variety, excitement, layers &amp; twists, etc, however, may be a trifle bored by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films You're Going to See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stories We Tell (2012) **** (out of 4) Incredibly documentary from filmmaker Sarah Polley who as a child heard stories that the man she thought was her father might not have been. Through interviews with friends, families and those who knew her mother, Polley tries to figure out which part of these stories were true and who exactly her father is. STORIES WE TELL is without question one of the most memorable documentaries to come around in a very long time. I think a strong argument could be made that we're living in an era that has given us so many great documentaries but this here is without question one of the very best. The main focus is to find out who Polley's father is but at the same time the film is about so much more. Just seeing what impact a simple story can have on so many people was just interesting to watch in front of us and Polley pretty much turns this into a Hitchcock thriller because you just never know what twist is going to follow. The director does a terrific job at telling this story, bouncing around from those interviewed to help complete this picture but there's also the impact that her mother's decision had on everyone. There are clips of Polley inside a studio listening to the person she grew up believing was her father tell his side of this story. Just watching her reaction to some of these spoken words was incredibly touching. Also, just being able to see how different person tells the same story and what impact this had on them at the time they heard it was something fascinating. Usually many people might ask what makes Polley's story so special that we, the viewer, should invest time in listening to it. I think what makes STORIES WE TELL so fascinating is her story itself really isn't unlike any story we've probably got in our own closet. By hearing Polley's story you really start to think about some of your own stories and how many of them might be true or lies. Polley has made a name for herself with some pretty good indie dramas but this film here is certainly her crowning achievement so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly unique biography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stories We Tell (2012) is a documentary written and directed by Sarah Polley. This movie is unusual because it's actually a biography of the filmmaker and her family, narrated by her father, "starring" her siblings and herself, along with Polley's relatives and family friends. But the film isn't straight biography or autobiography. It's a quest film as well.Sarah's siblings and family friends begin by talking about Sarah's mother, Diane, who died, aged 55, in 1990, when Sarah was 11 . (There's some actual 8mm footage of the family, intermixed with staged footage that has the same grainy look of old amateur filmmaking.)Sarah's mother was beautiful, and she was vivacious and fun-loving. Sarah's dad was a handsome, decent person, but no one would describe him as vivacious and fun-loving. The marriage wasn't terrible, but it was clear to the couple--and eventually to their children--that it wasn't a good match.That much information is established in the first half-hour of the movie. Then the question arises as to whether Sarah's dad is really her biological father. Polley decides to dig for this answer, and interview the same people she's already interviewed, although this time asking the question, "Who's my father?" Polley accumulates information bit by bit, and eventually expands her search to include people who knew Diane when she was performing in a play out of town. As Sarah embarks on this search, the camera keeps rolling, and we go along at her side. It's a fascinating ride, because everyone has part of the picture, but only two people had the answer, and one of them is no longer alive.Stories We Tell is a quiet, careful movie. There's anger, but no shouting, sadness, but no tears. Sarah Polley is in the middle of it all, but she's credited as the director, not as the star. In a way, the star of the movie really is the late Diane Polley, but she's the one person who can't tell her side of the story. That's what makes the whole thing so fascinating.This is a movie you will want to see if you enjoy quiet, thoughtful, serious films. It will work equally well on a small or large screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the ultimate self-referential documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, this is one of the best and most arresting documentaries I've ever seen. I find it surprising that it's not very well-known. It's quietly enjoyable to watch, is thought-provoking, and is the kind of multi-layered deep meditation I expect critics and film schools to analyze closely. It's not like anything else I can think of. In fact my main reaction after my first viewing was WTF? What did I just watch?This is the most "self-referential" movie I've ever watched. Yet it's done in such an understated way some could watch the whole thing and still not even be consciously aware of it. And it's not just one grand loop between two adjoining levels, but rather a whole bunch of small recursions all over the map. Once you become aware of it, it's likely that you too will find the recursion like nothing you've ever seen. There are many different ways to read this film. Each of them is complete and self-contained, so you can enjoy the film in one (or more) ways without having to also "get" all the others. Possible readings include: reading #1] a true story about slowly unearthing biological parentage (i.e. "is my father really my father?") reading #2] a meditation on how we tell stories and on how different people relate the same story somewhat differentlyreading #3] an experiment in just how far the "self-referencing" conceit can be pushed without the whole film collapsing reading #4] a deconstruction of what "documentary film" means - What is "truth"? What is "accuracy"? Is it even possible?reading #5] a film about filmmaking, in the tradition of "Day for Night" or "8 1/2"The audio is mostly interviews and storytellers (where a "story" is a sort of one-sided extended interview). The video matches the words. Sometimes it's the speaker's face. Sometimes it's the action the speaker is describing. Sometimes it's very similar to the event the speaker is relating. Sometimes it's related science - for example when the voice talks about DNA the microscopic picture show chromosomes separating during a cell's Meiosis Anaphase. (Perhaps this was motivated by the science talks in "Mr. Nobody", which Ms. Polley was acting in about the same time she was thinking about this film.) And once in a while it shows the _opposite_ of the words, probably to let us know something isn't quite right. Nearly half of the film is "flashbacks" on what is initially assumed to be home movie footage ...and some of it really is old home movie footage that's been found and edited in. But we start to become dubious. There's so very much of this footage, and it seems to match the needs of the modern day filmmaker eerily well, and much of it does _not_ follow the stylistic pattern that's mentioned explicitly early on. We're eventually told when the camera first appeared; then it can be carefully noted that some of the footage is from _before_ this date. It also seems odd that the camera filmed so many things that the camera operator couldn't possibly have been present for or even known about. We keep seeing fragments of a clip with Mom and a male on a footbridge - careful examination reveals the male isn't always the same person. Finally we see some really explicit clues: the nowadays director appears in one of the clips, the director is seen giving acting instructions to her Mom, some of the people in the clips are seen getting their film makeup applied, and one camera actually shows another filming one of these clips. A few minutes later it's made even clearer to those that have missed it so far: the exact same scene switches back and forth between the appearance of one of these historic clips and the appearance of the modern day film, then we see Ms. Polley herself both inside that scene and also filming at the same time, and finally realize what she's holding is an old Super 8 camera. The end credits confirm that while some of the flashback clips are authentic, many of them were recreated. Already at the very beginning "things are not what they seem" is thrown in your face. Pictures of interviews are purposely mis-framed to give away hidden wires, mic booms, light reflectors, tripods, and so forth. Later, interviewees occasionally break the fourth wall, primp on camera, or say outrageous things. We eventually realize the entire family is deeply embedded in the Canadian show-biz world, so deeply that some of the main characters actually had careers as stage actors at one point, and many of the rest were involved in other aspects such as producing or casting. Sure enough, it eventually becomes clear that the "honest" interviews with the main characters are in fact acted. There's even a comment about somebody "falling in love" with the stage character he was playing rather than with the actor himself. The line between "in front of the camera" and "behind the camera" is shown to be overly precious. It's not even all that well defined; what does it mean when at the same time the visual is in front of the camera, but the audio is behind the camera? At some points a character on camera gives a suggestion for how the film could be edited at that point, then that exact thing really happens. Name any "rule" of documentary filmmaking you like, or any "theory" of how documentary films should guarantee they're presenting "the truth". It's mentioned here, then gleefully flouted or debunked. This film is so clever and so thorough (in its understated, un-obvious way) that it feels like nobody else should ever again make a "self-referential documentary", because the last word has already been spoken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly self-indulgent faux examination of narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never review movies but hated this so much and didn't find nearly enough vitriol on here.I didn't go into this wanting to dislike it and withheld judgment until the final act. And before I get ripping, I did find the second husband, the polley one, to be likable if completely uninteresting. As other reviewers have stated, this is not an examination of or even a rumination on narrative or recollection or truth or family. The film attempts to explain to us how deep it is in the last act, seeking to justify itself and help us process the deep currents that arnt there. That stuff is clearly tacked on and then overtly hammered home in a specious, ', if we have have the genial gravitas of a liberal arts class or Ira Glass, maybe people will swallow it' way to compensate for the total flimsiness and worthlessness of the film both formally and in terms of character/narrative/thought/substance.I'm shocked that a movie that has to literally state its thesis at least three times toward the end in an attempt to justify its existence, and hopes to pass that off as either clever or deep and 'meta', hasn't been more widely ridiculed,Furthermore, Sarah P is generally unlike able (we hear her voice, and see her in the process of making the film and are imp'icitly supposed to identify with her and root for her without ever being given reason to -and I am a cinephile because I am eager to empathize with the voices and faces on the screen). The mom character, who is sketched broadly and reductively (with the same simple take of her repeated over and over but apparently she was not interesting enough for anyone to have a engaging anecdote), seemed intolerable.And the biological father (Harry?) is one of the grossest people I have ever seen in a documentary. Totally delusional narcissistic clown, totally Embarrassing to watch. Incredible shocking disgusting hate-able narcissism that is emblematic of the worst of the wannabe baby boom generation, just as Sarah P seems to hold down the vapid navel gazing narcissism for gen x or whatever she is. Can more people flay this garbage pleease?

Polley tackled the story so proficiently and create a strong tense for it be remade into some kind of detective story, and isn't it so relating to our personal experiences, that we grew up, and discovered certain fragments which would fulfill a grandiose puzzle of our own family (and we just might not be able to finish it)).Heck, the point being, watch the movie, damn it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story was too good to be true.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a recommended-to-watch movie, However, there were few things missing in the story. I think the story was told too good to be true. I mean everybody seem to be happy and satisfied with what happened. No matter how Dian had been behaving irresponsible and careless towards her children, her spouses and her lover in different occasions, they all speak as if because of Dians circumstances it was all right. It appears to me that since she has died years ago, everybody is OK with the facts and nobody is complaining and doesn't remember any resentment or doesn't want to remember it. Sarah is not taking part in telling thestory. she doesn't contribute to movie like others. she questions and directs but doesn't narrate anything herself. doesn't speak about her feelings. her point of view. all I can guess, is that she liked her mum(or maybe the story itself) enough, to edit the movie in a way that depicts everything being wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sarah Polley bares it all in the stories her own family tells.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a curious film. I was eager to see it because I am a Sarah Polley fan. I like her film roles and the movies she makes. However in this one, not really knowing what we were getting into, my wife and I considered turning it off after 10 to 15 minutes. It looked like it would be a rather boring time.But we stuck with it and I am happy that we did. It is a thoroughly interesting examination of Polley's own family, her father, her sisters and brothers, her deceased mother, and herself. There are stories told and the culmination is fascinating.I can't say too much more before the "SPOILERS" section below, for you should see it without knowing too much about it. Because the film covered a period starting before Sarah was born, and while her mother was still alive, actors were used to portray some of the family members for the 1960s to 1990s period. This was combined with some original film which was available.Just a fine film for those who enjoy seeing a nice family mystery unfold.SPOILERS: Sarah is much younger than her siblings and half-siblings, one might wonder if in fact she was a "mistake." As she grew up with her mother gone, she died when Sarah was only 11, the family joke around the table was that Sarah didn't look like her dad, was she really one of his children? Her mom had gotten pregnant during a 6 to 7 week period in 1986 when she was acting in a production out of town. Her husband, Mr Polley, had visited her and they made love passionately, the assumption always was that the pregnancy resulted from that. But now, as an adult, Sarah began digging and talking to her mom's old theater friends and discovered one, now 80, who claimed to have had a love affair with Sarah's mother, and he has been assuming all along that he was really her father, but for family privacy concerns said nothing. Now, with this new information they arranged DNA testing which confirmed the man was her biological father. Some of the interesting development is Mr Polley's reaction to all this and it was fine, in essence he said had the other man NOT been Sarah's real father, she would not exist and he would have missed this loving relationship with this daughter of his. The fact that Sarah is NOT his biological child changes nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the marketing blurb had hyped me up to expect something this wasn't. I'd read of bold playing with form and reality, the nature and recall of memory etc... I enjoyed Away From Her very much too, so was hoping for something unusual here. I can't agree with the other reviews here.I didn't find it particularly courageous or bold in its form, or content matter. Some scenes are recreated, it's as clear as day, not formally bold, and I'm perplexed by the reactions. I didn't come away feeling I'd learned much about the human condition, it was more like going to a friend's house, only, a friend I'd only just met and had no connection with, and having her life story relayed to me. There's nothing shocking in the family timeline, which is fine, but there was no great emotional question I could relate to and wanted answered either. It feels more self-indulgent than the personal insight I was expecting. Not a particularly fascinating life or universal family story. Just one girl's pretty-average story. Not to take away from what the Director feels or demean her life experience, but honestly, it felt precious and narcissistic. I find some aspects of my family history equally as interesting but I know no-one would want to see a film about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sarah Polly's intimate and unique documentary Stories We Tell was one of last year's biggest festival and critical hits in the doco field with her fresh approach to telling a story using 8mm film to recreate the past and talking heads to tell the present hitting a chord with audiences. As one of the most critically acclaimed movies of last year hype for the movie remains strong and in that respect Stories We Tell is an overrated movie.To get the most out of Stories one must be wholly invested in the concerns of Polly's family and the eventual revelations that come forth from her questioning and investigating of the past but if your investment is minimal as I found mine was any emotional impact the film clearly has for many is dulled and therefore the film as a whole nothing more than a slightly intriguing piece of life in all its glories and in all its hidden secrets. It must be said however that the films early stages are quite promising and downright riveting it's not until revelations are made clear that the film starts to struggle and you get the sense this is more a film for Polly herself than we the watchers.It's nice that Polly chooses to air some very personnel and deep seeded emotions in the way of this film but one question's if what is being found out is of much benefit for someone not in the Polly family. Great documentaries like Searching for Sugarman or Dear Zachary work on emotional levels because what is being discovered as the film and participants go on is relatable in more large scale and universal ways, Stories showpiece just does not have the power to affect like this. The film also has a waft of self-importance that allows proceedings to sadly go in circles and length wise drag out to near two hours which with this format gets old fast.Being critical as I have been, Stories is still a movie that will appeal to many a wide ranging audience and for people that may have been through similar family circumstances a tale that will really hit home. For the rest of us though Stories sadly is one of last year's more overrated documentaries and in a genre that is consistently producing the goods it will be quickly forgotten in the wave of other quality entries.3 storytellers out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Film About the Elusiveness of Story-Telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STORIES WE TELL opens with an extended shot of Michael Polley (director Sarah's father) reading out a prepared script in a recording studio, with his daughter facing him. This sequence serves as a metaphor for the entire film, which concentrates in depth on the nature of story- telling. It is fundamentally an autobiographical detective story, as Sarah interviews various members of her extended family to discover something about her late mother's life. We learn that her mother used to be an actress and performer; a vivacious soul who married Michael (a British actor) after having experienced a disastrous first marriage. Her marriage to Michael works fine for the first few years, but then things start to go wrong, and her mother ends up having an affair with film producer Harry Gulkin (one of Polley's interviewees). Michael and the family are based in Toronto; Gulkin in Montreal. As Sarah investigates more about this love-affair, she discovers something shocking about her own life that changes her perspective for ever. As she conducts her interviews, Polley realizes that different interviewees have different versions of 'the truth,' shaped not only according to their perceptions, but also by what they want to reveal on camera. Only by comparing different interviews can Polley reach at least an approximation about what 'really' happened to her mother and Gulkin, and the effect of their love-affair on Michael. One reviewer of this film has already asked "what is it REALLY about?" The answer to this question becomes clear: there is no such thing as a 'real' or 'definitive' interpretation of the past. We can only listen to different accounts, and make up our own minds, while realizing that our interpretation is no more or less definitive than other interpretations. Polley's film is both uncompromising yet sympathetic to the interviewees; sometimes they are prompted into revealing truths about themselves (which perhaps they had not previously admitted), but Polley - who appears on screen as well as directing the entire film - makes no judgment on them. This absorbing piece is essential viewing for anyone interested in the relativity of history, whether personal or otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting film, though indirect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You should watch the film before reading my comments. It is film worth watching.This film, as the director tells us a few times, is about the different points of a view over the same events. I didn't find these differing points of view, as other reviewers have also pointed out. In fact, quite the opposite?the various comments seem to re-enforce each other. But I'll put aside this disconnect between Sarah Polley's intent and what I actually saw.We have a daughter who discovers that her father, with whom she has grown up, is not her biological father; in fact, her mother has slept with at least two other people. The father is painted by everyone, including him, as a good father but incapable of providing the love craved by her mother. So much so, that when one of his daughters hears that she had an affair, the daughter is so happy for her. In the next moment, when all the daughters learn of their mother's exploits in the name of love, they all get divorced. Sarah's biological father sees nothing wrong with his pursuit of a married woman (or accepting her advances, which ever was the case), and wishes Sarah's mother would have divorced her husband and come, along with her children to live with him. Their relationship may or may not have worked, but they had a strong love for each other?given the six weeks that they knew each other. By the way, the gay son is disappointed that his father was reluctant to talk about oral sex. If this last comment seems to come out of the blue in my discussion, that's exactly how it felt in the movie.We learn that the Sarah's mother wanted much more sex than her father would provide, and the suggestion is made that love and sex are the same thing: Sarah's mother needed more love and sex than her husband could provide. Her husband knew this and was thus grateful that she had outside affairs because otherwise she might have left him.Sarah learns that her mother had scheduled an abortion (of her) and in fact was on her way to the procedure, when she changes her mind. Her mother appears to have known who the true father was all along?despite having slept with at least three males during the period in question?as Sarah's mother sent the biological father pictures from time to time of Sarah.Sarah's non-biological father, the one she grew up calling dad, appears to feel that he got the better end of the deal, in that he got to take care and love this wonderful person Sarah. He says that if she had been his own child, she may have been a better person, or worse, but that Sarah was special.Did her non-biological father (dad) love her mother? It does appear so, and in fact when her mother dies, he is devastated. When he learned of his mother's affair, is he angry? No. He talks about how this revelation has brought him closer to his (adopted?) daughter and that he doesn't remember exchanging such hugs with her, as they have done now that the story is out. He says "nothing has changed," yet she is off being welcomed into the fold of all her newly discovered blood relatives, and in particular, bonding with her biological father.Despite the trauma, no one seems angry, disappointed or even upset with anyone. Sarah in particular maintains a monotone and cool demeanor through it all.Am I being critical of all of this? No. It's amazing and at least surface level honest. That's why the film is worth watching. There is probably a story we didn't hear about how Sarah's father got into the position of seeing himself as so completely unworthy. He seems a totally defeated individual, but with a good heart. Once Sarah's sisters were freed from the bonds of marriage upon learning of their mother's adventures, I wonder how their husbands felt when they were divorced?Sarah's mother was married when she fell in love with Sarah's "dad," and subsequently divorced this first husband. This first husband was not happy being divorced and gained full custody of their children (a first in Canada). Sarah's siblings report being abused by their stepmother in this relationship, and that Sarah's mother would cry endlessly having to return her children into this abusive home. I wish Sarah had more fully reported on this perpetrated abuse. How about interviewing the stepmother and her first husband?The facts and interviews in Sarah Polley's documentary tell an amazing story about the nature of one family's structure and bonds. It was well filmed and filled with old clips. Its major flaw I suspect is in the fact that no one ever stood up and said something in an angry, outraged, betrayed and hurt voice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at all what the reviewers appear to think it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film as part of a month-long series of documentaries at my local public library. Throughout the film, I was struck by the seeming incredible luck that the director had in having access to so much timely and relevant Super 8 movie footage of the family in their younger days. That all became moot when, near the end of the closing film credits, it is revealed that every single member of the family in past and present was portrayed by an actor. In effect, it is not a true documentary at all but the very well written and directed retelling of someone else's family story. The audience at the viewing I attended had much the same reaction--thinking that we had just been taken for a very elaborate ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distasteful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a documentary that tries to explore larger issues of humanity by exploring the various secrets, stories and viewpoints buzzing around Sarah's dead mother, including her personality, her relationship with her husband, as well as her possible infidelity, the last of which has an obvious consequence on Sarah. Sarah makes everyone share their version of 'the story' of her mother, and splices it all together while investigating and 'interrogating', to see what truth, if any, emerges. At least, that's the theory.The plot summary has this to say: "Stories We Tell explores the elusive nature of truth and memory, but at its core is a deeply personal film about how our narratives shape and define us as individuals and families, all interconnecting to paint a profound, funny and poignant picture of the larger human story." But don't be fooled. The only thing correct about that summary is that it is 'deeply personal'. And it should have stayed deeply personal.The "elusive nature of truth" and the different versions of "the story" is just simple gossip. No amount of film-school hyperbole or fancy talk can alter that fact. When a key person in the story states towards the end that only the key people should be allowed to tell the story because only they know the full truth, he is partially correct. He is incorrect, because it's obvious that even he doesn't know the full truth and is delusional. But he is also correct in that everyone else is just passing on useless gossip that only provides a disservice to the truth and to her mother.But this documentary purportedly demonstrates how people interpret the truth according to their personal viewpoints and needs. I suppose that is true in this one deluded case, but with everyone else, the only thing that we 'learn' is that they enjoy gossip and are exhibitionists.As far as the alleged thoughtful commentary is concerned, I'll never forget this outrageous quote from the movie: "She had the strength and ability to keep all of her loyalties." Somehow, loyalty now means lying to your husband.Painfully personal introspections are exhibited, private bedroom details are shared as if they were an anthropology experiment, and juicy rumors and gossip are thrown around even concerning a dead person. All throughout the movie I kept wondering what is wrong with these people. Despite the attempt at sophistication and the lack of scenes of people yelling at each other, watching this felt the same to me as watching Jerry Springer. Dressing it up with pretentious attempts at sophistication and self-obsessed introspection does not change the fact that they are just making a big fuss over whether she cheated or not, and who with.So, the larger issues of humanity boils down to gossip and infidelity. Therefore I didn't find anything interesting here, since I am not a voyeur. This is just dirty laundry. Please do not flaunt it. Even if it were really "profound, funny and poignant" then it would be questionable, but it isn't.I even found the 'surprises' in the movie very unsurprising, because it all boils down to character. And the character was obvious to me in the first ten minutes.Imagine if only one of the key people refused to participate in this movie based on the fact that it was private. The movie would have been impossible to make because the only thing left would have been gossip. The fact that they didn't refuse to participate says more to me about humanity than the stories they told. Unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intriguing, but not as emotionally overwhelming for the audience as it is for the storytellers. There is ever so palpable, cold detachment from the story's emotional spine. Maybe, it's because of the lack of perspective of the person who wanted this story to be out there- Sarah Polley herself. You can sense subtle reactions coming from her whenever she is on screen, for however little time, and build her point-of-view in your head. But that would be just another version of story in this baggage of different perspectives. Also, I would rather she hadn't filmed dramatized clips of real-life incidents and trust the audience's imagination.All that being said, it does not take away anything from the fact that "Stories We Tell" is a fascinating concept. If nothing else, it works as a brilliant think-piece on subjectivity of memories and distorted truth by different perspectives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing but also self-centred</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rather self-centred family documentary. Sarah Polley digs deep into the family relationships by uncovering its very core, the nature of her own parents.What began as an exploration of the chemistry between her parents, unravelled into a big life changing discovery. Two very different people (her mom and dad) got together, got married and remained so until she passed away. An outgoing and lively female ends up with an introverted reserved male. Was she happy? Was she fulfilled? Was she faithful?Whilst undoubtedly interesting, lively and stimulating it is somewhat self-centred, as I initially remarked. There seemed to be an overwhelming emphasis on her deceased mother who appeared as spotless despite two marriages, at the first of which she lost custody of her kids, and an affair that produced a child. Little prominence is given to her (supposed) father who raised her like his own and did not stop treating her as such even after it was established that the producer of this documentary is not in fact his own child.No one of course can blame a child who was deprived of motherly love early on in life but some consideration ought to be given to the father who took part in the upbringing other than going through life considering himself to be insufficient for his former wife.Still, it makes for an intriguing viewing.</fullReview>

Self reflection in the "stories we tell" about ourselves through song, dance and in this case documentary film can actually interest and at best inspire someone but one must know the fine line between telling a personal story and extreme self-indulgence. Too bad, because if it was summarized effectively (i.e. it could have been a 75-80 minute documentary without losing its value) then I would have left remembering that Polley has a unique ability to capture a holistic autobiography creatively on film.

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of Sarah Polley since "The Sweet Hereafter," and Michael P is memorable as one of the music-hall cutups in "Slings and Arrows" (which is on our shortlist of best TV series ever, btw). I guess it's interesting that even Canadian showfolk sometimes got up to mischief in the 70s; Sarah's no Errol Morris, but she does a pretty good job of rounding up the surviving members of her extended family (most of them quite charming) and "interrogating" them about what went on in those days. A fair number of online commenters have objected to the sly way that a few staged scenes, cleverly processed to look like vintage Super 8, are included in the film, but that only seems to underscore the point that the past can only be recovered through memory and the imagination. (It's pretty clear which scenes are staged and which are real home movies, I think.) I agree that the critics may have oversold this one, and it does go on a bit too long after the big reveal, but basically I'd recommend it.</fullReview>

While some of the magic-tricks that Polley seems to be playing ? mixing actual 8mm film footage shot of her family at the time with (albeit very smoothly transitioned) reenactments with actors playing her mother, father, siblings, and the lover who turned out to be her biological father ? is a bit tiring near the end, it's ultimately a fantastic story, a wonderful and bittersweet look at the ties that bind, how we delineate truth and fiction, and that love is really what should count. It's power is when it is its simplest ? or when we see Polley's father in a recording booth reciting some finely written narration for her daughter (her father, by the way, is a known British actor from Canada, Michael Polley).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Life in Memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actress and filmmaker Sarah Polley found out when she was in her early twenties that the father who raised her was not her biological father. "Stories We Tell" is her reconstruction of the circumstances that led her mother (who died when Polley was 11) to have an affair and child with another man. She interviews both of the fathers as well as her siblings and other key players in her mother's life in an attempt to piece together a portrait of the woman, and she creates fake home video footage to supplement the action. In what amounts to a small twist (at least it was for me), we see about mid-way through the movie Polley directing this fake footage, and the actors she's assembled to play her various family members, and realize that what we've been watching all along has been a recreation and not the real thing. I suppose I should have known I wasn't watching actual home video footage, and if I'd paused long enough to think about it I probably would have figured that out on my own, but I didn't, so the twist worked on me.I'm not sure "Stories We Tell" accomplished Polley's stated objective, which she claims over and over again during the film to be an examination of the past and the way it's impossible to ever get at the truth of past events because they're distorted through the prisms of others' memories and recollections. The problem with her theory is that everyone's account of the past is pretty consistent, and there aren't really different perceptions of how things went down. But even if it's not successful at achieving that goal, it's still a fascinating exploration of family dynamics, and we feel the sense of closure watching this film that Polley probably felt in making it.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is recommended.Michael and Diane were two very different people who fell in love. Both actors, Michael was quiet and introspective, a private person, while Diane was loud and out-going, always the life of the party. &nbsp;They met, married, and raised a family. Their life story is on public display in Stories We Tell, a fascinating examination of family dynamics written and directed by their actress/director daughter, Sarah Polley. This investigative documentary uses the various viewpoints of family members and friends and their clouded memories of real events to create a cinematic tapestry of a dysfunctional family trying to come to terms with the actual truth of their family history. Through home movies that contrast the former images of the two lovers and candid interviews by their off-springs, Stories We Tell hones in on the life and death of their mother and the direct effect on all of its' family members. Diane's past transgressions and erratic decisions seemed to complicate everyone's life before and after her death, making many of the brothers and sisters question their own relationships with their parents. As with time, memory and reality blurs and the truth remains elusive. The past and present ultimately collide in this documentary of hidden affairs, divorce, and questionable paternity issues. As the filmmaker delves into her mother's mysterious past to find clear-cut answers, it takes a toll on each family member.Stories We Tell gets to be almost too personal in its message, relying on conjecture and here- say to form its narrative structure. The subject matter is always interesting but too limited in scope. On one hand, one almost feels voyeuristic in experiencing this film. Yet, the filmmaking is expertly assembled and must have been cathartic for some of the family and seen as an embarrassment by others. That said, Ms. Polley has made a well-crafted film with strong editing techniques, effectively blending the footage of the interviewees speaking movingly about the emotional damage cast upon them with the many happier family images that haunt their recollections. (Particularly ironic is the inclusion of a segment with Diane singing Ain't Misbehavin'.) &nbsp;Stories We Tell tells its story very well.

		<fullReview>'STORIES WE TELL': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Actress and filmmaker Sarah Polley wrote and directed this documentary about a long kept family secret. She interviewed several family members and close friends and had her father Michael Polly narrate the movie (by reading from his memoir). Polley also recorded reenactments of significant events in her family's history, with a Super-8 camera, making the video appear like old home movies. She cast actors as key players in the scenes; like Rebecca Jenkins as her mother Dianne (who lost a battle to cancer when Sarah was just 11). The whole film revolves around her mother and a possible affair she had, which may have led to Sarah's conception. I found it to be well made and somewhat interesting but not overly involving or emotionally fascinating. The movie is presented sort of like a 'making of the documentary' film as much as an actual documentary. Polley records her father reading the narration and includes a lot of the commentary and dialogue they had between takes (often highlighting moments when she'd ask him to repeat a line). The interviews are shown with outtakes included as well and I at first didn't realize the Super-8 footage was fake but the film includes 'behind the scenes' video of that too. I think the methods Polley used (of presenting a story) are interesting and unique; they also definitely distinguish it (quite a bit) from similar documentaries.The movie got rave reviews and is actually one of the best rated films of the year (by critics). Despite this it failed to secure an Oscar nomination for 'Best Documentary'. I haven't seen most of the films nominated in that category (this year) but I don't think this is up to par with what I usually expect from a 'Best Documentary' film. It's filmed in an interesting way but it doesn't quite grab the viewer and impact them emotionally the way the filmmakers want it to (at least it didn't for me). Still it is a good documentary that's worth seeing though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAydMPYt0Hs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tender and often moving inquiry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Produced in collaboration with the National Film Board of Canada, Canadian director Sarah Polley's documentary Stories We Tell is a tender and often moving inquiry into the life of her mother Diana who died in 1990 from cancer when Sarah was only eleven years old. Her investigation, consisting of interviews with her Toronto family members aided by Super-8 home movies (60% of which are recreated using look-alike actors), uncovers family secrets that slowly begin to be revealed during the course of the film. Sarah not only directs the movie but also conducts the interviews with the storytellers that include her father, siblings and half-siblings, and close friends of her mother who all share their memories of Diana and what she meant to them in their lives.Though Sarah does not share her own feelings or thoughts, she does acknowledge that her bond with Michael and her four siblings grew closer after her mother's death. Polley comes from a family closely associated with the theater. Her mother was an actress as was her father Michael, who narrates the story from his written account of his memories. Family members are asked to "tell the story from the beginning until now," and they relate their recollection of Diana and how she affected their lives, their stories filled with emotion and sometimes tears. As the storytellers go on, it becomes clear that Diana was a free spirit who was a more complex person than at first imagined.Everyone's memories of Diana and the details of her life are somewhat different but, on the whole, they complement each other, each providing one more piece of the puzzle. One interesting aspect of the story is the long term close relationship Diana had with film producer Harry Gulkin, a former union organizer and left-wing activist, and how the consequences of their affair strongly impacted Sarah's life. Though the film talks about their affair as one that stemmed from Michael's inability to satisfy Diana on many levels, we do not really know Diana's own thoughts and feelings on the subject.As far as Gulkin is concerned, he does share his point of view but lets it be known that he is uncomfortable in the context of the film and that he feels the story should be his alone to tell. Although it may go on a bit longer than necessary, Stories We Tell is never less than fascinating and is especially noteworthy for its refusal to engage in mawkishness or sentimentality. Though there are differences in interpretation among the storytellers, the fact that Sarah's family remains supportive of each other after all the years is a testament to their resilience and mutual respect.Stories We Tell underscores the point that it is difficult to separate what actually happened from the story we tell about it, our interpretation of the event. What is not said, however, is that over time, the story may become the only reality we know. When that happens, we no longer have a story, but we become our story, a position that severely limits our ability to grow. Perhaps the film's greatest contribution is to suggest a process that other families can use to look at how their interpretations often get in the way of acknowledging the simple truth of what happened and allow them to see events in their life from a broader perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sarah Polley is just wonderful. She is a lovely and intelligently gifted artist and thanks to her love of exploring she has created a very uniquely enjoyable documentary that tells the story of an issue within her family, from various points of view. Having it told from more than one perspective (in such an intimate way) is what makes this film work so well. Events are commonly remembered differently from person to person, depending on what is important to that individual... and this film puts that phenomena on display. It's like sitting in on a family discussion, among people that love each other very much. Whenever 10 people look at 1 thing, there are 10 different versions of that 1 thing existing in mass consciousness. Her talent has not been tainted by 'US Hollywood Inc'. She's very thoughtful and is able to focus on telling a story in an original way- even if her biological father insisted on telling the story from just his perspective. Seeing the finished product is justifying enough that her choice was the way to go. What she's created is Very original in form and she should be very proud of her finished product. This is a testament to Family, Love and what ties human beings together through the 'Stories We Tell' to one another. I know when I'm seeing something special and this was definitely in that realm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ripple effect of family secrets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even the loneliest man who ever lived had a mother and a father. No matter how superfluous he may have been in later life, he was born somewhere and meant something to someone. That's the great truth of humanity. We all come from the same space; we all come from the same reproductive process. We all exit the birth canal. What happens after that is built, not on the great cosmic luck of the draw, but on the lives led by those who surround us. The circumstances that bring us to the moment of our expulsion into the world can remain a mystery held in the stories told by those who come before us.As Sarah Polley's deeply intimate documentary "Stories We Tell" gets underway, she sits her father Michael down in front of a microphone to narrate his memoirs. Michael Polley is an actor, known on Canadian television for his role on the series "Slings and Arrows" on which Sarah has had cameo role. Michael Polley, through a craggy English accent, speaks eloquently about the mystery of who he was in the decades before his own birth. "It is clear to me that I was always there," he says, "somewhere in my ancestor's DNA just waiting to be born. So, this unique 'I' has always existed, even in the mystery of nothingness." The mystery of what happened in Sarah's own "nothingness" is the center of "Stories We Tell," in which she films her family members telling the story of how her mother and father formed a relationship that eventually led to the moment that Sarah would enter their lives. Polley is an actress and a director. You may have seen her in films like "Go" and "The Sweet Hereafter." Recently she's turned to directing films like "Away from Her" and "Take this Waltz." This is her third feature, and just the nature of it says a great deal about her as a director and as a person.In "Stories We Tell" Polley asks her family (in separate interviews) to tell the whole story of her parent's relationship from the beginning. We hear from Sarah's older sisters Joanna and Susy, and her brothers Mark and John and from people who were critical figures in her mother's life. At first her family seems somewhat startled by this question, but as they talk, they reveal more and more. As youngsters, both Michael and Diane (Sarah's mother) were stage actors who fell in love with one another. The relationship quickly began to cool under the imbalance of affection (he loved her more than she loved him.) We learn a great deal about Diane. She died of cancer in 1990 when Sarah was still a child, and it is Diane's story that makes up most of the narrative. Through stories and old home movies, we meet Diane as a person who was a free-spirit, someone for whom life seemed to be a free-wheeling carnival. She was never fit for a family, a husband, children, a home, school. She wasn't irresponsible, but we come to understand that she just wasn't designed for our definition of a "normal" life.Midway through the film something is revealed about Diane that won't be revealed here. One of the great things about "Stories We Tell" is that as Sarah's family tells more and more stories about Michael and Diane, more and more layers begin to peel back. We learn things about Diane that even Sarah doesn't seem to know. Then at about the mid-point of the film, it turns into something else. Sarah discovers an entirely new section of her family that she never knew. How she reacts is simply incredible. More on that cannot be revealed without spoilers.Traditional documentaries lead us to believe that the movie is just going to be a series of talking heads. For the most part we're right, but Polley experiments with narrative structures that give the revelations more emotional punch then we might have expected. The interviews are very intimate and no two are ever the same. Through the stories, Diane becomes a complex individual and the movie cross-cuts to examine Sarah's life and how it has affected her.By the end, we feel that we've come to know Diane. She was a woman who felt trapped. She didn't see her life tied down to a family, but she became trapped by them. That may sound like a tired cliché but as Polley digs further and further, she unearths truths the break the traditional narrative wide open. Stories told over and over have a way of pulling the diamonds from the rough, of covering the negatives with positives. Polley reveals her mother's positive and negative and allows us to see her as a human being. She was a person who was complex and deep. She was joyful and yet sad. This is the story of the strange bonds of family and the overwhelming ripple effects of the secrets we keep.**** (of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sorry spectacle -- spoiler alert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoy spending hours in the company of completely self-absorbed people struggling to make their banal lives somehow dramatic and important, this documentary is for you. It's hard for me to imagine a more pathetic waste of time than listening to the endless jawboning of this clan of no-talents as they rehash sordid but ultimately so-what family events with the gravitas of Walter Cronkite reporting on D-Day. The only thing that is remarkable about the assembled cast as they tell their stories to the camera is how truly clueless and narcissistic each family member is, along with the outer members of their circle. There is plenty of archival video to flesh out the threadbare story. In fact, this tribe of narcissists seems to have shot home video of virtually every moment of their dreary lives -- from having drinks in a nondescript bar to walking down the street, sitting in the kitchen, and so on. Spare us from such bores.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but Interminable and uninformative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give the filmmaker credit - Sarah Polley. It's an interesting way to do a documentary/tribute to your deceased mother and get to the heart of some big incident you keep hearing about and have to wait until the big secret is out.This film mixes actual footage and "recreated" footage designed to look like the real thing to simulate what must have happened long ago. I didn't care for this mixture of the real and artificial which somewhat soils the whole point of hearing different people's differing perspectives about the same incident.But what made me give this film a middling review - perhaps the only one you'll ever find online - is that there is an incredible amount of redundancy to the point of the film feeling interminable and not going anywhere. Putting it simply, from beginning to end the film indulges itself in talky, not so informative discussions with various people familiar with Sarah's mother and circumstances surrounding an "event" that was pivotal. Most say the same thing and hearing it over and over again becomes horribly tedious.And then there is the turning point. The film obsesses with what happened and continues to cover so much of the same ground without adding anything new. At almost an hour and 50 minutes, I was ready to lose it after 20 minutes. You must stay until the very end - and stay until you see the credits - otherwise you'll miss the second "bombshell" of this movie.So why the average to fair rating? This film desperately needed an editor and a fresh pair of eyes. Walking out of the film I really don't know too much about this family and there was so much more to add that was left out because of an obsession with rehashing the same main event. Critics have fawned all over the movie but don't say you aren't forewarned. Others in the theater felt the same way with the exception of an artsy "time on my hands" woman who seemed to revel in spending as much time indulging.This film may be slightly better than my rating but it was one of the few films that me and my company felt was "interminable" - and that's too bad. I'll give it a 5.5 with a caveat that it's only for those who like an excessive amount of self-expression without much movement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched it knowing fairly little about the film. Sarah Polley is doing a documentary. Soon into it, the audience will realize it's a documentary about Sarah's own family. It takes awhile to set up. For the first 30 minutes, my take was this is a better-than-most home movies. Then there is the shock of what this movie is actually about.It is definitely a brave personal project for Sarah Polley. And it's important to not read any of the spoilers. It is possibly the most intriguing use of film recently. It makes you question the reality of her story, and given some personal reflection, it'll make you question the reality of your own story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now that's a documentary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time in a very long time I have seen a documentary that actually fits the definition: "using pictures or interviews with people involved in real events to provide a factual report on a particular subject". It feels good to enter the word "documentary" in the search box and not end up watching some transparent propaganda, investigative journalism dribble or twisted portrayal of the facts. Step aside BBC Panorama, Louis Theroux and Michael Moore. And thank you Sarah Polley for simply being interested in the truth. I cannot help think it would not have been half as good had most of the protagonists not been from the world of acting and writing, as they would not have been so eloquent and interesting in the way they relayed their memories. But Sarah Polley clearly used that to her advantage by opting for this interview based and script-reading format.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story that should be heard for families that thing they are dysfunctional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Would your juiciest family story make for an interesting documentary? Director Sarah Polley had a enough confidence in her unique, completely arbitrary family story about her mother and her many relationships and made it into a feature-length documentary that is more interesting and explorative than one may think. Stories We Tell is a deep and personal story about Polley herself, who desperately wants to find out if the man she called "dad" for her entire life is actually her real birth-father.The story is so gripping and intriguing that I'll do my best to keep my summation concise. In 1965, a woman named Diane met a man named Michael as they acted in a play together. Diane seemed to have truly fell in love with the character Michael played in the play, which was extremely different than how he acted in real life. Michael, who is still alive, states that they were immensely different because she'd be doing ten things at once, while he'd be doing half of one.Even though Diane and Michael gave birth to many children, Diane wanted to get away from the responsibility for a while and fly from her home in Toronto to Montreal in order to act in a play for six - eight weeks. When she came back, it was like everything was normal, until she discovered she was pregnant. Michael thought it was his. Diane was very uncertain, as she knew she had romantic relationships with people in Montreal. Contemplating an abortion, but choosing to give birth to the child in the long run, Diane gives birth to young, redheaded Sarah.All was well for a number of years, until Sarah's brother John recovers a repressed memory of mom crying on the phone, worried about not knowing who the father of her post-Montreal pregnancy was. John claims that he put away the conversation in his head soon after hearing it because he already knew of family complications and such and felt this would only make things worse. It wasn't until recently that John was forced to confront the memory once more after his aunt brought it up, and the thought - combined with the long-running joke that Sarah looks nothing else like her many brothers and sisters lead to the creation of Stories We Tell, one of the most entertaining documentaries of the year.I eel that all filmmakers should make one personal documentary in their career, shedding light on their personal lives through examining their family, their childhood, their schooling, etc. I say this because of how much I feel that elements of Stories We Tell, from Polley's examination of her childhood and upbringing, are subtly communicated in her other films. A few months back I caught Take This Waltz on Television, Polley's preceding directorial effort. The film was a colorful (literally) portrait of a young relationship impulsiveness captured with a sort of appreciation for sensory manipulation. Here, her stylistic attributes are reduced to some cute, faux-home-movie footage with watered down, faded qualities. Even if I found myself seeing Take This Waltz as only passable, and lightly amusing, I think after viewing Polley's followup film, I find Take This Waltz to be more of an understandable film as a whole. It shows the consequences and mishaps that evolve without careful planning on ones' part.Stories We Tell works as a beautiful showcase of Polley's family, but it's the personal insights to her childhood and her current life that make the film so rewarding. It humanizes the often elusive film director, who's often viewed almost as an archetype - not an actual thinking, living person. Polley's story may make your family seem natural and normal. If not, it'll at latest provide a pleasant humanization to the people behind the films we love that often go unnoticed. The film is a rarity; it's a win-win from almost every conceivable direction and angle.Directed by: Sarah Polley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and engaging while also being unsuccessful in its goals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actress and filmmaker Sarah Polley decides to make this film about her family history, with a particular early focus on her mother who died many years prior. In building the story of her family she draws on all those alive who were involved and this is probably as much as you want to know. Many others have put too many details in their comments without warning and I think this is unfair as this is a film that is better when you come at it without knowing everything. Polley tells this story in a way that is engaging and interesting. Early in the film one of the contributors asks "who would want to know about our family" and it is a fair question since, although it has famous members ? they are really not that famous. In reality though the film is structured and delivered in such a way that, while you may not have an interest in this specific family, their story is engagingly told.On this level I liked the film and I thought it worked well, but I have to disagree with the comments made by many in regard what it else it does. Many have praised the film for showing how stories get fragmented and twisted and how perspectives etc influence their telling and indeed Polley herself lays this out as the goal for the film when she is asked towards the end. Perhaps it is because she said it so clearly that some assumed she'd done this and perhaps it is also the reason why it stood out to me that she didn't, even though I liked what she had done with it. The problem with this goal is that, while the story over the past few decades may have been half-told, twisted and gradually revealed with different people knowing or thinking different things, in the film this is not the case at all. Indeed the thing that makes the story so engaging is that it is so well structured to be gradually delivered, be clear and be interesting on its impact on the family. Everyone contributing knows the full story and while they may have different opinions on small things or motivations of others, there really isn't something like Rashomon here where the same thing is different from different angles. There are no questions left, no doubt at any point really ? we get introduced, follow the story quickly and efficiently and are left at the end with everything neatly done.The irony is that for me the film works well like this. I enjoyed the story and how well told it was and I found the contributors to be honest, human and engaging. It is a very personal and human film and this was the quality I took from it. I still had no reason to care about this specific family over any other, but it worked nonetheless. To me it is almost a shame that Polley laid out this alternative goal because she really doesn't get anywhere near achieving it and indeed if she hadn't said anything about it I would never have guessed such an objective was ever on the table.It works for what it is, but in terms of its own goals it is unsuccessful ? but it still worked for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These people aren't interesting and the story is completely white trash, trailer park garbage only it took place among people of wealth and standing.I don't claim to know their financial origins but, if they claimed to come from meager backgrounds I would insist they're lying. These are the people that always have money whether or not they are holding a job. Socialites who live in fantasy land. The people who condone sex with minors if they're willing. The winos that live on massive estates outside the city or in the city in town houses and have dinner parties that turn into god only knows. The families with gay, heroin addicted children who somehow manage to live on the brink of death for 20 years before finally recovering.It's a huge waste of time and money yet they believe they are so important, so interesting and so very entitled, they made this pile of crap with a misleading premise just so they could talk about themselves.It's not an introspective on story telling and it's roots! It's an ego maniacal mess of idiocy that only appeals to the retards in it and that know them personally!!! The fact that they titled it the way they did to be so misleading is just typical of this culture.These might not be THE PEOPLE but they are definitely of the CULTURE of people who own all our senators, judges etc. with either their money or filthy secrets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the first piano key to the last tune the music editing of this brilliant and touching film subtly underline the story Sarah Polley tells on film through numerous witnesses. The technique employed to recreate perhaps 60% of the past is extraordinarily smooth and beautifully integrated. "The Story" is read and written by Michael, Sarahs dad (spoiler excluded). It is pure poetry and the actor's voice...he is a stage actor in life...is marvelously emotive. This is enough to say...just go see it and marvel at the audacity of the filmmaker and her crew who labored for five years to bring this film to screening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth or Consequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. As a lover of indie films, I've long been an admirer of actress and director Sarah Polley. Her two feature film directorial efforts "Away From Her" and "Take This Waltz" displayed not just an eye for the camera, but more importantly, a unique story-telling vision. This time she turns and focuses her story telling skills on her own family, in what is a very intimate pull back of the curtain.Polley takes a three-tiered documentary approach to the telling of stories associated with her mother (actress Diane Polley). Sarah intertwines interviews with her brothers, sisters and family friends with the voice recording (by her father Michael Polley) of his memoirs, and some staged Super-8 looking video of reenactments of certain events from these corresponding stories. It's a different approach and works to keep the viewer engaged, even in the slower segments.Much has been made of the variances within the stories told by the family members. In fact, the stories all seem remarkably similar but it nonetheless is a terrific study in memories and how we come to view our version as the truth. Of course, the obvious answer is that how a memory impacts us does in fact become our truth. Within the first few minutes of the movie, one of Sarah's siblings says something along the lines of "Why would anyone care about our family?". At this point, we tend to agree with her. Even once the real story and secrets are exposed, it's not difficult to think that these stories could be replayed for numerous families throughout the globe. Sure, the Polley family has the whole showbiz thing, but for family relationships and personal secrets and associated pain, I'm not convinced there is anything extraordinary here ... other than the fantastic presentation.The value here, other than exorcising any personal Polley demons, is with the technical brilliance Sarah shows as a documentarian and story-teller. She spends little time on camera, but we realize this is much more her own story than that of her mother (as it's set up). Clearly Michael was not fully engaged as a doting father, though that's hardly unusual. It appears their relationship comes courtesy of Sarah's commitment to making it happen ... before, during and after the big reveal. Polley's talents as a filmmaker have probably brought her family closer, despite the remaining question of exactly what her motivation was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best documentary of 2012!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rather unusual for a director to shoot a documentary which pivots on her private family life, being the one behind the camera to interview others, her side of story mostly remains elusive, actress-turned-director Sarah Polley's latest acclaimed documentary about the startling discovery of her biological father is a pure revelation and a wondrous crowd-pleaser. Starts with family members recall her late mother Diane Polley (who passed away from cancer in 1990), an actress, a twice-married woman (with 5 offspring), a freewheeling soul lives everyday to its fullest. The narrative takes a midstream swerve when a secret is slowly to be debunked, after Diane's death, Sarah and her siblings would find out her liaison with a man who would be Sarah's biological father when she was in Montreal for a short spell to act in a play. There is a small twist of finding her father, but it is not the keynote of Sarah's film, like she mentions in the film, what intrigues her the most is the way stories are being told, and how can one get the truth when the only one who is able to reveal what is the absolute truth is long gone? So Sarah glean information and trivia from participants, friends, onlookers and gossipers, the most poignant one is from her father Michael Polley, whose instant response is affecting and genuine, the family bond surmounts bloodline lineage, which is an important criterion elevates human beings as a supreme specie on the earth. Interposing the interviews with real-life footages and re-enactment of the past story gives the film a distinctive shade of perusing an old photo book or watching a vintage super-8 video playing out. Every family has its own snags and their complications, what makes the Polleys' so compelling is save the provocative scandal aside, the film actually anatomizes deeper into the source material and transpires itself to a reflective reminder of how one's life could only be experienced once and any kind of recount is futile, as long as it involves more than 1 person, there is always a murky territory where certain feelings are unfathomable since only myself knows exactly how I feel and what has happened to me, not even soul-mates would have that power. The film is a new entry into my Top 10 films of 2012, and the best documentary feature of 2012 so far, Sarah Polley doubtlessly is courageous and tactful, a firm spearhead on behalf of female counterpart in the male-skewing director sector.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it a documentary or not? When the film is over, you're not certain. Not so much because of the unbelievable story as because of the Super 8 clips. Are they authentic or not?Well, you become rather certain finally, but it's after a quite silent merry-go-round ride, there everything is turned upside down when you didn't expect it. It's the daughter trying to reconstruct the relation between her mother and father. It's made in a very touching way and many family members and friends of the couple take part.Saying more would perhaps mean spoiling it all.

		<shortDescription>The PERFECT Canadian Film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the movies made in Canada pretend to be set in the U.S. This bogus counterfeiting of locations such as New York City virtually always flops. Furthermore, a lot of low budget horror flicks come from north of the border with the covert objective of making pretend-Americans look more stupid than a country which puts the head of some other nation's monarch on all their postage stamps, coins, and folding money. Though STORIES WE TELL writer\director Sarah Polley may well carry some of this funny money in her purse, she has seldom been associated with the plethora of fake and lame versions of the United States inundating us from the country that found all the animals, birds, and fish apparently were taken already when it came time to belatedly design a national flag. Polley is one Canadian who has tried to stand up for what's right on the streets of her homeland in real life, and she has been savagely beaten by the authorities (and lost teeth!) because of her relatively high principals. So, what makes Polley tick? STORIES WE TELL may not answer the question, since she employs actors to portray her relatives, as well as her having her actual relatives appear as themselves, in an ostensible quest to uncover the mystery of her paternity. (Hint: There are no angelic proclamations here.) More than likely, Polley is using the possible existence of her parents as a metaphor designed to elicit thoughts of a distinct national identity for her homeland, however distant and improbable such a development may seem today. Good for Sarah! Keep up the great work!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A unique and deeply moving documentary. Actress/director Sarah Polley had always had a suspicion that she was the product of an affair her mother had when she was doing a play in Montreal. This was often played as a family joke, even between her and her father (Michael Polley), but as the years went on she decided she wanted to know. And she eventually discovered that the stories were true. When all was said and done, she decided to make this movie about it, and the results are stunning. It's an interesting story in its own right, and Polley infuses it with so much love, especially for the father who raised her, the father she only recently discovered and her long dead mother (who died when she was only around 10). But there's something more, something surprising, with the way she constructs and then deconstructs the documentary format. Only near the very end does it reveal how brilliant the whole thing is. My only complaint is sort of minor, given how successful the film is, but I did wish there was a bit more detail given to the family history near the beginning. It led to a bit of confusion as the film went on. But it's not much and it's easy enough to figure it out by the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Meta Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmmaker/actress Sarah Polley deserves to be titled in that order, if it makes a huge difference. Yes, she's a luminous actress, but over the past 4 years and 3 films, Polley has ascended into something bigger than that... a woman crafting tremendous, personal works of art that transcend her young age.Polley's latest film, "Stories We Tell" is a documentary, turning the lens on herself and her own family as she scalpels away at the truth of the infectious personality of mom Diane and exactly what happened in the late 70's. Using direct interviews, grainy home video footage and even actor-portrayed recreations, "Stories We Tell" charts the timeline of her family with judicious investigation. Why doesn't she look like the rest of her family? What causes a marriage to fade into boredom and familiarity? And what's the responsibility of future generations to trace the truth of past ones? All of these questions are answered in Polley's capable hands, at great personal cost to all.In actuality, Polley has probably been answering these questions for years now. Her debut film, "Away From Her" was a moving and real depiction of a woman's slow ascent into sickness, featuring a wonderfully nuanced performance by Julie Christie and, obviously, based on the slow progression of cancer that eventually took Polley's own mother when she was just 11 years old. Last year, Polley released "Take This Waltz"... a film starring Michelle Williams as a woman torn between the comforts (and boredom) of marriage and the exciting possibility of an affair. I was on the fence about the film, amazed by certain moments of spontaneity but taken aback by the weird outbursts of Williams' character. After seeing "Stories We Tell", it's clear "Take This Waltz" was more autobiographical than anyone realized. Both films, seen as a fictional and then non-fictional rendering of the same woman- Polley's mother- compliment each other and deepen the conflicted and quizzical feelings Sarah must have about her mother. While most of us can appreciate a parent in the here and now, Polley is recreating her through grainy images, interpretive writing and tough questions.In "Stories We Tell", a unique structure is used where her own father reads aloud from a text (we find out at the end of the film where it came from) and Polley frames the images around the meta-textual musings. It's ironic (and somehow perfect) that the most memorable images of the documentary are stationary reaction shots of Polley as she listens, her face or mouth or eyes tightening or twitching in discovery as the words are made. Not only is it a human moment, but a touching one that forces the audience to discover and relate to her own discovery. The best non-fiction works, like those of Jonathan Caouette or Ross McElwee, not only mine the potential of a great personal story but they allow us unsettling peaks behind the emotional curtain of the author or storyteller. Sarah Polley has created a brave undressing of her family that not only belongs in this class of personal docudrama, but stands head and shoulders above anything else this year so far.www.itsamadmadblog2.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're thinking of doing your own family history documentary, watch this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever thought of doing your own family history documentary, 'Stories We Tell' is a good model to follow. It's put together by the noted Canadian filmmaker, Sarah Polley, who focuses on her mother, Diane, who died of cancer when she was 11 years old in 1990. It also helps to have some dark family secrets which you can draw from as Ms. Polley did, in constructing her 'Rashomon-like' project.A good part of 'Stories' is narrated by Sarah's father, Michael, from his pre-written take on the family history, under Sarah's direction, in a recording studio. Also in the mix are Sarah's siblings (some from her mother's first marriage), who have their own unique perspective on the family goings-on.Things really heat up when it's revealed that Michael might not be Sarah's biological father. At one point in the 80s, Sarah's mother, a part-time actress, took a trip from Toronto (where the family was living) to Montreal, to perform in a play for a few months. Eventually, Sarah discovers that indeed she has a different father. He turns out to be a fairly well-known film producer, Harry Gulkin, who her mother had an affair with while she was acting in the play up in Montreal.The documentary is enhanced seemingly by Super-8 archival footage of Polley's parents and Gulkin during the time of the affair. It turns out that Polley has conscripted actors who look quite similar to younger incarnations of her parents and passes that footage off as the real thing. It somehow works and you actually feel you're watching footage contemporary to that period.Nick McCarthy in Slant Magazine, cogently observes that the documentary acts as a sort of therapy for its creator: "As an actress, student, and practitioner of film, Polley uses the tool of cinema as a form of therapy, as a way to rationalize and gain deeper, satisfying clarity for how the world of her family functions, and we're pleased to lie on the couch and silently weep along through each bittersweet realization." Polley ends up as a mostly detached observer in imparting her family history. This may or may not have been a good thing. Certainly there is enough emotion to go around, particularly in Gulkin's insistence that the film really is "his" story.My main criticism is that the Polley's story goes on a good twenty minutes too long. Often I felt she was about to end the story but then tacks on additional interview footage of her father, which felt a tad bit unnecessary.Despite the length, 'Stories We Tell' is one fascinating memoir of a talented filmmaker's offbeat family history. If you're thinking of putting together your own video family house, look to Sarah Polley's technique, for inspiration.</fullReview>
