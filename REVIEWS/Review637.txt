		<fullReview>In the age of Matrix, I Robot, A.I., Minority Report, etcetera. ain't easy to find adventure-movies made in the old style: the good guy, the very bad guy, the girl, and a happy ending ... Well, this is what Hidalgo offers us.Viggo Mortensen's character is a cowboy specializing in long distance horse races, he and his horse (Hidalgo, a Mustang) are just unbeatable. So some arabian skeikh (Omar Sharif) sends for him to take part in the biggest horse race in the world (4.800km long, through the Arabian desert) to prove that Mortensen's non-thoroughbred horse is not as good and resistant as arabian horses. That's the starting point. And from that moment on we will witness a marvelous adventure through the desert in which the starring will have to face all kind of difficulties and traps. As I've said: and old style adventure movie. No absurd and meaningless special effects, no absurd and unbelievable plots, and no pretensions but to make the audience have a good time. And no doubt Joe Johnston achieves that: the movie is 136 minutes long but you don't feel tired nor boring in any moment. The rhythm is just great and well measured. The photography and the landscapes are just astonishing; and the work of Mortensen is so remarkable. He seems to be the perfect heir to those actors specializing in adventure movies just like Harrison Ford, though Mortensen's characters (Hidalgo, LOTR) usually are a little more darker than Ford's. My rate: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read some pretty disparaging comments about this movie that make me wonder what on earth was so bad? Let's see, there were objections over the predictability of the plot, the stereotyping, the music and on and on. People need to relax and enjoy this movie as entertainment only. I personally thought it was one of the nicest new releases I'd seen.I know this was another movie about the underdog winning against all odds but I like this kind of movie. I thought the screenplay was admirable in it's restraint not having the main character even kiss the two women involved. The music was very moving and beautiful.Perhaps some people have become so jaded that a movie simply isn't complete unless there's a helicopter chase, an exploding car or two (or in this case, a wagon), a trip to the nearby strip club with the flashing lights(where all characters in search of answers seem to end up at), gratuitous sex scenes, oh yeah, don't forget to use the 'F' word and while we're at it: let take God's name in vain a few times for the sake of 'realism'.Hollywood needs to make more movies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a film that I could watch almost any time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK: so what makes a film a "10"? For me, every scene has to work. Would I take out any scenes? If so, then the flick isn't a 10. Also, does each scene move the story forward? If this is seamlessly done, then all the better. "Hidalgo" not only does this; but it does so easily, and unobtrusivesly, with the sense that the lead actor (Vigo Mortensen) is the vehicle for an ongoing, and interesting, story ... and what a story it is! Just as with the film Apollo 13, the fact that the story is based on real history and fact makes the story-telling more than a good tale. It tells us something worth remembering.Did I mention that this is a rippingly good story? Did I mention that all of the actors are compellingly good ... including the horse (Hidalgo)? Did I mention that this movie transcends facile categorization (Western, Adventure, Drama, etc.?) This is just a damned good, under-appreciated movie.The bonus material on the DVD is worthy of inclusion in a course on Western Civilization (a course that I've taught several times)? See this for yourself. I doubt that you'll be disappointed. In fact, I think that you'll recognize this as equal to such under-appreciated films such as "King of Hearts" and "Kasper Hauser" ... films that you'll be proud to own and to show to your friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoy the Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent, epic tale. This is not a fast-paced film; rather, think of it as story unfolding before your eyes, so sit back and enjoy the ride. There's plenty of adventure along the way, and I shed a few tears as well. It is a moving narrative. Viggo Mortensen plays the lead character, Frank T. Hopkins, with aplomb, humor, humility, and spunk. Hidalgo, his painted mustang, plays his part well, also! Hopkins is a cowboy/Pony Express rider with a heritage that he holds to himself and is revealed in time. Especially heart-wrenching is the Battle of Wounded Knee. More massacre than battle, it had a profound and personal impact on Hopkins' life.In the legendary 3,000-mile Ocean of Fire race across the sands of the Arabian desert, Hopkins and his horse must face treachery and the cruel desert elements in an endurance race that pushes man and beast to their limits. If you like horses, adventure, and epic films, this is a movie for you. Expect moments of triumph and humor that make you laugh and cheer, as well as moments of tragedy. It is a story beautifully told and carefully crafted, though not without mistakes. A few scenes could have been edited to preserve the epic feel while maintaining the film's pace. At certain points it was natural for the film to slow down, but it should not have been allowed to slow down to the point of stalling. However, in defense of the filmmakers, they were successful in capturing the tedium, beauty and peril of crossing a desert in a 3,000-mile race, and it gave viewers a real feeling for what it might be like to make such a journey. The relationship Frank T. Hopkins has with his horse in this movie is especially touching, and is perhaps the highlight of the film. Supporting roles by the rest of the cast were outstanding. Omar Sharif was amazing as always. Even the smallest actors shone in their parts.Mr. Mortensen's diverse talents, including his aptitude for learning languages (Lakota/Sioux in this case), his own horseback riding skills, and his versatility as an actor made him a perfect fit for this part. Mr. Mortensen's book, Miyelo, which sprang from this movie, is a fine choice for anyone who wants to see a sampling of Mr. Mortensen's outstanding photography. Frank T. Hopkins remained a staunch advocate of the wild Mustang horse until his death. Keep in mind that the real Frank T. Hopkins was known for his weaving of tall tales; thus, the "legendary" Ocean of Fire race.A highly recommended movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hidalgo is one of those movies that comes along once in a blue moon. This is a movie NOT to be missed.Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of a gentle, laid-back cowboy hearkens back to the golden age of cinema and would make the likes of Gary Cooper proud! His subtle blend of virtue such as honor, honest and pride - without being the least bit preachy, make watching his performance an utter joy.All of the actors are brilliant in their roles, especially the one in the title role! Hidalgo is clever and entertaining without being unbelievable as many animal movies are these days. You won't find him standing on his hind legs and doing the hokey-pokey, but his talents are very evident and he becomes a hero that we all love before the end of the movie.One of the best parts of this movie is the fact that it is a movie by grownups for grownups, although it carries enough action and suspense that kids will probably like it to. Absent, however is the sickeningly sweet "kids scenes" that we simply cannot get away from in movies today. No charming close ups of dimple-faced waifs. No little wise-mouthed child prodigies - nothing but good old fashioned grown-up fun! How refreshing.You will be happy to know that the ending isn't as predictable as it could have been. Although falling into the "happy" category (of course), there are poignant moments and you might shed a tear. One other aspect of this film which I found intriguing is the issue of examining and accepting who we are. It was very well done and meaningful. Overall this film is easily a 10+. Please see it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old-Fashioned Adventure Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's an "epic" movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid 1960s such as Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence Of Arabia. Interesting to note that Omar Sharif was in this modern-day movie and Dr. Zhivago. The only problem is the Liberal bias in here, which is brutal.Several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because, thanks to the previews, they thought it would be an action-packed adventure story such as "The Mummy." Well, it wasn't and it was way too slow for them.Frankly, I thought the "slow" parts were the best and overall, thought the film had just the right amount of action, instead of overdoing it as the recent Mummy pictures did. Another big plus was the cinematography. This is a beautifully filmed movie, stunning in some parts. Another good point is the language: hardly a swear word.On the negative side, there was the usual political correctness, a la Dances With Wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at Wounded Knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys. The horse race had some credibility problems, too, as "Hidalgo" came back from the dead not once but twice to race like Secretariat! Anyway, if you are looking for a modern-day adventure story with old-fashioned storytelling and no language problems, this film is for you and the rest of the family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just wanted to state that this movie is very enjoyable, no matter how many times I watch it. I am impressed in how the filmmaker portrayed the very sensitive topic of the Wounded Knee Massacre! It was handled tactfully and with sincere empathy! Additionally this film shows an American traveling overseas! He learns of new customs and great differences in cultures. No matter what situation he finds himself in, he is courteous, polite and he accepts that these are the customs of these people! He doesn't try to change the people or push his ways on them, he knows he is a guest in this country and as that, he is downright charming! It is refreshing to see people carry themselves well and with honor, rather than being the "wild Americans" foreign countries have come to expect us to be! Well done Viggo, Joe Johnston and John Fusco!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular movie with exciting adventures and wonderful Oriental outdoors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture talks upon Frank Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) a real cowboy who participated with his horse called ¨Hidalgo¨ in an extraordinary racehorse : ¨ Oceans of fire¨, a 3.000 mile survival race across the risky Arabian desert . He'll take on ominous Arab riders and many dangers . The confrontation will be terrible and he'll face off imposing winds , locust plague , quicksands... though he'll love an Arab princess (Zuleikha Robinson) , Sheik's daughter (Omar Shariff) too . The film is based on historic deeds and famous people , thus : the ¨Wounded Knee slaughter¨ (1890) ; besides , there appears : Buffalo Bill Cody (J.K.Simmons) , Annie Oakley (Elizabeth Berridge) and Indian chiefs: Eagle Horn (Floyd Red Crow Westerman) , Sitting Bull , Crazy Horse and Big Foot . The final duel amongst the horsemen is breathtaking and overwhelming .This moving motion picture blends adventures , action , a love story , emotions and results to be pretty amusing . From the beginning to end the adventure-action is unstoppable , it's fast moving and for that reason packs a lot of entertainment . The final horse scene was filmed in Browning, Montana , 550 different horses were used in that scene , the horses all came from different owners, so to tell them apart, their hooves were branded . Sets and production design are spellbinding and the Oriental landscapes are mesmerizing . Special effects (FX) by Industrial Light and Magic ILM (George Lucas's ownership) are top-notch , as especially the impressive digital storm . The movie was well directed by Joe Johnston , including Shelly Johnson's riveting cinematography and James Newton Howard's fascinating musical score . The film obtained success at box office around the world and United States was number one . The flick will appeal to Oriental adventure enthusiasts and Viggo Mortensen fans . Rating : Very good , well worth watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made adventure yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great action/adventure movie! I was surprised at just how good it was, as it has received so little attention. Viggo Mortensen of Lord of the Rings plays Frank Hopkins, a real-life cowboy, although probably much fictionalized in this movie. He is a half-breed, part Native American and part white. In the film's prologue, he works for the cavalry and witnesses the massacre of his people at Wounded Knee. The event scars him and he becomes a lush. For some easy money, he and his horse, Hidalgo, enter Buffalo Bill's roadshow. Hidalgo is so famous that a sheik has sent a servant to invite him to participate in a race across the Arabian desert, which he accepts, it being a better alternative to the humiliating performances. It's really a classical adventure movie, with princesses and scimitars and sandstorms and swarms of locusts. Omar Sharif co-stars as the sheik. Its nice to see a movie like this made with care. It never gets stupid, and, while it moves quickly, it isn't too fast, either. The director is Joe Johnston, whom I think is an undervalued filmmaker who specializes in these kinds of enjoyable yarns. His previous films include Jurassic Park 3, which is my favorite of that series, Jumanji, The Rocketeer, Honey I Shrunk the Kids, as well as episodes of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, which I loved in my tween years. He also made October Sky, which I haven't seen, but has been recommended. The film also features good performances from Zuleikha Robinson, soon to be a star, I'm sure, Louise Lombard, and Adam Alexi-Malle, one of my favorite character actors (he was the guy who wrote Chubby Rain in the movie Bowfinger). 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good action western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually do not go for westerns, but this one looked rather good on the trailers so I gave it a try. It exceeded expectations and was a good movie to me. I thought it could have cut a few scenes here and there, but all in all it was very entertaining. Though I highly doubt all the things that happened in the movie happened in real life as claimed by the makers of the film, I think the guy this movie is based on was probably a good story teller. This one has a cowboy whose specialty is long distance races going to the Middle East to race there because they do not like the claim that he is the best long distance racer there is. Which is fair enough considering it does not look like there is all that much desert terrain in the United States. This race is very dangerous and it makes you thirsty just to watch it. Of course there are many trials and obstacles along the way including his fellow racers who hate the idea of a Mustang horse competing in the race. Though you know a Mustang has to be a rather fast and strong horse because they named a rather good car after it. All in all a very good action movie that the entire family can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen Hidalgo twice and will go again (and again) and I will buy the DVD. I hope that people will not listen to the critics and will give this movie a chance for success. It doesn't matter if Frank Hopkins did these things or not. If he didn't, he gave us a rousing story. Viggo is perfect in this role as the "cowboy" and rides Hidalgo like the wind. The Arabian desert is frightening and beautiful. The horses are beautiful. Some don't like what seems like stereotypes, however, it takes place in 1890 and Native Americans were killed, then played for sport in "shows". Africans were enslaved and women wore (wear) veils. The movie is right with the times. The music is enjoyable. I'll look for the soundtrack on CD. See it and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the last comment posted: this movie is far more than what Touchstone promoted it as and more layered than what even the good reviews give it credit for. Themes of prejudice, equality, sexism, and human perseverance quietly lay a foundation for the rousing action and adventure that is being advertised.Man and horse in a survival conflict with nature is what hits one on a visceral level, and Viggo Mortensen and his remarkable mount draw you in. King Aragorn is now the Lord of the Reins.Looking forward to the DVD and hoping for good extra features, but this one has to be seen on the big screen to experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exaggerrated Family-Friendly Epic Seeks No Deeper Meaning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just your run of the mill "based on a true story" romanticized Hollywood semi-fiction. Vigo Mortensen makes for a convincingly dedicated cowboy in this fish-out-of-water document of an endurance race across the middle east, but can't quite turn the role into anything more substantial than a simple caricature of wild western perseverance. Instead, far too much effort is wasted on the personification of his horse, the titular mustang Hidalgo, who all but opens his mouth and speaks by the time the film is through. Part exaggerated Disney epic and part family-friendly adventure, it's predictable and inoffensive - good for a few breathtaking landscapes and a thick, obvious underlying moral.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picked up this movie because the trailer's looked good and was not disappointed. Maybe just a little long, but the movie flows well - the lead character is likable and you care what happens to him and Hidalgo. Strange that they don't flesh out the other racers before the start though. We were interested in the story and did a little research - the basic facts appear true (he did indeed take part in this race) although there is a liberal amount of poetic license, of course.Thought Omar Shariff played a very good part and the rest of the cast gave good support.All in all, a good movie to curl up and enjoy with your chosen loved one !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be one of the most inspirational that I have seen in a long time. The filming was exceptional. The riding that Viggo Mortensen did was awesome and the horse that was Hidalgo was quite an actor. I was riveted throughout and it should be considered an epic. This movie shows so much about this particular piece of our past and how we started and what happened to the Native American Indians and to the Mustangs. We don't have enough of this kind of movie now. There are children that don't know about these things. There were many messages in this movie that were courageously and sensitively put forth. Viggo Mortensen was perfect in every way as was the horse. I found all of the actors wonderful, the scenery so different from just a western and the horsemanship outstanding. What a movie.

		<fullReview>One of the best movies so far of 2004 and that I have ever seen is Hidalgo. I loved it so much. The story was great and the acting and everything. Ever since I was 6 years old (now i'm 15) I loved Viggo Mortensen as an actor, poetry writer, etc..... and i still do love him. I think he is incredible at everything he does or at least tries. What I liked about Hidalgo was the bond Frank T. Hopkins had with his horse Hidalgo. I also liked the humor here and there. I think no one else could of played Frank T. Hopkins like Viggo can. This movie is one I will recommend for everyone to see. It is just great. Hidalgo has also given me a love for horses more than I had before. For any one who loves racing or horses this is the movie for you to see.</fullReview>

High points include some lovely scenery; Omar Sharif as a powerful Bedouin sheik; and, to some extent, Viggo Mortensen as Frank Hopkins, the half-Indian long distance rider who brings his Mustang, Hidalgo, to "Arabia" for a 3,000-mile race. Viggo looks great in his 19th-century pants, and definitely looks good on a horse, but struggles with some pretty cheesy dialogue. Low points include that dialogue, plus some very muddy lighting in a lot of scenes. And overall, it's just corny. But if you're a fan of "the Big V," it's probably a must-see.

		<shortDescription>Near-total lack of Authenticity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hidalgo is quite enjoyable and entertaining. To western eyes it probably also looks exotic. But take it from a native of Arabia, in terms of authenticity in production design the movie scores a zero. Nothing, and I mean nothing about the costumes, locations, character names or language is authentic. Hollywood likes to shoot in Morocco when the story takes place in a desert and elements of North African culture stick out like sore thumbs all over the movie. The "look" of Hidalgo is a hotchpotch of African and perceived Arabian cultures. The clothes worn by Arab characters have never existed in Arabian history. They look like costumes left over from a Halloween party. The only authentic clothes are Moroccan. But what are Western Sahara horsemen doing in central Arabia? The two regions are thousands of miles apart and the cultural contrast between them is strong. You see one of the actors serving Arabian coffee in the wrong cups and with the left hand. In Arabia you only serve your guests with the right hand unless you mean to insult them. The names of Arab characters are completely wrong for the location or the period; some are not even people names. The Arab characters speak in classical Arabic, the use of which is correct since there is no surviving record of 19th century Central Arabian dialect. The American actors deserve praise for the effort they put in learning their Arabic lines; but why is the man announcing the start of the race Moroccan in appearance and dialect? To be fair, the producers did put some effort to avoid making this a story about an all-conquering white man in the land of the Brown People. The main character is half-native American, a race that enjoys respect in the Arab world. Unusually for Hollywood, most of the Arab characters are not villains or imbeciles. Mercifully, Arabs are not portrayed by painted white actors but by African Americans (Hispanics are also suitable for portraying Arabs). One element of Hidalgo that was authentic is the Arabs love for horses and their pride in them. I managed through the distracting cultural inaccuracies to enjoy the movie by pretending that the story takes place in a fictitious land populated by fictitious people with a fictitious culture, have fictitious names and wear fictitious clothes. Most people will also enjoy Hidalgo. I would simply like them to keep in mind that almost nothing about the Arabia they see in it is authentic.</fullReview>

A wild but close horse to Hopkins and is said to be the fastest there is in the west. When an Arabian sultan hears of this he feels that the title of "Fastest" needs to be approved and Hopkins is asked to enter the Ocean Of Fire race to prove his horses title.Directed by Joe Johnston (Jurrasic Park 3) and also including a strong cast, He brings the story to life along with really impressive special effects and some beautiful camera shots with the horses Hidalgo is a film worthy to your collection.</fullReview>

The film - though a bit slow at times - was a unique blend of a Western and a 1001 Arabian Nights.(possible spoilers) This was the first time that the events at Wounded Knee were depicted on film (at least, as far as I know). Other films have mentioned the events, but nothing more. Custer made his last stand at Little Bighorn in 1876 ... the Indians made their last stand at Wounded Knee in 1890. If DANCES WITH WOLVES would ever have a sequel, I would imagine it would pick up where the first film left off and end at Wounded Knee.For the film HIDALGO, the old West was only looked upon briefly. Most of the film was spent in Arabia. It is very interesting how the film's release is timed - while the US is still in Iraq. The film shows that the Middle East had feelings of ill-will toward America in the 1890's as much as they did in the 1990's.Viggo Mortensen made for a very convincing cowboy. It is good to see that he is finally receiving top billings in movies, something that is perhaps overdue. We saw him briefly in WITNESS, but I do not remember seeing him again until CRIMSON TIDE which was 10 years later. His performance in that film made me believe he was finally receiving recognition.The film has powerful overtones along with a basic plot. Overall, it made for a great adventure film that I plan to watch again. Its ending was certainly bittersweet - if you love something, set it free...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie.A few years ago I saw a documentary on F.T.Hopkins. Viggo is a favorite.It was good to see Omar Shariff.My sister's three kids are going to love the story of this.I do recommend it to any-one who likes westerns,horse riding and just general good fun.I liked the sand dunes.The different horses,land scape veiws.It shows what I thought to be more side of the Native American Indian.Beautiful colours in the horses.I think Viggos love and admiration for the horse shows in this film.It also shows an older part of amercia. I felt you can learn something from the film.There is a very good shot of the statue of liberty when he leaves his country for the race.Laurel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great family movie one that will for sure join my collection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an admirer of wild horses and a female who happens to love westerns it was great to have a movie with those qualities.Not having to worry about the language or subject matter was awesome just hearing some of the children in the theater comment on things happening on the screen was incredible they were actually watching the movie not up running around. They made a joyous noise. A real family movie so make it a family date, don't forget the popcorn.This movie prompted me to learn more about history not just of the west but of the wild horses especially HIDALGO and the meaning behind it. It is a great search but I'll leave that up to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old fashioned adventure film is rousing fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story is very reminiscent of the adventure films that were made in the 1930's and with everything that occurs in this film it would have made a terrific Saturday afternoon serial. Story is set in the late 1800's where we see Frank Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) who is half American Indian but doesn't like to mention it to anyone due to the racism that was occurring during the times. His horse (and best friend) is Hidalgo and they enter the famous Ocean of Fire race in Arabia which the prize is $10,000 but once they arrive all the Arabs tell him he has no chance of winning considering the lineage of their horses.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The race covers 3,000 miles and many die during it's course and in charge of it is Sheikh Riyadh (Omar Sharif) who has a rambunctious daughter named Jazira (Zuleikha Robinson) who wants Frank to win because an impending marriage to someone she doesn't love hangs in the balance. During the race Frank has time to save Jazira from her father's rival and also turn down bribes from Lady Anne Davenport (Louise Lombard) who wants him to lose.This is directed by Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer, Jumanji, Jurassic Park III) who shows once again that he's more than able to make fun adventure flicks and simply put this is a fun film to watch. It is a bit long and your never convinced that Frank and Hidalgo would be able to finish a 3000 mile race in the blazing Arabian desert sun but this is not the type of film to necessarily nit-pick about specifics with. Mortensen is well cast as the stoic cowboy and in fact he's so stoic that in many scenes it's Hidalgo who flashes more facial expressions! One of the interesting things about the script occur when different characters look down at Hidalgo because he's a mixed breed which parallels Frank who is half American Indian and takes the insults aimed at his horse personally. This film has so many scenes of action and acts of heroism that it leaves no room for any type of love story to develop and twice (yep, twice!) Mortensen walks away from a pretty woman who stand there awaiting a kiss from him. The story here follows the same formula as the adventure flicks of yesteryear and while it's definitely not in the league of something like "Gunga Din" it does capture the spirit of a film such as that which in essence is all that it wanted to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historically completely incorrect - Film is for horse lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The historical event Hopkins witnesses at the beginning of the film, happened in December 1890. The movie is set in that year but tells the viewer Frank Hopkins had already witnessed the event WAY prior to this. Historically this is completely untrue, as is Hopkins resulting behavior. Also, Hidalgo was in fact one of three mustangs Hopkins took to Arabia. There is more, but view the movie first, then research the actual amazing facts. Personally i LOVED the movie as i am a long time horse rider and have a deep love for horses of all breeds. I'm disappointed that Hollywood has lied and distorted Hopkins life so much (so whats new), but i now know all about this great horseman and his brilliant mustang Hidalgo. Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Counterfeit Cowboy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is based on a real man but not a true story - it is an outright lie. First out, the race of Ocean of Fire is nonexistent. Second the real man is a native of New Jersey and works for digging tunnels for a subway in Pennsylvania. Thirdly, he never worked for Buffalo Bill Show, the closest he came to this was as a horse hand for the Ringling Brother's Circus. Fourthly he had two wives. Making such an adventure a seemingly impossible task since he was married since his childhood. First was a Canadian wife who lives in New Jersey and had several children. The second wife was Gertrude Hopkins, who tried desperately to keep secret of his first married and to promote him as a hero was suspicious when an editor demanded proof that the legend was true, which of course she could not prove. Keeping his family a secret is important so no newspaper writers could verify his story from family members. Oh, yes there is a surviving Hopkins siblings, but they too remain suspiciously silent about this film. Fifth, he had nothing to do with Wounded Knee, or even buying a land to protect the Indians. Sixth, the Indian Chief mentioned in the movie never existed.Finally and most important: Iraq didn't exist in 1890. It became an independent country in the 1930s. Also newspaper interviews in Philadelphia Public Ledger in 1926 of Frank Hopkins which was made before Iraq existed made no single mention of the great Arab horse race. So my guess is Hidalgo was made up after Iraq became an independent country. If that is not enough, years ago, Hidalgo story has been proved to be a hoax.I avoided watching Hidalgo movie when it first entered the movie theaters because the feel of "Yankee conquering the East" sounds suspiciously like the Yankee in King Arthur's Day. When I finally had a chance to rent the movie, the mention of Iraq was very suspicious. Also the promotion of any particular horse sounds very suspicious, in this case a single breed that Mustang is good for long distance race is not true, in fact other breeds can also cross the country, such as the Pinto. All mentions of "hundreds of race" which Frank Hopkins mentioned made me very suspicious. If you watched Seabiscuits you will realize winning "hundreds of race" is nearly impossible. In fact, if Frank Hopkins can do this he could easily beat Seabiscuits and become a millionaire. The truth of Seabiscuit not mentioned in the movie is that the horse was and truly is a real looser. And the reason, which the movie was correct is the bonding between the rider and the horse. So in fact, there was in fact little bonding between Frank and Hidalgo, another red flag when I watched the movie Hidalgo. Other suspicions about the movie includes an awfully liberal Sheik after discovering Frank Hopkins together with his daughter. For those who know how strict Arabs are on this matter, you probably know this "act of benevolence" just doesn't exist, especially in the 1890s. If I suspend the idea of "based on true story" I still find it hard to convince myself where all these "prize money" comes from and why do Arabs bothered to get an American to race and let the American keep all the "prize money" when the Arabs are the partner in sponsoring such an event.I will not have any spoilers here and will let you decide who won the race. I give the movie good marks for cinematography, 9/10. A story, even if I think it is true, I just simply did not buy it, I give it 3/10 because it was not convincing enough even if it is A LIE. When I do watch a movie, the story always come first, so I will never complain of any bad fx or cinematography, I do complain about the cardboard actor and the story, therefore I give the movie 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Old-fashioned, Somewhat Predictable, but Thoroughly Entertaining Horse Opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As westerns go, "Jumanji" director Joe Johnston's new movie "Hidalgo" (***out of ****) qualifies as an old-fashioned, somewhat predictable, but thoroughly entertaining horse opera about the 'Ocean of Fire' endurance race over 3000 miles of Arabian desert from Aden to Damascus in the 1890s. Actually, "Hidalgo" meets the criteria of a western hybrid. Usually, Hollywood reins in its oaters on the far side of the Mississippi. However, this offbeat, picturesque dust-raiser with "Rings" trilogy hero Viggo Mortensen and "Lawrence of Arabia's" Omar Sharif doesn't flog sentiment to death like the usual Disney animal epic. Furthermore, the hell-bent-for-leather competition occurs well off the range in another corner of the world. No, "Hidalgo" isn't the first western to blaze a trail overseas. Cowhand Glenn Ford traveled to Brazil to deliver Brahma bulls in William Castle's "The Americano" (1955), while drunken outlaw Lee Van Cleef pursued kung fu master Lieh Lo to China in a search for hidden treasure in Anthony M. Dawson's "The Stranger and the Gunfighter" (1976). More recently, David Dobkin's "Shanghai Knights" sent Jackie Chan &amp; Owen Wilson to London to recover the Great Seal of China. More often, Europeans and Asians do the emigrating. In Edward Dmytryk's "Shalako" (1968) a buckskin-clad Sean Connery buckled on a six-shooter as a cavalry scout and escorted aristocratic Bridget Bardot on safari through hostile Indian territory, while Terence Young's "Red Sun" (1974) teamed up samurai warrior Toshiro Mifune with roguish bandit Charles Bronson to retrieve a stolen ceremonial sword.Like the aforementioned frontier classics, "Hidalgo" breaks new ground both with its protagonist and setting. Scenarist John Fusco, whose credits include the Billy the Kid bio "Young Guns" (1988) and the animated nag "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" (2002) has appropriated the real-life figure of Pony Express courier Frank T. Hopkins with his trusty mustang Hidalgo and sets this exciting saga in the distant deserts of the Middle East. Johnston &amp; Fusco take their time and sketch in an interesting backstory for Hopkins before the action breaks into a gallop in Saudi Arabia. Not only does "Hidalgo" take advantage of a fistful of western clichés, but also it depicts the culture clash that occurs when an outsider enters an alien society. Literally, our hero finds himself a fish-out-of-water in the Middle East without a clue about Muslim culture. "Hidalgo" stereotypes both Americans as well as Arabs. Indeed, the most despicable character in "Hidalgo" is a Muslim, but the film presents positive images of Muslims, too. Nevertheless, the filmmakers cast a shadow over Arab culture, particularly its intolerance toward women and its rigidly segregated society, with enslaved Africans languishing in chains. Eventually, Hopkins frees one, a small boy, and enlists him as his water-bearer. "Hidalgo" opens with an unsuspecting Hopkins riding into Wounded Knee, South Dakota, with an order for the 7th Cavalry to disarm the Indians. An overzealous trooper tries to take a rifle away from a deaf brave. The struggling Indian accidentally fires a shot that triggers the infamous December 28th massacre in 1890. Like the disillusioned Tom Cruise hero in "The Last Samurai," our guilt-ridden protagonist holds himself to blame for the senseless slaughter. When he isn't drowning himself in alcohol, he performs stunts in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Buffalo Bill (J.K. Simmons of "Spider-Man") advertises Hopkins as the best horseman in the world. Sheik Riyadh (Omar Sharif) challenges Hopkins to compete in his "Ocean of Fire" endurance horse race. Not only is Hopkins the only American in the race, he rides the only mustang. Everybody else, including the treacherous Lady Davenport (Louise Lombard of "Tale of the Mummy"), races pureblooded Arabian steeds. Nobody believes Hopkins has a snowball's chance in the Sahara to win. When Hopkins doesn't fall for Lady Davenport's charms, she bribes Riyadh's evil nephew Katib to kill Hidalgo, Hopkins' beloved horse, and set the half-Sioux, half-white wrangler afoot. Had director Joe Johnston devoted the entire movie to the race, "Hidalgo" would only have been half as interesting. The villainous Katib (Silas Carson of "Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones") raids the sheik's camp and kidnaps his headstrong daughter Jazira (Zuleikha Robinson of "Timecode") along with Riyadh's own stellar stallion. Johnston takes time out from the race to stage a bullet-blazing shoot out as Hopkins rescues Jazira from the bad guys "Indiana Jones" style. The last hour of this marathon 136-minute epic generates white-knuckled suspense as Hopkins nurses his wounded horse back onto the trail and rides like the wind toward the finish with his opponents nose-to-nose with Hidalgo.John Fusco's adventurous screenplay, based loosely on mythic Hopkins' life, follows the ideology of the John Ford western "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance." When the legend becomes fact, print the legend! "Hidalgo" inflates the legend instead of the fact. Most historians classify Hopkins memoirs as tall tales. Pretty much straightforward in its linear narrative development, the story concentrates on Hopkins with interludes with the Sheik's daughter who behaves a lot like "Mulan." In his first starring role, virile Viggo Mortensen delivers a quiet but sincere performance. Mortensen evokes memories of iconic cowboy Gary Cooper. Viggo appears at ease whether he's straddling his painted pony, twirling his rope, or fanning his single-action Colt's revolver, like Robert Redford in the best-known western hybrid "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969). "Doctor Zhivago" Golden Globe winner Omar Sharif enlivens the proceedings with his colorful but crafty Sheik of Sheiks. Sharif and Mortensen have several good scenes together as their relationship gradually goes from adversial to amicable. Meanwhile, Silas Carson excels as Katib. You'll want to cheer when he gets his comeuppance. "A Clockwork Orange" star Malcolm McDowell makes a brief appearance as Lady Davenport's bewhiskered hubby. Veteran lenser Shelly Johnson of "Jurassic Park 3" captures the scenic grandeur of the sprawling Moroccan locales, which convincingly substitute for Arabia, and gives the action a sense of spectacle with his widescreen photography. Happily, "Hidalgo" is short on giddy-yap and long on giddy-up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than action - a message!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading one of the commentaries about this movie urged me to write one of my own. It does seem to me, today, that a movie needs to be ridiculously full of stunts and action sequences (and blood, violence etc) to be considered worth while by the rank and file who are watching. How sad is that? I guess I am in the minority, but I want more to a movie than special effects.I had wanted to see this movie from the start, but was never able to get to the theater, so I got it the minute it came out on DVD. I know it was supposed to be a "True Story" but as is I would doubt it - too Hollywood. But hey, the long and short of it is . . . Viggo. Horses. I am so there. Who cares if it did not really happen this way?Anyway, now that I have seen it, I can't say I was disappointed at all. I was raised in a scouting family that was very involved in "Indian Lore" and the chants brought back memories. I think Native American history is complex and interesting, and we can still learn from the mistakes made on both sides. And Native Lore is ingrained in the message this movie had to tell. EVERY movie lately seems to be overcoming obstacles and winning even when you had no chance . . . you can't sit through a day of the Disney Channel without getting that drummed into you! But this was different. Frank T Hopkins was what was then called a "half breed", but he passed as white, and not wanting to deal with his race, he hid it (except for speaking the language, which I assumed many white men who were close to the land could do). Although he tried to deny it, his bloodlines brought him back to it time and again. Although being in the race had nothing to do with being a "half breed" on the surface, it was all about it in the end. Hidalgo was an "Indian pony" - a breed that was facing extinction. The horse was constantly being put down by both the whites and the Arabs. While defending the horse constantly, Hopkins yet shunned his own heritage and culture, and only when he accepted it did he win the race. And yet he should have known it all along, since the horse, the symbol of that heritage, was his most prized friend. I got my back up a little when I read that someone thought the movie was was "moralistic" until they finally got to the action. Gee, aren't movies supposed to be moralistic? Should we not learn from our entertainment, or is it just mindless slaughter and CGI? It was like, yeah yeah, forget the plot, let's see some action.Action is fine, but I liked all the little coincidences, symbolisms and tie-ins to other characters. The tie-in to Jazia (the sheik's daughter) wearing a veil over her head was perfect. They were both less in the eyes of white men, but in reality they were fine for what they were. They just had to accept it. The symbol of the natives, a necklace given to him by a chief friend, became his symbol as well, when his servant mistakenly used it for their flag. In the end it was no mistake at all. Yes, it was the typical Disney underdog wins, but there was something extra to it. At least to me, and I am not sorry to say I still watch movies for the message, not the phony thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the "Based on A True Story"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can get away from the "claim" to be based on a true story, you will probably enjoy this film. I found myself, however, unable to get away from that claim, and it ruined the film for me. I just kept sitting there saying to myself, "Now, that was about as unreal as it could get." I mean, the horse is down, blood comming from its nose, and the next minute up he gets, and not only runs to the finish line, but passes 2 other horses on the way, get real. I have no doubt that something like the race could have happened in which Hidalgo ran, but that is where the reality ends.Ignore the claim, and you can enjoy a good story, find yourself thinking this actually happened, and you might not like it too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long, too boring, too full of horses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see this movie, I wasn't expecting a Hollywood blockbuster, or something that would blow me away, just a feel-good western. Unfortunately I got neither. This movie was boring, repetitive and lacked a certain element of suspence that normal westerns have.The story is basically the life of Frank T.Hopkins and his horse Hildago. They enter a race across a big desert to raise enough money to free some indians horses. The rest of the story is him racing around in the sand infested place coming up against obstacles, overcoming them saving a beautiful girl, and, well what place do you think he came?Plus we get the added bonus of hearing Viggo Mortensen sing yet another mumbly song (very much like his last ballard in l.o.t.r), but do confess he did look + talk a lot like a cowboy, yet the affection he showed for Hildago sometimes was a little too close for comfort.In all fairness its a matter of taste. If you love horses and sand then this film is for you. But in truth, you would probably get more fun at riding the donkeys at Blackpool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the worst movie you will ever see and parts of it were actually very well done but it could have been so much better. The acting is average at best but the story had so much potential. The repeated theme of Americans are killers of unarmed woman and children, always drunk and greedy to the bone really gets tiring. This is suppose to be a "True Story" but I find it hard to believe that when the horse got horribly speared American Indian spirits appeared and instantly healed its leg. That's the kind of garbage that ruins so many good movies, this one included. Take out this scene and the first ten minutes and you'd have a much better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason i saw such a movie was because i got the DVD from one of my friends. Its quite clear i had medium expectations from this film. However this movie exceeded my expectations on some departments and let them down in others.The major problem was the length because even though you don't really get bored you realise after the film that not really much happened in this film in so much time.A nagging problem was the casting of vigo mortesen as lead, he is a great actor and fits the role perfectly IF you ignore the fact that he is half red Indian.Also as he is a person who is so confused as to his roots,we could have definitely had more character building in such a long film.The locations and sets are breath taking and even though we have a whole lot of stereotypes it is carried of with panache.Other than that this movie has feel good and rustic factor about it, and the only thing i could have asked for more is a shorter film.Good movie worth watching once more of a 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rip Roaring amazing adventure!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although never much a fan of Viggo Mortenson it occurred to me while watching Hidalgo what a great action star he could make. In fact his character Frank Hopkins at times reminded me of Indiana Jones and having always said that no person could replace Harrison Ford that's quite an honor in my book. I am always a fan of Disney films, they do a great job and this is no exception. They create an epic film set in the old west, and the Arabian desert with non stop action and an emotional ride of a man and his horse.Hidalgo is based on the true story of Frank T. Hopkins. A former pony express rider and long distance horse race champion, whose mother was a Sioux Indian. While delivering a letter to the calvary at Wounded Knee he witness a horrific slaughter of a Sioux tribe and it devastates and haunts him. Much time later finds Hopkins and his beloved horse Hidalgo working in a circus type rodeo for Buffalo Bill traveling the countryside. When an eastern entourage arrives at the rodeo on behalf of a very rich middle eastern Prince they give an ultimatum to Buffalo Bill. He must stop announcing Hopkins and his horse as the best racers in the world or enter Hopkins into a 3000 mile sand race across the Arabian desert against the Prince's horse who has won the race before and therefore considers himself the best. Hopkins finally agrees not sure if Hidalgo has another race left in him. Nonetheless with help of his fellow rodeo mates he pays the entrance fee and heads across the Ocean. The race ahead of them has taken the lives of many men and the Middle Eastern thoroughbred riders take offense to the American's presence in the race. They do everything in their power to stop him from winning but against all odds Hopkins will find in himself and in his beloved horse the power to persevere against it all.Uplifting yet gritty and full of action. It's a western but set in the middle East in the deadly deserts that you can just feel the heat against them. It's not just a race but man vs man as well. The film is rich with middle Eastern culture and religion and I notice that there are many geographical and analytical errors in the film and I haven't myself looked into them although I think some of them can be explained away but nonetheless for me it takes nothing away from the film because it's not about the history as much as it is about the adventure. This is a grand adventure beautifully written and although the characters are fairly shallow, we never get to know much about them, again it's about the adventure. We feel a connection to Hopkins and we learn a little about him, enough to progress through the film. The amazing part is what we see in his horse. Watching the horses movements and his beautiful big eyes he really does play such an integral part to the film. It might seem like it's more about the people but ultimately it's about this horse that inspires and fights for his "brother" (Hopkins.) Watch the horse throughout the film and you'll be moved. The cast is perfect in their roles but as I said none of them have to do much acting. Mortenson does a great job as the rough and rugged cowboy. Kids and adults alike will love this action adventure and everyone should check it out...it's a beautiful fun family film although has a few disturbing scenes some young kids might not like. Joe Johnston made an amazing movie 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is quite possible that I missed something when I saw 'Hidalgo'. It didn't 'do it' for me, and I felt slighted out of $10.25 after leaving the theater. Let me explain...First off, the character development was poor at best. The reason why I say this is because if I really enjoyed the movie... if I really, really enjoyed it, I would actually give a crap about the characters. In order for me to care about characters, I need a little bit more background; an attachment if you will. In the beginning, I thought we would receive that - the slaying at the camp, etc. However, that was quickly brushed by, and left me with the 'yeah, this guy is part Indian.. who cares?!' feeling. One of the indians gives the main character a necklace. Did we find the true meaning of the necklace? No. Did it warrant a cheesy flag at the base camp? No, etc. Same deal with the rest of the characters; they were all superficial. With this 'lack of attachment', I was left to deal with the acting (Hidalgo was the best 'actor'), cinematography (definitely good), and the action (definitely there, but too spaced out - not enough to fill 2 hrs 20 mins). Little things, like the slave trading... yes, we know there were slaves in that time period.. either focus on it, or don't. We are left with a slave child (that the lead character bought, but they skipped the 'purchase' scene of the child, BUT they showed an adult slave on the auction block, etc etc blah blah figure it out). Interestingly enough, the child ended up with a dental plan by the end of the race (notice the difference..)Point: If more time was spent developing the characters, it is quite possible that I would have cared enough to recommend this movie. Instead, we received the highly predictable, cliche, 'mildly entertaining' (as in, 'nothing else to do that evening') sort of movie.Netflix at BEST, but ONLY if you have a good home theater to appreciate the cinematography...which I don't.. hence the $10.25 loss..6 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few exciting sequences amid a fairly dull film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: ** out of ****An old-fashioned adventure in the truest sense, Hidalgo will probably please the older crowds with its back-to-basics style of film-making and storytelling. In fact, CGI is kept mostly to a minimum, used only when absolutely necessary, and despite the many clichés and glorified heroics of the film's protagonist, there is a general level of believability in this picture that's lacking from most of today's offerings. That, however, is also partially responsible for the film's downfall.Hidalgo is based on the supposed true story of Frank Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen), a courier who carried the orders that led to the massacre of Wounded Knee, the same people who were part of his ancestral Native American family on his mother's side. Hopkins turns to drinking to drown his sorrows, but still sticking alongside his faithful mustang, Hidalgo. But Hopkins receives a second chance when he's challenged to a 3000 mile race in the middle east, where the grand prize is $100,000 to the winner. Hopkins accepts, but is unprepared for the brutal elements, the weather, the harsh geographical conditions, and the treachery of his fellow competitors.Hidalgo represents Viggo Mortensen's first leading role in a big-budget Hollywood production (true, he could be argued as the main character of the Lord of the Rings series, but that was more of an ensemble), which is probably one of the main reasons I looked forward to the film. As expected, Mortensen delivers a decent performance, nothing particularly outstanding and certainly not near the level of his work as Aragorn in Lord of the Rings, but a suitable turn that shows he has the chops to be a leading man (word of advice, though, he should probably speak up a bit, much of his dialogue is uttered in mumbles).But even though Mortensen makes a fairly dashing hero, virtually every other performance is bland or unmemorable, save for maybe the title horse himself, who is actually fairly endearing. Omar Sharif returns to the sort of role that he could play in his sleep, Zuleikha Robinson is probably the homeliest and mopiest princess I've seen in a non-comedy, and the lovely Louise Lombard has the unenviable task of playing the uptight, wealthy British lady with a devious agenda. She's actually the film's most interesting character, but I don't think the filmmakers were smart enough to realize that. Thick accents from the majority of the cast also do little to clear up much of the movie's expository dialogue.The film moves at an often very slow pace, probably no surprise for a story that details a 3000 mile race in the desert, but what's most surprising is the utter lack of oomph and energy to the proceedings. Popular word out there is that Frank Hopkins is a fraud, a fact I probably couldn't care less about. The actual story being told, regardless of whether or not it resembles historical fact, holds promise, but the film just doesn't do anything creative or particularly novel with it. This ultimately results in little more than Hopkins and his horse trudging along the desert sands for over an hour of the film's running time, and this gets boring quickly.To be fair, there are a few decent to solid action sequences, particularly the rescue that leads to an exciting swordfight/shootout and a later climactic encounter with a treacherous prince and his henchmen in the desert, but the action also boasts its share of clunkers as well, namely the poorly choreographed raid in which the Sheikh's daughter is kidnapped. In this day and age when swordfights in even PG-13 flicks can be delivered with pulsing energy and vibrancy (as seen in Return of the King and Master and Commander), some of the sword clashes in Hidalgo are somewhat disappointing and awkwardly staged.The film tries its best to come up with a number of crises that our hero has to resolve (sandstorm, locusts, etc.) with quick thinking and riding and occasionally fancy shooting, but all of it's completely predictable and simply not convoluted enough to engross. Also not helping matters is James Netwon Howard's lackluster score, which actually drains the energy from the action. This is surprising, given Howard's recent track record. That the film isn't all that exciting is no surprise, director Joe Johnston has yet to put together a solid action film, and after this mediocre attempt, I'm not sure he should be given any further opportunities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A 3,000 mile race across the Arabian desert between the fastest and finest horses is the story line of this beautiful picture. The hero is a spotted mustang owned and ridden by Frank T. Hopkins, as portrayed by Viggo Mortensen. The film's beginning dwells on the massacre at Wounded Knee, which Mortensen witnesses, and his Indian ancestry is never far from his thoughts. Indeed, Mortensen appeals to the red spirits to sustain him and his horse as the race heads down the home stretch. The film compares the red nomads of the American plains to the Arab raiders of the Middle East deserts, citing the excellent horsemanship of both races. Mortensen and his steed face dangers during their adventures in the desert, not the least of which are traps and ambushes from Arabs determined not to allow the American cowboy to win the race. A highlight of the film is a kidnapping and rescue mission at the midway point. Omar Sharif has a good role as a sheik who befriends Mortensen. The supporting cast also good, and James Newton Howard contributes an excellent music score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining adventure through the Arabian desert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hidalgo" certainly is no Oscar winner, but this shouldn't deter anyone with a love for adventure films to watch it. Set in the late 1800s, the movie tells the story of a man and his horse, and their perilous participation in a long-distance horse-race through the Arabian desert.It would appear as though the director (and/or screenwriter) was unable to decide if this would be a comedy as well as an action/adventure/drama, and I must admit I found the many the comic moments uncalled for, but it's certainly no comedy.The acting is, I am afraid to say, quite poor from mostly everyone involved, save perhaps the performance from veteran Omar Sharif. In fact, it is the acting that is the biggest problem this film is faced with.From all other aspects, I found this to be a highly entertaining movie, which, despite its quite long runtime manages to keep the audience on the edge of their seats, and may indeed even provoke a philosophical inner debate or two before the end.I'd write more, but I'll let you judge the rest for yourselves! Unless you're very pressed for time or have a very low attention span, I highly recommend this beautiful adventure film, to be taken with a grain of salt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Arabian Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An old fashioned epic Western, "Hidalgo" tells the story of real life American half-breed Frank Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) who, in the film, participates in a cross-country endurance horse race across the expansive Arabian desert. The star of the film really is Hopkins' horse, a mustang named "Hidalgo"; hence, the film's title. Although the film starts out in America where in 1890 Hopkins witnesses the infamous Massacre at Wouonded Knee, most of the film's story takes place in Arabia.Technically, the film is well made, with impressive production design and credible, elaborate costumes. The best element is the outdoor color cinematography. It captures the sweeping desert vistas, those lonesome dunes, and a blazing orange sun. Riding Hidalgo, Hopkins' trek across the vast landscape is the highlight of the film.The problem I had here is the film's epic scale. Typical cinematic epics, those from the 1950s and 1960s, are melodramatic and pretentious with their "casts of thousands", their contrived conflict, their smarmy soap opera dialogue, and their absence of subtlety. "Hidalgo" is no exception. I might as well have been watching some sword and sandal movie from the 1950s. After a few minutes, the pomp and spectacle from such a huge cast gets tedious and tiresome.Further, most of the background music in "Hidalgo" is manipulative and irritatingly nondescript. Overall acting quality is average. Mortensen's performance seemed a tad too casual and nonchalant.For viewers who enjoy epic Westerns, "Hidalgo" is probably a good choice. It's a big budget film extravaganza, a sprawling tribute to the epics of past generations. And its theme of the underdog is one that will resonate well with viewers who enjoy traditional, old fashioned, stories. But, if you're looking for a more low-key story, one that is more realistic, or with a more obscure or complex theme, you will need to look elsewhere.</fullReview>

The movie tells about a cowboy with his Mustang horse that could tame the cruel desert in Arabian to gain victory in a horse rally competition in Arab. I like this movie but somehow it's really a little boring to watch it. It's too easy to predict the end. Somehow this movie trying to convince Muslim's ideology that their thinking about the world is so crowded and inflexible. I don't know what to say when I see the movie which shown a character such a Sikh who in Islam is a holy and wisdom figure is shown as clown to me (the example is he likes to gambling, arrogant to Christian and very stiff). Very clear to see that this movie is want to say that western civilization is much better than Islamic way. What a pity to me to know that fact. But, If I forget the fact i really feel this movie is enjoyable. So-so movie... I give the rating : 6,5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe Johnston doesn't make 'great' movies but he certainly knows how to make a movie entertaining. "Hidalgo" is yet another entertaining Joe Johnston movies with a nice looking visual style and some well shot sequences. Still the story is lacking and prevents this movie from being a must-see.The real problem with "Hidalgo" is, is that the main story-line is about the 3,000 mile race across the Arabian desert but the movie has many side-plots and events in the movie that has very little to do with the main storyline. It's a times distracting and it makes the movie feel inconsistent at times. At times the movie truly feels like some loose sequences put together to make one movie out of. Not the most consistent movie out there, that's for sure.But who complains really. "Hidalgo" is a good and fun movie to watch that is a pleasure to watch. The visual style is good and works fine for the Arabic backdrop of the story. The action sequences are surprisingly good and also the visual effects do not disappoint. There truly are some spectacular moments in this movie!Viggo Mortensen probably wasn't the best choice for Frank Hopkins. Believe it or not, he just wasn't always believable enough as a tough Cobwoy. Still he is a good actor and certainly gives the movie some more prestige. The same goes for the presence of Omar Sharif, who also gets to do some fighting again. The characters are all very stereotypical, something that is a must for a movie like "Hidalgo", that tries to bring some mindless but good entertainment.Certainly a watchable movie that is better than I heard it was. I can recommend this movie to everyone.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

So we are not talking Dolby Stereo, but I did have a good view after the kids and the frequent toilet users got out of the way.The movie was entertainment personified. Whilst the cast probably played more to the females in the audience - Mortensen for my age group and Omar Sharif for my Mum - the real driver in this movie was the horses. Frankly they were the star of the show. As someone who is just coming to terms with liking horses after about 30 odd years of being afraid of them, this was a one way ticket to Pony Heaven.The sequences of the race, the wild horses and particularly the closing moments of the race had me in tears (which blew my chances with the cute girl I was sitting next to) and I wanted to get up and shout that horses ROCK!The last moments of the film and the release of the wild horses would have seen me ripping up my seat and running up and down the aisle but the way was blocked by serial toilet goers.Go see the movie, enjoy it, don't think about it.

		<fullReview>Hidalgo. A horse with spirit, pride, and eyes that communicate scriptlines as coherent as any spoken. Viggo Mortensen is a charismatic and very persuasive actor and talented man. Omar Sharif, "Let in the light"... the scene at Wounded Knee is thought provoking. Hidalgo is one I would recommend highly. I do not see how a mustang from America could have any chance though in such a race. It would be unaccustomed to the new climate, and could possibly get sick and die just from the change of environment. It would be racing against horses who have been on these sands all their lives... it would be at a great disadvantage. Remember the movie Lucas? Where at the end he finally gets to play football and nearly gets killed? Reminds me of those kind of odds.This movie has many subtleties that go unspoken that are the signature of a great film. I'd like to point one out.1. The amount of the purse is unspoken until halfway thru, which leaves the mind open to experience beyond the material aspect.I love the goat herder whose punishment for stealing milk is to work for the American. We see objectively thru the eyes of Frank the positives and negatives that arise from different cultures, including our own.. and this honest experience, gives the film great character.Overall a very enjoyable film.

		<shortDescription>It is a beautiful film, maybe not a 'must-see' but a definite 'worth-seeing'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having played 'Aragorn' in 'The Lord of the Rings' Viggo Mortensen chose again a role that has quite some similarities: an exceptional personality, manly but kind, and a strong will ? and yet not quite knowing his place in the world. Of course he replaced his sword with a colt an his long hair with a cowboy hat but he once more plays his role with a force that just draws you in. Viggo Mortensen, who performed almost all of his stunts himself, is absolutely believable as lost and broken cowboy with Indian heritage and brilliantly harmonizes with his co?star T. J. (Hidalgo) whose very own personality miraculously comes through in every single of his close?ups. And you feel solidarity with them all along. You feel with Hopkins sitting on his horse utterly exhausted and on the verge of falling down, you feel sorry for Hidalgo breaking down in the burning heat, you feel sympathy, you feel ? guilty reaching to your cup of ice-cold coke. But you also feel confidence that in the end their strong will and endurance will succeed over prestigious bloodlines, heritage, and even Providence.With breathtaking shots of the landscape (the movie was predominantly shot in Morocco), endless desert, dunes, and sunsets director Joe Johnston created a fantastical and authentic fairytale alike that beautifully breaks with the usual stereotypical adventure story 'almost immortal and flawless hero wins, kills the evil, rescues the good, gets the girl, kiss, the end'.I would absolutely recommend this movie to everybody who likes action-filled yet subtle entertainment. It is a beautiful film, maybe not a 'must-see' but a definite 'worth-seeing'. And as a final statement, just for the record: you do NOT need to be a Viggo Mortensen fan to enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were some aspects of this movie I really enjoyed. The cinematography was excellent, ranging from the clanking steam train couplngs to shimmering desert panoramas, to the moving and simple effects at Wounded Knee. Viggo Mortensen did a good job as the lead Frank Hopkins, bringing his characteristic sincerity to his role. It was nice to see Omar Sharif and his front teeth again. The horse, Hidalgo, almost outdid Viggo. And here we find one of the great catches of the movie. The man-and-animal-sidekick relationship which works really well here.Sadly, I found the script quite wanting. The lines attributed to the Arabs and Bedouins were banal and one-dimensional. Their characters (and the Brits) were stereotyped. I felt that the scriptwriters did well in the US, but foundered in some of their own quicksand in the Middle East. I also found myself scratching my head at historical timings. Was Iraq called Iraq back then? When _was_ then?If you are prepared to ignore the "based on a real..." horse dung, you will enjoy this rollicking adventure, cast much in the same genre as the ripsnorting and politically incorrect cowboy and indian movies of the 50's . To modernise, we move it to 1900's middle east and turn the Indians into Arabs. But what more to expect from Hollywood?Viggo and his horse make a great pair and between them and the cameras, make this film worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a movie proclaims it is "based on a true story", this sets a Pavlovian response in many people to get them to believe that what they are about to see is what really happened. I see it as the marketing ploy it is. Sure I believe there was a Frank Hopkins and that he was renowned for long-distance horse racing. But that doesn't mean he ran in a 1000-mile race over in Arabia for lucre.Oh, I liked this movie. It got me to thinking about how my tolerance level for accuracy varies from movie to movie. For "Hidalgo", what annoyed me was Viggo Mortensen's blue eyes in the head of Frank Hopkins, supposedly the son of an Indian chief's daughter. Whenever I was taught about dominant/recessive genes, the example always used was that brown eyes are dominant over blue eyes. Frank Hopkins couldn't have had blue eyes.On the other hand, I didn't care if the scenes in Arabia were mainly figment's of the writer's imagination. For all I know, Arabia may have been much more brutish in the 1890's than was depicted in the film as it was still under the thumb of a decaying Ottoman Empire. The film depicts a race in Arabia so we have to see many Arab characters. One scene showed Omar Sharif as Sheik Riyadh reading a dime novel about the Wild West. That's what the moviemakers have made here as well.The once scene this American would demand complete accuracy for is the massacre at Wounded Knee. What they showed there better have actually happened.Despite Mr. Mortensen's blue eyes, he is believable as a laconic cowboy. Zuleikha Robinson as the sheik's daughter is beautiful and Omar is fun. And let's not forget the horse. It gets plenty of screen time and close ups to earn its title billing.Good adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-reliant American befriends the Arabs on their own terms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read a few tepid reviews of this film I hoped seeing it wouldn't be a disappointment. Instead, I found it quietly enthralling, leaving me wondering just who writes reviews and whether they can appreciate or understand anything but boobs, bombs, and special effects.Leaving aside the issue of whether the plot is factually based, which is irrelevant to the quality of the film, it is a terrific portrait of the encounter between a quiet, self-reliant American and Arab culture. Self-taught rather than "book-learned," Frank Hopkins is free of cultural prejudices and willing to meet the Arabs on their own terms. He reminds me of rural great-uncles and aunts long dead now, products of the 19th century, whose unpretentious outlook, practical energy, and egalitarian respect for the perspective and dignity of others (including animals) made them universally liked and respected. I've never seen another film character that so fully embodies this 19th century American mentality. Read Ralph Waldo Emerson's Self-Reliance and you'll get the general idea.It's also a horse-lovers' film in a big way, from the mutually supportive working relationship between Frank and his paint horse, Hidalgo, to his use of the prize money from the race to save the Dakota mustangs from U.S. government extermination. As a mixed breed himself, Frank has a personal perspective on the issue of "breeding," whether in horses or humans, and the film demonstrates in many ways, without ever making an issue of it, how irrelevant race, parentage or culture are to the value of an individual. There are "goodies" and "baddies" on every side. Frank and Hidalgo overcome the initial hostility of Arabs to his cultural "strangeness" with integrity, fortitude, and a love of horses that transcends cultural barriers and touches their human commonality.Take the kids to see this one, a thought provoking story with minimal violence and an excellent, overall non-sentimental respect for the natural world as well as the humans and animals that inhabit it. They'll be thinking about it and asking you tough questions long after the popcorn is gone.</fullReview>

Not only was it breathtakingly beautiful but the dominant message - that the underdog can triumph against all odds and in the process of trying, learn more about him/herself than in all the preceeding years of his/her life makes this an outstanding film. The Maroc scenery was a visual treat. My father lived there in the early 60's and still waxes poetic about the landscape and wonderful people he met there.The negativity that a few have expressed about Hidalgo puzzles me and smacks of ulterior motives. I went to the theater expecting to see a "movie" with a positive message. I came out of the "movie" with so much more. But then, anyone who gives it an ounce of thought, can understand that the phrase "based on a true story" is not the same as "non-fiction".

The cinematography is spectacular, the horses are awesome eye candy (and Viggo isn't too hard on the eyes either), and the locations are wonderfully exotic. Who cares if the story is true or not? As it is, many people are refusing to see what is otherwise a highly enjoyable film due to the rediculous claims.I do question the casting choice for Moretensen, I don't think he was convincing as a Souix half-breed (come on, he's blond! Can't they at least have dyed his hair?) but otherwise, while the acting wasn't spectacular, it wasn't bad either.The comparisons between the Bedouin and the Native Americans was interesting, and between Mustangs and Arabians. In the end there was a definate "moral to the story" (ie, saving the Mustangs, saving the Souix, etc), but it wasn't as blatant as they could have done. Otherwise this great horse movie could have turned out to be a gagger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hidalgo" is the story of a man and a paint mustang. However, in the film--as Viggo pointed out in an interview--"The star IS the horse". The story is one of survival and growth, but it also exemplifies the genuine bond of partnership than can exist between four-legged and two-leggeds. It helps that Viggo's character (Hopkins) is "Blue Child" and is half-Lakota. Floyd Crow Westerman is a familiar voice speaking the Lakota tongue. The beginning of the film was strangely similar to parts of "The Last Samurai"...principle characters partaking inadvertently of despicable events (i.e. Wounded Knee) and suffering from PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), then seeking refuge from their nightmares in whiskey. Hmm. Onwards and upwards, as Hidalgo suggests when he disappears in the desert camp, only to be found waiting at the starting line for the day's race, staring at his staggering human, suggesting he get his,well, er-hum, together. Very eloquently projected to the audience, without a word having to be lipped in the style of Mr. Ed (bless him!). This is, after all, the age of natural horsemanship. "Be in the moment" is the horse's healing lesson for the tortured human.The concepts truly behind natural horsemanship are that we are all brothers. None of this medieval church philosophy that God set two-leggeds above the four-leggeds for dominion. This film borrows heavily from the sacred wheel of the Lakota (their flag and Hopkins' talisman) and together the desert sands lead horse and human along the true path of the Red Road to healing and wholeness. Along the way, much hatred of Muslim for infidel is converted to mutual respect and even admiration, as cultural biases give way to common understandings that we are all good, all filled with that divine life, all equal....two-legged, four-legged, and even winged. The kinship and understanding of how to make the right thing easy and the wrong thing difficult--tenets of the late Tom Dorrance, a master natural horseman--take Hopkins and Hidalgo beyond living in the American West with its creatures and peoples to tasting and daring to share strange worlds and stranger customs of other peoples and their creatures--even when half of them are out to ruin Hopkins and his beloved horse. For anyone that loves horses, a good old-fashioned Western, the Lakota people, the mystique of the Arabian culture or has a fear of the Muslim from ignorance, they will find this film to be a broadening and enlightening experience. I have not read the history of Hopkins. The film says he was an advocate that sought to preserve the American Mustang breed his entire life. I have ridden mustangs and spent time with them on a preserve in Montana. They are intelligent and noble creatures. They still need our protection, lest they end up as fare on tables in Europe or processed into dog food. These are sentient, intelligent creatures, each animal unique with beatiful personalities--even humor. And Viggo is fun to watch, too. His bareback gallop scene had everyone on the edge of their seats in our theatre. Don't take yourself too seriously. Live in the moment and enjoy! Quite a romp. Viggo manages Lakota with the skill that he handled Elvish. Very impressing. And a childhood riding with the Gauchos certainly comes across in his ability to bond and be with horses. Nicely chosen role, sir. And Viggo is perfect for the part. "Hidalgo" was played principally by a horse named TJ and Viggo mentioned in the interview that I saw that he bought TJ and kept him; they really bonded. This film is that genuine in its scenes of horse and human. They really understand one another and the mutual respect and love they have for one another will bring a tear to hardened eyes. This film seems undermarketed with little advance press. But it is a gem. Almost feels like you have seen a foreign film, with the Lakota and Arabic being subtitled. James Newton Howard wrote the soundtrack--another plus. All in all, a good journey to share with food for thought and applications for the terrors, trials, and existence in today's world. Thank you, all of you who created this piece.</fullReview>

Allowing the viewer to fully experience a dramatic rebirth, the movie fulfills the need for a rich and spiritual film. But carefully placed in the story is the character of Jaffa, a loyal servant of the sheik, and bodyguard to his only remaining offspring Jazira. Through Mensah's magnificent features, we understand that there may be a lot more than a simple duty to the beautiful daughter. It represents a quiet and pure love. Unfortunately the relationship isn't permitted to unfold, but the viewer is treated to its power in an unparalled fight sequence.Mensah turns in the action role of the year in a no holds barred fight with scores of villans carrying weapons of all sorts. Once again, Peter Mensah proves he can handle dramatic roles, as well as excite the viewer with visual magnificance. A must see.</fullReview>

Some people have been complaining about the so-called "shallow" acting. To this I say - try not to take the characters so seriously - they are obviously an exaggeration of the factual people on which they were based. Therefore the acting style is much more overblown &amp; larger-than-life than if it were a true-life portrayal. Omar Sharif is looking good and is still a wonderful actor, delivering his lines with a twinkle in his eye and a smile on his lips. Viggo Mortensen is spot-on as a crusty, down-on-his-luck cowboy with issues. The rest of the cast also did fine jobs of portraying their characters. If you're looking for a fun, utterly entertaining adventure flick - this is it.</fullReview>

And he rode him to the premier (sp) of the movie. I think Viggo Mortensen is absolutely gorgeous. He's also a painter and a poet. I think this explains his soft-spoken way. He seems like a very sensitive man and this is what I like. I generally see a movie for the stars in it and not particularly the story, which in this case was breath-taking. I also love an animal storyline and this was one. Reminds me of the times years ago when films were of the type you could take your kids to. Bravo HIDALGO!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cynical and Mean-spirited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a real disgrace. It steals from other, better movies (think of it as "Seabiscuit, Starring in The Mummy Returns to Lawrence of Arabia"), gives the audience lousy special effects, one-dimensional characters (Mortenson seems to be channeling "The Man With No Name,") and worse yet, its portrayal of Arabs and the Muslim faith is an outright slap in the face. Think of a negative Arab stereotype (violent, sadistic, cruel towards women, dishonest, spendthrift, given to religious zealotry), and it's in "Hidalgo". It's almost as if there was a checklist that the filmmakers used to ensure they were as offensive as possible.Judging by the cheering of the preview audience at the screening I attended, this movie will probably do well at the box office, but those responsible for making it should be ashamed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise behind Hidalgo is interesting. Frank Hopkins, a famous Pony Express rider, is chosen to compete with his "impure" Mustang in a 3,000 mile race across the Sahara Desert. I'm a sucker for true survival stories, but anyone's a sucker for thinking the film is true at all.Apparently everything from Hopkins background, from his Indian bloodline, to his time as a cast member in Buffalo Bill's Wild West is dubious. The famed desert race the film revolves around may not have ever existed as well. Don Blazer writes in an article from The Horsemen's Corral:"Hopkins claimed he was a 'star and ringmaster' in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show for 32 years.Dr. Juti Winchester, curator of the Buffalo Bill Museum at the Buffalo Bill Historical Center says, `We are unable to find any Frank T. Hopkins in our database of known cast members, acquaintances, employees, or friends of Colonel Cody.'Finally, about winning the 3,000 mile race in Arabia, Dr. Awd Al-Badi, director of research, King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies says, `There is absolutely no record or reference to Hopkins, with or without his mustangs, ever having set foot on Arabian soil. The idea of a historic long distance Arab horse race is pure nonsense.'Larry Hewitt, a director of The National Association of Competitive Mountaineering writes on his site (nacmo.org):"There was no Hidalgo, and Hopkins, who crafted the initial stories over the years, was never a rider with the Pony Express, never appeared in the Wild West Shows, and there was never a 1,000 year old 3,000 mile Oceans of Fire race in Arabia. These stories had merely been told and retold based on Hopkins' hoax, with none of the subsequent writers ever bothering to conduct research into their validity.Disney was caught in a bald-faced lie. Their response - typically corporate America. To quote Disney's publicist, Nina Heyn: "No one here really cares about the historical aspects... It has little to do with reality." Yet billing it as based on fact has been the cornerstone of the Disney marketing machine. To quote Professor David Dary, a recipient of the Cowboy Hall of Fame Wrangler Award and published author on the American West, "To misrepresent to the motion picture viewing public that the upcoming film is a 'true story' is not only misleading, it also raises a serious question about the credibility of the Disney organization." The recent resignation of Roy Disney from the board of directors, the last Disney family member to have a board position at the mega-corporation, simply serves to reinforce this opinion.Certainly other films have used the "true story" angle erroneously, such as The Blair Witch Project, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, even Return of The Living Dead, but with a tongue and cheek manner that is more of a tribute or inside joke than something that's genuinely deceitful.So accepting the story may not be a true one, is it still a good one? Though not awful, it's hardly a great film by any measure.The entire film is a mish-mash of other movies. You've got the Native American sentimentality of Dances With Wolves, mixed with Indiana Jones style action scenes (though they end up being more like Romancing The Stone) with liberal doses of The Cannonball Run mixed in. Even the special effects featuring a dust storm and a locust swarm look as if they were cut and pasted straight from The Mummy series.Had the movie been simplified as an elemental struggle with a man and his horse against impossible odds it may have worked better, but by throwing in sub plots like rescuing the daughter of the Sheikh before sundown to avoid castration was flat out ridiculous.As the Sheikh, Omar Shariff is very charming and eats up the screen every moment he's on it. And at 72 he believably pulls off some decent swordfight scenes.There's some cameos in the film that are pretty fun, too. JK Simmons is a great Buffalo Bill Cody, and the nearly forgotten C. Thomas "Pony Boy" Howell has a nice (albeit brief) turn as a prissy horse racer in the film's beginning.The horse is given some nice personality, too, snorting and huffing for dramatic effect to compliment Viggo's dialogue. Though screenwriter Joe Fusco did a much better job with his earlier horse pic, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron.With Viggo Mortensen fresh off his long stint in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, you'd think he'd have reached a bit further than to settle for yet another grizzled adventurer on a danger filled journey with this sub par flick. Though it's great to see him carry a major film again (he certainly has that younger Harrison Ford quality that can take him far), to see him play such an empty, shallow character after achieving such greatness is a disappointment. Though I suppose that's a tribute to Peter Jackson and we'll say that of any actor from that trilogy, save Ian McKellan for our their future work.The motivation for the character is confusing as well. When Hopkins, in The Pony Express, delivers the orders that result in the Indian slaughter at Wounded Knee, he descends into alcoholism and has nightmares about it. So the way he deals with them is by entering a race to win $100,000? I don't buy it.There's really no clear "bad guy" in the film, either. Without spoiling it, the antagonist that attempts to sabotage his attempts to win the race is neither punished, or revealed to the hero as a villain, either, leaving for a very unsatisfying conclusion.Hidalgo might be worth a rent, but there's certainly much better movies out there to spend your hard earned cash on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second by several lengths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hidalgo" is the first of what are sure to be several attempts to cash in on the success of last year's "Seabiscuit," but it doesn't come close to accomplishing the feat of its model.This film comes across too much as being made for really rather dim viewers: For one thing, the horse's behavior is right out of a Dudley Do-Right cartoon: he turns his head, neighs, and glares with surprise, condescension, and scorn all right on cue and with unfailing predictability. Second, if the filmmakers wanted it to be a surprise (as, judging from how late in the film he "reveals" this fact, they seem to) that the lead (human) character is part "red Indian," perhaps they shouldn't have included in the trailer the line "I am their kind." Beyond that, there are the carefully cast "Arabs," all just different-looking enough to overcome the filmmakers' worry that the audience won't be able to keep them straight by their names: one looks like a heavyweight Martin Lawrence, one is very dark-skinned, one is Omar Sharif, and of the two that have beards, the bad guy's is carefully trimmed to a demonic point. Easy, right?There is some beautiful scenery and some not-bad special effects, and sometimes they overlap. Not content to steal the "underdog horse competes against his thoroughbred superiors" theme from "Seabiscuit," the filmmakers also decided to steal the sandstorm scene from one of the recent "Mummy" movies. Of course, if you're going to steal something, get your money's worth, so they use the stolen effect twice: once for a sandstorm and then again later for a swarm of locusts. To try to fool you into thinking it's two different effects, they even sweep in from opposite sides of the screen. The locust scene is the better-done of the two. Look carefully and you'll see they even animated a couple of locusts to look like they were crawling across the camera.Less well done are the CGI cheetahs. The less said about these and the scene they appear in, the better.Now, I feel obliged to say that I saw this movie in a preview, and the experience was miserable. The audience was exactly the kind of low-wattage IQ the filmmakers seemed to be targeting, so there were plenty of "Oh, no!"s being uttered at timely moments throughout the film when it looked (horrors!) like Hidalgo might not finish the race. Worse, one particular set of night lights decided to bring their talkative 2-year-old to the film. On top of that, we were sitting in front of Mr. and Mrs. WhatDidHeSay and their daughter and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. WhatIsHeDoing. It seems like these folks are attending more and more films with me lately, I'm sorry to say. Last but not least, there was a medical emergency during the film that necessitated someone being carried from the auditorium.Now, was it all of these things that made the movie so unimpressive? No. But it is a measure of how unimpressive the movie was that I could not ignore these things going on around me and can in fact catalog them in such detail. You would think that a movie about a horse race could carry you someplace, but my main impression upon leaving "Hidalgo" was gratitude that it had been free.Original grade: 6 out of 10. Worth seeing, probably not worth recommending.Revised grade (3/7/2012): 4 out of 10. Bad. Significantly flawed but gets credit for a worthy attempt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't live up to the great trailer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did not live up to a trailer that really made me want to go see it. And that really annoys me. This is the story of a once-famous cowboy who is called into a legendary race across the Arabian Desert. Once he gets there, he is the officiant of scorn, and allkinds of obstacles both natural and through man stand in his way. The exciting trailer promised an action-filled film with good touching moments from what looked like a great plot. the movie delivered nothing of the sort. Viggo Mortenson gives just an okay performance- nothing compared to his Lord of the Rings glory. But then again, I truly believe that was the role he was born to play. This clearly was not. His "western" accent makes him hard to understand more than anything, and his character never shows any depth. Omar Sahrif provides much needed REAL comic relief with his character, but the rest of the cast is nothing impressive. That was a disappointment.The only thing that saves this movie from total ruin is its nice, if far between, action sequences. They are the exciting part of the film by far, since it lacks greatly in story and plot. But even the action sequences are too far between to satisfy. The movie is quite slow. Basically, it's not terrible- but it's definitely not good. 4/10 stars, and that is all.Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hidalgo" is an unenlightened movie for unenlightened times. It's the sort of mindless macho flick that expects us to cheer on an American character as he shows a bunch of nasty ol' foreigners how to really race a horse, how to treat women as equals, and how to behave with honesty and honor. Good grief. I'm surprised this turkey isn't being picketed all over the world (well, maybe it is, and I just haven't noticed!).Here are just a few of the film's stereotypical characters: a Prissy Gentleman who gets beaten up in the opening segment (I guess we're all supposed to hate prissy guys), a Funny Ethnic Friend who helps Hopkins tend his horse (funny friends are a must for these movies, right?), an Evil Guy with a Pointy Beard (not as cool as Roger Delgado in "Doctor Who"), and a Rebellious Woman Who is Forced to Wear a Veil, but Hates It (which clearly makes her about two hundred years ahead of her time). Don't forget the Faithful Warrior Slave and the Cute Slave Boy, too. Add to this noxious mix of characters a Really Long Rescue Segment in Which Two Guys Kill Two Hundred Guards, and you've got a connect-the-dots epic with all the sophistication of Bush Jr.'s foreign policies.Good points? A decent first hour (the Wild West show is a nice set piece), lovely costumes, and Omar Sharif (though why he's keen to appear in a clearly prejudiced film is beyond me). More of the bad: Viggo mumbles his way through much of the movie (maybe a blessing in disguise, since the dialogue is so bad), and the music score is so melodramatic that it merely emphasizes just how absurd the proceedings are. Honestly, the movie ought to come with a laugh track, it's just so ridiculous.And, you know what? Even the horse doesn't have much personality. "Hidalgo" is nothing less than an atomic bomb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was a pretentious western. All in all, this was a combination of Seabiscut and Indiana Jones -- a horse race in the Arabian dessert, where the people's horse (a mustang) outraces the pure bred Arabian steeds -- all ridden by the stereotypical Arab bad guy that we met in Indiana Jones.In this film, instead of a race to possess the Holy graile, it is just for the mundane $100,000 cash purse.Just like in Seabiscut, a central character has some kind of spiritual ability to communicate with a horse.Joe Johnson played his part like a poor man's version of Gary Cooper. His rendition of the central character was Gary Cooperish except when Mr. Cooper mumbled, it was understandable. Mr. Johnson just mumbled without bothering to realize that the audience has to understand the dialogue. The best actor in the movie was the horse.The producers of this film must think the audience are fools. I can't imagine that anyone would actually believe someone above the age of 10 would think what is depicted on this poor attemp at an epic film has even a scintilla of a factual basis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moose Hole - Review of Hidalgo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does a motion picture essentially need to be successful? Is it eye-popping special effects? A sovereign leading man? A rousing and inspirational story that attracts people from a variety of demographics? Well, yes, but now adays there seems to be an even more vital ingredient ? controversy. The predominant pictures seem to be quite ripe with it including the one leading the charge, The Passion of the Christ. Now a new feature film enters the fray, on an obviously different level but arousing controversy none the less. Not too long after Walt Disney Pictures announced the start of production for their $90 million epic horse feature, Hidalgo, based on the memoirs of Frank Hopkins, a newspaper printed an article that seemed to dispute the outstanding claims of Mr. Hopkins. In the Times Argus article, it is revealed that Hopkins' claims were unsubstantial and there seems to be no evidence to back up those extraordinary claims made in his unpublished autobiography. But there is no real evidence to dispute them either. Can this hurt the film? Only if you go with some knowledge of what the truth may have been.The story, as was recorded in Frank Hopkins' unpublished memoirs, tells of a man who, despite overwhelming odds, wins one of the greatest horse races of all time and becomes an American legend. Frank T. Hopkins, a cowboy and dispatch rider for the US cavalry, is a man at odds with himself. Hopkins was born into a family that consisted of a white father and a Native American mother. But he is ashamed of his Indian heritage at time in American history when the Native Americans are being pushed further away from the lands they had settled on for centuries. After witnessing the massacre that occurred at Wounded Knee, he joins Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show but as time progresses and alcohol enthralls him, Hopkins loses all sense of who is. Then at the urging of The Sheik, he and his horse Hidalgo enter a 3,000 mile survival race known as the Ocean of Fire. For years Frank Hopkins had claimed to be one of the greatest horse riders the world had ever seen ? now it was time to put his foot his mouth was and compete in a race that not only test his endurance, but his sense of pride and honor as well. The story for Hidalgo, all disputes on whether the tale was accurate or not aside, is inconsistent and tiresome. There is no clear idea at what the filmmakers are trying to get across as they seem to throw several interesting concepts into the fray and hope splashes of exhilarating action sequences will level things out in the end. Johnson, who directed such weak performances as October Sky and Jurassic Park III, doesn't seem to show improvement in directing another feature with no sense of direction. After such an excellent start with Honey I Shrunk the Kids, what the heck went wrong?If you're going to this feature looking for big name stars, you're only going to find one and that is if you are really interested in what a star of The Lord of the Rings trilogy has up his sleeve after the mega-smash film series. Viggo Mortensen, best known for his portrayal as Aragorn in the LOTR film series, has able opportunity to showcase his acting chops outside an audience consisting of nothing more then outlandish Tolkein freaks decked out in elvish ears and hobbit feet. Okay ? That was a little extreme but you get the point. Mortensen does as best a job as he can with the material he is given but the character he plays ends up coming out flat and uninteresting. Hopkins was to be presented as man conflicting with who he is and though he, in the end, discovers what his true heritage lies, there was no real significant event within the two hours to provoke such a result. All it does is leave you with more questions about the man then answers. Louise Lombard, who portrays Lady Anne Davenport, isn't featured long enough to get quite a sense of her acting her skills, but, as expected, the feature wasn't to focus too primarily on the supporting cast as the true focal point was the leading man. The only disappointment coming from her character, once again the fault of the filmmakers and not the actor, was the motivation behind the actions of Lady Davenport. Why is she so determined to win this race? No real specifics are given and only assumptions can be made to her true nature. Granted this is a minor squabble but one large enough to be worthy of note.Overall, Hidalgo stampedes over the line of believability and crosses the finish line with nothing more then an over embellished, inconsistent and, ultimately, flat tall-tale. Even if you go into this feature with no knowledge of the controversy it has created, the filmmakers continuously throw amazing event upon amazing event that, after time, begin to grow more outrageous and unbelievable as the film progresses. Granted the tale was `conceived' during the 1930's when people were apparently a lot more gullible but in today's modern retrospective, we thankfully know a whole lot better and therefore the tagline `Based on a True Story' can be greatly disputed. Outside the outlandish events depicted in the feature film, the moral lessons of `equality' and religion come off as being too preachy and some scenes feeling over exaggerated. Perhaps if the filmmakers explained the time period in which the film is set a bit more to describe the reason for such events, there may be a bit more understanding of the actions of certain individuals, whether they were right or wrong. Bottom-line is that Hidalgo is nothing near close to the artistic quality of Seabiscuit nor is its action sequences in comparison to those of The Lord of the Rings series. Much like Hopkins himself, the audience is left lost and searching for answers.My Rating: ** ? out of 5 (Grade: D+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It all starts with LOTR guy seeing a terrible slaughter of Indians, this makes him go off the rails for a while in a cliché fashion then of couse he's asked to compete in some super race and remembering a lot of Indians died, he does it.Then it's off to do the super race with all the Arabs calling him "infidel" and laughing at his horse, when of course we all know that he's going to somehow romp home to victory. Anyway after the mockery stage has finished they actually start racing... which isn't really all that exciting.There are a few short action scenes until he reaches the half-way point when the Sheikh's daughter gets kidnapped - and of course forgetting that this is the same guy that was going to have him castrated a few minutes ago, Aragorn rushes off to save the daughter.The rest is predictable but not awful. Although one feels that really this film could - and probably should - have been a more action packed 90 minutes, as really not that much tends to happen. Then of course, the ridiculous way in which Hidalgo - after falling down a hole and being impaled, almost dying - manages to win is just silly.</fullReview>

He doesn't have a impressive (read very expressive) play, but he is pleasant to watch and has a rather constant play.The set up, the photography are beautiful if clearly exaggerated with postal card overwhelming 'reddish' looking images. This could have been a beautiful adventure movie, but it lacks a single item. Because of this, it's a dish not only without salt, but also without spices.The missing item is called directing. Not that it doesn't have it, it's just awful. Joe Johnston was a poor choice for this movie. It makes it look like a b series movie with the actors moving slowly, saber fight scenes poorly directed than Power Rangers fights, slow image change in action takes, and so on.Because of this, the movie lacks pace. There are action/adventure movies with slow pace, but that's another level of mastering the art of directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big Viggo fan, if he's there I'm there (except for the remade Vanishing Point), I think he is right up there with my current favorite movie heroes. I enjoy the way he modestly underplays his action characters. I also enjoy Omar Sharif as the Arab leader with mixed feelings about Viggo in this tale of an American cowboy with a painted mustang engaged in a long distance horse race across Saudi Arabia. Pretty much anything that could happen happens. The action keeps coming but you still get a few magic moments of the beautiful scenery of the open desert. So I really continue to struggle with the Disney machine. Their labeling of this as "based on a true story" is pretty disingenuous in light of the internet material I've read on the subject. It sounds like Frank Hopkins was one major bull-you-know-what. I don't like the "based on a true story" line unless the movie is essentially grounded in the real deal. Kind of like where "Fly Away Home" was "based on a true story" when the only connection was a guy made a plane geese might follow. But it's just like Disney to sneakily give veritas where no veritas is due. If they were really creative and not this antiseptic corporate blockhead, they would have had fun with the whole Frank Hopkins tall tale thing. Make it clear at the beginning that this is a story told by Frank Hopkins and whether it happened or not is up to the viewer. And at the end, just say "Frank Hopkins claimed to have....". Sometimes it's not so bad to just tell the truth.</fullReview>

It's December 29, 1890 and he's there to see the aftermath of the Wounded Knee Massacre. He becomes a drunk, haunted by the event, and riding in Buffalo Bill Cody (J.K. Simmons)'s Wild West Show. He takes on a challenge from Sheikh Riyadh (Omar Sharif) to ride in a 1000 year old 3000 mile race in the Arabian desert. Riyadh's purebred horse Al-Hattal is the favorite. His bandit nephew is jealous and looking to take the family honor of owing the prized horse. Riyadh's daughter Jazira is desperate for it to lose so she isn't forced to marry the prince rider as his 5th wife. Lady Anne Davenport has the other favorite in the race.This is an old fashion high adventure. At times, it has the feel of Indiana Jones. It's a nice underdog story. This is a throwback movie. I would like to drop the Wounded Knee reference. It's unnecessary and over-the-top. Otherwise, this is a movie from the golden age of Hollywood in the best tradition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Hollywood Cowboy Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typical cowboy movie? Maybe, maybe not... mostly not. Personally, I hate cowboy movies. My dad's sat me down and made me watch too many bad cowboy flicks, but "Hidalgo" had me hooked from the start. This had plot twists around every corner, a (somewhat) diverse set of characters, and great practical and special effects, each are ingredients to the recipe for a good movie.To be brief, the movie starts out at the end of a race in America, during the Cowboy age. Frank Hopkins (being the somewhat typical white-washed "Hollywood cowboy" with a Native American twist) has just won yet another long-distance horse race. Frank's show name in an American entertainment show gets him wrapped up in a famous race in the far-off country of Arabia. He is given vague advice, some poor instructions, and is sent off to compete in the race. Being an underdog character and a tough-as-nails, adaptable-to-everything cowboy stereotype, Frank is able to survive a massive sandstorm, locusts, starvation, heat, corruption, and anything else thrown at him. In an odd addition, Frank is sent on what can be described as a "side quest" to save the daughter, Jazira, of Sheikh, the one holding the race. Once Jazira is safe, Frank simply goes back to racing. Of course, as everyone anticipated, Frank and Hidalgo win the race after almost every damn odd was stacked against them. The casting for this movie is arguably... "okay". Frank, played by Viggo Mortensen, was introduced as a cowboy character for the most part, but with the addition that he was half Native American. This detail could have been removed/replaced and made the movie look a little less white- washed, as Frank looks entirely white. Oddly enough, the horses' acting is worth noting. The animals, no matter was situation they were put in, reacted extremely well and fitting to their scene, it's quite remarkable. Some characters could have been removed, such as Lady Anne and her forced-feeling relationship with Frank (but the cowboy always has to get the girl, right?) as well as the slave boy and Jaffa, whose parts are irrelevant other than giving Frank advice. The clashing of Frank's American culture and the Arabic culture was mixed well. Frank respects, although not happily, their customs. Not touching the Shiekh's hand (in the beginning), not helping the other racers (at first), and putting up with their "fate has been chosen already" rants. The Arabics accept that he has a "painted" horse, and is not one he bred himself, but instead tamed and befriended. Though, the Native American touch could have been ditched for something a bit more fitting, say... more American grit? Second thought, this movie has so much grit already it might burst if there is anymore added.All things considered, "Hidalgo" isn't half bad of a movie. It's got great emotional feel the whole way through, the costumes and scenery were gorgeous, and the ending was a bit disheartening yet certainly satisfying. Although, what American (such as myself) doesn't love an underdog movie with cool animals and awesomely choreographed fight scenes?</fullReview>

Upon impressing an Arabian sheikh during a show in the United States, he gets invited to participate in a traditional horse marathon that lasts for many long and sour days; deadly is the term best to use to describe such a race.Despite Viggo's great acting, the director of the movie didn't put the story exactly right, nor did he pay attention to simple facts that lowered the credibility of this movie in truly being in a 19th century Arabian setting.Although you may see some Arabian women whoring in the Western world, back then the case was much different. The scene with Viggo laying back in the tent is something that is 101% rare back in them days.Girls were raised "by the belt" as they say, and they would never lower their morals and standards to "laying down the same tent" with a man that isn't her husband; moreorless a foreigner that is far different from their culture and religion.This simple fact is quite shameful to see in such a great movie.Other than that, I loved seeing the deceptive parts played by the Arab tribes during the race.. As well as the tribal fighting, which was a bitter part of Arabia's history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clichéd Western Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the legend of American distance rider Frank Hopkins and his horse Hidalgo,this film tries to recount how he raced against Arabia horses back in the 1890's.It stars Viggo Mortensen, Zuleikha Robinson, and Omar Sharif.This movie entitled "Hidalgo" is directed by Joe Johnston.The Ocean Of Fire is a three thousand mile survival race that is held across the Arabian desert and it restricts its participants to the finest horses found in Arabia that are owned by noble families. Then,a wealthy sheik invited an American,Frank Hopkins and his horse to enter the race for the first time.Billed as the greatest rider in the West back in the United States,Hopkins gets into a big challenge against the greatest Arabian horses who are just as determined to prevent a foreigner from winning.With another theme of having the main protagonist being the underdog and being up against the best of the world,we have another yet a clichéd and predictable film at Hidalgo particularly the conclusion when everyone knows who is going to win and how it is going to end.It also tries to relive Western movies when it was released but there is nothing groundbreaking nor refreshing in it except the excitement and entertainment that it can bring to viewers who love this particular types of films.What's even worth noticing is the fact that the story was definitely cheesy that people of today may no longer look for when going to the theaters.Overall,it is one clichéd movie from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Science of a Good Title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, here in Mexico the titles of movies change radically, but not for good. For instance, "Rush Hour" movies became "An Explosive Couple", "Bourne Identity" became "Unknown Identity", "Despicable Me" becomes "My Favorite Villain". Do you know the title of Resident Evil? The Cursed Host? which actually sounds pretty good in English? but in Spanish sounds like? well. Something else that is compromised is the continuity of the following titles: like, "Resident Evil: Apocalypses" has no Spanish title, but that is another story.There are a couple of films that has been better with the title given to them here. I'm pretty sure people would have liked the more "Pearl Harbor" with the subtitle "Between Passion and Fire" on it. It prepares you for a war-romance flick (when you are watching mostly romance with war as a subject and time-space scenario, but is kind of what you were expecting).When I saw this movie on TV a couple of months ago, I didn't know it was "Hidalgo", the 2004 movie whom commercials trailers where not attractive to me. That was before I knew what it was about. This is simply one of the most entertaining pictures I have ever seen on my whole life, I've watched it like four or five times since. It has the right amount of adventure, action and comedy, half western and half racing.But I believe it could have been something different with the real name. Here, the name was the name of the race ("Ocean of Fire") which I think depicts better the script. If you consider it, "Hidalgo" prepares the spectator for a movie about the horse, something like,? I don't know, "Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron", "Babe" or something like it?"War Horse". But the story about Hidalgo, how it was born, how it was trained, the same story filmed with a different view point, focus in the horse, when it is about the cowboy, Frank Hopkins and an adventure in the middle of Arabia. So, when I heard "Ocean of Fire" I knew it was going to be about the race, but I also found a beautiful story about Indians, civil war soldiers, a terrible past and a very weird friendship.Maybe that is why I liked it so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Good Breeding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the old west, Frank Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen), a half-breed American, is dispatched with a message to the military brass that orders the massacre of a tribe of native Americans at Wounded Knee, if necessary. It becomes apparently necessary. Hopkins takes to drink and joins Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show which dramatizes, with flash and fury, and guns a-blazing, the triumph of the noble white man over the pernicious savage. Strange to think how this idea was perpetuated by popular culture (the movies) until the 1950's and beyond. Anyway, fate intervenes - an Arab Sheikh (Omar Sharif) has taken an interest in long-distance horseman Hopkins and his wild mustang, Hidalgo, and soon the two are crossing "the great water" to compete in a prestigious horse race across the Arabian desert, against a different breed of horse ? and horseman ? altogether.In "Hidalgo" breeding is everything. In Arabia Hopkins encounters a world in which the privileged few ? princes and sheikhs ? hold sway over the multitudes, and lesser races are relegated to slavery (Hopkins was born in 1865, during the demise of American slavery). Hopkins and his mustang are sneered at by the breeders of generations of Arabian thoroughbreds, and the valiant riders of these princely animals are not above cheating and engaging in other forms of deadly chicanery in order to win the race. Mortensen plays Hopkins as a particular breed of man ? one with honour, integrity, self-reliance and the ability to take care of himself ? and this "infidel" eventually endears himself to Sheikh Riyadh who holds similar ideals (a little hokey, I admit, because this type of laconic American hero, the likes of Gary Cooper, has been so prevalent in American movies).I liked the "breeding" angle, which carries well throughout the movie, and I liked Viggo Mortensen's performance. Most of all, I liked the horse, Hidalgo, who pretty much steals the show. I found the race sequences to be a bit sketchy, and I had trouble believing that the participants actually covered the great distance we're told they did. It's an amiable adventure movie with stock action scenes, though not always that rousing. Writer John Fusco is purportedly a great fan of Hopkins whose claim to have participated in the Arabian horse race is held in question, according to my minimal research. But it's a good tall tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and Action-Packed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hidalgo is a very entertaining, action-packed film that is well-directed and has a great lead actor fresh off his Lord of the Rings films. It's beautifully shot and the cinematography of the "Old West" and the Arabian Peninsula is gorgeous. The script is thinly-written, but Joe Johnston easily takes care of that in this entertaining flick. I also learned a thing or two about horses and the different types of breeds.Joe Johnston's film is about a cowboy and a horse racer who heads to the Middle East to participate in a 3000-mile long race. However, there is an evil plot in the works that this cowboy may end up being involved in.Viggo Mortensen is an underrated actor and it's a shame he doesn't get many leading or high-profile roles, with the Lord of the Rings trilogy being an exception. He does have the grace and capability of being a leading man as shown here.Overall, this is a fun, very entertaining film. It's a pleasure to look at and the story is involving. This is nothing special, but it's a pure escapist film after the long, grueling Oscar season. I had a fun time watching this and there are many important themes here. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film. It was incredibly well done - the cinematography, direction, and writing were so great. And the acting! Viggo Mortensen is so great.They did a great job in making the star horse emote and 'give opinions' as well. I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a good animal flick (within reason) if it's done well and not cheesy. This is just a good story.The imagery across the desert are beautiful, although I think someone was a little overzealous (not that I can blame them) with the sun in the background on a horsey shadow. But it was all goodVery few movies these days (I know, I know, this movie is nearly a decade old now but bear with me!) get me to the point at which I'm actively rooting for the protagonist, on the edge of my seat.This film was exceptional, I can highly recommend it!</fullReview>

IT would be easy to call this the American against the Muslims. And you may be right. But there is something about this movie that speaks to the American spirit. Something about the old west, too. Every scene is significant. Every scent an adventure. How could you not love it and how could the droids give it a numerical rating like that. There are only movies and anyone who doesn't recognize the great ones should stick with "Saw." The only movie besides "Little Big Man" that salutes the American Indian.

		<fullReview>Traumatised by his part in the Wounded Knee massacre, rider Frank Hopkins leaves the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show and accepts a challenge to take part in the 3,000 mile Ocean of Fire endurance horse race across the Arabian Desert.Based on Hopkins' self-related life story (which, it appears, contains no verifiable facts and must, therefore, be regarded as of questionable accuracy or less), Hidalgo - the name of Hopkins' mustang - is an exciting and enjoyable action adventure movie, albeit one which suffers from shifting moods. The opening, with Wounded Knee and Hopkins' spiritual malaise in the Wild West Show promises some emotional depth but, despite Viggo Mortensen's typical intensity and integrity, what follows is Boy's Own action adventure stuff, including an exciting princess rescue mission as well as the privations of the race itself.The movie is enjoyable, but without the depth it might have had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice, heart warming story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hidalgo" is a nice break after seeing so many movies today that rely on cheesy graphics, cursing, nudity, and sex. It reminded me of older movies in that shock value was less important than story, characters, and theme. The characters are well developed, from the hero, to the adversaries, right down to the horse. They all have personalities and goals of their own that you begin to care about. Even the Arabians, who seem to be almost stereotypical in their hatred of "infidels", are believable, especially in the historical context. As the movie progresses, so does the character development. The script might not have been extraordinary, but I did not see this as a drawback. On the contrary, I thought it was well written because the dialogue sounded natural, yet had just enough witty lines in it to keep my attention. The action kept the audience on the edge of their seats and the cinematography was beautiful. Though it was not an incredibly deep movie, Hollywood rarely produces those and this one was deeper than many out there. I would recommend "Hidalgo" to almost everyone who is willing to open their hearts to a story of courage, hope, and acceptance. Or for anyone who just wants to sit back, relax, and let themselves enjoy a good movie for a while.</fullReview>

The coolest character was the slave to the Muslim princess who was beatin' the crap out of maybe ten guys with swords. The sand storm was really sick and believable and a close call for Viggo when he was running from it. There were a few people who p****d me off throughout the movie, like the guy who kept trying to sabotage Viggo's character.

Hopkins and his mustang Hidalgo, get invited to the greatest cross-country horse race in the future, in Arabia. The Sheik is offended that Hopkins' horse is billed as the world's greatest long-distance rider in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Viggo Mortensen plays the lead character (although the movie is named after the horse), however, his performanace is too dry. And he mumbles several lines. Omar Sharif, Lawrence of Arabia's Sherif Ali, plays the role of the wealthy Sheikh Riyadh, but he brings nothing but cliche to the character. Zuleikha Robinson, one of the supporting cast "spies" from The Lone Gunmen, plays the role of the Sheik's daughter, but without even attempting to hide her American accent. There's one interesting surprise, but it's not really germaine to the story. While based on a true story, this film is pure, predictable Hollywood hokum. The dialogue is as Disney corny as it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(BIG spoilers here)How can a film based on an interesting story with such a rich palate to craft a tale end up like this? So much potential, and yet....It's forty minutes into the telling before the film kicks in, and I still don't know why the protagonist took the challenge. Was it bravado? Was it for the money? Did he really think that he could beat 300 challengers with generations of expertise, breeding and culture so the "ponies could go free"? (Saw that plot twist coming up Broadway, by the way.)The whole movie was close, but not quite right. Even the shift of color and saturation balance in the "dying of thirst" scene quickly became annoying.I found the portrayal of the Arab characters embarrassingly Americanized and unintentionally condescending. And I simply didn't believe that Viggo had a single drop of Indian blood coursing through his veins. (Loved his performance in LOTR, but he misses here.)More than anything else, the film tried to do too many things and succeeded at none. It was simply a big disappointment. This story deserves a second look sometime in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hidalgo" is an old-fashioned romp in the "Indiana Jones" vein, with less clever dialogue (mostly along the lines of "You can insult me, but if you insult my horse. . ."). But it has stunningly beautiful cinematography by Shelly Johnson, lovely scenery, and excruciatingly bombastic music by James Newton Howard. It riffs off a similar premise as "The Last Samurai" in the lead character's disillusionment (not Hidalgo, that's the horse - Viggo plays Frank Hopkins) over the Indian Wars and Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, but uses that more effectively for self-discovery as his mother was a Native American.A nice modern twist in the genre is that the women, whether villainess or heroine, are not helpless, even as bound by 19th century conventions.Combined with Viggo being nice and easy on a horse and on the eyes, though he doesn't have to show his emoting chops along with his chaps, this movie really carried me back to my pre-adolescent fascination with horses, like the lovely Russell Crowe film "The Silver Brumby: King of the Wild Stallions."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't say this movie will go down as one of the classic horse-enthusiast film of all time, but it's a good film.This movie has some classic elements like a protagonist strung across two worlds (American cowboy relic and Native American) who gets torn between his committments to both and runs away from it...well...runs away from it on horseback anyway. And then there's the 3,000 mile desert race.Don't worry the good guy triumphs, end of story.I think the true value of this movie is that it contains a portrayal of Arabic people as honorable (except for a few bad apples). It includes an interesting parallel implied between the Arabic tribes and Native American ones at times.Overall I would say this movie met my expectations...a nice family film with light moments and inspirational ones.

Frank T Hopkins was a real American cowboy who protected and promoted the Mustang until the day he died in 1951. I spent sometime on my computer following the details of his life and he did spin a few tales. However this movie is a great family outing. It could bring up a lot of questions about the "Way of Life " in the Old West, around a family dinner table, if family dinners happen in this rushed lifestyle of 2004!!!! The "Ocean of Fire" race also sounds quite impossible but it COULD have actually taken place. I feel for the horses in a venture of this type. I wonder if there were any injuries during the making of the movie, either man or animal!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hidalgo was the classic Disney (Touchstone) formula - underdog of poor background over comes all to defeat the rich, powerful and advantaged. (I had just seen Miracle and thought that I was seeing the same move all over again. Just substitute ice for sand. "Goal scored by #2 Hidalgo, assisted by Dave Christian and Ken Morrow.") This time, the maudlin sentimentality is troweled on a foot thick. The story itself was so weak that they had to fill in a patch with a totally extraneous side track about retrieving a kidnapped princess. Overall, the plot of so full of absurd turns that it is hard not to laugh at times. Look for the medical miracle at the end of the movie.There are however, 2 good reasons to see Hidalgo. One is the photography, which largely substitutes for a real plot. The second is Omar Sharif who towers over the other lame acting in the movie like a giant. Good to see him back in movies again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hidalgo tells the tale of an late-1800's Army messenger (Viggo Mortensen) at the end of his career. Being a witness to the Army's massacre of Native Americans at Wounded Knee, he turns to the bottle and barely muddles through as a stunt rider in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. His chance for redemption comes in the form of an invitation to participate in a race across the Arabian peninsula, where he not only suffers through the elements but also through the intrigues of the competing Arabian tribes.The movie is entertaining enough. There are some good action scenes, some interesting scenery, and a few comical moments. The horse riding scenes are spectacular, and if they gave an Oscar for animal performance, the horse that played Hidalgo is an absolute shoo-in for his amazing multi-faceted performance. Unfortunately, the film does not really stand out, it's simply another formulaic telling of an old story. We've seen the washed-up hero in countless other films, this simply puts him in another setting. His past connection to the Native Americans is only touched upon during the obligatory and oft-repeated "mystical moment in the desert when the hero is on the edge of death" scene. The political intrigues between tribes is random and unengaging. The sheik, played by screen and bridge legend Omar Sharif, is only mildly interesting. The chief bad guy comes out of nowhere in a plot line that makes little sense.All of these problems are a shame, because this story had better potential than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joe Johnston knows how to make a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did have a few problems with Hidalgo, but the redeemable qualities more than makes up for Johnston's mistakes. What I have to start by saying is that this is a very classic action movie. I've noticed that throughout Joe Johnston's directing career, he's done an incredible job of paying tribute to genre's of the past. With Honey I Shrunk The Kids it was old disney kids fantasy movies, with October Sky it was Capra, with JP3 it was classic monster movies. What makes Hidalgo so great is that Johnston made the movie feel like a classic western adventure movie. He understands the genre, and doesn't get too deep into updating it to modern day standards. And Viggo Mortensen understands the genre as well. He doesn't worry about making himself come off as really slick and cool. He's just an average guy that's very heroic.Hidalgo isn't without flaw, and it's by no means Johnston's best work. It's at least 15 minutes too long, and there were some poor transitions about half way through. At one point a side story develops that takes us out of the race, and to me it felt like a second movie was going on for a while. The transition into this could have been done a little smoother. I also think this movie could have benefitted from more profiling of the racers. Only 2 other racers besides Frank Hopkins get any real screentime. At the beginning of both legs of the race, you see all the racers at once, but the race itself could have been a lot more exciting if we saw more than just the 3 main racers. You can't really get the maximum amount of tension when we're not even shown if there are more than 3 guys competing. But these are minor flaws.I liked that the action sequences relied more on clever staging than just fast cuts and lots of gunshots and fighting. What was so enjoyable about the action was that Frank Hopkins would do spontaneous things that I didn't see coming. The action was original and clever. It didn't try and be too serious. There was humor in almost every action scene from start to finish. And while I was having a great time through the whole movie, when it got to the ambush sequence with the buried trap and the leopard attack, this movie had officially won me over. That sequence was incredibly exciting. And the finale of the race worked really well. I think that's because it wasn't predictable. In most movies you'd just assume that the hero would come from behind and win at the last second, but I wasn't so sure what was going to happen. Maybe that's because Johnston never makes this movie about a guy that HAS to win. Hopkins and Hidalgo don't even seem too concerned with winning, just finishing. On a final note, I just want to comment that Omar Sharif really does steal the movie. I only wish he had been used more in the final act. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

But these are minor flaws.I liked that the action sequences relied more on clever staging than just fast cuts and lots of gunshots and fighting. What was so enjoyable about the action was that Frank Hopkins would do spontaneous things that I didn't see coming. The action was original and clever. It didn't try and be too serious. There was humor in almost every action scene from start to finish. And while I was having a great time through the whole movie, when it got to the ambush sequence with the buried trap and the leopard attack, this movie had officially won me over. That sequence was incredibly exciting. And the finale of the race worked really well. I think that's because it wasn't predictable. In most movies you'd just assume that the hero would come from behind and win at the last second, but I wasn't so sure what was going to happen. Maybe that's because Johnston never makes this movie about a guy that HAS to win. Hopkins and Hidalgo don't even seem too concerned with winning, just finishing. On a final note, I just want to comment that Omar Sharif really does steal the movie. I only wish he had been used more in the final act. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read some bad reviews of this movie, so I was not sure of my own reaction. I did not care if it was historically correct. I was not there to watch a documentary feature; I wanted to be entertained and 'Hidalgo' did an excellent job of it.It is definitely Viggo Mortensen's movie. He is in nearly every scene, but Omar Sherif did an excellent job too. The horse is very expressive and the relationship between the horse and Frank Hopkins is touching. The cinematography is magnificent. A few Spoilers ahead:There are a couple of side stories, and I felt that without them the movie might have become monotonous, and/or more like a documentary. The long race provides the means for Hopkins to discover himself. At one point I actually wondered if he would finish the race at all. The suspense was excellent. He could have finished second or third and it would not have mattered.The movie moves and keeps one interested. Perhaps the initial portion could have been a bit short (when Hopkins was with Buffalo Bill), and more emphasis could have been on his Sioux Indian roots, and tying those better toward the end.Great job of entertaining! I gave it 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie of a 'King'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it seems to have been edited to death, Hidalgo still manages to deliver with an excellent cast, beautiful scenery, and a great plot line.Mortensen shines once more, this time with a cowboy hat instead of a sword. As usually, it seems that he threw himself into his character, bringing Frank Hopkins to life in a way that few actors could have.I have hopes that when the DVD comes out, the edited scenes will reveal more about the backstory. So much of the movie seems dependent on Hopkins' past, yet they spent so little time developing that.Despite the poor editing and mediocre script, this movie hits it's mark. It's definitely worth that second trip to the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mustang sally, or Been through the desert on a horse ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink." That's how I felt going into "Hidalgo". The trailer, or preview, turned me right off. That shot of an approaching sandstorm reminded me too much of the silly special effects in "The Mummy". My roommate had to bribe me to see "Hidalgo". He paid my admission, and I said I'd pay him back if I liked the movie.Well, he won the bet, and so does Frank Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) in the film. He races his painted horse, a wild mustang, against the finest purebred Arabian steeds in the world. Damned if he doesn't reach the finish line first after crossing a stretch of desert known as the "ocean of fire".But you knew that, didn't you? No spoiler there. To quote another saying, "Getting there is half the fun" -- and "Hidalgo" takes us for quite a ride.The cinematography is breathtaking, except for the obligatory slow motion as Hidalgo enters the final stretch. There were also several annoying shots of the horse gazing straight at the camera. I kept expecting Hidalgo to say, "This is the screwiest picture I've ever been in!" (Shades of the camel in "Road to Morocco".) Or else they were setting Viggo Mortensen up as Wilbur Post to Hidalgo's Mr. Ed.The costumes are splendid, especially the 19th-century hats, veils and bustles worn by actress Louise Lombard.Even the acting is pretty good. (Early on, however, Viggo Mortensen seems to be channeling John Wayne, right down to the trademark swagger, drawl and loose wrist.)The story may be based on a true-life adventure, but the plot is far-fetched at times. (I felt cheated when the film invoked a "deus ex machina", a divine intervention, to save Hopkins and his horse at a crucial juncture.) As for the score, don't get me started. It's a retread of the music from every Hollywood western since Tom Mix.Every so often, a movie comes along that causes me to ask myself, "Why was this film made and released at this particular time?" "Hidalgo" is such a film. The story took place a century ago, but has a certain resonance in our time -- one that left a bad taste in my mouth. The tale of an American who beats the Arabs at their own game was quite simply too reminiscent of the war in Iraq. Indeed, Iraq is mentioned a couple of times during the film. To top it all off, one of the two leading female characters, a sheik's daughter, is named Jazira. This echoes the name of the Arab news network, Al-Jazeera.(By contrast, last year's "The Last Samurai" tells a different story. It is set in the same time period, with a similar hero, who adapts to a foreign culture and learns from it, instead of the other way around.)To be fair, the villains in "Hidalgo" are of all races and nationalities -- from the American cavalrymen who massacre the Sioux at Wounded Knee, to the dastardly Aziz and Katib (brother and nephew to the sheik), to the ice-cold Englishwoman, Lady Davenport.The heroes also span the spectrum -- from the urbane sheik (played by the incomparable Omar Sharif), to his intrepid and freedom-loving daughter Jazira, to the wise Sioux chief.Movies have the potential to be more than just entertainment. They can create evocative images and convey meaningful messages with the power to shape our culture, the way we think and feel. In the wrong hands, "Hidalgo" could have dealt in negative stereotypes. It is to the director's credit that he does not go down that slippery slope. Rather, he shows how vastly different cultures can share each other's wisdom and join their hands in friendship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoilers Herein***While the plot of Hidalgo was predictable and the ending was feel-good and it's the kind of movie you smile at and then watch if it's on TV again in a couple months, it was well made and brought up several interesting points. (I call it a movie because I'm not sure that it ought to be called a film.) As this movie is apparently not based on the claimed true story, the way things turn out to give a couple of nice points.First, the British Davenports were well-cultured people and accepting of Arab culture. Mrs. Davenport said something about living with them since she had been thirteen, but she still saw herself as slightly above them, as she made some comment about tribal war being the national sport. However, she did have great respect for their entire horse culture, a respect that was not shared either by her or her husband for American Indians. If I'm not mistaken, they both talked about the "Red Indians," showing how that culture was somewhat ignored - elbowed aside and better forgotten.Identity - who you are, who your ancestors were - played a big role in this movie. Frank Hopkins and Hidalgo were both 'mixed breeds,' as opposed to the purebreds (both horses and humans) they raced against. The three competitors racing for the finish line represented Britain, the Middle East, and America. The first two were all about breeding and ancestry and looked down on the "half-bred" American and his horse. This ancestry, the bloodline, became more important than the actual horse or person you were. Thus, the race becomes more a competition of your breeding than your desire to win. Hidalgo, representing the American melting-pot, is the winner of the race, showing that willpower can outrun even the best bred of horses. Hopkins is the ideal rugged American individual and didn't even accept his Indian heritage - rather, he accepted it but did not take pride or participate in it until the race.I had a bunch of other little points that I was going to mention here, but in the course of writing this I forgot them all, so after you've seen this movie, you can think about these or not think about these and maybe I'll think of more and post another comment later.</fullReview>

We were glad Frank didn't jump into bed with either woman, showed he was very honorable. We don't find that much in films these days, which makes this film refreshing. Omar Sharif was excellent, even down to the gap in his front teeth. The photography was breathtaking and the ending made you feel good about these wonderful wild mustangs. They are becoming a dying breed and it is a shame. Whether or not the story is true or based on fact shouldn't be a great concern, it does tell a good story, esp. at the start with the massacre at Wounded Knee. After the movie, we stopped off at the store to buy some chicken for a late dinner and highly recommended it to a few people. Take your family and enjoy a great adventure and film.

		<fullReview>Went to see Hidalgo last night with a group from the stables, mostly young women who love horses to start with so first you know there is a bit of prejudice involved here.I loved this film. I've been reading the reviews and for those who wonder how the base camp gets to the half way mark and the finish line before the riders, HELLO? Were you listening to the actors in the film, at least three times they mentioned the CAMEL ROADS that were faster and shorter than the race route.As for the film, many say the race never happened, Frank T. Hopkins is a fake and Hidalgo never existed. So what? It's a fun, entertaining and great adventure for the whole family. The acting is wonderful, the horse is spectacular and the pace of the movie is as close to perfect as it gets, action, relax and recover, ACTION, relax and recover. Well paced and fun to watch. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves horses and loves Viggo, both are certainly worth the admission price and I know because rarely do I pay full price to see a movie at the theater, I'll usually wait for the DVD or the cheap local theater to show it. This was well worth my money!</fullReview>

A lot is left up to the viewer to decide for themselves. For instance, Frank Hopkins motivation isn't really clarified, you can guess, but his agenda is left a little vague.Some of the Arabian characters are a little stereotypical but Omar Sharif is enjoyable and generally the good guys come off well and the bad guys come off badly. I know some people couldn't get why the riders were so exhausted but the idea of riding a couple of thousand miles in 35 degrees celcius sounds pretty nasty to me.Generally it's a fun movie once you're not expecting anything too historical and/or socio-political.

		<fullReview>I love this movie!!! It is beautifully photographed, to be sure, but the overall story is what makes it for me. It's true that the movie is VERY LOOSELY based on Frank Hopkins life and it has to be viewed as more of a tall tale than history, but many of the legends of the old West are embellishments of reality.The pace of the movie is just right to me and it never seemed to be long or boring. I am a big fan of Viggo Mortensen and was very pleased to see this solid performance in a starring role. Considering that it is a Disney movie, I was pleased that the movie was pretty straightforward in approach and didn't get overly artificial. It is an adventure movie, after all, so there are a number of contrived "situations" for the hero to overcome. Viggo's performance is typically quiet and introspective, which is appropriate for the character. His Indian chant toward the end moved me to tears.I also liked that there wasn't any artificial romance in the movie. He has respect for the Sheik's daughter but I never felt the movie implying "romance" on his part or hers. They are clearly from different worlds and it's going to stay that way. And he has a healthy distrust of the conniving British woman. I found her to be the real villain in the movie.Of course it's formulaic like just about any movie about racing or sports competition. The end can be predicted before the opening credits, you just get to enjoy the journey with the hero or the team.I have seen the movie twice and plan to see it several more times. It's beautiful, entertaining and very satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saturday afternoon, movie popcorn and Viggo Mortensen adventuring as a purehearted hero. It does not get any more satisfying than that. The plot is simple and the resolution is never in doubt, but getting there is all the fun. Viggo has a screen presence that elevates this cowboy- races-across-the-desert flick to a riveting performance. Personally, I could not get enough of him on screen. All the parts in Hidalgo were well cast and performances were very good, but the reasons to see this movies are Viggo and the horse.Hidalgo is suitable for all ages. Just about any child will enjoy the movie while his/her mother can be engaged in the film in a combination of childlike relish for adventure and adult appreciation for a hunky, but sensitive hero.

		<shortDescription>Seabiscuit meets Lawrence of Arabia, et al</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mild Spoilers)Frank Hopkins was a real cowboy hero and Hidalgo was a real horse. Together they really did go to Arabia and win a 3,000 miles race against the finest Arabian horses and riders. Frank actually won this race by 33 hours rather than by a nose, as in this Hollywoodization of his achievement. But that is forgivable: this is an adventure film with some dramatic backbone to it, not a precise history. The screenwriter has incorporated several subplots that seem like something out of Raiders of the Lost Ark, with Frank departing from the race to save a beautiful chieftain's son from the clutches of a rival to the Arab Prince who is putting the race on. There's also an aristocratic English femme fatal who will do anything- even to the point of seducing the hero- to have her horse win. There are also many small points of humor, such as Frank getting riled up whenever somebody says anything bad about his horse, the Prince being a fan of western dime novels, the Prince supposedly having the ability to tell the future, (which he never does throughout the film), and which would be lost if an infidel like Frank should touch him. It's all good fun, if heavily derivative. Omar Sharif, 40 years after Lawrence of Arabia, plays the Prince, once again marveling over a foreigner's ability to conquer the desert. Scenes involving quicksand and a triumphant ride along the beach after the race are obviously inspired by the former film. Viggo Mortenson, who plays Frank, rides away from an oncoming sandstorm that seems like something out of Lord of the Rings. We are constantly reminded that Hidalgo is an old horse and is injured, so he is an underdog like Seabiscuit. The wrap-around story about the fate of the Sioux is out of Dances with Wolves. Hey, they were all good films.I was a little uncomfortable with a story of an American hero showing up the Arabs, who are shown as villainous or slightly comical in light of current events. How would this play to a Middle Eastern audience? I don't know. But if you accept it as just another adventure film, it's pretty good.</fullReview>

It is the little trail less traveled; a bit longer and steeper but ultimately more gratifying to the organic senses. It is a straight forward story, told in the slant of bright light and dark shadows; of good and evil.The grit of sand on wind and blazing sun, it is the private journey of a man to become 'whole' and a celebration of the empathic kinship between man and animal. As for Viggo Mortensen, I wish him splendid success in all of his endeavors. I have always had a soft spot for the "late bloomers".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband, mother, grand-daughter, and myself all went to see Hidalgo and thoroughly enjoyed it. If you plan to see this likable film you might not want to read on as some plot spoilers appear in the next paragraphs. It's the story of a man accepting who he is and the help he gets from his new human friends and from his loyal feisty mustang named Hidalgo. Mr. Mortensen does a fantastic job in his first 'starring' role as the emotionally damaged Frank Hopkins, a dispatch long distance rider for the government. Frank has to fight his way out of the depressed and alcoholic existence he fell into after delivering a dispatch that resulted in the massacre at Wounded Knee. Somehow he feels responsible for the slaughter which sends him into a tailspin. He winds up working for a Wild West show that gives him the money to live on but not the will. During one of the shows he is challenged by an Arab man to enter the Ocean of Fire endurance race and prove his claim as the best endurance racer in the world. Encouraged to take up the challenge to enter the mother of all long distance endurance races he is financed by his friends and goes on a journey that for him is life changing as he comes to grips with the pain of denying his Indian heritage throughout his adult life. Mr. Mortensen has an expressive face and uses it to his advantage in conveying his journey into a world that is alien to him and to his horse. His charisma that makes him likable even as a villain in some of his previous movies comes through in this role in spades. He equestrian talents are awesome and who needs special effects when you witness his thrilling ride in the sand storm scene that to me (having actually been in some sand storms) looks very real. The locations are beautiful and the editing is well done. The supporting cast is effective and round out the new world that Frank Hopkins and Hidalgo enter into. The special effects are really quite good and I think people today are too nit-picky about each and every effect and are just looking for mistakes instead of just sitting back and enjoying a good tale. I can tell you this; there is no nudity, no sex (some innuendos), some rip roaring fight scenes with non-gory violence, and only a mild curse word or two. I guess for some people that makes a movie boring but to us it was great and we would recommend it to anyone who wants to take the whole family and enjoy an evening at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>because the action picks up after that.Beautiful shots throughout the movie, but they get old after the 3rd time. I understand the director was trying to show the long passing of time, but this movie did get a little long.When the action picked up, I enjoyed it. When it was slow, I darn near fell asleep.This is one of those movies where you can watch the trailer and see all the good action parts though.I'm not so sure about the based on a true story line as well either. A lot of films seem to be banking on this loosy goosey line.</fullReview>

At one point, it began to remind me of the Indiana Jones movies, so watch for the comparison. I was glad to see Viggo Mortensen as the lead character-he was wonderful! I found myself falling in love with the horse, Hidalgo (TJ). In many cases it seemed as though the horse was the star as he showed off his amazing personality. Hidalgo is not only an action packed movie, it is also a heart-felt story about a man and a horse who share an extraordinary bond. You can see that they do care for one another deeply. So take my advice and check out this movie. Like me, you may be going to see it more than once.</fullReview>

I was not very impressed with either, but frankly, Hidalgo gives me hope for JP4. Maybe he's grown as a director.Hidalgo is a beautiful tale of a washed up cowboy and his beautiful pony braving the Arabian desert and all its treacheries.Stunning visuals, uplift this beautiful work and deliver a fine finished product.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find this film thoroughly enjoyable and, given the cast and crew starring in this one, would be hard pressed not to compare it with the likes of such films as "Lawrence of Arabia". The amount and attention to detail are what separate this one from the rest. It excels in not just keeping the audience interested but in making it clear that the whole is indeed sometimes greater than the sum of it's parts. The sequences are very well laid out and provide ample indication of what the writer is trying to impart to the audience and at the same time keep him/her interested enough to remain focused on the subject matter. I read somewhere that "The race doesn't always go to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but that's the way to bet". One would be hard pressed to bet effectively against this one! Great Job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wounded Knee and American imperialism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has come under attack for being a fiction masquerading as a true story. On rewview of these criticisms, their tone suggests to me that what these critics find unpleasant is not the story of a horse race through the Sahara; although they don't say so, what they fear is the very well documented facts concerning the Massacre at Wounded Knee - presented in an honest and even-handed manner in this film - and the equally well-established desire by certain politicians in America to portray Islam as a "primitive" culture requiring immediate corrective invasion on the part of American soldiers and businesses; when, in fact, as the film shows, Moslems are a civilized people struggling to develop a civilized solution to pretty standard human failings in an environment that presents human survival itself with challenges every day.I do not care whether the autobiography of the leading character (upon which the film is based) is true, or if it were a false self-engrandisement. The larger truths presented by the film, concerning American attitudes towards Native Americans and towards Moslems, needs repeated demonstration in artistic media, regardless of source material.This film is a pretty good popularization of the real issues. Now we need in-depth exposure of the events at wounded knee, and of the recent American efforts to colonize the Mid-East.Just by the way, this film is a lot of fun; don't get the impression that it is didactic in any way, it is not. It is truly "epic" in a way few such recent efforts have succeeded at. The hero is heroic, a very noble equine, and the hero's rider is heroic too; they both act very well, in fact the whole cast turns in wonderful performances, professionally presented by an excellent production.Don't let the cranks, right or left republican, spoil this film in advance - see it and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow paced adventure flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have very high expectations on this film, but how hard could it be to make an entertaining adventure flick? Apparently, Joe Johnston, director of Jurassic Park 3, found it to be pretty hard.The film starts out with Viggo Mortensen's character Frank Hopkins with witnessing a slaughter of an Indian tribe, which is very badly edited. I felt nothing for the Indians cause it came so sudden and the tone was anti-dramatic. Not a very good start. It is later revealed he is part Indian, and a very good horse rider. He and his horse Hidalgo has won several endurance races throughout their years. The word of Hidalgo and Frank has spread across the Atlantic, to the Sheikh of Sheikhs (Omar Sharif).The Sheikh offers Frank to participate in the annual "Ocean of Fire" race, which spans 3000 miles across the Arabian desert. Frank agrees, and travels across the Atlantic to Arabia. Along the way, we find the obvious reason why this film is so ludicrous: Malcolm McDowell in a cameo! Augh! As he arrives to Arabia, he meets the Sheikh and a bunch of other characters who find the entrance of an "infidel" to be "sacrilege". Everyone tells him he will be among the first to perish in the Arabian desert. Soon after, the race starts and Frank and Hidalgo take off.In the scenes with Frank in the Arabian camp, a lot of culture clash scenes occur. Their purpose is to show that we, the US, are more civilized than the Arabians. Well, there's one scene that absolutely stuck to my mind. When Frank first arrives to the Arabian camp, he rides past a few poorly dressed people being shoved away. One of his guides says something along the lines of: "Have you ever seen a slave market before?" to which Frank responds with a kind of grimace, reminding the audiences that "No, we are the USA, home of the free.". But if this film takes place in 1890, that was only 27 years after Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery. Nice tough, Joe Johnston, better check on your history next time.The action scenes (This is an adventure film after all) are few, poor and far apart. The most enjoyable one has to be when they visit a thief market and a fight breaks out, where a kick ass Nubian rips out his sable and with some really nice swordplay defeats a handful of brigands. As with every other sympathetic character (apart from Frank, the Sheikh and his daughter) he gets shot in the stomach. I'm not kidding, almost every character in this film suffers the very same fate. It's a shame too. I wish the film would have focused on his character, instead of Viggos (not that Viggo is a bad actor, but his character is 100% 1-dimensional). Other action scenes includes: A short flight from a sandstorm, a short climactic fight with the main bad guy, a short (and poorly done) scene where the bandits attack the Arabian tent. Some really poor swordplay choreography is shown here. (I also want to add that the film is incredibly long and somewhat slow paced. Tends to get boring at times.)Now, now, not everything about this film is bad. I mean, one of the main characters is Omar Sharif. That can't be bad! He plays his usual character, sympathetic Arab who wants well (why change a winning concept?). The special effects are quite nice. I really liked the short sequence where two cat creatures attack Viggo and his friend. Some really nice animation there! The music is perhaps not James Newton Howards best, but it's pretty good. Nothing that sticks to your mind, however. Also, the ending is incredibly beautiful and brought a tear to my eye. Very touching indeed!All in all, not a very good film. But if you're a fan of Viggo, horse movies and adventure flicks, then this film is perhaps something for you. But beware, it's very long and not that action packed.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT based on a true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wanted to let everyone know that this is NOT based on a true story as is claimed. There are no records of the main character or the horse in history. If there are minor references, they are vauge and do not appear together. The biggest disappointment is that there is no 3000 year old race. That's why you had never heard of it before this movie.The only thing that may be considered true is that the Americans did slaughter the Indians, and some people felt bad about it at the time, while others did not. I don't think that this is enough to claim that movie is based on a true story. By that logic, every movie is based on a true story, no matter how diluted or unconvincing the claim may be.That is all. Just wanted to clear that up for everyone.BTW - the movie sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond just horses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the reviews I have seen about this film make comparisons to 'Seabisquit'. They referred to it as a horse movie, and that would not be totally true. While Hidalgo is the name of the horse, and the name of the movie, there are many characters and situations that go beyond simple definitions.One of the reasons that I enjoyed 'Never Cry Wolf' was its depiction of someone in extreme conditions. In that movie it was the intense cold. 'Hidalgo' shows us the opposite, a race across desert. It gives us an American (Viggo Mortensen) in a strange, alien land. I felt that I was along the journey with him.My kids enjoyed it as much as I did, but I am sure they have their own unique reasons. Great films entertain on all levels, and 'Hidalgo' certainly does. I recommend and love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a remarkable Horse Race Story-They screwed it up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caution - Spoilers They took what could have been a remarkable action - adventure story. A 3,000 mile horse race through the Arabian desert; and turned it into a silly Hollywood fantasy. - However it contains all of the elements needed to create a popular movie in today's American culture - It has the 'Noble Savage' motif - the wise old American Indians are shown as wise, honorable, long suffering and generally pacifist - their religion is superior to the 'white man's' as well; as when the hero chants in his own Sioux language for help - and it produces a turn-a-round. - A three thousand mile race of ninety nine Arabians versus one American seems like it would produce dozens of subplots of its own. But the producers choose to have the evil relative trying to take over the Top Sheiks kingdom, the abduction of his daughter and the American having to take a detour to save the Sheik's daughter in the middle of this huge race. How can the American's horse out run the bandit's horses time after time when the bandit's horses are fresh and the Hero's horse has been doing nothing but desert running for days upon days? The hero loses his gun in one scene and suddenly he has it two scenes later. The Sheik is going to castrate the hero for spending 5 minutes alone with his daughter - but later in the movie nothing is said when they spend the night together out in the desert alone ? They trade a counterfeit horse for the daughter - why did they have to take a white horse and paint it black ? Couldn't they find a black horse with the same features - come - on ! I was also surprised when the Sheik was ready to slay a traitor and the American Hero intervened to save him so that the American could torture him by placing his lasso around his neck, tying it to his horse and threatening to pull his head off. I thought torture and degradation were bad and interrogation with no threats and no physical harm - good. At least the movie ends with the freeing of hundreds of wild horses that the evil American army had captured and were going to senselessly slaughter. Letting all those horses go free - - it was just - - up lifting. It made me feel good.But I still give this movie a '3'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes...Ok...I admit it. I watched this film for Viggo. Not only Viggo, I am a 21yr old riding instructor who has been riding for 17 yrs and own 4 horses of my own.There were moments of this film which truely were great. Especially the relationship between Viggo and Hidalgo (its hearwarming to know that the bought this horse after filming, just like he did in LOTR) Its clear that he his a compassionate man who loves animals and a talented rider. The only other actor I would have liked in this role is Russell Crowe. The man has the ability to play anything and a great rider to boot.However, parts of the script seemed cliched, and just why did everyone speak english? Especially the goat herder who would most likely have had no education? Ok...I know it was so we didnt have to spend the whole film reading subtitles but hey...Also, so much happened it seemed rushed, alsmost like the when the script was being written they all sat down and said: "Right, its in a desert to there has to be a sandstorm...thats cool...and what if the Sheiks daughter gets kidnapped...great...then of course a nasty british villain...evry film needs one. Ooohhh, and lets put in bear traps and injure the horse...but he cant be lame because hes gotta win..."Thats the major point that bugged me, the great gaping wound that Hidalgo suffers yet he remains totally sound. Anyone with horses knows that the smallest puncture wound can make a horse lame let alone a 12 inch stab wound across a shoulder!But never mind, there are many more discrepancies you may find. but forget them and enjoy this film for what it it. A heart warming story with great central performances. Viggo is fantastic, as is Omar Sharrif, and enjoy the chemistry Viggo has with the horses... My vote, 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viggo Mortensen plays Frank Hopkins, the ex-Pony Express rider who made a name for himself in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show late in the nineteenth century, with his horse, (the titular animal in question). Like "Seabiscuit," don't look for much more than the Hollywood version of actual history, although Hopkins does witness the bloody injustices of the Wounded Knee massacre in the film's first dramatic scenes. Unlike the biscuit, though, the story kicks into high gear adventure when Hopkins and his horse are invited to a race across the desert (through Iraq, no less), at the behest of a Western obsessed Sheik (Omar Sharif, who, forty years on from "Lawrence of Arabia," gets to swing quite a mean sword! Go, Omar!). Along the way, there are lovely women: Zuleikha Robinson (whom we two or three fans of the short lived X-Files spinoff, "The Lone Gunmen," will remember as Yves Adele Harlow) and Louise Lombard, but it's really all about a man and his horse. Another film to adequately tide you over until the next Indiana Jones flick. In fact, maybe Spielberg would consider recasting with a certain former Aragorn.? Hey, he could knock another twenty years out of that franchise, don't you think?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long haul for the characters... and the audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So there I am, on my way to Leicester Square to see "Hidalgo," when I suddenly realise that the movie's written by John Fusco. The John Fusco who wrote "Young Guns." The John Fusco who wrote "Young Guns II." The John Fusco who wrote "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron." None of which bodes well for this latest horsey extravaganza, but by this time it's too late to turn back.And "Hidalgo" lives down to the writer's past track record; the titular horse and the rest of his four-legged brethren outact both Viggo Mortensen (as real-life endurance rider Frank Hopkins) and most of the rest of the cast, with the exception of Omar Sharif - as the sheikh involved with the deadly overland race that our hero is persuaded to enter with his beloved Mustang, he provides the movie with some genuine strength and charisma. (A far too low-key Mortensen, on the other hand, seems to have lost any presence when he went to the barber's after finishing up as Aragorn. Viggo Mortensen; the Samson of the 21st century.)Some interesting moments are all but lost throughout the two-hours-plus, and it's only occasionally rousing (mainly towards the end). But it's impossible to really see the point of the race, even allowing for the characters's regularly pointing out that Hopkins isn't part of their world; you just can't connect to the goings-on, despite writer Fusco and director Joe Johnston taking pains to underline what a sensitive, animal-friendly guy our hero is.A big expanse of not much, rather like the desert in which most of the movie takes place, I have to admit I mainly went to see this to check out the James Newton Howard score - which, not for the first time, is far better than the movie it supports.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, but sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved that movie. It had suspense, action, adventure, and friendship. Its also sad, but in a good way. Hidalgo had very good casting. Viggo Mortenson was perfect for the part he played. The direction was wonderful, and I loved that they did not name the movie after the rider, but after the horse! Why? Because most people think that we are the only worthy living creatures on earth, so its good that the people who did this movie did not put such a big emphasis on human beings. I would reccomend this to anyone unless you dont like any of these things: suspense, a bit of violence, and sadness.I would rate this movie 9/10 because Hidalgo was fantastic in every way!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a well written, wisely directed, real life adventure of a man whose life ached for peace. We can identify with his grief, understand his complexity and hunger for a healing resolution. The relationship between horse and man pulls the heart strings into a smile through out the movie. I enjoyed seeing Omar Sharif, play the loving dad, tough sheikh, noble man. Viggo Mortensen - what a guy, I think Frank Hopkins would be thrilled to know that a poet embodied his personal story and acted it out with all the passion and humor that could be communicated on a movie screen. The little stories threaded through the drama added enjoyable dimension to the pace. This is a great movie. I recommend this movie to animal lovers, cowboys and Indians, the heart broken, and dreamers of all ages.</fullReview>

It is even a family one, which is hard to find now-a-days, with no sex, no language (that I can remember) and not much violence.

		<shortDescription>It's the horse, of course</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful paint mustang horse is the star of a story about a fictional race across the Arabian desert to the sea. Viggo Mortensen plays the real life character Frank Hopkins. Whether he really did go to Arabia and race is another question. It is not important because Hopkins did long distance races all over this country and did become a champion mentor to the wild mustangs. The beautiful cinematography throughout; the great Omar Sharif playing Sheikh Riyadh; Mortenson and the Horse (which he eventually bought for his own); the fact there is no swearing, no gratuitous sex, and little blood, make for a fine 2 hours at the movies.Others have complained about the Arabs being the villians and saying that is a problem. But they are villians to their own Sheikh, because they have a younger member of the clan wanting to win at all costs in order to take over the herd of great horses that is the wealth of the clan. Another one of the tribe rides, and plots with an English woman, Lady Anne, who has her great horse in the race. She will do anything to win and even has her surrogate rider try to kill Hidalgo - in the scene that had me gasping in horror. If fact, I may even have cried out it was such a horrifying sequence.As an older woman who loves horse stories, western films, great scenery in my films, a fine music score - and great looking men, I was satisfied and got my matinee moneys worth! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very exciting, enjoyable and satisfying film, whether or not the story it is based on is "true." Having read both sides of the story, so to speak, I have concluded that the real Frank T. Hopkins was not guilty of a hoax in writing about Hidalgo, but certainly could tell a great big, wide-open tale. And the movie brings it all to life. The acting is wonderful, especially the male bonding chemistry between Viggo Mortensen and Omar Sharif. My husband, who is a farrier, enjoyed the film very much, even though he always notices when a film changes horses, such as those that are used for Hidalgo, in every scene. And feels that he was sure Hidalgo had shoes on when Hopkins let him go at the end. That would not be a good idea to let a good horse go into the wild with shoes on; it's dangerous and could get the horse hurt.</fullReview>

This is just a fun movie and who cares whether it's a true story or not. It's a good story about a man looking for something worthwhile in himself. Viggo Mortensen rocks and he is still THE KING! His screen presence is captivating whether the material is believable or not. He makes it believable. He even does his own stunts in this movie. The horse is great too. There's no swearing and lots of engrossing action and Viggo is marvelous as a soft-spoken cowboy who cares about his horse. It's entertaining and isn't that, after all, the point of movies.

		<fullReview>Whatever you were expecting when you walked into the movie theatre you might as well throw it out with the styrofoam popcorn. If you've read the numerous lackluster reviews of Hidalgo and thought it wasn't worth it to see this film, I have one word for you: GO!WHY? You ask... 'Cuz they were dead wrong for starters...Hidalgo is a throwback to how they used to make films. There's a story, a few subplots and some good 'ol fashion guns and punching someone's lights out. The movie was well paced. I wasn't sure if I could sit through 2 and half hours of horses, but the movie was over before I was even settled into my seat. There aren't 100 million dollars worth of flashy special effects nor huge explosions and pretty images floating around the screen. If you enjoy beautiful vistas, edge of your seat action and good classic movies then this season Hidalgo's your best bet.Viggo Mortensen proves that he doesn't just play a king in the movies, he IS the king. From the moment he appears on the screen till the credits roll he oozes the masculinity of a John Wayne and the charisma and humor (and let's not forget the eyes to match) Paul Newman in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The man carries the film and in doing so proves that he can be a leading man with a sword or his horse. I'll warn you though, if you go into Hidalgo thinking you're going to get The Lord of the Rings then yes, you're going to be disappointed. It doesn't even come close. Don't let Barry Bonds fool you however, you can't hit a homerun every time at the plate. A double into center driving in two runs is just as good though! And this movie is the series clincher. That being said, Viggo Mortensen does bring one thing from his role as Aragorn. He still has the juice to make you believe in the character. When he's singing the song of his people out in the desert at a pivotal point in the film, your heart aches for him. You can care about this guy and you'll want to see him win. You'll even want to bring him home for dinner. Indeed, Viggo is the shining the star.It's not to say that the rest of the cast is horrible, quite the contrary. Omar Sharif was brilliant and lovable in his own right as the Sheikh. The rest of the cast did exactly what it was supposed to. They supported the film and filled out it's bones. There are no standout performances but not every film needs nor should have them. They gave steady performances and enhanced the overall feel of the story.As wonderful as it is, there are some cons to this movie. The story isn't wonderful, the writing only adequate and the development leaves a little to be desired. There are a few subplots that should be fleshier if they are important or left out entirely and some were essential I believe in order to enhance film. It's not all that imaginitive and yes, it is predictible. You have to remember that this is NOT a thriller, however. There are also some definite stereotypes that yes, in this day and age might be a little perhaps insensitive, but one must also remember that it was set in 1890 not 2004. The overuse of the word 'infidels' and the Arabic views of The American might make you cringe, but unfortunately then, and perhaps even now the words ring true of their feelings. And not just of Arabs. We all are guilty of arrogance. The truth does sting a bit, but you cannot deny it. There are times that Viggo mutters his lines in the cowboy fashion he was going for and that can be irritating not being sure of what he said but doesn't take much from the film.It is also extremely important to not get caught up in the 'based on a true story' tagline. If you go in with any knowledge of the supposed story you'll miss the movie and what's the point in wasting 8 bucks if you're not going to let the work stand on it own regardless of the stigma attatched. Remember, it's BASED on a true story not a RECREATION.All in all, my recommendation is to go see this film. It's a good Sunday afternoon movie with the family that reminds us that when we accept and believe in ourselves; the impossible can happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It makes you think! That's what I liked about it. I went in thinking it was going to be a feel-good overcoming-obstacles-against-great-odds kind of a film. I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. There's no other way to explain it. I'm glad I went to see it (even if it was alone -- I saw this and my dad went to see Passion [I could care less- I want to see Passion, but not in a movie theater (I despise a movie filled with sub-titles.)]) and I'll see it again (this time, dragging my family with me). I sat through the entire film and I loved the part at the end when he calls onto the ancestors for help. At that time, I think he finally comes to grip with who he really is. I'm glad I went because the old stereo-type that I had about the COWBOY (blonde, rugged, western white-male who is superior to all other ethnic backgrounds and boasts his superiority) has finally been destroyed from my mind. The best part, and most astonishing, is that this came from Disney!!!!???!!!! DISNEY CAN THINK!!!!!! Oh my gosh! Whoa! Since its been a long rebellion of mine to despise all westerns, I can't bring myself to do that with this film. My appreciation of the actor who played Aragorn so well that he made me believe (like all others in that Epic Classic of a Trilogy) all this might have happened at some time, somewhere, might have been my one reason in going to see the film, but it wasn't my only reason. My second reason was the fact that it was being televised as a True Story (for some reason, True Stories speak to me more than fictionalized ones) - although I've found out from most of the reviews and interviews I've read that a lot was embellished. Being of Indian background (I'm not Native) this film speaks to me, which I've always held as a good basis for my enjoyment of any film and I've watched quite a few (tasteful ones and then there are the latter). Then again, I also loved A.I. whereas everyone else around me said it sucked. Well, Hidalgo is on its own now, in the hands of movie-goers everywhere, and I wish it the best of luck (HATS OFF -- Pun intended) because the movie deserves it. The film deserves to be seen, experienced and understood (it might just help draw an end to a lot of the ignorance going around about different cultures and customs -- wouldn't that be great. Then again, I'm an idealist at heart and I think World Peace is possible.) and appreciated for what it tries to remind us all about and not force it down our throats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night at a sneak preview, and can't really say I was dissapointed because I didn't go into it expecting anything and it was free.Viggo's acting was adequate, although nothing that blows you away. Some people have said the horse's personality is so great, but everytime they want to show the horse "thinking" or "saying" something they just cut to a shot of him raising his head. I'm not saying there is really a better way to show a horse expressing anything to a human, but it's nothing spectacular or all that charming.As for the story, since it is based on a real life and actual events it is kind of cool to peak into the lives of the people who went on this amazing race. Still, an underdog that nobody thinks will win with some bad guys trying to do things (like hurt the horse) to stop him when it looks like he might win is absolutely nothing new, and this story has no surprises.I can't really recommend this film unless it is playing at a local dollar theatre and you don't have much else to do. It is definately not worth eight dollars, but for a buck there were a couple good scenes of unintentional comedy and some pretty good race scenes.</fullReview>

Viggo is a natural with a horse and looks good in the saddle. This movie may not have any deep meaningful plot but it entertains and thats what most of us want. We cheered when Frank and Hidalgo came in first at that race. The horses were beautiful and so is Mr. Mortensen. I would like to see him in more westerns in the future. He is very multi-talented and can play just about anything from the devil (in prophesy) Aragorn in Lord Of The Rings to Frank in Hidalgo. Also the wild horses must be saved and this show conveys that message very well. I rate this movie a 10!</fullReview>

This was a take off on the old Arabian nights stories of the 40's and 50's. The special effects were very good and especially the sand storm that hit mid picture. The female villain was expected as well as the bit players that were there to sabotage the win by our hero. This one can wait for the video store. Save your price of admission as this one can readily wait for you to go to the video store.

Its importance as a film is chiefly in giving Viggo Mortensen the experience of playing a cowboy -- experience that he would later put to good use in Appaloosa.Mortensen plays Frank Hopkins, a former Pony Express courier, turned Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show actor, turned long distance horse racer in the Ocean of Fire--a 3,000 mile survival race across the Arabian desert. Hopkins and his mustang horse, Hidalgo, are racing against Arabian thoroughbreds, but might as well have been competing with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse since the plot throws up all manner of unlikely obstacles and dastardly villains for them to overcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather far-fetched version of an alleged true story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hidalgo claims of itself that it is based on a true story, but in reality it merely takes the skeleton of a true story and fleshes it out with a great deal of romanticised, far-fetched narrative trimmings. The cinematography is the film's strong point, with some genuinely excellent lensing of the American West and Arabian locations (Morocco standing in for 19th Century Arabia, Iraq and Syria). In other departments, the film is a somewhat average-or-worse affair. The script is full of clichés; the acting is quite lazy; and the outcome is predictable from the very beginning.Long distance horse rider Frank T. Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) is famed for winning countless long distance races aboard his trusted mustang Hidalgo. Frank, the son of a cavalry soldier and a Red Indian woman, is traumatised after witnessing the massacre of unarmed Sioux Indians at Wounded Knee, so he retreats into a downward spiral of alcoholism while touring the USA with a rather degrading and historically-distorted Wild West Show. A shot at redemption comes Frank's way when he is challenged to enter the "Ocean Of Fire" race in Arabia. Upset by claims that Hidalgo is the greatest long distance race horse in the world, Arab Sheikh Riyadh (Omar Sharif) has decided to invite Frank and his mustang to compete in the gruelling 3000 mile desert endurance test against Arabia's finest thoroughbred horses and riders. The race is so dangerous that half the entrants will not survive, becoming lost in the unforgiving desert, or swallowed up by quicksand, or swept into oblivion by sudden and devastating sandstorms. Not merely endangered by the race itself, Frank and Hidalgo also face the hatred of fellow riders (unhappy about the presence of this foreigner in their midst); treachery from Anne Davenport (Louise Lombard), an English lady with ulterior motives for seeing her own horse win the race; and the unwanted advances of Jazira (Zuleikha Robinson), the sheikh's tempestuous daughter who is desperate for Hidalgo to win to spare her from an undignified marriage to the race favourite, an Arab prince with four wives already.Hidalgo certainly looks as if it has been put together at considerable expense, with lots of large-scale set pieces, and difficult but authentic location work (indeed, the DVD version features a documentary entitled Sand &amp; Celluloid which shows how challenging it was for film-makers to shoot in the desert). But the problems, as mentioned, rather overwhelm the film's strengths. For example, in the film's final moments Hidalgo is seriously wounded by a spear and Frank is all set to shoot the horse to put it out of its pain. But when he realises how close they are to the end, Frank puts away his gun and rides Hidalgo at full gallop to the finish line (passing two perfectly healthy stallions in the process!!) It's a pitifully unrealistic sequence, not to mention an over-used Hollywood cliché - just how often have we seen the heroes on the brink of giving up reviving themselves in time for a rousing finale? Mortensen's performance is incredibly detached, almost as if he has been blackmailed into appearing in the film and cannot be bothered to hide his irritation. I enjoyed him in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy but here he is a blank and unenthusiastic participant. All in all, Hidalgo is a bit of a let-down. Not a total bomb, but definitely not as interesting or intriguing as it should've been. I'd stick with Bite The Bullet, which has a similar story but is a whole lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excruciatingly awful start gives way to a highly enjoyable little picture as real-life pony express rider Frank Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy fame) enters a race with the titled horse in 1890 Arabia. Of course the elements and constant trouble from other riders and deviant characters (led primarily by British aristocrat Louise Lombard) make the race one for survival rather than just victory. Great visual cinematography of exotic desert lands and pronounced, but not loud special effects make the picture a real joy to behold. Omar Sharif is excellent (as he always is for the most part) as a mysterious Sheikh who ends up being the unlikeliest of allies to Mortensen. Malcolm McDowell and C. Thomas Howell appear in short cameos. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I've spent time in a large script engineering lab. That's where they confabulate something like this.Start with a timely notion: a noble American in Iraq, employing honest grit and will in the face of Islamic fate and goofy beliefs. But this must be a true American, so make him half Indian. That way he can also be of a `people of the hoof.'Then triangulate among three formulas: `Lawrence of Arabia' so you can be cinematic with sand (and even reanimate Sharif); `Seabiscuit' which takes the theme of the little mongrel horse up against `purebloods' (here transformed from the `liberal' politic of the original to `conservative'); and `Last Samurai' so we can borrow the drunk who carries the guilt of an Indian massacre to a dead life in a wild west show.Triangulation is unfortunately a standard in these recipes. Then season with a couple women, a couple villains (better if they overlap), some parental conflict, some effects and a few other standard mechanisms. Then cook and promote.I do willingly enter the theater expecting to be manipulated, and yes for profit. But there's something intolerably crass about this sort of mechanical button-pressing.There was some extra story about the hawk saving the day at the end: more not quite subliminal reference to Bush. But test audiences took it out. Good for them.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

Alas, the movie's opening 15 minutes or so are nearly identical to the opening of The Last Samurai, including Frank Hopkins' predictable alcoholic response. Do cowboys ever do anything but feel guilty, get drunk and become hucksters?But it's when we get to Arabia that the film really loses it for me because all of the Arabs are portrayed at best as cliches (yes, even Omar Sharif's character), and at worst as racist caricatures, including the puerile attitude toward Islam.Sadly, with very little effort the film could have just as easily developed real characters and then the horse would have had something to work with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was younger, and first got into seeing movies seriously in theatres, Lord Of The Rings was a huge thing. Every actor in it was scrutinized and put on a pedestal of worship by myself and peers whose passion lay in film. Many of the actors in that trilogy were for us at a young age relatively unknown, prompting strict attention as to what their further ventures beyond Middle Earth would be. Viggo Mortensen, being one of the stars of the show in LOTR, was naturally under my burgeoning cinematic microscope and therefore I was eager to rush out and see whatever else he did during and post Aragon. That's what led me to Hidalgo, a rousing western adventure about aging cowboy Frank T. Hopkins, who takes his beloved wild mustang hidalgo for one last race, aptly named the Ocean Of Fire. It's a brutal slow through hundreds of miles of hellish desert situated in the Syrian gulf and on through Damascus, with every earthly obstacle imaginable chomping at his spurs. Hopkins is a shadow of his former racing glory and enters the contest as a last ditch effort to rekindle dimming glory, and at the request of a wealthy sheik (always nice to see Omar Sharif) whose interest has been piqued by Frank's infamy. And so he enters, not quite knowing what fresh hell he is in for, and the movie takes off into pure joyous escapism. Mortensen already proved with LOTR that he makes an iron solid hero, and here he dons the cloak of rugged underdog with equal fire and brimstone. The photography starts in magisterial Montana and moves to the scorched beauty of the Arabian desert as he and hidalgo hurl themselves into the challenge of both their lifetimes in attempt to win gold and glory. Along the way he encounters many obstacles including bandits, plagues, the mother of all sandstorms and the sheik's gorgeous daughter Jazira (Zuleikha Robinson, excellent). There's nice supporting work from Louise Lombard, C. Thomas Howell, J.K. Simmons and a sly cameo from Malcolm McDowell. It's old school adventure done right, with dazzling scenery and a pillar of a lead performance from Mortensen.</fullReview>

We expect to see the likes of Viggo Mortensen in roles such as these: confident, rugged men atop steeds and pretty handy in conflict; a post-Aragorn role for someone who seeks adventure and isn't the man to panic in the face of danger. But come the end of the film, we're surprised at how well he's done NOT to look like his "Carlito's Way" character; a tired, withered man beaten up by life and the absurd challenges he decided to take on therein it. In a directorial sense, this meek 2004 action/romance hybrid is precisely the sort of episodic nonsense we've come to expect from director Joe Johnston, the man responsible for the likes of Jumanji and Jurassic Park III, but here running out of luck with an often excruciated, almost certainly overly long, race film about respectable Westerners heading off to the untamed Arab world to prove his superiority.Viggo Mortensen plays Frank Hopkins, a Sioux Native American with the most un Sioux-like of names. He is a long distance rider/racer in this, the 1890s; a man who's attained fame for such things out of his skills in being a courier during the wars between indigenous Native Americans and white, European invaders. With his horse, the titular Hidalgo, they form what is considered the greatest long distance riding partnership of all time. They're racing on the American frontier in the very first scene, Hopkins established as a man unafraid of gamesmanship if it means winning against an arrogant rival; a man who's able to saddle up in the face of adversity before charging on ahead and pulling off a sensational win versus someone who was assured of victory. With a strong tie to his horse, cool in conflict and a hard bodied characteristic to boot, Hopkins is your man.Burying the pain of a massacre bestowed upon his people some years ago, and away from being in his element on the race circuit, Hopkins bites his lip and works with his horse on a cheesy, politically incorrect stage show ? one that is tacky and phony on top of the fact it talks down Native American Indians. A release arrives in the form of a chubby, arrogant Arab who's over from the Middle East with his aides, one of whom looks suspiciously like that sinister looking chap decked out in black from Raiders of the Lost Ark, to lay down to Hopkins the challenge of competing in his annual endurance race having observed the title bestowed upon Hopkins and Hidalgo that they are "the world's greatest distance horse and rider". The race itself is across a few thousand miles in the searing desert heat, a grueling contest against some of the best long distance riders in the world; most of whom will be locals feeding off the home advantage.Accepting, Hopkins suddenly finds himself in the firing line of slurs; intimidation and that of being demeaned when amongst these established racers, people who find the presence of this American and his show pony about to undertake this endurance race quite amusing. Before anything along these racing lines actually begins, Johnston bogs us down with a sub-plot involving the race organiser's daughter, Jazira (Robinson), and the fact that he who wins the race will have her as his wife. This, of course, relegates the lone female presence is relegated to that of being a prize awaiting the champion - although, this IS the Arab world circa. the late nineteenth century, so should the film be pulled up on its gender politics, or indeed hailed as a realistic depiction of hardships in a specific place at a specific time. Since the film has zero faith in the race itself being a dramatic enough entity, one of the local Arabic riders partaking in the race wants Jazira himself anyway, champion or otherwise. This will, of course, induce the later required conflict. To an extent, you cannot blame the film for such an approach; previous pieces of its ilk, such as Rat Race or The Cannonball Run, have called upon comedy to see it through its racing segments so as to keep us occupied. Hidalgo likes to think it's based on true events, and heading down the comedic passage would be, you would think, detrimental to the legacy of they who it is that's being depicted.The race itself is a curiosity, a contest wherein the participants ferociously duke it out over first place during the very early stages of the competition before all catching up with each other anyway come the evening when they arrive at a checkpoint. As things roll on, we're left sitting there waiting for some sort of sabotage to rear up, some kind of cheating ? sure enough, there is. Then, there's a sandstorm; also, a rivalry with a British trainer rears up, but oddly enough they do not suffer the resentment from the Arab hosts that our lead does in spite of the fact they're pompous and Western and female. Even though there is fierce racing across great distances, the likes of this trainer magically appear at the next rest stop ready to give Hopkins more verbal grief ? but how did they get there so quickly? The earlier nonsense to do with Jazira and the suitors she desires; those who desire her and those of whom her father would like her to marry, rear up on cue and cause the film to just come across as a completely different entity. The horse is too anthropomorphic; the film is no fun and to keep yourself occupied, you have to wonder just what in the world it was that those behind this were thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man and horse as mutual metaphors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>However far-fetched this ripping yarn may be, it is undeniably clever, moving and enjoyable. Other reviewers for this have missed the key point, that the hero's horse is a brilliant metaphor of himself. Hidalgo is a tongue-in-cheek reference to a Spanish aristocratic naming convention, meaning 'The son of', while Mustang is most likely ultimately etymologically tied to the Latin word for 'mixed'. Both rider and horse are half-breeds, taking on the finest Arabian thoroughbreds. I watched this film with a class full of Saudi male students of English. Apart from the whiskey, there was nothing I felt to be too strong for Islamic conventions here. The students were charmed by the classical Arabic of Omar Sharif, and the respect shown by the hero for the Arab world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film promises to be entertaining and captivating given its unusual subject of an American cowboy racing in the Arabian desert at the end of the 19th century. Apart from the controversy surrounding the idea of the film, i.e. whether it's really based on a true story, the film is poor in every respect. From the start it is clear that no respect for history, geography or cultural accuracy has been attempted - it is just assumed that no one watching will really know anything about that time... The film focuses so much on the calamities besieging the hero, that it delivers very little other than sequences of scenes. The hero is miscast; it is hard to think that Disney could not find an American actor to play Hopkins; Mortensen spends the film trying so hard to be American that he forgets to act the part he's asked to play. You never connect with the story, or the hero, you never sense any connection between him and his mustang. The clichés abound and there is no point rooting for him anyway you know what's going to happen. This is just another cookie-cutter 'adventure' film with lots of special effects (but some great desert shots), another missed opportunity to make a story interesting and relevant with so many potential themes here, from American Indians,the presence of the British in Arabia, the(anti-?) hero himself and his motives. Can't really think of why anyone should spend time watching this film (seen on TV).</fullReview>

This is a pretty difficult film to dislike. 20 bucks says every negative review talks about cliché's and predictability. You'd have to be an idiot to rate this film under 5, and the 6.6 rating here is a terrible barometer as to this films' quality. It may make you cry, but will definitely make you smile.Those that are looking for something different or original won't want to like this film, but they won't have a choice.Delivers!

		<fullReview>THIS is why we go to the movies! Whether fact or fiction, this is an amazing story and an expertly made motion picture. It's a many layered tale, with rich characterizations, telling of multiple cultures involved in a fabled race. Superb cinematography throughout, with awesome scenery, sumptuous costumes, magnificent horses, gorgeous actors, etc, etc... It held my interest from beginning to end. It's not a traditional western in the sense that it does not take place only in the American west. Yet, it is a western in character. The added dimension of the Arabian desert makes for an even more spectacular and adventurous story. While it may be too intense for very young children, I'd still say it's good for all ages, as it is culturally educational as well as spectacular to watch. I highly recommend it, especially if you have a big screen TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta say that I liked this much better than "Seabiscuit", but "Seabiscuit" was a very good movie. "Hidalgo" is based on a true story of Frank T. Hopkins and his beloved horse, Hidalgo, a wild Spanish mustang. The film has much to enjoy: great adventure, intrigue, wild west history and the differences between the horse culture of Arabia and the horse culture of the American Indian. It is beautifully filmed in Morocco (subbing for Aden, Iran and Syria) and has a terrific James Newton Howard music score. Hidalgo, a brown and white pinto has won many long distance races with Frank Hopkins all over North America. He ends up in the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show touring the world and is billed as the fastest race horse in the world. In London an Arab Sheikh challenges that title as he owns a renowned Arabian horse who has won an annual race from Aden to Syria for many years. Thus begins a great, grueling journey across the deserts of Arabia, where all sorts of dangerous obstacles stand between Frank and Hidalgo and the finish line. Being a true story, I wonder just how much is true and how much is artistic license. No matter, this is a very entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really good movie. The acting is well done, beautiful horses, beautiful scenery (and Viggo Mortensen :D). This is definitely one of my favourite movies. I must admit, the first time I saw the preview, I was a bit skeptical. I thought it would be boring, but I was wrong. It is a bit gruesome in parts, like when Frank is taking the spear out of Hidalgo. (Hidalgo is fine later) But there are also some really funny moments, like when Yusef says "Men go mad" and Frank's reply is "I can see that" I can't believe that this movie has a 6.6 rating, in my opinion it should have about a 7.5- 8.7 rating. I highly recommend this movie. *Please note, parents, that there are some gruesome moments. Any child older than nine would probably be okay with the gruesome moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hidalgo when realised was a movie that I did not look at and I partially blamed the way that the movie was handled. However when I found out hat Omar Sharif was in it I decided to check it out. From the trailers it looked like a fun movie. However aside from Omar Sharif who I thought was brilliant , Hidalgo its-self was a study of 2 very different cultures aside from the Western world. It brought back Arabia to its times of being enchanted rather than the time warn terrorist place it has been turned into. The action is consistent it is fast paced , and it also has amusing moments of comedy. My only concern with this movie is that it might drag on a little bit too much in places with make it a little longer than it should be , it also feels slight rushed and crammed up in places and the historical accuracy might also be questioned but then this is Hollywood we are talking about. Viggo Mortison was great, along with the likes of Zulkhia and J.K Simmons were great. To some it up, Hidalgo was one of the best adventure movies I have seen in a long time. It is an adventure worth watching and only the ones who make the effort to watch can truly appreciate the fact that why this movie is vastly over rated.HIDALGO : 8.6 0UT OF 10THE TRUE STORY OF A MAN WHO WENT HALF WAY ROUND THE WORLD TO FIND HIM-SELF...</fullReview>

I am a great western fan and so anything that has a cowboy and his horse is fine by me. This was cowboy and his horse meets Arabia. The main story is about a race in Arabia, but this is just too simple a line to say, there are stories in and around the race. The film keeps your interest from the start to the end, and is just pure entertainment. No swearing, no violence, well there are the usual gunfights but no undue violence. It is the kind of film that you can watch over and over again. The acting was great from all who took part, Omar Sharif, well what can I say, he can recite a telephone directory and still make it sound interesting. The setting of the film was perfect as well. I can honestly find nothing wrong with this film and would recommend everyone to watch it. I have given the film 10 0ut of 10 but only because thats as high as it can go, really I would like to give 20+.</fullReview>

This film shows how great this wonderful animal is and the great love between a man and his Mustang, "Hidalgo". Viggo Mortensen,(Frank Hopkins) is a Cowboy who loves to race his Mustang Hidalgo and take on a challenge to race his horse against Sheikh Riyadh, (Omar Sharif) with his horse across the Arabian Desert and many other horses he has to content with in this very long race against desert conditions and many obstacles along the sandy path. There are a few gals in this picture and the only one that Frank Hopkins likes is Jozira, (Zuleikha Robinson) who cheers her Viggo all the way. There is a great scene in this film when thousands of horses are released into the country side and a great Mustang follows after them. Nice film, and great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank (Viggo Mortensen) is a half Native American rider in Buffalo Bill's traveling show some one hundred years ago. Frank was a witness to an Indian massacre at Wounded Knee, among other injustices to Native Americans, and he now drinks too much in an attempt to forget the pain. His wonderful mustang horse, Hidalgo, saves him time and again as they perform in the circus tents. One night, an Arab gentleman congratulates Frank and Hildalgo on their victories in several endurance races on the plains but insists that the duo can not truly brag until they have entered and won a legendary race in Arabia. With monetary support from colleagues, Frank and Hidalgo go overseas and enter the contest, which begins in the deserts of Iraq and ends in Damascus. Can these two American champions truly compete with some of the best horses and riders in the world? Then, too, a rich Arab gentleman (Omar Sharif) has promised his daughter in marriage to a man who already has four wives. However, if Frank and Hidalgo win the race, this marital agreement is null and void. With sandstorms, outlaws, and sink holes along the way, is it too much to hope that Frank and Hildalgo will be victorious? This is a great and very exciting adventure movie, done in grand style. From the look of the film, no expense was spared, from the sweeping cinematography to the costumes to the amazing horses and riders. Mortensen is wonderful as the mixed-heritage rider whose heart is almost as big as that of his tremendous horse, Hildalgo. What a pleasure, also, to see Sharif in a role that was made to order for his great talents and nationality. The rest of the cast, despite their lack of fame, is very fine indeed. If you wish to present your loved ones with a family film that is the essence of great movie making, here is the flick for you. Despite its somewhat lengthy running time, this motion picture will enthrall viewers, from eight to eighty, in a big, big way.</fullReview>

May be be rated poorly because of anti-Arab sentiment. Get over it and experience a noble movie. This movie has beautiful cinematography and the acting is solid. If you like horses at all you will be drawn in from the beginning and held spellbound throughout. If you like westerns, this is a western that takes place in the Arabian desert. The main weaknesses of this film are the poor choices of western clichés. The race finish is just a tad predicable as well. The fact that the story is based on a true-life character, Frank Hopkins, is just icing on the cake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was an excellent movie. Viggo Mortensen did a fabulous job. The horse he rode(TJ) played his part really well. When ever I watch it I want to go to Windy Knoll Farm and ride Rocky(my favorite horse to ride)! I found it very refreshing to see an American(Frank Hopkins) befriend the Arabian Sheik and his daughter. Also, I found it very interesting that Hopkins (Mortensen) hid the fact that he was part Indian. Though in the end he accepts his people (the Indians) and is able to win the race. This is one of those stories where the underdog(Frank and Hidalgo) beat all odds. Anyone who is a horse lover and a Viggo Mortensen fan should watch this movie. The Ocean Fire, a 3,000 mile race, is very thrilling! It's filled with excitement! During the race, Hopkins has to go through a storm of locust, survive a sandstorm, outrun people who wished his horse dead and him out of the race, save the Sheik's daughter, and WIN! The Sioux in this movie is very intriguing. It makes me want to learn the language. Mortensen did great with the Sioux. The stunts are absolutely amazing. When everything (the languages, the stunts, the actors, the special effects, and more) comes together in this movie, the result? A terrific film that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat 'till the end of it. The last scene, where Frank lets Hidalgo go, is a nice touch on the directors part. Especially when Frank says,"Let 'er buck." one last time to Hidalgo. It's very touching.This is definitely a movie worth watching. Especially with the family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think of this movie as Hollywood's gift to the Administration at a very crucial moment, while at the same time capturing the enchantment of the moribund western genre. Our hero, Viggo, is the epitome of the American hero, polite, deferential, unassuming, but proud, confident (but not violent!) not so much of his powers, as the power of the Mustang, the wild western/Spanish horse that is currently being captured by the Department of the Interior/ Bureau of Land Management to be sold as animal food, or to European horse- flesh eating markets. His opponents are perfidious and either Muslim or European. Sound familiar? Nevertheless it's a very beautiful movie, because the desert is always beautiful, and horses are elegant,beautiful animals. But keep in mind, as you watch, what it's really about.The 'special features' information revealing the fact that there were 5 Hidalgos carefully made up (with non-poisonous make-up) to replace each other is comforting in the context of animal abuse. It's also the best things about DVDs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hidalgo stars Viggo Mortensen and is directed by Joe Johnson. I think we all know who Viggo is... Well in this movie, he stars as Frank Hopkins, a horse racer not as the Aragorn. Either way, the king has returned.Viggo Mortensen plays a solid role as Frank Hopkins, who gets in a famous horse race in the Middle East. Now it's just him, Hidalgo his horse, and his fellow Americans cheering him on. Him and Hidalgo enter the race for pride and money. They go through many courses and perils while making allies and enemies. It's a fun adventure and Viggo leads an exciting movie with many tones. Sometimes you don't know what genre would fit it best though. It's funny, it's action-packed, it's dramatic but that's the problem.Overall, Hidalgo still is a solid movie and the King delivers. If you like horses, give it a shot in your DVD player. If you like action, give it a shot. If you liked TLotR, watch this. I just can't picture anyone human who didn't like the trilogy but if you didn't stay away, inhuman beast. Joking aside, you'll enjoy this movie and get some kicks out of it. It's worth to watch once or twice so give it a whirl. I know I liked it, did you?My Rating: 7.5/10 (A Low 7.5)Eliason A.</fullReview>

The funny part is that as usual the only good heroic black guy gets killed.In 20 years this movie will look as stupid and prejudiced as those old Tarzan movies where the dumb African tribes wearing war paints and cooking humans in a cauldron are abused by Tarzan and some evil money hungry white colonialist hunting rare animals.Besides that it's got decent action, though not gripping enough IMHO, but nice scenery and CGI.The panther CGI was pretty good, but will take another 2~3 years of R&amp;D to make CGI characters really lifelike. They reused the sand storms of The Mummy and the boats of Titanic :)It's nice to see a good IL'American middle class mustang beat the crap out of those noble arabian studs, and be recognized but the highest power as heroic and worthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i did not like this film, i made fun of it the whole time. i thought the storyline was ridiculous (and they don't even know if it really happened in the first place) and the acting was horrible. viggo's lips were chapped the entire time and i just wanted to attack him with lip balm. i hated the woman as she was way too dramatic and i think viggo's character would have deserved to have been circumsized. also WTF kind of punishment is that? how can you show a scene like that, with an old man dying to cut off another man's testicles with another man injecting random questions about some cowboy and not find it hilariously funny?the only thing i liked about this movie were the horses. gorgeous! two thumbs up for the horses. it would have been better if it was just about them and there were no actors in it, frankly. don't see this movie you'll be wasting two hours of your life.oh yeah and the "christian woman" was a retard, they could have redeemed the entire movie if they had killed her in the end and taken away her stupid hat, geez.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accurate Schmaccurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually don't add my two cents to movies with as many reviews as this film has generated and while I will drop those two cents in a moment I want to address a recurring irritation I've seen expressed over and over with films "based on a true story".These films, like this one, often get slammed for historical inaccuracies. Aren't all films fiction? No matter how historically accurate they attempt to be they are ultimately actors giving their "take" on actual persons and writers imagining how these historical characters thought and acted and reacted in little moments in history and directors re-creating history as they envision it.A historical argument regarding a film is one subject but I don't see how a fictionalization of a "true story" can be docked, regarding entertainment value, because it bent the truth to create a work of entertainment.I think, in a preface to Goldman's screenplay for "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" the author, or someone, made the statement; "not that it matters, but most of what follows is true". That tells me that those incidents and dates that are verifiable are in the film and the balance in invented from whole cloth which, no matter how historically accurate it is, it remains a work of fiction.Hidalgo is based on a true story. That doesn't mean it presents itself as a true story, or even tried to keep itself as close to the truth as possible. The "true story" thing is akin to the other disclaimer "inspired by real events".Documentaries are true stories and real events.I asked of Hidalgo, as I do all the films I see, that it touch me in some way or in multiple ways, so that when it is over, I am glad I spent my time watching it. Storytelling is built into our ancient ancestry, movies are the modern version of someone spinning yarns around a campfire.My two cents; Hidalgo delivered. It entertained. It made me feel good to have seen it. All the elements that moved all the other contributers to reviews of this movie, moved me as well.It will go into my DVD collection though I fully know its relationship to the truth is fragile and whispy. It was a good, solid film, with lots of rewards for movie-folks in lots of categories.My favorite element; the human/animal bond. I had a horse in my youth (my first method of transportation) and shared most of my years since with canines. The human/animal bond thing is very real and very strong and sometimes kind of spooky.This is a very good movie. Likely inaccurate which leads me to paraphrase a very great screenwriter "Not that it matters, but most of what follows is made up".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Speedy but not pedigree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 19th century, a half-native half-American man ruled the open plains with his mustang horse, Hidalgo. They were a legendary team galloping over the wild west plains and leaving their opponents in the dust.Hidalgo's rider never gave in to a challenge and always stood up to the right cause with some good IL' western hospitality. Who is this magic man? Viggo Mortenson with a cowboy hat.When Frank Hopkins (Aragorn...I mean, Mortenson) and Hidalgo are out casted from their once glorious lifestyle, they decide to take the ride of a lifetime and race in the 'Ocean of Fire': a hellishly long race across the Middle-Eastern desert, from Arabia to Damascas. Frank enters the race but he faces a very big problem: un-pedigreed horses in classy races are heavily frowned upon and Frank ain't making many friends since his horse is a mustang. Despite this major setback, Frank gives the race a shot and rides his best to glory."Hidalgo" would've been a great movie if it stayed to the storyline. While one will expect misadventures for the characters on their journey, the movie has many subplots that keep one impatient. The most obvious one is this doozy: A royal's daughter is kidnapped by some wild riders who will agree to give her back unless they receive the horse Al-Mataal, the purest, wildest, most beautiful horse in the Middle-East. They also seek a special horse breeding journal (stay with me) that carefully explains how to breed the most perfect race horses. Not only that, but (forget her name but the locals call her "Christian Lady") insists that her mare and rider win the race or they loose they're honour. Got that? Quick! Tell me what the original plot was!I'll give "Hidalgo" 6/10. Certainly a disappointment but still worthy of a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mortensen shows his experience in Hidalgo.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to disagree with the person, who said that Mortensen was acting poorly because he acted tired. I too have experience riding. Most every person who rides is tired afterwards because you have to use a lot of muscles, especially in your legs. First you have to learn to keep your self from bouncing in the saddle. That takes experience and practice. Plus you use your leg muscles to send messages to the horse. Whoever thinks that you aren't tired afterwards must not have much experience with riding. Mortensen is a good actor, plus if you watched behind the scenes special on Lord of the Rings you would know that he has had plenty of riding experience. He probably knows exactly how it feels after riding all day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Hidalgo several weeks ago, but it is still quite clear in my mind (or at least the main points). I went to see Hidalgo for reasons that are two-fold. The first is I'm a Viggo Mortensen fan since he played Aragorn in LOTR, and the second is it had horses in it. I nearly ripped my families arms off to get there when I found that the horse was a paint like mine.I sat down in the theater and was what I considered completely open to the movie, and whatever it might bring. The movie was absolutely fantastic. I was especially moved by Frank (Mortensen) and Hidalgo's (TJ) open, honest, and obviously loving relationship. It is at the heart of the movie for me, and everything else (scenery, plot development, etc.) is icing on the cake.If you like a character movie, or a movie with significant human-horse bonding this is you movie. It already has a place on my DVD self, and I hope yours as well. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little disappointed - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I must say that I went to see this film largely because of its hero, Viggo Mortensen. Fortunately for me (and all other Viggo-lovers out there), Mortensen did an excellent job as Frank Hopkins. I was once again astounded at Mortensen's ability to make horseback riding seem so effortless! He certainly has a way of connecting wonderfully with the animals he works with in his films.I was, however, disappointed in the numerous side-plots in the movie (ie the whole saving the princess deal). I felt that the horse race and its elements were exciting enough, but the side-plots kept showing up and distracting me from the race. For example, it seemed too unrealistic that Hopkins could skip racing for one day so he could save the princess, and yet still be caught up with every competitor the next day. If the filmmakers had cut out the side plots and spent more time with the race, I think that the movie could have been a bit more interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Using the not-dissimilar American West and inner reaches of northern Africa for settings about a fine American horseman (and a cowboy to boot)is one of the joys of this Hollywood reach-film. In true fiction movie fashion a somewhat mythical figure (Frank T. Hopkins played by Viggo Mortensen) is challenged by Arabs jealous of his horse and Hopkins' own popularity to a duel of monumental proportion. A 3,00 mile horse race across the most formidable terrain in the world - well, except desert California, most of Nevada and nearly all of Arizona - is the primary setting, but the not-too-unhistorically accurate depictions of the Massacre at Wounded Knee and even Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show are the launching pads of this epic tale. Mixing humor, adventure, a fairly intriguing story (one not too complicated by subplots) and terrific location shooting, we are treated to a fairly timeless piece. Audiences in the Thirties would have liked it, and viewers today should appreciate it even more. Turning its back on convention, "Hidalgo" (the name of Hopkins' horse) has a feel of the real thing.  This feeling is garnered as one views real deaths at the hands of swords and guns and spears. These weapons are wielded by warriors, and unlike contemporary offerings are far more believable and realistically rendered. This is not to say the film is gory; but one can feel some of the pain of the men and even animals involved. If films like "Holes" and "Hidalgo" can be made when all eyes and ears are focused on the next big digital computer-enhanced thing then I say bring 'em on.</fullReview>

Not your typical love story, but between a man and his horse!! Hidalgo (or more accurately the horse that portrays him) is about the best "acting" animal I've ever seen! He adds more emotion and humor to his role than most humans can ever hope to achieve without speaking! And for all the Viggo fans out there, there are tons of nice shots of the Hottie!

		<shortDescription>Mortensen is strong in his role and the action sequences are fun, but this isn't the epic it wants to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HIDALGO (2004)**SPOILERS**THE GOOD:--Though it takes a while to get to them, the action sequences are genuinely enjoyable. The sequence where Hidalgo and some of the sheikh's men rescue Jazira from capture is especially resourceful and entertaining. I enjoyed seeing the variations of weapons and styles used in the action sequences; we get sword fights and all sorts of kitchenware being smashed over people's heads, gunplay and some intense horse racing sequences. And that sandstorm you all saw in the trailer is bloody amazing too.--Predictably, this epic is easy on your eyes and technically well made. There are some great visual effects sequences and the cinematography is Oscar-worthy and the scene where Hopkins prays to the gods to save his horse or whatever (a weird scene that belongs nowhere in this movie) is memorably stunning - I was just gasping all throughout that scene. There are enough stunning long sunset shots to please any "Pearl Harbour" fan too.--Viggo Mortensen is hot property now, and "Hidalgo" only further proves this. He doesn't step a foot wrong here. Mortensen has consistent chemistry with pretty much every cast member, not least Hidalgo himself. Hidalgo is a beautiful horse and has a personality. Mortensen seems to be able to handle these animals like a master, though his brilliant acting skills from Aragorn to Hopkins have me hoping he doesn't give up his day job to professionally train them or something.THE BAD:--What was I watching here? I'm not entirely sure. Screenplay writer John Fusco just never seems to be able to settle on one genre or story. Is this a film focusing on the relationship between a man and his horse? Or the relationship between a princess and a foreign man, which is against the rules? Was this about one man's struggle to overcome doubt and do his best? An epic desert chase film? A film about the courage one town has to combine and overcome its enemies? All of the above? Perhaps?but if one film is going to do all of these things they all need more development and none (save the man/horse relationship) have convinced me very much as far as storytelling is concerned.--Twists in the tale are fun, as long as they are paid off and make sense. Lady Anne Davenport's sudden turn on Hopkins and Hidalgo is rushed and under-developed, we are never given a reason why she would deceive them like this. Her twist is nonsensical and never given a resolution and lacks afterthought, but that said her entire part in the film is annoying and completely unnecessary. Every time the character came on-screen I just kept thinking 'Oh God, this dumb bitch again'.--It may have been the way it happened and all, but this film is exceedingly predictable. I saw the ending a mile away - Hidalgo wins after some strife and competition and everyone - who previously didn't like Hopkins, by the way - cheers after him and looks up to the winner and then Hopkins and Hidalgo split up in a subtle sequence. It's one of those movies where you say to the person next to you 'Oh, I didn't see that coming!' in an overly sarcastic way.RATING:6/10 - Though this is a technically stunning film featuring Mortensen in sizzling form, it's overlong and has an identity crisis. You have to be a patient viewer, but "Hidalgo" is worth checking out if you're a horse lover or cinematography-crazed movie fan.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:The Horse Whisperer (9/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (9/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (10/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (10/10) Rabbit-Proof Fence (10/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is one breathtaking scene in Hildalgo which I thought at the time boded very well for the film. It comes early and involves a scene of great tragedy and snow gently falling in a Sunny sky. It strikes an emotional chord which the rest of the film could have used from time to time. As is Hidalgo is a standard genre picture that like the Horse in the trailer falls into one too many cliches like pitfalls. The beginning is quite intrigueing. The set-up of the race itself is nice. Almost a throwback to films of yesteryear which had a way of unfolding like a picture wrapped tenderly in a big blanket to keep it from getting cracked over the years. Unforetunately everything comes to a halt once the race is underway. Hidalgo, by not trusting in the race itself to deliver the excitement and the drama, makes a fatal error in focusing on the Sultan/King and his family problems. This takes us from one tired genre staple to the next. And by the time they get back to the race, the movie has worn out its welcome. Then again, the horse is cool, and steals some scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I wanted to see something else, my niece wanted to see"Hidalgo," and I'm glad we did. It's a good three-star film. We all enjoyed ourselves, Viggo is a down-to-earth hero, and the horse himself is adorable.I really expected to see Rachel Weisz or Brendan Fraser to pop out at some point. (Brendan would have been great as the lead.) After watching "The Mummy" twenty times, Arabia now seems both exotic and happily familiar. The photography is well seen and often flat-out beautiful. As with the LOTR, the "modified to fit your screen" video wont't do it justice. Yet my favorite shot was the one of the locust staring into Viggo's eyeballs. Funny!I wish "Hidalgo" had swept me away like "The Mummy" did. Somehow, despite the great sets and action sequences, the characters remained a bit wooden (except for the Sheik's daughter) and didn't grab my heart.That said, this movie is about personal character, finding depth to overcome obstacles, and the value of keeping promises. And those are still important lessons to learn; they're as ageless as the sands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and a throwback to the time of John Wayne Westerns, where people did what they did for the right reasons and not for power and glory.This movie has just a hint of darkness, as in the conversation between Bill Cody and the Chief who asked Cody to rescue the mustangs. But for the most part, it was full of light. A story of personal redemption for a man who felt more than guilty for seeing the wrongs that were happening yet chose to say and do nothing.Only one thing bothered me about the film -- I think at times Hildalgo looks at Hopkins with eyes that were perhaps computer-effected.I know that the story was an exaggeration, but it did not matter. It reminded me of the Tall Tales of Paul Bunyan, or Davy Crockett, or Daniel Boone. Did we ever question their "truthfulness."I am tired of the cynical sophisticates who takes all joy out of life in the name of art and reallity. Is reallity television more real than Hidalgo. The reallity is that we need stories and myths to give power and meaning to our lives. When Hopkins accepted that truth, he was empowered and strengthened enough to finish the race.In choosing to accept the reallity of Hidalgo, I am accepting although temporarily that myth has power and meaning.</fullReview>

However luckily Hidalgo stood up soon after that. :) About Viggo always trying to pretend to be tired, I think it's due to the hot and dry weather during the journey.

		<fullReview>Much has been written about whether the events in the movie Hidalgo are true or even feasible. Whether they are true or not is irrelevant as this is a movie made for entertainment. The cast and crew of Hidalgo have done a tremendous job of creating an entertaining and enjoyable film that is respectful of western, Sioux and Arabic cultures. The characterization of Frank Hopkins in this film is one of the best depictions of cowboy behavior in recent history. Cowboys are respectful, courteous, loyal, hard-working and yet, they do play hard. Inclusion of Lakota Sioux and Arabic dialects with large and easy-to-read English subtitles did not detract from the flow of the film. Some reviewers have commented that Mortensen mumbles too many of his lines. One that is accustomed to listening to Native American dialects might find that the softness, quietness and blending of the sounds is characteristic of this native language. The director did an excellent job in casting this diverse group of actors and each brings distinctive touches to their performance. The cinematographer should be commended for capturing the beauty of each locale, and the scenery is gorgeous. Hidalgo delivers the story of a valiant horse who happened to be owned by a man that stumbled, fell and yet through arduous effort regained his sense of self and place in the world.</fullReview>

In any event, this movie was a great break from reality and reminded me of Raiders or some of the cliff hanger adventures of old. I do not think that Muslims were treated badly in this movie, in fact just the opposite; I think Omar Sherif's character has a regalness and a curiosity reminiscent of Sean Connery's character in The Wind and The Lion; by the way these are both great classically trained actors in roles as strong Muslim leaders.

Frank Hopkins and Hidalgo are an awesome team, and they keep you guessing what the next adventure will be the whole time. All the actors had very believable preformances and did a very good job bringing out all the plots. The movie has just enough action to keep you entertained the whole time. It did get a little confusing at certain times, but the movie was good enough that you can forgive the common mistakes. It wasn't too gory, but it was exciting, and the fights are so authentic it's hard not to get caught up in the story line. I really felt like it was 1890 and I had entered the ocean of fire. It was a really cute ending, and this movie deserves to be seen by people old and young alike. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is reminiscence of the westerns of the late 1940's and 1950's where you knew who the good guy was, who the bad guy was and the horse is wonderful. I don't care if this story is based on a true story or not, it is a good story. The mustang is a true American symbol. Although small in size and not as sleek as the Arabian, Hidalgo showed that the size of the heart in the race is what is important. It was also so good to see Omar Sharif in an interesting role for a change. Viggo Mortensen was very good as the half-breed Frank Hopkins who did not like anyone insulting or hurting his horse. I will definitely go see this movie again and I am also going to recommend this film to friends and family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hidalgo is not an epic (just because it stars Omar Sharif doesn't mean they were trying to remake "Lawrence of Arabia"), it's not great (No other movie could be LOTR) but it is definitely good and mostly well done. There will be no spoilers, I will just state right out that the beginning could have been better. But don't give the whole film a 'thumbs down' based on it. After the poor start it gets much better. And the end is extremely enjoyable.The acting is good and the use of authentic dialogue between the different cultures is done well (though people are probably getting alittle sick of subtitles, but we Americans are spoiled). Viggo and Omar do a great job. The movie really doesn't have any stereotypes, in fact I felt that the American Indians were treated with great respect. The Arabs were shown as both good and bad, hey they don't want someone coming into there country and winning their most famous race. I think we would do the same here. And let me just make a final statement about whether or not this is a true story. WHO CARES! This is the movies for God's sakes. Half of what came out of America is myths and legends and for one I love stories. Tell me a good story any day of the week.So all in all a good old fashion, Saturday afternoon, popcorn and candy movie. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT Movie Regardless Of Controversy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hidalgo is a FUN action/adventure western with a hint of romance, inspiration and some great comedy scenes. Viggo was made for this movie and did a great job.Hidalgo is a cross between Disney's "Spirit", The Great Race (Natalie Wood) and a swashbuckler movie. Horse lovers and Viggo fans will especially enjoy this film. But don't expect it to be like "Seabiscuit"&lt;---a great movie but Seabiscuit didn't rescue a Sheik's beautiful daughter. ;)Frank Hopkins was a true man with some exciting memoirs. Were some things true but over-embellished? Perhaps his horse races could've been small/lesser known than what he admits. He also lived in a time of tall-tale western stories, esp. concerning great legends like Annie Oakley, Wild Bill Hickcock, Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, etc. Perhaps Hopkins wanted to be one of those "tall-tale" legends? He had no birth certificate (was it because by being half-Indian his parents wanted to protect his identity?) Even if his stories are fabricated, you have to admit he was one hellava storyteller, and he's still a mystery. :)Being a movie BASED on a true story doesn't mean it has to be 100% authentic (and you can bet Hollywood will throw in extra fluff). There's definitely Hollywood touches added to the Hopkins character/story but it all makes the movie worthwhile, IMO. I was able to look beyond the controversy and enjoy this great film.9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

I thought it was great. I think that the writers did all they could with character development, and the story line was really impressive as well. Viggo did a great job portraying Frank Hopkins and all of his quirks. And the rest of the cast carried the movie with the right amount of comic relief and drama. I really can't say enough about it, it's definitely one of my favorites. I've been waiting for this movie to come out for some time now, and I am happy to report that I wasn't AT ALL disappointed!

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful old fashioned film with a sweeping sentimental style one doesn't quite so often anymore. The story and the characters are grand while the cinematagraphy is breathtaking. Viggo Mortensen (a long time favorite of mine) and Omar Sharif are wonderful. This is the kind of movie Hollywood used to make. It isn't afraid to be bold or romantic. It is able to portray all its elements with a sense of grace. Mortensen wears the mantle of leading man as wonderfully as he rides. He is truly a gifted artist. He follows up Lord Of The Rings with yet another grand tale of adventure set in a wonderous far off place. This amazing epic is a must see for all movie lovers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too shabby - worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good movie - it avoids a lot of the cliches you'd expect in this type of film. The Arab characters are not stereotyped - the script treats them, their religion and their culture respectfully. In fact, I can't recall a major Hollywood movie that had this much Arabic in it - it's very nice to listen to, and it give the film authenticity. Omar Sharif was terrific - he swings that sword pretty well for being over 70.The film has some minor weaknesses. There are a few cheesy "one-liners" dropped here and there. The cinematography is pretty much Hollywood 101 - it didn't do a good job of providing a good feel for scale of the landscape. I did notice that the sky was faked in a few big action scenes (you can always tell when they do this - the sky looks a little too blue, too perfect; and the light on the actors just doesn't seem to fit). They relied a little too heavy on digital effects - I think a little creative shot taking could have been more effective than seeing two obviously digital cheetahs on the attack.The movie makes up for these shortcomings with actual character development and a good script that's not a sell-out, which are two things many action movies lack these days. While it won't win any Oscars (tm), this film is signifigantly a few steps above an average action flick, which makes it worthy of the $8.00 investment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The little horse that could</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a true story in 1890, American cowboy Frank T. Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) is the first outsider or infidel to be invited by a wealthy Sheik (Omar Sharif) to race in the greatest long-distance horse race ever run. Hopkins was once a dispatch rider for the U.S. cavalry and is known as the greatest long-distance rider in the West. While Hopkins is working in the Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show, the Sheik's emissary challenges him to enter the race, which he accepts. This race has been held every year for the last thousand years, and has only been open to the purest line of Arabian horses ever bred. Hopkins' horse, Hidalgo, a small mixed-breed mustang, was regarded as impure, and therefore shouldn't be in the race with purebred Arabian stallions. The `Ocean of Fire' race is a grueling 3,000-mile survival horse race across the Arabian Desert with the winner receiving $100,000 as prize money and the honor of being the best in the world. The 100-entry race is a battle of endurance and survival and only a few make it to the finish line, alive. If you like western movies, you must see this one. The story line of the little horse and the underdog cowboy racing against the best Arabian horses is a great American classic tale. The movie is long, but the filmmakers keep it interesting from beginning to end by telling stories within stories throughout the race. Some of the funniest scenes are with Hopkins talking to Hidalgo and the horse understanding what he is talking about by giving expressions with his eyes. Hidalgo means Nobleman in Spanish.

		<fullReview>Contrary to what I expected, I really loved this movie. Granted, I am a horse person and a sucker for Disneyesque plots, but, despite some clichés and predictability, this movie has more going for it than that. There is adventure, risk, thrill, pathos, grit and humor all wrapped up in a western feel with some cross-cultural explorations. The pace rarely lapses and the story line is captivating. There is a fine balance of suspense, intrigue and some well-placed humor. It's nice to see Viggo Mortensen coming out from under the spell of his excellent performances in Lord of the Rings Movies intact. His cowboy portrayal is reminiscent of some classics; he drawls like the best of them. There are some other fine performances in supporting roles too and Omar Sharif is wonderful. I understand there is controversy surrounding the validity of the story, but fact or fiction, this is a movie that is pure entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the movie very interesting and easy to watch, not vulgar, a plus today. The history part was especially good. Some parts make you feel ashamed of the behavior of our forefathers. Looking at he history and tradition of the Arab people show the gulf between us and them and the need for understanding. The filming in the desert showed the beauty and harshness of the country the race took place in. It is hard to imagine anyone could finish the race given the weather and land.The only complaint I could find was the captions which described the foreign language went by so fast you could not finish them, this caused some missed dialogue. However not bad enough to detract from a fine film. Omar Shariff is great, the first time I remember seeing him was in Dr. Zhivago and he was great then and just as good now. Go See it, You will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie deals with a lot of classic hollywood archetypes: the lone hero, the honorable native, the bond between man and animal companion, the great quest to find oneself, the great race... Yes this is a "boys" movie, but it is also a wonderful cinematic journey that takes one from the wild and unrelenting west to the sand shifting, exotic and intense world of the Bedouin. The trailers led me to believe it would be an intense but light ride, like the Mummy, but it was so much more.It never lost the feeling of the old Hollywood "big pictures" but there was an intimacy in the telling and a sensual and textural "realness" in the cinematography. The story of this film is simple, but finely developed and compelling. The action is great, but does not overshadow plot elements and more importantly, the fine acting by Viggo, Omar and the rests of the cast. I had not expected to like the movie, but must admit I was drawn into it and enjoyed it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. This startling movie will undoubtedly benefit from enthusiastic word of mouth. Initially, many will be skeptical, but will no doubt leave the theatre as believers. Director Joe Johnstone ("October Sky" "Jumanji" and the underrated "The Rocketeer") delivers a beautiful ride and creates stunning beauty within the most stark and brutal desert environment. Viggo Mortenson ("Lord of the Rings" "GI Jane" "A Perfect Murder") stars as the real life (half-Indian) Frank T. Hopkins, world famous distance racer on his equally famous (also) infidel mustang, Hidalgo. I believe Hidalgo flashed almost as much personality as Viggo in some scenes! Their story is fascinating, uplifting and heart-warming. Make no mistake, this is no soft touch film ... it is harsh and intense. The underlying message of self-realization and redemption is not lost among the many action scenes or desolation scenes. Hopkins and Hidalgo are quite the team and there story will reach you. Absolutely stunning photography and some nice choreography in fight scenes and race scenes make this a visual joy. Today's digital surround sound brings the pounding of hooves on the turf to life - you can feel it in your chest! It is also wonderful to see Omar Sharif onscreen and still with the twinkle in his eyes. This is one the family can enjoy together (except for young kids). The real trick will be getting teens in the theatre. Once there, they will feel the joy of the saddle and the thrill of the race.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, it's set in the Mid-East and somehow that makes the film 'edgy'. I don't think so at all. There are commonplace plot elements all over the place and many actors don't even try. Viggo Mortenson dead-panned most of the film, only occasionally stepping out of his stupor to do some quality acting. Omar Sharif is the only consistently good actor in the entire movie. The whole movie reeked of stereotyped characters and there were nearly no original ideas. It came across as one part "Raiders of the Lost Ark," one part "Le Mans," and one part "True Grit." The action sequences contained no real build-up and rely on special effects and brute force to make them remotely interesting, but, in fact, they fail at even that. American film-making often captures the zeitgeist, but only occasionally do they become classics. This film does neither, shunning the zeitgeist, good film-making, and the critics overall opinion of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply the story of a horse race across the arabian peninsula.Frank Hopkins is the lead character on his mustang "hidalgo". Both hopkins and his horse are misfits both in their country and in the romantacised Arabian peninsula that Hopkins races in. (omar sharif plays a 'leader' of sorts who spends most of his time in his fine tent lamenting the loss of princely sons) He is of course the first "westerner" to race in such a prestigious race, and many of the characters in the film remind me of the multiple characters in the "wacky races". Some are devious, others are warm and helpful.Overall this is really a film for those who loves horses. There are a few good scenes involving the horses, but the film on the whole is too sparse and particularly at the beginning too slow.There are a few good "action scenes" halfway through the film, but if you don't like horses, it is just a bit too slow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only little thing I found flawed was the confusing beginning. It seemed too fast paced. I was confused by the chronology of the events: the casual race at the beginning, the Wounded Knee masacre, the road-show career and suddenly Hopkins and Hidalgo were on their way to a big race in Arabia.But right away things improve and HIDALGO is a very entertaining, unique adventure, one of the best modern westerns since DANCES WITH WOLVES and TOMBSTONE, and also an inspiring story for any horse-lover who enjoyed SEABISCUIT and DREAMER. Hidalgo, a plucky Spanish mustang with beautiful roan and white markings, and Frank Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen), an ex Pony-Express rider, are 2 loyal friends who are invited to partake in a huge tradition across the globe, a race across the formidable sands of the Arabian desert against the most celebrated horses and horsemen of that land. The story and action never stop, and for the lover of good old fashioned swash-buckling adventure, there are plenty of gun and sword battles, a couple of involving subplots, and even some genuine comedy.The cast includes Omar Shariff and Louise Lombard. Even though it's a male-dominated movie and story, the 2 women in the movie (one is a strong-willed Sheik's daughter and the other a ruthless Englishwoman horse fancier) are strongly written and well-acted, not just set filler. Music and costumery are beautiful as well as the cinematography, the setting in the sweltering sands very interesting.I'm glad they still take the time and effort to make movies like this. If you haven't seen it yet, by all means. It's an inspiring and uplifting adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a time when many human actors fancy imitation as the sincerest form of self-expression, a horse rises out of the stable and presents an Oscar-winning performance without uttering a single neigh... hats off and a big round of applause to the director/writers of this film for presenting the western in a "people-aquarium" as observed by the sarcastic and strangely bemused face of Hidalgo horse. My favorite shot f this film, which in itself is fair Indiana Jones/adventure-love story material, all of which is elevated when said love interests are making "googly eyes" at one another and they cut away to the horse whose expression is one of "Oh god! Not another movie love scene where they make googly eyes at each other." And it's not an over the top performance (like Babe that stupid pig or Beethoven the dog, lovable but definitely NOT understated).. no, the horse doesn't flap his gums or do nun-chuck tricks with his tail.. his look says it all.... there's been westerns and epic historical fantasies (told from many perspectives.. though not all human) and now finally there is a visionary element which introduces an element of self-amusement with human history, behavior and story telling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hidalgo is a great adventure film based on the true and amazing life story of Frank Hopkins, a Siox native American who goes to Arabia to enter his horse, Hidalgo, into the longest and most dangerous horse endurance race in the world. This movie does an excellent job at playing with the western genre, which usually seems to stay pretty constant, by mixing it in with the cultural diversity of the Arabian Penninsula. It has a nice mix of comedy, awe, compassion and a good chunk of the middle is very action packed. A few places will put you on the edge of you seat and the shots of the scenery between scenes are beautiful. The movie also does a good job at portraying inequality and helps us to understand how it is so wrong. You get to really start caring for Frank and Hidalgo towards the end of the movie and the ending is a real tearjerker. All in all this is a very motivational must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hidalgo is a a classic cowboy story about a man and his horse.Frank R. Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) is a cavalry rider with a reputation of being the fastest and most daring cavalry rider in the United States.After the slaughter of the American Indians at Wounded Knee, Hopkins is sick of the cavalry. Hopkins ends up in the "Wild Bill Hickcock" traveling show. Hopkins has also been written about in the dime novels of the time. Sheikh Riyadh (Omar Sharif) is a great fan of these western novels.Sheikh sends a representative to the U.S. to invite Hopkins to enter the most daring horse race - The Ocean of Fire - a 3000-mile race across the Arabian desert.Hopkins enters the race. The movie is full of adventures that happen to Hopkins because the other racers feel that Hopkins and his Spanish Mustang horse, Hidalgo, are not worthy to be in the race.The film is beautiful and rich in color and scenery. It is good to see Omar Sharif in a movie again. Viggo Mortensen does a good job in bringing Frank T. Hopkins to life. I will be waiting to see who Mortensen will be next in film. Very entertaining!

		<fullReview>I can't really find anything negative to say about this movie. But the problem was it just never held my attention and it wasn't that entertaining. I felt the plot was hard to follow at times, but maybe that was because I never could follow who any of the Arabians were except the Sheikh because of what he wore and his daughter. I never understood what their names even were. And Hopkins adventures in the desert weren't that great. He endures a huge sand storm, but that only lasts seconds, and the same thing with a swarm of locusts. He encounters a few riders, saves one from quicksand. And then there is the guy and his men who try to kill him because the American lady wants her horse to win. I never understood that part. I don't even know which horse was hers. I'm glad they let Hildago survive, even after being stabbed. And Viggo Mortensen was as hot as he was in LOTR. He should land more starring roles.FINAL VERDICT: If you really like horses or think Viggo is hot, then you should watch this. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it unless you find nothing else appealing at the video store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly not Oscar material, and it could be a little shorter, but all in all, it's a solid adventure movie. Plenty of fights, epic races, and visual effects. You don't have to love horses to like "Hidalgo," but it would probably help. If you are a Lord of the Rings fan, as I am, you will find Mortensen's transition to reluctant warrior king to washed-up cowboy interesting. Any fan of horses, cowboys, or the actors in the film will find the film worth a watch. The special effects are reminiscent of the 1999 remake of "The Mummy," with sandstorms and other Arabian desert epic events. To reiterate what I've said, "Hidalgo" is not one of the greatest movies, but it certainly is worth a watch, especially if you're in the mood for a solid adventure movie.</fullReview>

The title character being the name of the horse reveals the fact that it is he who the movie is really about.After a slew of animals that have human overdubbed voices to make them actually 'act' this film shows that it doesn't take Will Smith or John Travolta to get a good performance out of a magnificent creature such as is presented here.The political undertones are impossible to ignore as American governmental exploits to rip off the natives over their horses while one 'dark skinned' horse rider faces a great many foreigners on their own soil (sand) in order to overcome the giant price set by American bullies.The fact that the Wild West is transposed onto Arabia for the majority of the action is also quite smartly done.</fullReview>

But don't watch this movie if your not in the mood to just sit back with the lights out and relax. A serious movie with a great theme, so grab some snacks and check out a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I saw this film when I rented it from my video store. I Knew itwould be a great film when I 1st got it, I just didn't know how good.Well the film started off well. We see two guys raceing on horses.That really got me into the movie. Suddenly I was glued to the screenand could not stop watching this movie. It was really great. Viggo isa great actor along with the other cast in this film. I felt so into the movie seeing Viggo and his horse together. I really felt for the house and during some part it made me want to cry, and I hardly ever cry during films. The horse us also a great actor in this film! Good job with this movie! I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Ed meets Indiana Jones meets Lawrence of Arabia might be a more tongue-in-cheek title. Not a BAD flick, by any means, but at any second I almost expected to see Wilbur pop up from behind a tent with a carrot in his hand. Continuity is a bit of a problem. We start in the west of the late nineteenth century and within few minutes find Vig Mort is on a ship bound for the middle east. Make the mistake of running out to the concession stand or to the fridge for a snack/beer, and you can come back to find you have no idea of what's going on. The subtitles can also be distracting at important moments and you'll miss facial expressions that can give away who's on whose side. If you've got nothing much better to do, give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hokey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hidalgo" tells of the adventures of mustang long rider Frank T. Hopkins who - according to the film - just missed the Indian slaughter at Wounded Knee, appeared in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, and rode 3000 miles across the Arabian desert in a horse race (circa 1890s). There's a very elegant website which sings the praises of this supposed legend and another not-so-elegant but seemingly more credible website which calls the whole Hopkins tale a hoax. Regardless, the film sticks Mortensen out front as Hopkins along with his trusty paint "Hidalgo" as it takes the audience on a two hour ride through a fictionalized journey from Wounded Knee Creek, SD to the deserts of Arabia in a tinselized, santitized, contrived, and hokey adventure tale with countless hazards and heroics. With lukewarm critical reviews, a somewhat more respectable nod from the public at large, and no awards of consequence, "Hidalgo" should make a good small screen watch for those more interested in a family adventure flick than those interested in history and the real deal. After all, why hitch your pony to a rail when all you have to do is whistle and he'll unhitch himself and come running (duh)? (B-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining yarn, with a little bit of everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersThe prime focus of the movie is a horse race, not the kind you see in Seabiscuit, but a grueling endurance test across 3,000 miles of an Arabian desert. The `Ocean of Fire' competition could have been called `a race through hell'. As a matter of fact, Frank Hopkins (in the movie) uses this very description when it is on the verge of shooting Hidalgo, nose bleeding and collapsing in exhaustion, a mustang he calls `brother'.This would have been enough for a great movie. The moviemakers, however, probably very honest and good natured business people, seem to think that they need to do everything they possibly can to give the audience the best value for their money. See what Hidalgo (the movie) ends up having!On the characters department, there are the exotic chief and the liberated princess, both surprisingly westernized, the traditional dark looking villain, the treacherous traitor, the fierce but mutually-respected competitor, the funny bad guy, the funny crazy old man, the alluring but ruthless aristocratic woman, the coal-black heroic warrior, and even a heart-winning slave boy thrown in for good measure.Not enough? How about some spectacle specials. There are killing desert storm, sun darkened by locus (which later becomes breakfast), hideous traps, murderous leopards, blinding eagles, mystic aboriginal chanting, plus kung-fu type fighting, cowboy shooting and an exciting horse race finish. Get the idea?But unfortunately, quantity does not necessarily mean quality.The start of the movie is striking similar with The Last Samurai: a degenerated hero stuck in a cheap road show, resorting to alcoholism to drown out anguishing memories of a massacre. But the similarity ends here, as Hidalgo takes on the line mentioned earlier, a race that is, forgive the comparison, not unlike Cannonball Run in many aspects. There is however a good central theme: will power and determination is more important than pedigree. The theme, unfortunately and ironically, is diluted by the moviemakers' well-intentioned effort to give the audience everything indiscriminately. Amidst some good laughs (the `castrating' scene is a sure-fire) and a distracting kidnap-and-rescue episode (which is far too long), the power and intensity of the race is lost. The ending (the race and the final release of Hidalgo) is uplifting, but falls short of moving the audience to the level of elation that Seabiscuit is able to.The cinematography is good, just as in other similar work that attempt to capture the deadly splendor of the desert, e.g. The English Patient. There is no point, however, in comparing any of these to Lawrence of Arabia. David Lean has done it once and I don't think anybody is able to do it again.Viggo Mortensen has done not too badly. He has brought out the compassionate side of Frank Hopkins quite well, but not enough of the wild spirit. Aragon is a perfect fit that is unlikely to be repeated. Putting that aside, however, Mortensen is heading in the right direction since the somewhat inconsequential roles in A Perfect Murder and Psycho. It's an absolute delight to see Omar Sharif again, particularly with his trade mark crevice between his two front teeth intact! His complete nude (but not full frontal) pose in Mackenna's Gold (1969) was talk of the town at the time. One more actor absolutely must be mentioned: T.J. (according to IMDB's cast listing) who played Hidalgo. This horse can really act. The look he gives when he turns around to see the approaching desert storm should earn him an Oscar.</fullReview>

It was a beautiful movie, the actors were great, the movie was believable and the story was incredible. Sometimes I'll see a movie and find the native americans, the soldiers or the other actors in it completely fake - but not this one. I love Viggo Mortensen's understated acting style and he is very attractive. I liked it that they didn't try to add story details to the movie that were untrue and improbable. I gave this movie a 10 because it transported me to that era and storyline. I always think the viewer must fall in love with the characters in order to become involved in the movie and care about what is happening. I was completely engrossed. Not one criticism.</fullReview>

But just knowing that Frank Hopkins was a real life guy, makes this movie more interesting. I hope the race happened just like Hollywood depicted! If Hidalgo really did live in 1890, he deserved a movie that showed how mustangs were treated! The horse in the movie was great also and what can I say about Viggo Mortensen.

		<fullReview>"Hidalgo" brings back the nostalgia of the classical swashbuckler film, recalling the era of such stars as Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn. Viggo Mortensen is the protagonist of this action yarn set in the late nineteenth century. I was impressed with Mortensen's understated performance of the cowboy and scout Frank Hopkins, who is haunted by the atrocities done to the Native Americans at Wounded Knee. A man of the earth and a lover of mustang horses, Hopkins takes a bet to compete in a horse race from Syria to Damascus, packing up his horse and traveling to the Middle East! The film is memorable for the beautiful photography of the two continents. The screen writing includes sensitive insights into the various cultures, offering thoughtful character portrayals and treating Islamic and Native American faiths with respect. The fine supporting cast dynamically portrays the colorful characters with Omar Sharif and J.K. Simmons especially memorable in their roles. My only criticism was the excessive and graphic violence in what was intended primarily as a "feel good" movie. The long road to Damascus was often a bloody one. Still, this was a compelling action story filmed in a splendid array of locations and with stunning cinematography.</fullReview>

It seems to be that it did exist.I think the movie could have been deeper, but I really enjoyed the characters in it, and thought the acting was good, a little wooden at times, but overall, good.You will be disappointed if you expect this movie to be something more than a historical story. Most of the characters are stereotypes that you've seen before: The arrogant Arabic princes, the sheik's noble African servant, the strong-willed daughter, the plain-talking but wise cowboy. There's no ground covered in terms of an intelligent and emotional understanding of Frank's conflicted past. I just expected the movie to serve up an adventurous story, and it exceeded my expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hidalgo" is a film with a plethora of sand and fury. Frank Hopkins travels to the middle east to compete in a horse race. He brings his own Mustang from Oklahoma. He desires a win in order to purchase an entire herd of Mustangs for the Indian Chief. The Chief's tribe had been slaughtered in the early moments of the film. This is a very light adventure film. However, it is exciting enough to maintain one's interest until the end. The scenery is breathtaking. The casting is more than adequate. There is little to believe in the content of the story line. However, there is an epilogue with sufficient information to make it worth the time. It is now available on DVD.</fullReview>

He's very nice to look at but his eyes do most of the acting, he mumbles and is wooden in a lot of scenes. Omar Sharif on the other hand has such presence on screen and he commands every scene he's in! He's lost none of the magic he had many years ago in 'Lawrence of Arabia' when he was first introduced to English language movies. The cinematography in Hildago is beautiful, reminding me of David Lean's movies but I couldn't help myself thinking "we're going to see that many times in the coming months" (especially when next year's Oscar race is on!) during several scenes such as the sand storm, parts of the horse racing and of course the magnificent final scene. It reminded me of a good old fashioned adventure story and yet it was based on a true story, and my husband, who is a big Lord of The Rings fan, actually said he enjoyed it more than LOTR!</fullReview>

I learned more than I had know before regarding Hopkins involvement in saving the mustangs. I already knew about the massacre at Wounded Knee. The film is exciting, interesting and fun in parts, but I loved the devotion of owner to horse that was expressed. Watch out Viggo...you may have to continue playing the hero now after this and the trilogy of the 'Lord of the Rings' instead of your usual, though well played, rats. I don't think its fair to compare this one to 'Seabiscuit', another fabulous movie. I realize its another 'little horse that could', and that is a good message to all of us, after all..the hobbit Frodo was another little one that did great things. I think this movie stands on its own just as 'Seabiscuit' did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Longest Ride is not always the one on the screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uggh! Tell about a story of endurance. On the Greyhound bus coming from Canada's far north into the friendly morass of Toronto, for entertainment they show movies. And yes, this long trip was no different. And the movie they showed was Hidalgo.Aside. Hard hanging irony that the only long distance transcontinental Canadian bus line would show a picture about long hard endurance riding. (eg. Vancouver - Toronto - 72 hours). Never mind. Just one of those quirks of life. Back to the movie.The story is of course a story about a long endurance rider played by Liam Neeson clone Viggo Mortenson. Now this is not a bad thing to be a clone of an excellent actor like Neeson, it means one is still talented. The acting style feels the same though.Unfortunately Disney claimed that this was a true story. 1800 mile races and 3000 miles are a little hard to believe. Due diligence in commentary structuring dictated that research into the real Frank Hopkins be done.Buffalo Bill's Wild West show was one of the most photographed events of that time. In the case of Frank Hopkins, The Long Rider's Guild web site stated in a long list of "Hopkins deceptions", that the truth is that Hopkins was a laborer digging the Philadelphia subway and, "...there is not even a documented photograph of Frank Hopkins in the saddle!" Not news. Okay, so Disney deals with fantasy all the time, so the movie isn't based on true fact as they boasted. Not a strange turn of events for a Hollywood movie to be total horse chips. Fortunately, I am a big fan of cinematography so this mitigated the complete disappointment in lost opportunity for a very good movie. Hopkin's legend derived from an ability to pass fantastic fiction as fact. Disney should have gone to the source on this one. Legions of mediums abound in tinsel town. No excuse not to do a séance. Hopkins agility with the true facts would have assisted the movie plot line. Lacking good consultations the movie, Hidalgo, wanders into a long formula parade of predictable plot lines and clichés. Few surprises sprout.Hasn't Shariff stopped playing the same cliché character movie after movie? From a directorial standpoint this likely is one of the largest failures in the movie. Shariff can be one of the most powerful actors on any screen, but here his characterization fails the litmus test for reality. The potential passion of a racing fanatic gets tripped up when it would have contributed to the plot. The religious aspect of Islam and Bedouin is poorly represented. Despite the recent events these are warm, effervescent people who treat guests intelligently, kindly, lavishly and with forgiveness.Again this is fantasy which serves the plot line little. Had the Bedouin been portrayed correctly as they really are, this would have shifted the plot line to a true believable level. It would have been a better movie.Would I watch the movie again? Yes, knowing that there are worse movies, given little choice I'd watch. The exception to that choice, ... just not on a bus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie I was hoping that it will be an interesting adventure movie with made with modern technology without annoying blocks. I was wrong! The main character was familiar by the half of the film I recognized Terrence Hil in him (but believe me it's a cheap imitation of him)! The story of a "one-man-army" cowboy who is the dream of every single women is a little burnt out for me, and just to make a complex character his mother is Indian so there is a mysterious side of him too. Now that's lame if you ask me.A couple of words about the story. Our cowboy - who won every long distance horse race with his mustang Hidalgo - goes to Saudi Arabia for a race across the desert to prove that his horse is the best and to take the great prize and save the mustangs in his motherland. In the desert he faces a lot of dangers and adventures. There is a scene when a sandstorm reaches the racers now that was absolutely cut out of "The Mumy returns". The story is not original and boring and the acting is awful. The only thing that made me watch this film was that it has the most beautiful horses in it that I ever seen. My vote is 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horse-back riding with Viggo...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horse-biographies seem to be rather popular lately.Last year, we had the terribly annoying film `Seabiscuit' which was also named after a horse and now there's Hidalgo. Luckily, this film handles about a completely different kind of horseshit. Viggo Mortensen portrays Frank T. Hopkins who wins a lot of races, works in a Buffalo Bill circus and drinks a lot. He's asked to join the `Ocean of Fire'-race..3000 miles across the Arabian desert! After a pretty dull and moralistic opening, Hidalgo slowly turns into a more exciting western/adventure film with a lovely photography and stunning settings. The race itself features sandstorms, dangerous scorpions, ambushes and even downright death-traps so I'm not complaining about that. Unfortunately the entire cast of characters is very stereotypical, and all the feared Arabian caricatures are there! Highlight to state this is Omar Sharif's presence as the traditional - yet good-hearted - Sheik. The film is beautiful to look at and contains several adrenalin-filled sequences but it there are no surprises to detect anywhere. For some unknown reason, all the acting performances are below normal standards.Viggo Mortensen acts like he isn't interested, while the rest of the cast seem to think they're part of an Indiana Jones sequel. The horse actually is the only one who acts well..Every time his rider does something stupid, he pulls up his eyebrows or neighs! Give the Oscar to the horse!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hidalgo is a pretty amazing story and the idea that it was based on a true story just left me stunned throughout. Then I went online and discovered that there was never a horse race like this one. Suddenly a lot of the unbelievable things in the film made sense.The action scenes are pretty good, but it's confusing to follow who's winning and losing the race. It's unclear how the crowd manages to follow the race. And other things I don't want to spoil the story to tell. So it's an action flick and while not on the level of The Mummy not an intellectual one.Who should see Hildalgo:-- Viggo Mortgenstern fans or horse fans who like action flicks-- Nobody else. Pure action fans, look elsewhere.I'll give Hidalgo a 5 out of 10, a knock down from 6 because of the phony "true story".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the acting was fair, the film was unrealistic and unbelievable. The props/costumes were incorrect for the era. Most horsemen saw a multitude of flaws in the (Quarter-Paint) horse which was supposed to be a mustang, and the equipment (a roper's saddle with the rubber horn wrap). The pencil bosal worn by the horse did not come into being until the 1950's and later. No desert sheikh in Arabia dresses in brocades which are reserved for kings. A fine cowboy "yarn" and although strong, rugged, and intelligent, no mustang could beat a purebred Arabian horse in a race of endurance. The authenticity of the Arabian horses and riders with falcons however, was the highlight of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Old fashioned" if you're in the mood but if you're looking for more then "solid and quite unremarkable" is more like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Together, Pony Express courier Frank Hopkins and his horse Hidalgo are the greatest cross-country team in the US, perhaps even the world. After becoming bitter and haunted by the slaughter of Native Americans, the pair join a travelling show and it is their billing as "the greatest" that causes offence as far away as the kingdom of Sheikh Riyadh. The Sheikh has a proud tradition of the greatest horses that have proved themselves in a gruelling cross-desert race; Hopkins is told to withdraw the claim or to prove it. Never one to allow his horse to be questioned, Hopkins travels to the Arabia to be the first "infidel" to take part in the race.Hidalgo got some promotion off the back of being Mortensen's first major film coming out of the Lord of the Rings films but even with this it came and went in the cinemas and watching it now I can understand why. I do not mean this to be a criticism but rather just a comment on the fact that the film is, as many have said "old fashioned" or as I would rather say it "solid but yet unremarkable". This is normally the description given to a film that doesn't engage in modern style and substance but rather just delivers a straight "adventure" story set in the past. Hidalgo fits in with this because it does have a solid story and character and provides a narrative that has OK action and dramatic sequences one after another right to the end. Those looking for a sturdy and simple film could do worse.Having said that though, those looking for more may well be bored by Hidalgo because, as well as it does the basics, it doesn't do a huge amount more and while it was interesting I was surprised by how unexciting it was and by how much of a passive observer I had very quickly become. I still thought it was OK but I doubt I will ever find myself recommending to anyone or providing higher praise than "yeah, it was OK" if asked my opinion of it by a friend, colleague or family member. Johnston's direction is fine throughout and he and his cinematographer do have some nice touches in there. Mortensen is suitable for the role but he is able to do more and this film doesn't offer him very much to work with beyond a rugged character. Sharif is a nice bit of casting and works reasonably well while Robinson, Lombard, Taghmaoui and Simmons are all reasonably good in support.Overall then this is a sturdy enough story that makes for a solid film even if it is not particularly special or memorable in any way. The "based on a true story" legend should really have been "based on a tall tale" but it made very little difference to me while watching it. If you are in the mood for an "old fashioned" film then this will deliver that but if you are looking for more than the basics then for you "old fashioned" should translate as "solid, not particularly engaging and quite unremarkable".</fullReview>

This is the man who supposedly entered this race and the movie was based on. When in fact many historians have traced Mr. Hopkins and his horse Hidalgo to no end. Just to find out this man was a big Hoax. There is a man named Frank T. Hopkins. But all his stories turn out to be untrue.

		<fullReview>I voted for this movie (giving it a 7) before I learned that it was a big hoax. The first hoax was by Frank Hopkins and then by the producers of the movie. It might have made a nice yarn, if they had left it at that.The producer even created a fictional website for Frank Hopkins as if it were created by fans. A nice hoax. I thought I knew my history of the Wild West pretty good and was shocked when I saw a 'true' movie about someone I had never heard of. The reason? He was a hoax. Mortensen does his usual job of underacting. One cannot be sure if it was more from his lack of talent or that he secretly knew he was promulgating a hoax. Omar Sharif was much better as The Sheikh Riyadh who sponsored the race of 3000 miles across the desert.The movie had great cinematography and was worth one viewing for that. The acting was fair, with my vote for the best actor? The Horse that played Hildago. See the movie and enjoy the very good cinematography, but don't believe a word of it as being true.if you are interested in the True Life of the charlatan Frank Hopkins I suggest you visit the following website...http://www.thelongridersguild.com/hopkins.htm</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite an exaggeration of the true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty interesting movie, but they tried to improve the true story by making the horse a superhero. Having the rider resist temptation to give in to the lusts of the flesh and the evils of filthy lucre was noble. I can buy the idea that an old alcoholic can turn down a sexy french woman and thousands of dollars. I couldn't buy the idea that a horse that was injured with a spear that went through its side/shoulder could get up and outrun the other horses ahead of it, winning by a few seconds a race that took several days. Still, our hero is a likable character, someone we can all root for. And his rider is a pretty good guy, too. There's not much acting in this movie, and it's a bit long and boring in parts, but it's a long race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie and much more than I expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my son to the video store, I picked "The Village" and he picked "Hidalgo". Initially, I thought my selection was the better one, but that was before the viewing of both. Now I think my son chose a much better movie than I did and we both came away rather awestruck and inspired. This was a much better movie than I expected. Maybe it's because it received so little press, I don't know. A quick web search and it seems apparent that even in death, Hidalgo and his rider still seem to inspire hate and elitist vitriol. That's too bad really because the nasty sites are only making themselves look bad. This movie has a lot of stories if you want to go there beside the simple horse race. One of them is never giving up even in the face of tremendous adversity, another is believing in yourself, even when no one else apparently does. Yet another is being proud of who you are when everyone else is telling you that you are worthless and in the case of Hidalgo, impure and worthless. On another note, there is a message about hiding from your true self, which encompasses not only the rider of Hidalgo but the sheik's daughter Jaziera as well. Hidalgo, unlike the other two, can't hide who he is but you get the impression that he doesn't care what others think and is the wisest of the bunch; with a mind of his own and in at least two key moments in the film, his actions dictate the events that follow. I'm glad my son chose this movie; we've seen it now twice and I'll probably buy it to add to my collection. Great movie, much more than a great adventure. I loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as it grabs you from the first frame all the way through to the end. No where in this movie does it say "based on a true story". What it does say is that it is based on the "life of Frank Hopkins". I grew up around horses, so I guess I am biased in that I like western movies and movies that mystify the relationship between a horse and a man. This movie is very clean, as well. No nudity and little foul language make this a great movie to watch with the family. My five year-old loves this movie (though I did have to cover her eyes during two fight scenes). I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hidalgo is not a bad movie, for a sham...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to agree with sci-fi action thinker guy's comments, almost to a T. I rate the movie as a "6", then agree that it should be docked a point for the phony "true story." However, I then ADD a point back because (WARNING SPOILER) Mortensen does not end up bedding the Bedouin princess, nor does he rescue her from her misogynistic culture and return with her to America. I always think it's great when a film thumbs its nose at the most predictable plot elements - kind of like (WARNING SPOILER) "A Few Good Men" refused to put Tom Cruise and Demi Moore in the sack. If this causes too much tension for those of you who can't stand being deprived of experiencing a climax vicariously, gee whiz, rent a porno or something.However, the life of Frank Hopkins (Mortensen) in truth might make for a good movie in its own right. I could imagine a movie of a man telling stories about his adventures to some credulous Hollywood producers in the '50s in order to cash in on the cowboy craze. Offers are solicited, contracts are signed, Hopkins becomes a "real-life" technical adviser about the Old West, only to have it ultimately exposed as a sham. Then, the movie could explore the psychological motivations behind a man who would so ardently sell his fantasy life as real - Ne'er-do-well trying to make a quick buck? Latent homosexual trying to shore up his low self-esteem? In the end, despite the exposure, the character continues to live the life of the cowboy he never was.On top of that, Hopkins-the-sham would have many opportunities to bed '50s Hollywood wannabees who come to believe he is a person of some importance.But then I would have to dock the movie a point...</fullReview>

Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) a disillusioned soldier in the American Confederate Army who saw some terrible events at the battle of Wounded Knee.He finds new purpose and meaning in his life when he is invited to compete in a major horse-racing competition with his beloved mustang Hidalgo in the Arabian desert by Shieikh Riyadah (Omar Sharif).But with other competitors not taking too kindly to a foreigner competing in the match,he has quite a match on his hands...This is a fairly nice kinda film,a nice soundtrack,not to mention some nice scenery.It's just,I dunno,it just sort of fails to come together and be really entertaining.It's a lengthy kinda film,and that doesn't really help with making it any more coherent and concerting.But it's got some nice action,not to mention all the things I mentioned above,and it's probably the perfect kind of Easter holidays/Christmas Day kinda film to settle down and watch.The film didn't enjoy that big a cinema release,which doesn't spell out good things for relative-newcomer Mortensen being head-billed in the lead role.Despite this,he delivers a fairly commanding presence in the lead,while veteran Sharif delivers solid support.Director Joe Johnston,aside from Mortensen,has also seen his star fall,emerging back out the woodwork after directing such hits as Jurassic Park III and Jumanji with such an under-performing fudd.Notice how many times I've used the word kinda in this review?!?...**</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it had it's share of cliché's and predictable scenes, but it was a decent adventure film. I am not sure what it takes to make an academy award winning film, but "Hildalgo" was very entertaining. I am glad I spent the time and money for it.I particularly enjoyed Omar Sharif's effort. He has always been a favorite of mine. Viggo Mortensen' character (Frank) was a real tough hombre', but knew his place within a culture of horsemen. He himself was a "halfbreed" taking advantage of his "white" side. In the beginning of the film, Frank witnesses the aftermath of the slaughter at Wounded Knee. The film didn't let on that he was part Indian until the eve of the beginning of the race. I felt like he knew that these deaths marked the beginning of the end for "his people." That was too much for him. The race was a race. Dodging bullets and dancing around sword-wielding bad guys, Frank was still able to persevere. I should mention Hildalgo's effort to give all that he could was the driving force that propelled this film. I often felt sorry for the horse. Hildalgo put up with allot of abuse. Falling in a pit getting stuck with a spear then recovering while stomping a leopard to death. That scene told me that the horse was one tough hombre' too!Thank God it didn't have an old Yeller ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horses were my first love as a child and I really like history, so it's easy for me to love this movie. The storyline is fairly thoughtful and culturally poignant, light-hearted and yet asking the character to deal with serious issues, both personally and professionally. I would have liked to have seen more interaction between the horse and the man; and more background through flashbacks (perhaps at the end of the movie). Also, as the culture in the mid-east is so radically different than Euro-Americans can understand, and while the screenwriters wrote well and fairly accurately about the time period, I would have liked to have seen some more cultural background. The movie has enough action and a good cast to handle having more time spent on these things, I think. I'm hoping for an extended version.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viggo Mortensen absolutely lit up the screen in the Lord of The Rings trilogy. He'd be lucky to light up a light-bulb in this. Really, when I saw the trailer for this, I thought it look like a solid, action-adventure. Well, all I can say for this monstrosity is: Dull, Dull and Dull.I love films. And I admit, I was very patient with this one. But the action just never started. In fact, nothing did. For over two hours I somehow endured scene after scene after scene of boredom. This film had potential. It really did. But all it eventually came to was a corny script and some cheesy acting and "action". The only real credit to this film is it's fabulous cinematography. The fact is, this film is not terrible. It's Ghastly. To some, this may have been a watchable, decent effort. To me, well...I was more captivated by the "efficient accounting" book that lay ahead of me. And I hate maths. Overall: * out of ***** (1 out of 5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>silly but fun adventure flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hidalgo" is one of those rousing, old fashioned adventure yarns that is none too taxing on the brain and offers a veritable feast for the eyes, ears and senses. This is a film for the virtual traveler who prefers to venture to distant times and exotic locales without having to leave the comfort and safety of his own living room armchair. The time is the late Nineteenth Century, the place the Arabian Desert, a brutal, unforgiving and barren wasteland that is the least likely location for a 3,000 mile long horse race in which at least half of the contestants who start out on the journey are destined to die before those lucky enough to survive cross the finish line. In fact, this is less of a "race" and more of an endurance contest, with the men and horses having to cope with hunger, thirst, deadly sandstorms, unbearable heat, and a whole host of other natural impediments on the road to victory.The film is based on the true story of Frank T. Hopkins and his mustang, Hidalgo, who together comprised the greatest long distance horse running team on the American continent. Hopkins was a messenger for the U.S. army who, without realizing the import of what he was doing, delivered the orders to have the Indians brutally massacred at Wounded Knee (Hopkins was himself half Indian and half white). As the film begins, we find him racked with guilt for inadvertently betraying his own people. To assuage his pain, he has since turned to drink and is rotting away as one of the sideshow attractions in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, alongside such "celebrities" as Sitting Bull and Calamity Jane. When word of Hidalgo's prowess reaches Arabia, the horse and the rider are invited to participate in the grueling desert race, even though Hopkins would be the first "infidel" to do so, a fact that causes a great deal of consternation among the local Islamic riders. To say that the film is rabid in its pro-American sentiments is putting it mildly, for despite all the obstacles and the threat of imminent death, Hopkins agrees to take up the challenge not only as a way of bringing some purpose and meaning back into his own life, but as a method of teaching those upstart Mid Eastern types a thing or two about what real Americans - both human and equine - are made of."Hidalgo" is at its best when it focuses on the eye-popping vistas of the sand-swept desert or the intricate, survival-of-the-fittest details of the race itself. The story, on the other hand, is pure melodramatic hokum and the numerous secondary characters are silly and sketchily developed. Even Hopkins is little more than a cardboard cutout - and Viggo Mortensen does little in the way of acting to bring any noticeable depth to the character. But who really cares? This is, after all, nothing more than an unadulterated Bedouin fantasy for Arabian Nights enthusiasts. Heck, this is the kind of movie in which the horse unties his own reins when he and his human companions have to hightail it out of Dodge (or the Arabian equivalent thereof) to escape the clutches of an evil horse thief, kidnapper and brigand. Actually, the most solid performance by far is turned in by none other than Omar Sharif (as the "Sheik of Sheiks"), who returns to the desert setting that made him a household name in "Lawrence of Arabia." "Hidalgo" is no "Lawrence," of course, but the film's visual scope, high-flying adventure and intense action scenes make it a first rate popcorn entertainment, bringing us back to the type of movie going experience we thought had indeed been lost to the sands of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let's cover a couple of ground rules. If you're going to count clichés or look for an articulate spoken cowboy in this flick, go critic the wind. Second, a movie based on a true story will never disappoint.Hidalgo has a lot heart, charm and some pretty good on location visuals. The action wasn't half bad either. While not as action packed or fantasy filled as Gladiator, Hidalgo has its churning moments of soul, which make you feel real good inside. This flick definitely gets the high five for family films. The movie is a little slow at times, but if you're in the mood for a good story, you'll enjoy it just fine.Now go getabeer or your favorite suds, rent or buy Hidalgo and 'viddy well my brothers and sisters...viddy well.'Peace out.9/10 !

		<fullReview>Hidalgo isn't exactly the most original movie to come along in awhile, but it certainly is a lot of fun.The movie is based on a real event in the life of a real person, Pony Express rider and horse racer Frank Hopkins. Hopkins and his horse Hidalgo--both supposedly past their prime--enter a gruelling race across the Arabian desert.We have elements of the Western, of sports movies, and of travelogues here. The film-makers seemed determined to insert all the expected elements--dare I say clichés--of all those genres into the film. But it's all done so well that it's not only forgivable, its comforting. You expect to see things like the underdog, washed-up, conflicted hero coming to terms with himself, the come-from-behind win, treacherous opponents, beautiful but harsh desert scenery, etc., etc.There's even some meaningful sub-text thrown in. Hopkins is conflicted over his mixed parentage (his mother was a Native American); this ties into the fact that his horse is a Mustang, an "impure" breed, while all his opponents are purebred Arabians.In addition, the fact that the film is set in the Middle East with the majority of characters being Arab Muslims is, of course, significant. The hero finds himself in conflict with some while winning the respect and friendship of others. Perhaps there's some American wishful thinking going on here, but the fact that ANY Arab Muslim is portrayed in a positive light in a Hollywood film is something worthy of praise. And they don't smack you over the head with it, which is good, because this isn't a "message" movie, it's entertainment.My biggest complaint about the film is the interlude where it delves into Indiana Jones-style adventure involving Hopkins (and his horse) rescuing an Arab princess. This is where the film goes completely Hollywood for several minutes, and it has nothing to do with the race. It's evidence that the film-makers--or more likely the suits financing it--didn't trust their material enough, and that's too bad, if all-too typical.Nonetheless, even that misplaced sequence is entertaining to watch, as is the whole film. Mortensen doesn't really stretch himself here--aside from the hair and the accent, Hopkins is a lot like Aragorn--but he's does a typically excellent job with the role and delivers his many down-home, plain-spoken one-liners with cowboy aplomb. It's also a film you can watch with the whole family, and that's something these days.8/10</fullReview>

I mean, is this guy actually an actor? He has appealing qualities, and knows horses pretty well, but none of that matters if you can't understand what he's muttering.Sorry, but that's how it affected me. I think also that more of it could've went on the cutting room floor and we wouldn't have really noticed the difference. It's just too long. And why are people wearing 2004 style glasses in 1890?Anyhow, the thing is just a bit too cheesy and Frank and Hidalgo are just a bit too bulletproof for the real world.

I think the original story could have been interesting enough with a better script, especially because it is based on a real event. It was for example very good to see a bit of Franks' history (witnessing the massacre of the Indians at wounded Knee) in order to understand why he first hides his descendant and later on recognizes his own roots by seeing the Arab way of life. It is very well shown how he finds "himself" again in the desert race. Liked the fact that Mortensen did his job well with the Indian and Arab languages (and of course horse riding). Special effects (f.e. Indian ghosts in desert) were well done and for those who know Mortensen's photography and paintings quite fitting !</fullReview>

The Horse Hidalgo is a mustang and as such represents modern America: a cocktail of different races.The rider is the new America, brash, swaggering with a past.The good Arab is represented by Omar Sharif: the bad Arab his nephew represents Saddam Hussein/Osman Bin Laden. Sharif has a fascination with all things Western and embraces elements of western culture. His daughter has a deep desire to be emancipated and embrace western ideals but the old Arab culture is holding her back. In the background we have the duplicititous Englishwoman who represents the "Old Europe" who is trying to frustrate Americas ambitions ( the Horse race).In the end good prevails over evil.New America has come out on tops.Some hearts and minds have been won over. The gift of a colt revolver to Omar Sharif is symbolic of American Military Aid? Anyway apart from that it was a very enjoyable film.</fullReview>

Fight scenes where people suddenly have new weapons appear from nowhere, the slave boy that he purchased (or did he????), his connection to the Indians (alright, he's half Indian, but why not let me know this before the mid point of the movie so that I can at least begin to relate). 3.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie over the weekend, on DVD...What can I say - it was BEAUTIFUL.... The animals are gorgeous - from the titular horse and the Arabian stallions to Viggo Mortensen and some of the 2 legged Arabian stallions....Sure, the movie has a load of technical and continuity errors - see that link for more... But the story behind it (based upon truth) is beautiful - showing that just one man CAN make a difference.....The scenery as Hidalgo and 'Cowboy' race across the desert is beautiful - as well as bleak - from the mountains and plains to the beach. If you are an animal lover, you will be in tears during some scenes and cheering and shouting during others... But, another thing to look at during this movie is to pick up on the underlying subtexts... There are morals about racism, elitist attitudes and the concept that an underdog can't win. There is beauty involved when each of these morals is brought to the surface, but never in a 'smack-you-upside-the-head' sort of way....Watch the movie for its beautiful animals and its beautiful juxtaposition of thoughts against actions.9 out of 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on Frank Hopkin's own published accounts of his life, this film has a decent cast featuring some pretty good acting. There is adventure, a little romance (but not much), some gorgeous horses and a race that, by many other accounts, never occurred. To hear some tell it, it seems that Mr. Hopkins may have built himself up to be more of an adventurer than he actually was. But, insofar as this film is concerned, the truth is neither here nor there. The film is well made, with, as I said, a good cast. Viggo Mortensen stars as Frank Hopkins. Omar Sharif is the Arab sheik who puts on a 3,000 mile race across the desert each year. Frank is given the opportunity to compete in this race with his American Mustang named Hidalgo. It is a race of pureblooded Arabian horses against this American horse, and, of course, the believers against the infidel American. Everybody cheats, except, of course, Mr. Hopkins. There is treachery, a few raids by bandits, and otherwise, enough action to satisfy anyone. Overall, a pretty decent film. I gave it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, old-fashioned movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hidalgo, starring Viggo Mortensen, for me, was an entertaining adventure. The story tells of Frank Hopkins, an American man from the "Old West" with a mustang horse, who travels to the Middle East where the Bedouin tribes have an annual race called "The Ocean of Fire" where they travel by horse for thousands of miles across the desert, all the way to the sea, to win riches and the Sultan's daughter. Frank, of course, accepts the Sultan's challenge, and heads of with his horse, while others have purebreds. Hidalgo is a great adventure story, and it's only problems are that it sometimes takes twists into sub-plots and sub-sub-plots.Grade: 8/10MPAA Rating: PG-13My Rating: Ages 10 and up (violence, some suggestive references)</fullReview>

It is, after all, the main reason we all go to see these films---to be entertained. And entertainment is what I got with this one. Not to sure about Viggo's acting credentials but he was convincing enough as a cowboy. A hell of a lot better than Anthony Hopkins as a black man in that dreary story "The Human Stain". Nice to see Omar still at work after all these years. The rest of the cast did admirably as well although I wasn't familiar with any of them.

But after seeing the entire movie that scene may be all you remember of it. This movie desperatately wanted to be an Indiana Jones style adventure film; in fact, despite the adequate acting job by Mortenson and the actor's rugged good looks, you can't help but wish the film was made 20 years earlier and starred Harrison Ford. Supposedly based on a true story, attempts at historical veracity should should have been abandoned entirely and the adventure and comic aspects---something so key to the success of the Indiana Jones films---should have been played up more. As it turned out, this film is too long at 1:36 and doesn't deliver the punch you might hope from seeing the trailer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Omar Sharif graces the sliver screen once more, albeit a supporting role, in this based-on-a-true-story of a one time Bill Cody showman and cowboy.Viggo Mortensen plays well the leading role of Frank Hopkins, who accepts an offer to enter his horse, Hidalgo, in a grueling Arabian horse race.You won't be disappointed, nor will you be surprised as the framework is pretty much that of a standard formula action adventure.In fact, Hidalgo, (played by TJ) often steals the show with a terrific side-ways startled look.Good family entertainment, but nothing very unique nor memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have enjoyed Viggo Mortensen in his other movie roles and this one was no different. I enjoy his relaxed, non-macho manner, vs. the stereotyped, hyped-up, macho-stud-cowboy-ready-to-fight-over-any-trivial-event-to-keep-the-movie-going type. His character, based (loosely) on the real Frank Hopkins, was thoughtful and humble.As another reviewer states, the movie started a little weak, but really began to move once across the ocean - in Arabia. I enjoyed the cinematography immensely - the beautiful desert scenes, large dune fields, and a sense of very inhospitable lands, was well done. Being horse people, we also enjoyed the horses in the movie and the movies effort to show how much they meant to the Arabs tribeman of the time (late 1800s).The only thing I did not really like was the the use of some of the computer generated effects. Don't get me wrong, I love animation and computer CG as well (everything from Disney classics, Wizards, Fritz the Cat, TRON, Last Star Fighter, Jurrasic Park and on), however, some movies could really stand on just good ole camera work.I enjoyed all of the supporting actors' roles as well, though I think some of them could have been developed more. Such as the Prince and the gentleman who (spoilerette) helps Viggo near the end.All in all, this was a fun movie and we have added it to our collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers?although there were a few destractions, the movie was just outstanding. Can't understand why the movie continued to get sand blasted.Had a nice Native American side to it too. Although I found the first half hour rather rushed. Some of the movie is rather patriotically silly., but The rest of the movie was well done. Wish I'd seen Omar Sharif in more movies since Dr. Zhivago. (nice easter egg too)I do know that the movie is supposedly not entirely factual by any means. But the movie itself is fairly respectable.I know the movie was heavily blasted for not being factual. That's a cop out. King Arthur claimed to be the true Arthur. and the movie bombed. The Alamo was probably very accurate. The movie bombed.However Monster seemed to get alot of attention, but is probably about as nutty about facts as this movie and Beautiful Mind. (Hidalgo and BM I love.) What I'm interested in is how good the movie is. Not what it is akin to facts.8/10Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 9/10 Replayable: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's About Hero's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that the movie 'Hidalgo' is a great family movie. Especially for kids five and up. It brought back our and I believe every child's play time while growing up, that 'cowboy's were our hero's. If we didn't have a real horse our stick horses were just as treasured. Silver plastic pistols and the plastic leather looking holster to carry it slung over our sides are still on the store shelves next to the stick horses. Things to help protect, to barter with, to ride away on. The belief that 'cowboy's are our hero's' grew and supported through the story the importance of a hero; it taught how character does matter, about personal conduct, integrity, respect and responsibility for yourself and for others, it showed courage, it showed truth and justice, it held honor. It was all in this movie. The movie kept your interest and the ending overwhelmed us!</fullReview>

I've always felt this was an overlooked animal rights issue, much like the Native Americans were and still are overlooked by the human rights activists. Hurray for Hidalgo.It was a captivating movie that showed real life struggles, and human kindness that transcended expectation and nationality. It showed real people's emotions based on their own thoughts regarding fellow men that are really not that much different. I applaud this story!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler minefield ahead...Disney has an interesting hold on the cinematic world. I saw 'Alive' right after this and was struck by the difference in derring-do. Disney takes popular, trendy ideas (here it's 'Seabiscuit') and creates a flat, open-and-shut, linear story. As an afterthought, Dreamworks then pirates Disney's work into an anti-Disney message. This reminds me why I look elsewhere for something to get me going.This film is constructed entirely out of theft. Ironically, the director substitutes for the protagonist. Johnston could have been great--he had the interesting 'Rocketeer' and 'Jumanji'--but he's been in a rut since. This is dull: it takes more than color filters, silhouettes and sunsets to make good cinematography--so few understand that. Here the camera has no character, only duplication.As far as humdrum content goes, everything here from the massacres and fights to the scenery and culture clash is painted with silly political correctness. If you aren't brainwashed already, it should make you vomit.On the side note, never trust blond women with British accents because they are plotting to kill you. In the meantime, Disney needs to make another cannibalism movie.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually stunning epic with intense action sequences, this was a memorable experience for my friends and family. Vigo Mortensen portrays western legend, Frank Hopkins, with humor and James Stewart-like understatement, invoking memories of the best in past cowboy heroes. With the truly remarkable Hidalgo,(Mortensen bought the horse after the filming), the film is both a bow to the old-fashioned cowboy as well as a telescopic view of turn-of-the-century American and European politics. Hidalgo, the horse,(there were 5 used but only one star) is as intelligent an animal as any animal devotee could hope for. A must film for all horse lovers, Hidalgo is every bit of a champion as Sea Biscuit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie in the cinema, not knowing what I was in for. From the previews I thought that it looked rather enjoyable, but I was wrong. After watching it, I came to realize it was better than 'rather enjoyable', it was fantastic! I usually am not a great fan of westerns, but this one just got me to the edge of my seat. To me it was a sort of Indiana Jones (which I also love) with Viggo Mortensen instead of Harrison Ford. I cannot decide who is better!I personally think Viggo looks cooler with long, black hair, but this makes absolutely no difference to the film.I give it 10/10 - it's a wonderful film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly under-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see this film, it was only on one small screen and i had to crane my neck to see it. However I believe that this is one of the most under-rated films of the year. I thought it was great! I can see why it would not appeal to some people as it is much more of a character film, more like Shawshank Redemption rather than James Bond. Unlike many films recently (e.g. Van Helsing) Hidalgo really spent time on building up the characters, allowing an emotional attachment to be made. Viggo Mortenson was brilliant, and he has truly become one of my favourite actors. He is so real, he really makes you believe in the character. I am an avid Lord of the Rings fan and love him in that, but I didn't see Viggo as Aragorn, but as Frank Hopkins through and through. This film is for anyone who likes a good story and a bit of history. The landscapes are fabulous and the soundtrack is unique in the way that the Arab and Native American sounds have been merged. Hidalgo is one film that I will definitely be buying on DVD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with one of the replies. Obviously some people did not watch the same film, or did not see the comparisons between the lives of the girl and Hopkins... and the way she wanted to come out from behind the veil, and the way that Hopkins is living behind a mask. How sad that folk missed this. How sad that people could not see the film for what it is. Compelling, happy, sad, romantic (without showing people in bed together)exotic locations, a connection between man and his horse....how do I know this? I have seen the film no less than 9 times and plan to see it again today. It's still playing in Simi Valley and still drawing people. That tells you something. And riding is not easy to do. If it was that easy, why did Viggo take extensive lessons to improve his horsemanship? Viggo, Omar and TJ all gave fine performances. How nice to see a film once more that is not all sex and gratuitous violence. I can say this... I am a talent agent. I see many screenplays. I wish I had been the one to find this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In reading the previous review, I guess the writer and I did not see the same film. I saw an excellent outing from Viggo Mortensen, who rides so well that he seems like part of the horse ... and some beautifully trained horses in the vein of Trigger or Koko. I know there are a lot of people who are cynical about Frank Hopkins' claims ... and I think most people accept that claims about the "Wild West" are rarely verifiable. However, I did find the film quite entertaining. I've seen it twice, and am considering doing so again this very weekend. It's a definite "must-have" for our collection at home. I think that people have given this film short shrift due to the controversies over Hopkins' claims raised by the Longriders' Guild, and that's truly unfortunate.</fullReview>

It's currently showing in the theaters, but I'm sure it deserves better than it's getting at the box office. I suppose the PR activities bear a part of the responsibilities for this. TV commercials for this film had at first given me an impression of another Indy Jones-like action play... but this was completely wrong, the theme of this movie is far more profound. It's not a showy piece but the drama is of high quality, and the subdued tone of Viggo Mortensen's actions effectively emphasizes the overall subject. I'm very much determined to get it in DVD and watch it again.</fullReview>

It has some nice action sequences and beautiful views of the desert. Those alone are worth going for. The plot has a nice little twist (not earthshaking though) and the race is exciting. It has a few scenes which are predictable but that doesn't make it less fun to watch. And it's always nice to see Omar Sharif back on the screen. He still is as charismatic as he ever was.

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable show - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the comments I almost didn't go. But I enjoyed the show.Some of the comments here about Muslims and how Arabs are portrayed didn't make sense to me, since the movie was set in the late 1800's. About the only thing I could see which would be a comment on our times was that Cowboy made it clear that Americans knew how to get information by torturing someone. There were some remarks here about horse riding - sure enough, I didn't think that Cowboy looked like he was one with his horse. But riding is indeed something that takes effort - although I have had limited (bad) experience. I was on a horse one time that broke into a gallop when we entered an open field (after it had tried to scrape me off on some trees), following friends who were experienced riders. It was unbelievable, one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had, as the horse shifted into a smooth wavelike motion. Everyone should experience it at least once in their lives. I think that gallop across the field might have been the only time a horse hasn't tried to just get rid of me, because they could tell I didn't know what I was doing. There was very little portrayed of religion, a lot of the standard fatalism that you hear ("it is in Allah's hands") but most of the characters, good or bad, worked hard to try to get outcomes that they wanted, they didn't just sit around. (Reminds me of a book of proverbs a professor I knew used to quote occasionally - the one I remember was "Trust in Allah, but tie up your camel.") As far as the veil removal - Cowboy did rescue her after all, and apparently even in the late 1800's some tribes did allow their women to remove their veils. Perhaps more evil was the English woman who mocked the tradition by wearing a see through veil herself in at least one scene, presumably Western women did (or should I say do) this to create a sense of drama, mystery and allure - but that was okay because she was a bad person overall anyway. The drinking, of Cowboy, the English woman, was tolerated by the Muslims, but again it was not presented in an attractive way - it was clearly presented as a weakness of Cowboy and English woman was a bad person, so who cared if she drank. A few Mustangs in a park are fine by me, but where I live they have wild horses that compete for grazing with native Elk, so I am happy to see that there are occasional culls. The horses are supposed to end up getting adopted but I suspect that many of them end up in dog food. It had some of the standard Hollywood formulas - the sportsmanship of the Prince who at the end swallowed his disappointment and gave his judgment about what a fantastic horse Hildago was (rather than sulking or continuing the insults he had hurled along the way). But an effort was made to convey the close bond between Bedouin and their horses - the guy who accepted that he was going to die in the hot mud sinkhole was begging his horse not to come near. Some people walked out of the theater when I saw the show, but I found it enjoyable and it seemed most of the people in the audience felt the same.</fullReview>

People sometimes had better discerniment to identify what is wrong and what is right. In the movie they 'build' some 'western' and artificial 'situations' that aren't from the real history. But, I think that, its has been made for the children public. But, the most important about this movie is the real history behind the man and its dreams, trying to make a better place.

		<fullReview>I am a horse lover, but even I went into this movie thinking that it would be nothing exceptional, but I was blown away. Anyone who knows anything at all about horses can tell you that the Arabian horse is built for the rugged landscapes of Arabia, with tough hooves, and can last for days without water. Mustangs are not a pure breed, such as Arabians are. They are more accustomed to foraging for food and seeking shelter from the elements. I have always had a thing for Viggo, and seeing him in a cowboy hat just did it for me. It seemed that he had a natural rapport with horses, and the horse who played Hidalgo and Viggo had perfect chemistry. He referred to the horse as "brother." What does that symbolize? The relationship that was portrayed by the two of them in the movie made me long to run home after the movie and see my horse. Never in my life has a movie made me hope, then cry, then hope and cry all over again. In the end, hope won out, though my husband's sleeves were wet with my tears, as well as his own. Everybody should see this movie. You will come away with a new respect for the relationship between man and animal and a new meaning of the word "hope." Viggo, aka "Frank" never let his brother give up, and his brother never let him. The world would be a much better place if we all relied on each other and pulled each other out of the quicksand instead of letting them sink.</fullReview>

Seemed to be a non-shaving role again! The horse that played Hidalgo also merits a mention, he could almost talk, well he did talk! He was so well trained, he and Viggo made it all look so easy yet it's not.Whether the race itself was ever real or not does not matter, the film did put me in mind of The Black Stallion (not necessarily the film - the book really) which in one book also has a long race with Arab Stallions - no Mustangs.My only bad thing was the women in it were either scheming and vicious or wimpy and protected.It's a great story.... go see it you'll love it!</fullReview>

But that is nothing new, it's show biz. I go to the movies to see a good story and be entertained. Hidalgo filled the bill for me. I liked the Frank Hopkins character. Although I have read that there may be more lore than fact in this film with regards to Hopkins, that doesn't bother me. It was nice to see Omar Sharif again. He is still in fine form. And the horse was quite amazing. I understand that Viggo Mortensen was so taken with the horse that he bought him. The chemistry between the two of them was great. The scenery was stunning. I want to comment on one last thing...I felt that the movie treated the Arabs and the Native Americans with respect, even though there was ample opportunity to do just the opposite.</fullReview>

Both learn just how determined the other is when it come to the trials of the desert, whether it is invaders or the harshness of the desert. The horses also are the teachers, as they teach endurance and what it is to be loyal and trustworthy, especially in the toughest of times. Hidalgo (the horse)portrays this very well. Even when Frank Hopkins wishes to give up on the race, the horse will not let him. I can relate to this movie through the relationships I've had with my equine friends.

		<fullReview>Hidalgo is a great family entertainment which is well worth seeing.Downsides: It dragged a little in places. Viggo whispers some of the dialog so you will miss it without perfect hearing. The movie is not based on anything like a real story.Goodsides: Well thought out. Real emotions by a real character. The "rescue the daughter of the sheik" was very nicely done. For me the emotional high point comes when the main character, Frank, is at the end of his strength and he kneels down in the empty desert and chants a Souix (?) prayer to the ancestors. This is a man who for most of his adult life denied his Indian background but now, had nothing left to turn to. That moment was deeply moving. The truth is all Americans are part Indian because the Indians, mostly unwillingly, helped make America what it is today.Many people have only been able to find themselves by pushing their bodies to the limit in some race or contest. This movie captured that idea. Americans are mixed. We aren't pure. But we are stronger for that mixing, not weaker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of American cowboy Frank Hopkins and his win of a 300o mile race across the sands of Arabia is at best an inflation of the facts. More likely than not the whole thing was made up by Hopkins. There have been dozens of stories since the movie was announced and more since its release taking Hopkins and his claims apart. The most serious problems with his story being that the race apparently never happened.That said, how is the movie?If you can ignore the huge "inspired by a true story" at the start of the film you're in for a fun ride. This is a movie of the sort that they were churning out in the old days of Hollywood, huge spectacles that are perfect to sit and eat popcorn while watching. Of course they have no real basis in reality, and I doubt this film comes close to Hopkins tissue of fabrications, but ts a very good adventure film.The film is not with out its flaws, it behaves like an old Hollywood film so things happen bit too neatly. The film is also probably 20 minutes too long, with the climax actually coming at the halfway point of the race.Still if you're up for a good popcorn film to disappear into for a couple of hours try Hidalgo.</fullReview>

What looked like a cute, harmless little film turned out to be facist and have a huge, gaping plot hole, so big in fact that you could drive a car through it.Ok, I'll be nice and disect the film, high lighting the good and also telling you why it was bad.High points:Good special effects.And... that's it.Low points:Facism towards Christians (a character repeatedly referred to as the "Christian" woman is an evil, violent adulteress).Facism towards young Arab men (there isn't a single honorable young Arab man to be found in the film).A plot hole which has been pointed out by another user (forgive me, sir, but your name escapes me), but must be reitterated, for it is so huge. Why is it that the FASTEST RIDERS IN THE WORLD are outrun by a slow paced band of old people, aristocrats, royalty and children carrying huge amounts of luggage? Many people are present at the starting place of the race, but the exact same people are present at both the half-way point and the finishing line. How could they POSSIBLY reach those places faster than the fastest riders in the world, not to mention get everything set up in time?In short, this was a very fun movie during some points, but don't go unless you expect to be at least a little ticked off.5 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS***I went and saw this film last night (March 16th), and I have to say, that is was one of the most memorable movie experiences I have ever had. I definitely could have stayed for an encore. This film is absolutely incredible and gives you that feeling you get when the underdog faces all kinds of challenges and adversity and finally comes out on top. A mixture of adventure, comedy and a great score made this film a must see for any adventure lover. If you have ever seen the shawshank redemption, and liked the feeling of satisfaction the ending gave you, then this film will be one of your favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HIDALGO (2004) **1/2 Viggo Mortensen, Zuleikha Robinson, Omar Sharif, Louise Lombard, Malcolm McDowell, Adam Alexi-Malle, Said Taghmaoui, Silas Carson, Harsh Nayyar, JK Simmons, Floyd 'Red Crow' Westerman, Elizabeth Berridge, C.Thomas Howell. Loosely based on the life of cowboy Frank T.Hopkins (played with low-key stoicism by Mortensen) circa 1890 where he enlisted his titular horse in a race set in the no-man's land of the Saudi Arabian desert with all manners of obstacles and pitfalls along the way including a glad-handling sheik (Sharif) and his gorgeous daughter (the luscious Robinson) and a conniving Brit (Lombard). The real star of the film is the eponymous equine that convincingly does most of its own hazardous stunt work and some B-movie lore of yore make for some of the film's jerry-rigged predictable plottings. Entertaining epic wannabe with its heart in the right place thanks to the screenplay by John Fusco and lively direction by Joe Johnston employing his exotic arid locales to full effect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You would think that a half-Indian cowboy riding a wild mustang in the world's most grueling endurance race across the Arabian desert, braving raiders, cheaters, sandstorms, and the blistering desert environment would be quite exciting, you would be wrong though. Hidalgo wants to be an old fashioned adventure tale but what it actually ends up being is an often clichéd snoozefest.Hidalgo is supposedly based on the real life exploits of Frank T. Hopkins (Viggo Mortenson). His name is right, everything else is almost pure fiction....and it shows. I wanted to like the movie, I really did, but the race was rather boring, the characters were walking clichés and stereotypes, and the action felt contrived and out of place amid the endless ride through the desert. The scene that sealed the fate of the movie shows Hidalgo (the horse) collapsing in the desert, blood running from his nostrils. His injuries resulted from a fall into a spiked pit trap laid by bandits paid by a rival to ensure Hidalgo does not win the race. Hopkins cuts out the spear that clearly lamed Hidalgo and cauterizes the wound then they bravely carry on to the final stage of the race. Anyway, after Hidalgo collapses, Hopkins does a ghost dance to summon his ancestors for aid. Mysterious, ghostly figures appear, seeming to offer their support to the beleaguered duo of horse and man. Hidalgo rises up and then races the two other top competitors to the finish line.I won't tell you who wins, but given the hopelessly clichéd nature of the movie you can probably guess all on your own how it ends. Movies like this are best when the journey is more important than the destination. When the journey is less than interesting, the destination becomes completely pointless, much like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hidalgo could quite possibly be retitled to the worst pre-Summer release of 2004. I am not sure what I was expecting when I first chose to pick Hidalgo up and actually watch it. Perhaps it was the visions on the box of an evil Sheik, a dust storm, or a wild-eye cowboy looking for adventure that put me in the mood. If I would have only known that the cover of the box ultimately shows the best parts of the film and the rest of this two hour production is nothing more than clichéd lines and filler. This was a horrible film from the beginning to end. Viggo Mortensen, so powerful in his role of Aragorn in Lord of the Rings, follows-up as a cheesy, clichéd cowboy that mutters 'Yes sir' and 'No ma'am' throughout the film. His character has no real depth or value, thus causing us to question his reasons for being the 'good guy'. Let me explain. We begin out film with Mortensen running a race then proceeding to punch someone in the face. Then he becomes an alcoholic exhibitionist, then he retires off to the big sand race where he continues to find trouble. Where, in the middle of all of this, do we see the compassion behind his eyes, the warmth around his smile? I must have missed it between the several minutes of shuteye I was getting while attempting to forge through this film. I must say that I did relate to one of the scenes. Closer to the end Mortensen feels like all is lost and no hope can be seen on the horizon, he is burnt by the sun and tired. Hidalgo even wants to end this debauchery. I really connected with this scene. While I was watching this movie, I felt as if I was burnt and could not continue forward. I wanted to give up, but after seeing the time on the DVD over two hours, I knew that home was somewhere in sight. So, like Frank Hopkins, I fought forward and survived.Outside of Mortensen's butchering of Frank Hopkins, we also have veteran actor Omar Sharif prejudicing the role of Jazira, a very wealthy Sheik. By the time we were introduced to this character, I already had a bad taste in my mouth so I was bitter toward Sharif, but he honestly brought nothing new to the table. I found his passion of the Wild West awkward and silly. All he did was add more wood to the already burning fire known as Hidalgo. I needed somebody in this film to speak up and stand out as the prizewinner. I was looking for that one actor that was obviously doing this film because he believed in the role, not the Disney money. I never once found passion in any of our characters eyes (even the horse). This caused me to question the sincerity of this film. Were our people making this film just to get another film out there, or were they excited about the story. I would have to go with the first option instead of the second for this film.As critics, we cannot just blame the actors because they are merely following the direction of the man behind the camera, so I would like to focus our next bit of attention on Joe Johnston. He made three grave errors on his part when releasing this film. The first is the fact that he quoted us, the audience, that this was an epic. This was no epic. There was nothing epical about it. It was a horse racing film. To call it anything else would just be giving it a better jacket. The bread and butter was that it was a horse racing film, nothing more nothing less. With this in mind, why did the horse race start 45-50 minutes into the film? I came into this DVD hoping to see some racing, not a dimwitted character stumbling through his lines. I needed more, but was handed less. I felt like Oliver Twist. Johnston's second error was another debunked fact when he said that this film was based on a true story. Nobody has ever proved that Hopkins ran all these races. He said he did to gain notoriety, but it has never been proved. This should have been stated at the end of the film. It would have only turned the heat up on this burning critic who wasted several hours of his life with this film. Finally, the last mistake that Johnston did with this film deals with the cinematography. It was a jumbled mess to say the least. There was no consistency behind the camera. I felt as if Johnston took images from The Mummy and from an Oliver Stone film and called them his own. I wanted Johnston to build his own name and style with this movie, but I could not find one original scene. His camera work was shoddy and uninventive. Closer to the end, it just became incoherent. Johnston was trying so many different styles that we, the audience, suddenly became lost also in this desert ? a place I didn't want to be on a Sunday night.Then there was Hidalgo. I could tell from the first time that I saw this steed turn around and look at Mortensen that he was not happy with this film. I kept waiting to hear him talk or at least do a Mr. Ed impersonation, but it never occurred. Every time I looked at Hidalgo, I could only see glue. The glue that was missing from this film to keep it held together. Near the final scene when Hidalgo is giving it his final push, I leaned over to my wife and asked her if Mortensen finally put this Mustang in fifth gear. HA! We needed some form of humor to compensate for this poor film.The only redeeming value (and it is small) about this film that I thought was interesting was the connection between the Muslims and the Native Americans. Whether this is accurate or not, I felt it was helpful in seeing the connection between Sharif and Mortensen. They fought and disliked each other, but they were of a similar culture, and I enjoyed watching that short minute before getting right back into the non-existent race. May I make a final suggestion? If you want to see a real horse race, go to the tracks. It would be a better adventure than you witnessed with this film and you might, just might, win back your money that you wasted on this filth.Grade: * out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would take a minimum of 30 days for a horse to run 3000 miles at an unprecedented 100 miles in 9 hours per day. The average would be 80 miles in a 9 hour period. If you take into account the terrain and heat of the desert in this movie a horse could only do about 50 miles and not drop over dead. I think its astounding these horses (with riders) could do the physically impossible and run this race in only a few short days. Im hoping in the remake the horse and Viggo race other participants to the moon --it would be just as plausible. The continuity person working on this movie was an idiot. If you take the movie to be a fantasy, like say, Lord of the Rings then its not too bad. Otherwise, its awful. You may loose IQ points just from sitting through it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My biggest surprise with this film is the relatively high score it is given on this web site. This is a movie I missed at the cinema and one that my wife was not particularly bothered about seeing. How right she was!I got nothing from the film and consider it a complete waste of two hours of my life. Lets face it, right from the very beginning we all knew who was going to win this race. So for two hours it was padded out with a dreadfully convoluted story line, poor acting, terrible dialogue and very ordinary special effects. ( I do not consider this to be a spoiler).I must admit to only having seen Viggo Mortensen before in the Rings trilogy in which he was reasonably acceptable. I hope he doesn't see the future full of big budget action hero parts if this is anything to go by. He was hopeless. His acting was one dimensional, his accent laboured and to be honest virtually unintelligible for much of the film. Why did Omar Sharif even think about this one?I really found the riding sequences hysterical in that it was so obvious that the actors were sitting astride some form of vault as opposed to a real and galloping horse. I thought special effect nowadays took us well beyond this quality of stunt.However it is clear many did enjoy this film and I'm happy for them, one and all. I always make exception for the big adventure, 'tongue in cheek' type film for which there is a real demand and place. This didn't even pass this test.Yes, I didn't like it and I'm not sure if you will either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is so bad that it's ..... worse...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am watching the film as I write this review. This thing is really bad. The propaganda against arabians ( the people not the horses ) is so childish I find it almost unbelievable. 19th century literature extolling the British empire was intelligent compared to this trash. I understand Disney was behind this according to one commentator. That figures. I guess brainless and cute has moved on to merely brainless. So what else? Of course, there is no "ocean of fire" race but that is the least of sins. And all the huffing and puffing about "infidel" this and "infidel" that... give me a break with that stuff. For a moment I thought that the introductory scene with the "battle" at Wounded Knee might be a harbinger of better things but not a chance. I'm surprised that George Bush 2 didn't put in a cameo appearance! Of course most Hollywood movies involving animals as a protagonist, or companion of same, are pathetic. I noticed that a number of knowledgeable people have made some fairly straight forward technical criticisms, the most obvious being that "Hidalgo" is not a mustang but an American paint horse ( which is simply a Quarter horse with white on the coat, something not permissible in the QH registry ). For long distance rides it is well known that Arabian horses, in particular egyptians, beat all comers. They are not the fastest over shorter distances but their staying power is respected, as are the people and areas of the world which share their name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing, historical nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Oscar of some kind should definitely be won by...the people who made the TRAILER for "Hidalgo". Because they certainly made a sow's ear look like a silk purse. The trailer was exciting enough that my friend's children wanted to see it badly, and so did I -- I am sucker for any kind of horse movie -- so I took them to see it.What a disappointment! For starters, apparently everyone is well aware that this is NOT based on a "true story", as nothing in Mr. Hopkin's self-aggrandizing fairy tales bears any scrutiny. However, plenty of wonderful stories are entirely based on fiction -- my only beef is saying that "Hidalgo" is a true story, when it clearly is NOT.Even as a fantasy based on the myth of a "superhorse" -- a tough little Mustang stallion who is 1/4 painted pony, and can outrace seemingly larger and tougher purebreds -- "Hilalgo" is a failure. Not nearly enough time is spent on exploring the relationship between cowboy and horse. Certainly the film is influenced heavily by "Seabiscuit", with the concept of the unremarkable looking horse who has so much heart and spirit that he can defeat all the thoroughbreds. This is a valid story -- Seabiscuit was certainly a real horse -- but nobody bothered to take this a step further or develop an intimate connection between the viewer and the equine performer (or performers, as I imagine there was more than one Hiladgo cast). So Hidago himself ends up just a "trick pony", who accomplishes miraculous things for no particular reason except that it suits the desired ending of the story.Viggo Mortensen is a particular disappointment here, following on his glorious role in LOTR, and I imagine a lot of fans (including myself) were let down by this wooden, tired performance. I've seen Viggo in enough other films to know he CAN act, but you'd never guess it here. Also this part seems written for an actor more like Kevin Costner -- the aw-shucks type -- and not Viggo's sort of reserved and quiet demeanor. In a supporting role, Omar Shariff is a pleasure to see in one of his last role. Newcomer Zuliekha Robinson seems to be the love interest, but the filmmakers draw back from developing anything, preferring to keep Hopkins character a "loner" (which is odd, since the real life Frank Hopkins was married twice, and not to a Arab princess). This is odd prudery, even for a kid's film.My biggest beef against "Hilalgo" is the manner in which the horses, and especially the title character, are treated. For starters, Viggo is a very large man, and Hidalgo a rather small horse -- scenes where Viggo is riding Hilalgo are painfully awkward. At the minimum, a man Viggo's size would be very uncomfortable on such a small animal. It seems to me that the horse playing Hidalgo was chosen largely for his exceptionally beautiful markings -- he is indeed gorgeous -- and not for any characteristics that would make him a good long distance racer.While I think highly of mustangs and paint ponies and all Western breeds, it is grossly unfair and unrealistic to suggest that a horse from such a background could outrun a desert-bred Arabian. This isn't just a matter of pedigree, it's a matter of CLIMATE. The Arabian desert is far hotter and drier than the American desert, plus it's considerably larger. The "Ocean of Fire" race is depicted as killing off many of the desert-bred native horses, yet newcomer Hidalgo adapts immediately to the harshness and outruns them. I should say that I find it hard to accept that horse-loving Arabic tribesman would subject their beloved horses to anything so brutal that clearly results in the death of the majority of animals (and many of the riders).Towards the end of the race, Hidalgo is badly injured with a spear -- an injury so extreme that Frank is considering putting the horse out of his misery. On top of that, Hidalgo has pretty much collapsed from heat exhaustion and thirst. However, in the film, the horse is shown to get up after these atrocious (and unnecessary) injuries and GALLOP AT FULL SPEED to the finish, beating numerous healthy, uninjured and well-rested Arabian stallions. This is not only appalling stupid, but cruel. It suggests that it's pretty much OK to take a horse into an alien environment, subject the poor animal to horrific conditions such as extreme thirst, attack from wild animals, spears, heat stroke and so forth and then have him race happily to the finish line...and for what? to win a bunch of money. (I certainly can't see anything in the HORSE'S interest there.)Basically, this kind of treatment results in DEAD HORSES. If you love horses, this is simply appalling, horrifying and unacceptable at any level. "Hidalgo" feels like a story which is saying "It's OK to abuse a horse nearly to death, as long as you win a lot of money". It should also be noted that the real life Mr. Hopkins did not buy up thousands of acres of Western land and establish a mustang sanctuary, as described in the film. Even today, there is controversy about the wild mustang herds in the Southwest and whether they should be hunted down and processed into pet food.Lame on absolutely every level, "Hidalgo" does not work as an adventure story, fantasy, cowboy story, historical truth, or even just a horse story. As a horse lover, I was doubled up in pain during nearly the whole film. If this actually cost $100 million to film, someone needs to be pursued for fraud. There are numerous quite good horse films out there -- "Seabiscuit", "Black Stallion", "Phar Lap" -- please do yourself a favor and rent one of those, and leave "Hidalgo" where it belongs...at the bottom of the discount bin....</fullReview>

I found myself watching the movie double speed with the subtitles on to at least get to the dialogue of the film before losing interest entirely. I don't think I have ever looked at a DVD display reading 38:00 minutes elapsed duration and considered it possible to be wrong. But that's where I found myself, at least able to rip the movie apart with friends while the obvious conclusion unfolded on screen.Do yourself a favour and rent/buy a different movie.</fullReview>

It seems like he assumed the character of Frank T. Hopkins with a lightness, which is incredible.

Viggo Mortensen and the lovely painthorse playing Hidalgo had chemistry, and I was impressed with Mortensen's riding -- like he was a part of Hidalgo. The smooth way he rode, without extraneous movement, is something difficult to achieve; you have to have balance and strength to ride like that.It is an outrage, however, that the mustangs are still slaughtered, starved, and unappreciated for their beauty, strengths, and brains.

		<shortDescription>A refreshingly clean piece of entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***minor spoilers***Finally.. an action movie that doesn't use the too-quick-for-the-eye type of editing that is used to compensate for bad special effects that appears in just about EVERY movie made today. Nor does it use the action to compensate for other aspects of the movie. The action is appropriate and not overdone.After reading a few of the other comments posted, I wonder if I saw the same version of the movie that others did. A number of people mention gaping holes in the plot. Admittedly the plot isn't one of the greatest and may have some minor holes, but some inconsistencies mentioned did not seem inconsistent to me.One was the "praying to the gods" scene that was mentioned to be out of place. It was a mirage of Frank's ancestor's, showing that maybe he finally has accepted the fact he is half Indian, and also the part he played in the final massacre of his people. It tied parts of the movie together nicely, especially when it was set on two different nations.The other was the explanation of how the other characters in the film could "beat" the fastest horses in the world to the mid and end points of the race. It was explained in the movie, but to reiterate, they used a road that went alongside the desert, thus allowing them to make faster progress. The horses running through the desert were mostly moving at a walking, or even crawling, pace through sand throughout most of the race. The heat of the desert and lack of food and water would have only made their progress even slower.Not necessarily a great movie, but certainly very entertaining and a visual treat.Okay, now that those inconsistencies are explained.... go and see it on the big screen while you can. It needs the large screen to do justice to the wide vistas. It may be a little long for some, but it's refreshingly crisp in editing and clean in content and dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>after I saw it because I loved it so much. Therefore, I searched Frank T Hopkins and Hidalgo on Google. Much to my dismay, I found nothing but negative stuff. It appears that Hopkins was nothing but a big story teller. Apparently, much of the tales he told of his life were apparently just that...tales. That sucks because I so wanted to believe in this story because of the inspiration it infused the audience with because of this bond between a horse and it's master.Evidentally, Hopkins didn't compete in most of the races he said, he never traveled with Wild Bill's show, and this 3000 mile race not only never happened but is geographically impossible. If they were to hold this race, it would end in like Romania or something (that is what experts say).None the less, I still scour the internet to find that one lonely article that says this whold thing was real (except for some of the parts that were a little far fetched).I loved the movie anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie. Thankfully it's G rated except for the action style violence.The action was well paced and the movie was not boring but also wasn't simply 100% action with no story or character development.There was some clever social commentary. Subjects touched upon: Loyalty, bravery, heart, betrayal, parental love, parent/child conflict, friendship, racism, Anglo-American/Native American conflict.The bad guys were somewhat likable. That's appropriate for a cute movie like this.There was some clever banter between the father and daughter that I enjoyed and appreciated.How can any scene in which Omar Sharif appears go wrong? His presence raises the caliber yet another several notches.Similar in tone to the movie "Raiders of the Lost Ark." That movie could be a litmus test for this one, if you liked "Raiders," you will like "Hidalgo."I saw some similarities to "Star Wars." For example the sand people looked and acted like the sand people in Star Wars, right down to the similar guns. The hero has hallucinations similar to the ones that Luke had after he escaped from the den of the snow creature, and the bad guy reminded me of Darth Vader.The movie was funny. We smiled and laughed a lot. There's a big laugh line near the end, the hero's sidekick is likable and funny, and the movie features comic communications from the horse. Silly, but funny.It was heartwarming and my wife cried. That's a good thing.As far as being based on a true story, there's some controversy over that. It's safer to say that it's based on literature that was passed off as autobiographical but may well have just been fanciful fiction with an ambitious marketing campaign.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea what this movie would be about before I went but being a Viggo Mortensen fan I was expecting to be impressed, however I must say that even I was surprised by how good this move is. The cinematography is absolutely top-notch. The desert has never looked as beautiful and desolate as it does in Hidalgo. Though the authenticity of the story may be debatable, I found that while watching the movie I was so engrossed I swallowed it hook, line and sinker.Viggo, as always, out does himself. He is simply superb as Frank T. Hopkins, his real-life bond with the horse, Hidalgo, is evident and quite something wonderful to observe. Viggo is in his element here and by all accounts a very gifted actor. A fine figure of a man in that outfit too, I might add!The horse, TJ, who plays Hidalgo, is full of screen presence and charisma! If there was a best actor Oscar for an animal he'd be the winner.*Warning, possible spoiler!*The kidnap scene came slightly out of left-field, but was necessary to keep the tension active and the story moving. The relationship between Frank and Jazira was treated with the uptmost respect. I'm glad it stayed in the realm of understanding between kindred spirits and didn't become farcically romantic (and hollywoodish!). The scene near the end where Frank sings to his ancestors is slightly twee, but ultimately works. My heart was breaking for the horse as he was clearly struggling, but the fact he was willing to try for Frank brought a tear to my eye.Strong performances from all the other actors and fair treatment of all the cultures involved make this a very enjoyable movie. As a horse lover and a Viggo lover, I recommend this movie to everyone. I've seen it twice at the movies and intend to see it at least twice more. Do yourself a favour and go and be entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is proof that we can be entertained without depravity, nudity, profanity, and drugs. We enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. It was simple, well edited, and had great continuity. Great cinematography, imaginative, and it reminded one of the great westerns of old. Many movies made today appear to be produced by people with attention span problems and are difficult to follow, but this one was well paced and enjoyable to watch. I hope to see more movies of this type being made in the future. It was refreshing to leave a movie theater feeling UP and not ashamed to be part of the human race. Also, it was refreshing to watch an innovative story line instead of the same old cookie cutter script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was a pretentious western. All in all, this was a combination of Sea Biscuit and Indiana Jones -- a horse race in the Arabian dessert, where the people's horse (a mustang) outraces the pure bred Arabian steeds -- all ridden by the stereotypical Arab bad guy that we met in Indiana Jones.In this film, instead of a race to possess the Holy grail, it is just for a mundane $100,000 cash purse.Just like in Sea Biscuit, a central character has some kind of spiritual ability to communicate with a horse. As in Indiana Jones we meet the bad guys, who are sword wielding screaming Arabs.The difference between Indiana Jones and this film is that in Indiana Jones it was all in fun -- no pretense that it was anything else but fiction for fun In Hidalgo, there was the ridiculous attempt to foist on the audience that this was a true rendition of an actual happening.The producers of this film must think the audience are fools. I can't imagine that anyone would actually believe someone above the age of 10 would think what was depicted in this poor attempt at an epic film has even a scintilla of a factual basis.Joe Johnson played his part like a poor man's version of Gary Cooper. His rendition of the central character was Gary Cooperish except when Mr. Cooper mumbled, it was understandable. Mr. Johnson just mumbled without bothering to realize that the audience has to understand the dialogue. The best actor in the movie was the horse.One star for the photography if it was not computer generated. If that's so, four stars for the programmers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1890 it appears there was little enough for a cowboy to do, so why not win some money racing the titular mustang, Hidalgo, against 100 of the best Arabian horses in the world-in Arabia! Viggo Mortensen, playing the legendary cavalry-courier Frank Hopkins, who supposedly won about 400 long-distance races, negotiates the sands, wily Sheikh Riyadh (Omar Sharif), his doe-eyed daughter, Jazira (Zuleikha Robinson), and a nefarious Brit blonde Lady Ann Davenport (Louise Lombard) to-Well, I'm not going to spoil the outcome because that is the only plot point worth anything.This is `Seabiscuit' on sand, a Western in the East with all the Hollywood clichés perfectly preserved from sun and wind. Does Davenport lust after the studly cowboy? Does the young daughter hope to snag the cowboy and toss off her veil? Is there a wicked Arabian contestant, guided by the scheming Brit, who will stop at nothing to win? These are just a few of the relentless plot antiquities chosen by director Joe Johnston (`Jurassic Park III') to move a weary plot to its obvious conclusion.I can't figure out how the film couldn't be suspenseful, but I began to feel it was all in real time as I reached for my bottled water in sympathy for Hidalgo and the cowboy. There was, however, a hint of intelligence when the idea of `infidel' was mentioned. Sheikh Riyadh refusing to touch the cowboy infidel lest sheikh lose his ability to see the future was intriguing, as was Riyadh's unwillingness even to touch the infidel. The Muslim culture is the most interesting part of the film. Contemporary mid-Eastern attitudes toward the West translate appropriately at the turn of the 20th century.`Hidalgo' might have been released last year. Now you know why it was not. It's arid and slow. Lightened only briefly by a simple shot of Sharif playing cards in a tent, a sly reference to his mastery of Bridge, something eminently better for him to do than playing a fatuous sheikh. Jizara asks Hopkins, "Why do I feel that you truly see me when others do not?" The answer is, like the film, obvious: She's taken off her veil. Robert Lynd said, `In choosing the winner of a horse race, a good guess may beat all the skill and all the special knowledge in the world.' I'm guessing Hopkins wins and the movie loses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In his first leading role since the huge success of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy I heard this was rated pretty terrible, I had to see why, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Jumanji, Jurassic Park III). Based on a true story, cowboy Frank T. Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) works at the Wild West Show run by Buffalo Bill Cody (Spider-Man's J.K. Simmons) who he is troubled by events at Wounded Knee and the treatment of Indians in the show. As he has been called the world's greatest endurance rider, Arabian Sheikh Riyadh (Funny Lady's Omar Sharif) challenges him to participate in the great race across the desert, and with his small mixed breed horse Hidalgo he accepts. Frank is against some of the world's greatest Arabian horses and Bedouin riders, most determined to stop him winning the 3,000 mile Ocean of Fire race which seems impossible. The race is difficult to achieve with drinking water running low, the desert heat increasing, sandstorms, other riders and strangers on the sands showing up, and some political plot going on. There are some battle scenes, Hidalgo gets a bad injury, but of course in the end Frank does indeed win the race, he uses the winnings to pay for the release of some other mustang horses, and he lets Hidalgo free to run with them. Also starring Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Sa?d Taghmaoui as Prince Bin Al Reeh, Louise Lombard as Lady Anne Davenport, C. Thomas Howell as Preston Webb, Malcolm McDowell as Major Davenport and Elizabeth Berridge as Annie Oakley. Mortensen is in essentially a Lawrence of Arabia style mode, with a little bit of Seabiscuit and Indiana Jones chunks thrown in, there might be the odd moment that gets your attention, but overall it was a little bit of a monotonous epic adventure. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful picture and nice entertainment... for kids!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing to jump into eyes at first frames is that picture work is done with lots of taste and artistry, and it doesn't disappoint us through the whole movie ? from the first scene of a melting ice on the water, through the gorgeous sunrises and swiftly moving clouds in the desert (a ready set for gorgeous PC wallpapers, hey!), stitched with awesome lighting on main character's face at crucial moments and till the final series of not so obvious but so subtle foreground-background self-speaking plans unleashing on us the powerful drive of wild nature and a human feeling and understanding it.Another pleasant thing about the movie is Viggo Mortensen's play of the main character. And I am very happy for Viggo! You know, after being used for years to see his face on second plans as some evil guy, I was surprised when they took him for one of the main good guys in the Lord Of The Rings, but he did a perfect Aragorn, he was above praise, above expectations. It was a discovery, I guess for many spectators. It is only to be happy for actors who come to it at last, not being probably so perfect in their looks nor extravagant as persons to make their way right to the Milky Way (much more sad for me was the discovery of Leonardo di Caprio, when I saw that as teenager he had shown himself as an ingenious actor while later they made rather a baby-doll from him). The above mentioned success had put Mortensen into the limelight, and here we see him starring again, and the actor himself now advertises for the movie, well like it happens to stars. Not to mention that after watching the documentary about horses for LOTR I guess Viggo was an obvious choice for this role if not the inspiration for the idea! :-) And he does not disappoint! He was wonderful. As strange as it can seem, although I don't feel too much sympathy for the character, I totally admire Viggo's work. How can I say it again in different words? He was fascinating! And other characters in majority were also very very well done, they were very bright and picturesque.But what of the story? It seems absolutely unreal through the whole movie. The characters are so conventional and so typical, the main hero charisma is so much a cliché that I didn't stop to ask myself what were they thinking of when making this movie? To remake an old western? I mean, "Nobody touches my horse" thing was at its top when I was a kid 25 years ago... And the conflict is too typical: our guy ain't bad, he wished bad to anyone, but everyone wishes his death and he stubbornly is going to make it however! And in the end all bad guys are either dead or turn out to be not so bad if not even good and his friends. Some moves in the plot were so exemplary, that they were beyond my expectations ? so simple, so banal, so noble... A fairytale, what to say. But in the end I discovered that it was actually based if not on a true story then on a true person's life... Amazing! There is one more inconsistency with my expectations that I discovered right at the beginning of the movie: the movie title is not about the man on the poster ? it's his horse's name! I just wasn't aware of that and it became a surprise. And this finally gave me the clue (the day after it) ? I remembered our favourite movies when we were kids, about all those wonderful animals ? and I think that's it: I was probably prey to commercialization mistake, and the film didn't seem all right as a normal movie if you compare with how they make it now (heroes with more cultural or intellectual depth, complex characters without obvious good/bad absolutisation). I think it will be a great new movie for kids like we haven't seen for a long time ? for them everything is in place: no ambiguity, not much psychology, kindness to Indians, central relationship man-animal, beautiful pictures, generous adversaries... And I guess for anyone who loves horses it will be a great movie too! A song of a horse and a rider's journey of will for victory...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Hopkins has the qualities of a truly legendary figure. I know Hollywood likes to embellish the story to make it more exciting. When you do the research on Hopkins, he won a lot of long distance horse races. The one in the movie, he actually won by 33 hours. Now, some people would like to discredit Hopkins achievements. The Library of Congress has the letter from the U.S. government to Hopkins for winning the Ocean of Fire race noting Hopkin's actual achievements. Certain professional horse breeders (The Long Rider's Guilde) would just as soon see his records go away because Hopkins did not ride thoroughbred horses. He did free all the mustangs depicted in the end of the movie with the money he won. Where else could he have gotten the money? Hopkins rode mustangs because they had the strength to endure hardship and keep going. If you only do a little research, you'll be amazed at what Frank Hopkins really accomplished while riding horses. It would have been better if the producers had noted the movie were based on a true legend at the start instead of the end credits. Too bad most people walked out of the theater before they found out the truth at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have rode horses. This movie was so over the top. The horse does ALL the running and all Viggo does is sit there. I was mad that Viggo pretended like he was tired all the time. How can he be tired when all he does is sit on the horse? The horse does all the work and the rider just sits there and takes in the sights. Viggo has obviously been in Aragorn mode too long. In middle earth, the way they rode horses was a lot different than in the old west. Why did Viggo ride like Aragorn? He needed to realize that no ring wraithes were on his tail. I noticed that the way he was riding was a lot like how he rode in return of the king. I was very mad about that. But the fact remains, that horseback riding is as easy as riding a car. You sit there, do not use really any energy and it's not all that hard. Shame on you Viggo. Shame on you!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pam tuned this in on Encore last night. We did not see the credits but she spotted Omar Sharif. She's good like that, said it was his eyes that were the giveaway. At first I told her Sharif could not need money that badly to accept such a part, but soon I realized she was right.I noted that someone seemed to have written a part for Maid Marian but with a veil. I think she was supposed to be Sharif's daughter. She had these ambitions to be a jockey and ride in the Kentucky Derby, but first she had to free Robin Hood, who then stopped someone from getting his head cut off. This was some fat balding Ay-rab, as opposed to Sharif's good Ay-rab, who had stolen some wonderful book. I dozed off for a bit when I heard Pam say that the horse was doing the best acting. She then predicted someone was going to buy the farm, and when the magnificently muscled Black guy, who seemed to be Greg Norman's buddy, did just that, she clucked in pride in guessing the plot line.I saw him meet his demise and realized that when action films are made today with White heroes, it is a requirement that same have buddies that are Black. Pam corrected me: that wasn't Greg Norman in the lead, but that actor whose name she could not think of. Then she showed true common sense by leaving to check her emails, leaving me with this mess on the screen. Her final comment was something about 'it's not The Wind and the Lion." I should say not. I tried other channels: AMC had 'Jewel of the Nile,' which is pretty mediocre and with commercials added, unpalatable, so I put Hidalgo back on and went back to sleep.I read one reviewer tell me that the film would appeal to us old fogies. Guess again....this was dreck. Two stars is kind. By the way, was that night attack on the village shot on a sound stage? It looked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as much an epic as the ads want to make us believe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It says that the movie "Hidalgo" is based on a true story. It probably should have said, 'based on a real person'. The story is mostly about a 3000-mile endurance race in 1890 across Arabia that Frank Hopkins and his Mustang 'Hidalgo' competed in. However, historians cannot find any evidence that such a race ever was held, much less held 'for centuries' as claimed in the script. Putting that aside, it has much of the flavor of an old time western - horses, guns, and people dying in the desert, all taking place in the Arabian desert. It also has the mandatory beautiful women, one a crooked British lady, the other a repressed Arab. Although a bit long at just over 2 hours, it is mostly entertaining, as long as you remember that it is a fable, not a biography.SPOILERS follow, don't read any further. Arabs came to America to protest the claim that Hidalgo was the best endurance horse in the world. They claimed their champion Arabian horse was the best, all that resulted in Hopkins and Hidalgo sailing across the ocean to compete. The competition is made more difficult by scheming to prevent Hidalgo from winning, but Hopkins eventually gets the upper hand. The Arabian princess also wants to help Hidalgo win, as it is the only way she will be spared marrying someone she cares nothing about. The race is hard, many die, and literally minutes before Hopkins is about to shoot the worn out Hidalgo to put him out of his misery, they see two other horses coming, Hidalgo gets up, and without saddle race to the finish line and win. Hopkins uses the prize to go back to Oklahoma and purchase from the government all the hundreds of penned up wild Mustangs and turn them loose again, for the Native Americans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lazy or sloppy research (at best)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hildago is a very poorly done horse movie. The research is some of the worst I've ever seen for the genre, and many children could have done better. The race on which the film focuses never existed, and the screenwriter has missed an opportunity to educate the public about a people of which it knows little. Sure, there are Hollywood stereotypes of Arabs aplenty (many examples are to be found in Hidalgo). However, most people have heard nothing of bedouin culture, and in this film John Fusco makes a mockery of it. These are the horse-breeding tribes of the desert. The people who greatly revere their horses. Yet here they are supposedly participating in a yearly race for over a thousand years in which their beloved horses routinely perish. The idea is pretty insulting as well as inaccurate, but the bedouin are not a powerful group so attacking their culture is apparently acceptable. The other really glaring error (among many) was the depiction of the treatment of guests. In this movie, there were many insults heaped on Hopkins by the bedouin. However, one of the oldest and most widely practised customs of the bedouin was the great hospitality shown to guests. Even someone who arrived at an enemy's tent and asked to be a guest was treated with honor and given the best the tribe had to offer. But Hopkins, who is an *invited* guest (by a sheikh no less), is on the receiving end of multiple nasty comments, and it is done in such a way that it seems routine to those present. Whereas if remarks in the movie were really said they would have brought great shame on the whole tribe. But that's Hollywood for you--make fun of the most important customs of a particular group, as long as that particular group doesn't have a way to defend itself.As to the horse scenes, well, they were beyond unbelievable. In one scene Hidalgo is apparently exhausted from lack of water, exertion, and the heat and Hopkins is shown dirty, sweaty, and sunburned (even to having chapped lips). But Hidalgo looks fresh as a daisy. His white markings are pristine. There is no sweat or dirt at all on him. He looks like a very healthy (and cool horse) that is lying down. Unfortunately, the movie has too many of these credulity-straining images. Give this film a pass and try a good horse movie like Seabiscuit, Phar Lap, or My Friend Flicka.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst movie i've ever seen in a cinema. Looking at the trailer my friends and me expected a cool "Indiana Jones"-like adventure movie, and sure there are a few cool scenes, like the dust-storm and the sword fighting. But it is pretentious; it pretends to bring a thorough and epic story but remains flat, vapid, predictable and it goes on and on and on for more than 2 hours!! The problem with "Hidalgo" is that it takes itself way too serious, it lacks any humour whatsoever.On a side note, it was released during the America/Iraq war, and i can't help but feel that some scenes are hinting a bit towards propaganda. The main character is a cowboy from the "free world" where anything is possible. And Iraq is shown as a country with rigid hierarchy, prearranged weddings, cruel punishments etc. Especially the ending scene with all Arabs chanting "Cowboy! Cowboy!" was just plain awkward to watch..In any event, i would not recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have nothing against fictionalizing 'history' (more about that below)-- after all, this is a movie. First and foremost it has to have cinematic entertainment value -- it should be a fun visual story.The problem is, it seeks to do this only by robbing other movie predecessors. They ride by in procession: "Lawrence of Arabia", "Last Samurai", "Thunderheart", "Raiders...", the sandstorm of "The Mummy"/"English Patient" ilk. Primarily this steals from "Gladiator": evidenced in the film speed/filter/editing rhythm changes during the 'Wounded Knee' prologue, the warrior picking up and feeling the soil of the battlefield, the camera movement during the sword/spear fights...It tries to carry too much at once, so it ends up tripping over the baggage left and right...there's no flow here, no élan.As for the history, this was a huge missed opportunity. Frank Hopkins was, by what few accounts there are of him, a notorious yarn-spinner, and he was full of canny know-how. How they could have made something of that! Something in the direction of "Sweet and Lowdown", or even "Interview with the Vampire"; some kind of story within the story, some ambivalence over the narrator's believability. Alas, no...we just get a dead story with a lifeless actor...would we know Mortensen was even alive if he weren't threatened with dismemberment? Even "Dances with Wolves" had more life because of the wonderful canvas it was painted on...this has zip, nada, no value and goes nowhere but in circles.</fullReview>

First it breaks free, then it runs down the street, take first road on the right, up the stairs where it sees the princess, over to her, then back, and just a hundred meters strait ahead, under the bridge, and last turn on the left, Hidalgo finds Aragon. Thats what I call one clever horse!!! But also Aragon is smart! He makes sure to enough shots in his gun, that he can take all the 3000 Arabian people down. And yes! When the gun is empty, all enemies are down! Good work, Aragon! Well, some might say that he is smart, that Hidalgo is clever, and that I'm am stupid, but when it comes to the truth....

		<shortDescription>An easy-to-watch Oriental flavored movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Omar Sharif is believable in the role of the sheik, even though he doesn't have so many lines in this movie. I think it's an easy-to-watch Oriental movie, because it doesn't give you the thrill you might expect when going to the movies. An Oriental movie is usually an exotical one. "Hidalgo" proves to have too many Western elements. Oriental people are seen as narrow-minded villains and, of course, a Western man should always be the winner. The Ocean of Fire could have been a wonderful experience. Instead, the director focuses more on human emotions, even though they are not so well developed. John has memories from the past while being at Wounded Knee, he is attracted by Jazira who proves to be a very beautiful woman, he is deeply affected by Hidalgo's injuries etc. There are too many elements and no one is developed in a proper manner. I would have personally preferred a development of Jazira's and John's emotional relationship, maybe just one passionately kiss, words of wisdom, an exteriorization of their emotions, probably a wedding at the end of the movie. The possibilities are unlimited.Omar Sharif is a very talented actor, but the script doesn't rise to his value, because the character he plays seems to be an easy-to-be-influenced kind of man, who doesn't stand up for a real sheik. A real sheik would have probably sentenced John to death with no discussions, even if his assumptions weren't real, as he is the one in power in those lands.Zuleikha Robinson is a very beautiful woman and has the potential of a successful young actress. I would like to see her in more movies, particularly in epoque kind of movies, as they are my favorite, because the past is more interesting than the present. One who doesn't know the mistakes of the past is condemned to repeat them."Jumanji" is probably Joe Johnston's most attractive movie, because it has the flavor of a real thriller. I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. Kirsten Dunst is a beautiful talented young actress and made her character believable, but she did her best in Neil Jordan's "Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles" while playing a hot young vampire, Brad Pitt's partner. Kirsten said once she was taught how to kiss by Brad Pitt. I would have enjoyed to be in his shoes."Jurassic Park 3" is probably Joe's worst movie, because it seems to be a too childish movie, with no believable climaxes. It's a man hunt, no interesting dialogue, not believable plot kind of movie. Compared to "Hidalgo", it's by far the most commercial one. It should have been one single movie "Jurassic Park", Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, and no sequels, because a sequel will never have the flavor of the original."Hidalgo" is a new experience for Viggo Mortensen. He played different interesting characters in his career. In movies like "The Lord of the Rings" or "A Perfect Murder" he made believable too strong characters. Aragorn is a powerful, emotional, friendly, brave character and David Shaw is a frightening, hot man, who seduces Emily Bradford Taylor. Gwyneth Paltrow and Liv Tyler are too wonderful on-set partners. Liv Tyler probably has deep emotional memories from the sets, because no one can forget Viggo. A powerful warrior, Aragorn and an out-of-this-world beautiful princess, Arwen would make a perfect couple. Chris Martin is probably jealous, because Gwyneth played alongside so many hot young actors, Viggo especially.I give this movie 6/10, because it didn't give me the thrill I was looking for, except for one scene where Hidalgo is attacked by two cheetahs, created using the attractive CGI technology and another one, when John tries to save Jazira, who was kidnapped by Prince Bin Al Reeh, the Oriental type of villain. I hope Joe Johnston will make a critically acclaimed movie and leave these easy-to-digest movies.Have a nice day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>movie is a lie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a lie. There was no 3000 mile race in the Arabian Desert. Historians have debunked this theory. The only evidence this ever existed was the tale of Frank Hopkins himself. That's it! The movie itself was a stereotype against Arabs. It consisted of scenes where Arabs are trying to fix horse races and kill Hopkins. Arabs are portrayed as savages. It is difficult to imagine that Disney would fund such a film and display it as "Based on a True Story" Such movies should never be made. Please do some research yourself and you will see this movie has no truth to it. The only good role Vigo Mortensen ever played was in Lord of The Rings. In fact that movie might have more truth than Hidalgo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horses, sand, stereotypes and overall bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horses, a really nice scenery (that is, if you like sand a lot), horses, rather stereotype relationships between a cowboy and Indians, and horses. That is in short what Hidalgo is about.I expected after reading the positive comments this would be a Seabiscuit meets Indiana Jones, but it is far from both. Conflicts between the cowboy and the Arab competitors, characters that stay on the surface... Never before my skip chapter-button has been used several times after another.You won't even care who wins the race, which characters get along during the movie. There's simply not a chance to get acquainted with one or more leading actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I even thought about going to this movie was because my boyfriend wanted to go with me. I hated the movie. The only reason I gave it a 2 was because it was a good time for me and my boyfriend to talk about things. I love horses... but you know... I think the lead guy... forget his name... starts with a V. He really should of picked a different movie to star in. He was so good in lord of the rings. Sheesh!I can't believe I paid money to see it.Not a good movie to see.I'm saving you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely terrible, bad acting, plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I must say I was shocked at the TERRIBLE acting in this movie. In a sewer of fake, awkward accents, Vigo Mortensen shows his lack of acting talent. Throughout this movie he whispers ALL of his lines, like as if that makes him INTENSE. It did NOT make him intense, it made him ANNOYING. He was going WAY over the top whispering to everybody. But he was not the only one delivering a stinker of a performance. The acting in this movie was enough to be distracting. I particularly did not like that FAT guy, who double crossed the King, who Frank Hopkins reffered to as "the deputy." He talked with a really high voice and his accent was SO terribly fake. My next biggest problem with this movie was the INCREDIBLE plot hole! The horse racers are racing across the desert...they are the fastest horse riders in the land, and yet, the BASE CAMP is able to EASILY beat the horse riders each time to the next rest stop. The riders are going from base camp to the next rest stop as fast as they can. And as they ride in, ragged and tired, there are all the same people and equipment from the PREVIOUS base camp waiting there for them! None the worse for wear! So we are supposed to believe that somehow these base camp people are beating the fastest horse riders in the land without even breaking a sweat! This happens TWO times in the movie. I was appauled! It made me think that the horse riders are just running around in a big circle! That is how it seemed in the movie. Another problem was the ICE COLD romance between Vigo and that HIDEOUS muslim girl. There is a HOT British girl who wants Frank (Vigo) but he turns her down because his heart has been stolen by the King's daughter. The daughter is totally ugly and has thick black hair that looks like sheep's wool, and big ugly fat lips. She is not cute or attractive at all. But the British girl is totally hot! She has BIG PERFECT BLUE EYES and beautiful hair, and she dresses very beautifully and has a lot of class. But Frank rebuffs her advances, and not for any really good reason. Then, he never even gets a real romance going with the muslim girl! So that left me really flat. Another thing that bothered me about this movie was the concept of how hard Frank Hopkins was supposedly trying. What was he really doing? The HORSE did all the work! He was just RIDING the horse. The horse was doing all the RUNNING! But the riders looked really tired and worn out. All they do is sit on the HORSE! And finally, there was not any good motivation for Frank Hopkins to be in this race at all. In the end, he uses the prize money for a noble cause close to his heart, but that is not explained at the BEGINNING of the movie. So there is no sense of rising action or impending doom. The audience is left without a clear definition of the ultimate goal of the character. Don't believe the hype on this movie. It is not as good as it looked to be in the previews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very awful movie from Joe Johnston, who could make very good entertaining movies in the glory past (Honey, I shrunk the kids, Jumanji), and a very interesting, nice drama (October Sky), but looks like he doesn't find itself since the Jurassic Park III. There is none, but really NONE original in the boring script, only great mistakes, very stupid resolutions (Hidalgos and Viggos awakening from the half-death at the end of the race is one of the most silliest trash I've ever seen) and a very bad Viggo Mortensen without any charm, talent and spirit. He's just on the screen, looking out of his head, and doing nothing. I don't think, he ever served the chance to play a main character in a major movie. Viggo, be happy with the money, you have from this and LOTR, live long, and please, get out of Hollywood - however not he is the one, who did terrible job on the set. Even the very talented James Newton Howard's score is boring, and Joe, what the hell has happened to you?</fullReview>
