		<shortDescription>Utterly Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an absolutely wonderful fantasy. I totally loved it.The dialog is brilliant. The humor is both bold, and subtle. The characters are archetypal.Matilda perfectly captures what it is like to be an intelligent person, trapped in the body of a child, and surrounded by idiots who control far too much of your life.The notion that bad people (even adults) deserve to be punished for their evil ways (even by children) is truly subversive. Any child who suffered through the countless typical abuses of unthinking, uncaring, and ignorant parents will truly love this movie. Those same unthinking, uncaring, and ignorant parents will probably hate this movie, unless they are wise enough to see the truth behind the fantasy.Despite the difficulties Matilda faces, like all good fantasies this movie has a wonderfully happy ending. I wish the same for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best "family movie" i've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>personally, i hate nauseatingly cute family movies, but this movie is great! I went to see it in the theatre because i had read the book, but i thought that it wouldn't even come close to it. But you know what? I enjoyed this movie more than the novel! I thought it wouldn't be faithful to the book and that it would have turned out to be one of those typical kids' movies, but there's nothing "cute" about mrs. Trunchbull! This has got to be one of my favorite films ever and it IS the best childrens' movie ever made. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has his heart in the right place!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a wonderful film - Not Dull for DAHL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm smart your dumb, I'm big your little, I'm right your wrong and there's nothing you can do about it!" What a catchphrase ? I could use that on my brother sometime but anyhow this was an influence on Matilda that made her strong and prepared her for her turbulent time ahead at school, especially with a nasty head teacher 'Miss Trunchbull'. Roald Dahl had written this book to show that a small girl like Matilda can show courage and get herself out of a bad situation, once the film had been made, everything I can remember from the book was alive with a sweet girl to a lazy Mum and Dad (played by Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman). I give this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Americanized, but still good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my most highly-anticipated films, 'Matilda' is both a treat and a disappointment. The casting of Mara Wilson as the title character is ingenious - the little girl exudes the qualities set forth in Roald Dahl's classic. Unfortunately, the filmmakers apparently could not resist the urge to alter the book, in which Matilda is British and lives in a small village. The movie version, of course, depicts Matilda as American, but what's worse, that she lives in a larger area. This detracts somewhat from the bucolic setting of the book, although not enough to create a starkly different environment.The casting of Embeth Davidtz as "Miss Honey" was another great choice. While not what I had pictured from the book, Miss Davidtz captures the warmth and energy of the young teacher. Pam Ferris, as the grotesque "Miss Trunchbull," is simply outstanding. Both her demeanor and her looks bring the book's character alive.'Matilda,' while straying from the book's true form, is still highly enjoyable to watch, especially for those of us who have read the Dahl's masterpiece. Those who enjoy 'Matilda' should also enjoy the movie adaptation of ``The Witches," another Roald Dahl classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quirky and Wonderful Slice of Magic &amp; Youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi hi!Danny DeVito touches on the viewpoint of children - and their imaginations - in this fantasy come to life: MATILDA.Who of us as children didn't see the world in the powerful images of youthful, innocent eyes? The horrific Agatha Trunchbull, the kindly librarian, Mrs. Phelps? The annoying big brother 'Mikey', or the wondrous, perfect teacher, Miss Honey? Who of us as children didn't see that some things in life were wrong and wanted to put them right - if only we had magic powers!Life as a child is fantastic and happy and exciting and scary. And in MATILDA we see all elements of childhood shine through by the intentionally ridiculous, over-the-top performances of Danny DeVito (Matilda's Dad), Rhea Perlman (Mom), and Pam Ferris (Ms. Trunchbull, the principal).And yes, there is a scary element to the movie: The chase in Ms. Trunchbull's house; the "Chokey"; the spooky scene of Matilda taking back "Lizzie Doll" from Ms. Trunchbull while "haunting" her house. But this is the scariness of youth; shown from a safe distance for even the young audience. And despite the scariness - which kids KNOW exists - Matilda and Miss Honey and all their friends are victorious. Danny DeVito has demonstrated a lesson well-learned from the Disney animated films of yesteryear: The more evil the villain, the more noble and victorious the heroine.To miss seeing MATILDA is to miss a heart-warming, hand-clapping, magical trip back to your childhood fantasies and ideals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Roald Dahl adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe this film best represents the themes behind Roald Dahl's rather subversive children's literature. It follows the continuity of both "The Witches" and "James and the Giant Peach," casting repulsive Trunchbull into the roles of Grand High Witch and repulsive evil aunt, with a bit of the ogre (especially during the chase in Magnus House).It's also pretty obvious that J.K. Rowling had read Roald Dahl long before she wrote the first of her Harry Potter books. I find it very odd how few people have noted Roald Dahl's literary influence on the spate of children's fantasy authors today. All the elements for Harry are here, in Matilda, right down to her unpleasant 'Muggle' family -- the Wormwoods -- and a brutish, Dudley-like brother. And for the record, Mara Wilson does a good job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Good Every Now &amp; Then</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics always get away with giving a lot of good movies the bad ratings. Matilda was one of them.I happened to think Matilda was particularly great. Mara Wilson did good as the title character, except on some levels she acted more like a kid, while more of an over-sophisticated teen on other levels. The only thing missing in her future is a part as the star character in yet another Alice in Wonderland project.Pam Ferris seemingly got the part of Ms. Truchbull for an obvious reason. No offense, but she's UGLY!! That best fit Ms. Trunchbull's personality.Danny DeVito was sort of trying to put a one-man act in the film. He was Matilda's dad, the director, and one of the producers.The other actors/actresses, Rhea Perlman, Embeth Davidtz, Brian Levinson, etc. did good as those they were acting as. That's what made this movie so wonderful. The casting was the right price.Again, the producers decided to wait until the original story writer passed away before making a movie from one of his works. The British story was somehow modified into an American perspective. One thing most people don't understand is how advanced Matilda's content is, even though it was probably intended for kids. That doesn't make it a bad thing; movies have to appeal to everyone in general, not just little kids. But other than that, Matilda was a real treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A wonderful and partly scary adaption of Roald Dahl's classic novel"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say 'Matilda' was one of my favorite Roald Dahl books as a child but the movie adaption isn't that bad. Matilda is a very bright and intelligent for a girl of her age. She's quite different from her grouchy and ignorant parents. Danny DeVito was good as Matilda's grouchy father, he often plays very grouchy characters. Mrs Trunchbull is as scary as she is in the book. She's worse than mean. She's a deranged and aggressive monster! She's an absolute monster! She hates children and does nothing except bully and intimidate them. As for Mrs Jennifer Honey she's the exact opposite of Mrs Trunchbull. She's kindest and sweetest teacher you could find. She's like a mother to her school children and tries to protect them, but unfortunately she to is intimidated by Mrs Trunchbull. So when Matilda develops these telekinetic powers, it is up to her to teach Mrs Trunchbull an ultimate lesson. I really liked the relationship Matilda has with Mrs Honey. It reminds me of the relationships I had with certain teachers at school. So I would say this movie is both frightening and touching at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of our favorite family movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My daughters (ranging from age 9-16) have loved this movie for several years. I am normally a very sensitive person and wasn't disturbed by the macabre tone of the movie. Somehow the movie remains upbeat as Matilda is able to find someone who will love her even though her parents don't appreciate her. Young Mara Wilson shines as Matilda. Each time I watch this I am amazed at her talents at such a young age. I haven't heard of her making any films lately...I hope this is by her own choice. In addition, Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Pam Ferris, and Embeth Davidtz all were wonderful in their roles as Matilda's parents, principal and teacher, respectively. I have read the book, and yes, it is different as far as the setting goes, but in my opinion, they've kept the main ideas quite intact. Movies are almost never the same as books, because by definition they can't be. We have enjoyed watching this as a family for at least 5 years now and will continue to. I just wish they'd release a special edition DVD with COMMENTARY. I'd love to hear from Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman about the making of this someday classic movie. At least it is in my family. My criterion for a classic? We are constantly quoting its script to each other.UPDATE: They DID release a special edition. It does have some fine extras, but I have to wonder why in the world didn't they offer a widescreen edition? That is a big disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kids nothing, I am 22 and I still love this movie. Unfortunate that it does not get played more often.I really can't think of any kid who would not want to be Matilda in this movie. Though she basically gets treated like dirt her whole life, she discovers that she can get even.To this day, the Trenchbolt lady still freaks me out. The scene where she throws the girl over the fence is burned into my brain. Really scares me just how much Matilda's family reminds me of my idiot cousin who had two kids by the time she was my age. The moral of the story is this, having kids you don't want is never a good idea. It will wreck your life, and it will wreck your kid's life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie, which celebrates Matilda's love for books and learning as opposed the greed, anti-intellectualism, and consumerism of her parents. Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman are terrific as Matilda's awful parents. And the character of the school principal is also terrific in a terrible, larger than life way. I don't remember the name of the actress, but she did a terrific job. I think the film really captures the feel of Roald Dahl's book, and contains some of the same kind of dark, wacky elements of some his other books that have been made into films, e.g., Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie. It is dark, funny, charming and brooding, and captures the essence of the book perfectly. By the way, I love the book as well, and consider Roald Dahl one of the finest authors of children's books, look at the BFG for evidence. The whole film is beautifully photographed, looking lush and crisp. Mara Wilson gives a very spirited performance as Matilda. Sure she's not the same as Quentin Blake's illustrations, but I preferred the changes. Danny Devito and Rhea Perlman were great as the parents. As for Miss Honey, I have never seen Embeth Davidtz look so lovely, and that's the truth. Indisputetably, the acting honours go to Pam Ferris as the tyrannical Miss Trunchball. I have never seen that side of Pam Ferris, and in real life, she is not as ugly as they made her. The Bruce Bogtrotter scene was enough to make you feel sick for a week, and you don't feel that in the book. The added scenes like in Magnus's house was a nice touch, and I also loved how dark Devito made it, mixing a bit of humour too. And the music score is superb. Check it out! 10/10.

		<shortDescription>A Truly Great Film From Dahl and DeVito</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summer of 1996 was an exciting time. Despite being one of the most popular children's authors of the modern era, very few films adaptations had been made of Roald Dahl's work, and now all of a sudden, two were coming out in the same year. Of the two, I was much more excited for James and the Giant Peach, a classic of my childhood. To my surprise, Matilda ended up being the stronger film, and a movie that's endured with many children who grew up in the late '90's. I appreciated Matilda when it came out, and over the years it's really grown on me. Even as an adult, it's a movie I love and remember very well.What I love about this story, both in the book and in the movie, is that it empowers children to be independent and not rely on parents and educators, who are portrayed as far from perfect but very flawed. Matilda is a gifted, resourceful, and kindhearted little girl. Yet her parents are self-absorbed, ignorant buffoons who barely know how old she is, and her principal is an abusive tyrant. Only in her teacher does she finally find someone who supports her. I think this rings true to a lot of children. Miss Trunchbull, while obviously exaggerated for comedic effect, represents a problem that I think exists in many schools: educators are more concerned with discipline and authority than they are with actually helping students.What makes this movie so great is how much heart it has. A lot of Dahl's writing is so wacky and grotesque that I don't think it works on film (The Witches had that problem). Matilda tells a very human story, even when it does get grotesque. Mara Wilson and Embeth Davidtz both do an excellent job and carry the weight of the film. Danny DeVito's direction also deserves credit. DeVito seems to really "get" Dahl's writing; I especially love the way he directs the "chocolate cake" scene. Another director would've had a difficult time making chocolate cake seem like a punishment, but DeVito sets up and shoots the scene in a way that gets under your skin. I love the way he manages to make the cake look disgusting and the Cook look a little creepy. It's little touches like that that make the film great. I also admire DeVito's decision to play dual roles: he plays Matilda's unpleasant father and he is also the story's narrator. This makes the story seem very personal and his narration truly captures the heart of the tale.The movie is not 100% faithful to the book. Yes, the story is Americanized (though Miss Trunchbull remains British), and some new material is added probably to make the story more commercial (such as a subplot with two bumbling FBI agents, and a thrilling scene where Matilda returns to Miss Trunchbull's house at night). However, these additions do not hurt the story at all, but actually flesh it out. In my opinion, a lot of Dahl's books suffered from weak climaxes, but this film gets it right, while at the same time retaining everything that made Dahl's writing shine.Dahl and DeVito clearly remember that being a child can be a very scary time. Adults tower over you and have the power to bully you. This film captures that, and its power continue to live on as children continue to embrace it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the children's book by Roald Dahl about a brilliant, self-sufficient youngster from an outrageously dysfunctional family developing her telekinetic powers and using them when the time is right. A triumph of art direction and special effects wizardry, however the film, directed by Danny DeVito (who also narrates and plays Matilda's father), is perhaps too stuffed with gimmicks and feels a bit top-heavy. DeVito does a fine job at mounting this story, but it might have been more rewarding without the smeary food fights and overacting adults. The climactic moments lose laughs because of this overkill, and there's an odd preoccupation throughout with gross-out humor and gluttony. A fun show for the first hour. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

I loved Embeth Davidtz performance too, purely because she was so sweet, and was perfect to play Miss Honey.I loved Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman's characters too, and I thought Rhea's performance was particularly strong at the end.

But they can also watch it, they'll have fun! :)I've never seen such a lovely film, which was made for children as well as for grown-ups. There is a good ratio between entertain and heavy thoughts. But neither of them are too much. The actors play excellent as well. I don't agree with other opinions which say that the end of the film was flat. It wasn't at all. It could be flat for anyone who doesn't read between the lines. Yes, the answer that was given could seem flat (something magical power to defeat the evil), but it couldn't give us the ultimate answer, because it doesn't exist. We have to find our own answer.

But these are all books that I read later, when I was 7, 8 or 9. My first book of him was Mathilda.I can honestly that there is no other book that I have read, adored , and loved as much as Mathilda. So when I watch a movie based on something so dear to me, and imagined by somebody else, then my mind just doesn't accept it.It's like I said, I can't help it! Actually, this movie isn't bad, I even liked it! But the thought of Mathilda as a movie, makes me want to tear out my hair.

		<shortDescription>A slightly exaggerated tale of a little girl not appreciated by her family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matilda (Mara Wilson) was just born into the wrong family. Her dad is a crook in the used auto business, and her mother lives in her own little world where nothing is more important than herself. Matilda goes to the most depressing school run by the most Nazi-like Principal anywhere, but has the nicest teacher anyone could want. This movie is the tale of this little girl and her teacher, and how they helped each other to achieve happiness. Not to be taken too seriously, mostly a fun comedy where we can cheer when the bad guys get what is coming to them. The filming technique uses lots of wide angle close up shots, which distorts features, especially of the bad guys.SPOILERS follow. Danny DeVito directed and narrates. His narration is nice and in stark contrast to his role as Matilda's dad, Harry Wormwood, who is clueless about how to be a dad. DeVito's real world wife, Rhea Perlman, plays Zinna Wormwood, Matlida's clueless mom. Pam Ferris bravely plays the mean, overbearing Agatha Trunchbull, Principal of the school, dressed like a Nazi teacher might have been. She has pictures of the school children on her dart board for target practice. We learn as the story develops that she was the aunt of the nice schoolteacher, 'Jenny' Honey played by Embeth Davidtz, having raised Jenny after both her mother and father died, the latter mysteriously. So Jenny remained as a teacher only because of her aunt.Matilda is smart, polite, likes to read and learn, all things foreign to her parents. In class, we see that she can multiply very large numbers in her head. At school, she is the only student who stands up to Ms, Trunchbull. Then Matilda finds that she has the power to move things by thinking about them, especially when she gets angry. She uses this near the end by having a chalk write a message on the board, to Ms Trunchbull, from 'Magnus', Jenny's father whose death we come to believe was caused by Trunchbull. The message told her to leave and never come back. Fortunately Matilda's parents are also rushing to leave, "to move to Guam", and Matilda conveniently has "adoption papers" handy, which her parents sign so that she can become jenny's daughter. They end up in Jenny's childhood home, with Trunchbull out of the picture, and jenny the new school Principal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My idea of a kid's movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my 4 year-old daughter's favourite films, and it's not hard to see why. Roald Dahl's stories have always appealed to children whose view of the world is more realistic than most, and Danny DeVito understands this more than most directors. His use of wide-angle shots and shooting from kid's-eye level and parent's-eye level beautifully conveys the feeling of outsidership that is so prevalent in Dahl's work. To boot, he's assembled a fantastic cast of character actors who breathe life into what could have easily been a one-dimensional pandering to the younger set. No, DeVito wants his audience (and their parents) to stick around and enjoy this wonderfully subversive variation on Stephen King's Carrie. This is a wonderful companion piece to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and The Witches. Check it out and you'll be rewarded for your efforts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first got this movie on DVD when I was going into my Junior High School years of my education, and I actually bought the DVD of this movie with my own money not long after I first learned to pay for things. Ever since I watched it for the first time in my life when I got it into my DVD player, this has been a film for audiences of all ages that I've always loved. Some of the things I love about "Matilda" are the comedic acting of Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman as Matilda's parents, and the beautiful teacher Matilda has for first grade, Miss Honey played by Embeth Davidtz (Schindler's List). I also think the visual effects of Matilda using her magic powers and the song "Send Me On My Way" by Rusted Root are cool and catchy. I personally think that this film should have received Academy Award nominations for Best Visual Effects, Best Actress Embeth Davidtz, Best Director Danny DeVito and Best Picture, for which it would win for Visual Effects and Embeth Davidtz as Miss Honey. I would highly recommend this great movie to anyone who loved "The Princess Bride" or "Babe" as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matilda's March for a Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1996 film, Matilda, has been a classic ever since it was released. This movie is one of my personal favorites due to its humorous yet touching plot. If you're looking for the perfect film to watch with your family all snuggled up with a bag of popcorn, this movie is for you. Due to its appeal to both young and old audiences, this movie is hard to criticize. While most of the movie is light-hearted due to Matilda's charming innocence amongst the negativity around her, other parts of the movie exhibit heart-wrenching situations that a kid shouldn't have to endure, efficiently teaching genuine life lessons about the importance of family. Matilda, only five years old at the start of the movie, is the youngest person in her family. Her parents barely acknowledge that she's alive by constantly favoring their older son, Michael, and disregarding anything that Matilda says. The audience is immediately attracted to Matilda's polite charm and ability to stay positive despite the fact that her family has neglected her. At just five years old, Matilda learns to live by herself; cooking and cleaning without any help from her family. Although a five year old providing for his or herself is wrong and meant to be sympathized, the audience can't help but adore Matilda's charisma and innocence in what should be a sad and somber situation. When Matilda's burning desire to learn finally convinces her dad to enroll her in school, she meets many people that actually care about her. Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey, and all of her classmates are amazed at the amount of knowledge she already has at such a young age. On top of being the smartest in her class, Matilda is also well-liked by her peers. It is encouraging for the audience to see Matilda finally getting the attention she lacks at home. At school, Matilda's best friends, Lavender and Hortensia, constantly urge her to use her secret telekinetic powers. When the evil principal, Miss Trunchbull, came to Miss Honey's class one day, Matilda used her telekinetic powers to spill Miss Trunchbull's water glass everywhere to make her leave the room. By giving Matilda fictional telekinetic powers, it creates a sense of magic that both young and old audiences can relate to. Amongst the trouble that Matilda goes through at home, the magical powers she has can be seen as a symbol of strength. One of the main reasons that this movie is outstanding is because it's not only adult-friendly, but it's also kid-friendly. The plot is a perfect combination of serious and humorous events. The beginning part of the movie displays more of the darker events in Matilda's journey, such as being neglected from her family. However, in the latter part of the movie, the mood is rejuvenated when Matilda is adopted by her loving teacher, Miss Honey. By creating Matilda as sweet and lovable young child, it helps reiterate the theme that family should never be taken for granted. No matter what age, every person deserves a support system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story of a girl, story of life.Matilda, Miss Trunchbull, Miss Honey,... Names that will remain in my head forever.Matilda was my childhood favorite movie. When I was 12, I watched it almost everyday, mostly at the school's video club during lunch times, till I turned 15. I love this movie because it is entertaining, touching, funny, the dialogues are convincing, actors are playing their roles with great success and the music from David Newman that perfectly fits to the movie is just beautiful and pleasant to listen to. I read the book many times and this movie is one of the rarest production that preserves the story and the atmosphere from the book. Of course, some details and scenes from the book have voluntary been cut or re-adapted but these changes doesn't affect on the magic of the writing. Mara Wilson is a great actress on it. Her leading role as a kid suffering from misunderstanding by her family, leading her to use later on her "special ability" to gain respect from her surrounding or bring some justice back is just perfect.When I was a kid, this movie touched me because I identified myself to Matilda. After parent's divorce, my childhood life was the same as Matilda's: parents looked upon me as nothing more as a scab and I had some nasty teachers. The movie helped me a lot to keep some happiness. I am 24 right now, and I decided to watch it again. It's the only movie in the world in which I can spend hours watching in a row in circle like a kid without feeling bored. And watching it one time is enough to bring some joy of living for a few days. My future kids will love it.This movie is universal for a whole generation, even if unfortunately, it's not very famous. It deserves to be because it's a lesson for kids and parents about life. But I spread this beautiful piece of art amongst my friends and they all enjoyed it. It deserves a bluray adaptation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to watch "Matilda" all the time when I was a child, it was (and still is) one of my favourite childhood films. I believe that "Matilda" is a under rated and unappreciated classic. Now I may be bias towards it because my childhood links still remain their but do honestly believe this is kiddie films at its best! Danny Devito not only fabulously hams it up as Matilda's hilariously awful father, but he also directs it perfectly. The pacing is just right along with some really impressive cinematography for a kiddie film. Danny adds in some fantastic shots and knows how to move the camera and when.The screenplay is also really great. It closely and faithfully follows the book as well as adding some even more hilarious scenes including the break-in to Miss Trunchball's house which always has me in side-splitting hysterics! It's full of dark humour and sharp wit, guaranteed to make you belly laugh in every scene.The real scene-stealer and the thing that makes this film so funny is Pam Ferris' performance has "Miss Trunchball" the cartoonish over-the-top head mistress of "Crunchem Hall". I'm serious when I say that she should've got Oscar nominated! Pam Ferris just absolutely goes for it, filling the character with such energy and life. Her performance has me in fits of laughter. She says it all herself as she slams a desk to the other side of the room with a psychotic gleam in her eyes, "and I have character!" Yes she does and she truly is one of the best characters in a film. What makes her so great is that we all know someone who is just like Miss Trunchball (scary thought) through her over-the-top exterior lies someone who is actually quite realistic and that is a really credible thing to do.Which brings me on to another great thing about "Matilda" everyone hams it up and gives a really energetic performance. The cartoony characters that you read in the book just gleefully leap to life on screen. Just imagine the worst parents you could think of and times that by 10 and you have Matlida's parents. Think of the worst imaginable head mistress and times that by 10 and you have Miss Trunchball. Basically every character is full of life, making for a truly perfect kids film.If you have kids, you can guarantee they will love this (unless they're psychotic little buggers who are too hard to please!) and parents would love it too, if not even more so! I'm 16 and still watch it, and I watch it with even more delight than when I was younger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best family movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid, I read the book and when I found out there was a movie version, I was SO excited! The movie took the book in places it had never been (I admit, I disliked a lot of places it took, most notably the messing around in the Trunchbull's house, but it was mostly true to the story).Recently, I've toyed with the idea of what I'd like to see in a re-make of this movie. But a lot of what made this movie good would likely stay in place. One aspect of this film that couldn't possibly be done any better is Pam Ferris' performance as the Trunchbull. She is terrifying and looks almost exactly like the Quentin Blake illustration from the book.The movie is perfect as a family film. It is, at times, bogged down by some bizarre additions to the plot (like the cops watching the house, while that was briefly mentioned in the book, it wasn't necessary for the movie because it simply wasn't that important a plot point and, as mentioned before, Matilda's excursions in the Trunchbull's house didn't really work that well either). But what this movie does right, it does very well. The narration never takes away from the plot and it's an example of narration done right. Some of the elements that are added do work well, such as establishing the Trunchbull as superstitious and actually showing the shady car lot where Mr. Wormwood works. For example, the book talks about Matilda's father's business in one chapter and then it's hardly mentioned until the end. The movie actually shows what he does to each car and that definitely adds to the story. The use of forced perspectives really add to the film as well because you really do feel like a child.If you're looking for an absolutely perfect adaptation of Matilda, this isn't your movie. But if you're looking for a darn good one, I think you'll like this. And if you haven't read the book, the story is still coherent and the movie still entertaining. I'd recommend this to anyone, both young and young at heart. Despite some parts that don't follow the book, I really like this movie and it deserves a 10/10.On a side note, there is a musical based on the book this movie was based on. It's fantastic. If you liked this movie, you'll probably like the musical too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This happened to come on the TV.Matilda is the most perfect, cutest, smartest, kindest little girl in the world. Her parents are the most low-class, self-absorbed, stupidest parents in the world. Matilda goes to school with the most evil principal in the world. The principal hates children, and like a boogy-man is always trying to scare them and hurt them. But this is a children's movie, so no one actually gets hurt. The teacher is the most beautiful, sweetest, kindest, understanding and wonderful teacher in the world (on the blackboard the Word of the Day is "Butterfly".) All the classmates are sweet and cute: the only bully in the school is the principal.Everyone is afraid of the principal, even the teacher, but not Matilda. She has already mastered dealing with her evil parents, so it's just a matter of finding the principal's weak spot. There are some scary chase scenes, but everyone escapes the principal's clutches safely. Matilda is smart and brave, and is able to finally overthrow the tyranny of the evil principal.In the end, the good end well, and the bad end badly, ("which is why it is called fiction".) Like everything else in the movie, it is the most happiest ending in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always loved this film! It's like 'Carrie' for children. Usually once or twice a year, I find this on TV, so I watch it. I have it on VHS, but it's buried under my 7,000 movies. My aunt, uncle, and I watched this recently and they liked it also. They had never seen it. A smart, lonely girl named Matilda has a terrible family who hate her. When they finally let her go to school, she has a sweet sexy teacher named Miss Honey, and a mean principal named Miss Trunchbull. When Matilda is fed up with people mistreating her, she gains special powers where she can move things with her mind. It has an awesome cast, awesome plot, and awesome characters. It's also a childhood favorite. If you love family comedies, you'll love MATILDA!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Little Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roald Dahl's short story for children was produced and adapted for the screen by Danny DeVito who also stars in it along with his wife in real life Rhea Perlman. They play the parents of Matilda, a child they neglect with some amazing powers and resourcefulness.The British origins of the story are unmistakable even though the location is in America with DeVito in that most American of occupations, a used car dealer. DeVito is typical of the breed and Perlman is from the Peg Bundy school for mothers. Young Matilda played by Mara Wilson has learned to be resourceful on her own.When her parents finally send her to school she meets up with a real adult friend and a real adult enemy. She meets an empathetic teacher in Ms. Honey played by Embeth Davidtz and a principal from the Buchenwald school of education in Pam Ferris.Please note the Dickensian names for the characters. Ms. Honey is the good teacher, Matilda's parents are the Wormwoods and Ferris's principal has a really great character name in Agatha Trunchbull. There's something between Davidtz and Ferris, but I can't reveal that because it's part and parcel of the story.Matilda ranks right up there with Dahl's other children's fantasies like Willy Wonka and James And The Giant Peach. Kids of all ages will admire Matilda's pluck and the hidden powers she possesses. And Ferris as Ms. Trunchbull will scare any kid.Good Lord, she scared me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Matilda' takes this movie far all by herself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Matilda" is a movie starred, narrated and directed by Danny DeVito. Not a tremendous film, but reasonable and interesting.The main character is Matilda, the character that gave name to this movie. Matilda is a sweet and innocent little girl who happens to be very smart and possesses an extraordinary intelligence since very early childhood. She also has some amazing powers, which she doesn't realize at first.However, Matilda's parents and brother are a bunch of jerks. They are stupid, they have no brain, they only care about watching television, they have no culture or motivation to read and they openly despise Matilda and even mistreat her for being intelligent. But Harry (the father) is the worst of the three. Matilda's brother is a dork, the mother is unemployed and plays bingo daily, while Harry sells overpriced crappy cars.And yet, Matilda makes friends easily at school and has the teacher any student would like to have: the kind-hearted Miss Honey - she is not only a beautiful person but also hot. However, the school principal, Agatha Trunchbull, is a real monster. She dresses like a Nazi, she is an ex-Olympic champion and she is a horrible woman. The way she treats children is awful and the way she talks about them is disgusting.Miss Trunchbull's creepy punishments include throwing kids into the air or out of the window, grabbing them and let them fall on the ground with no mercy, yelling at them, threatening them and even locking them in the chokey (which is scary as hell). They can't even breathe in her presence. And she is cruel for the kids even for no reason at all.One of the creepiest lines by Miss Trunchbull is «Some rats are gonna die today...»Mara Wilson steals the show as little Matilda. She was a terrific child actress, I wonder what ever happened to her. This is one of her finest roles.Mara Wilson was a very talented little girl and this is one of her best roles and performances. Plus, Mara Wilson was a very cute and adorable little girl, especially with that red bow on her head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Slight Spoiler) When I first saw 'Matilda', I was visiting my aunt in Colorado. I have to say, that movie was a turning point for me. I sat myself down, and watched the movie three times in a row-- no joke. By the time my visit was over, I had decided something. I no longer wanted to be a teacher, or a princess, or a superhero. I wanted to be a six-year-old girl with telekinetic powers and a love of books (something that called to me, being a natural bookworm). Matilda isn't just a fun comedy to entertain the kids, though. It has it's moments of drama-- today even, the scene of Ms. Honey and Matilda in the home of the Trench puts me on the edge of my seat. And the all-important lesson that every movie needs to have; that even a child can make a difference. Matilda is ridiculed and treated like nothing all her life, and yet she still rises to the occasion and enacts a revenge worthy even of Fred and George Weasley (Harry Potter). 'Matilda' is a great movie, that is sure to bring the audience laughing and sympathizing right along with the brilliant, funny, wonderful Matilda. A great movie that everyone will enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no film that is better than Matilda! Its a wonderful, thoughtful and very enjoyable for all ages and genders.The film is an adaption from Rhoal Dal's classic story about a Girl who has had to put up with her horrible parents and there evil son. They are totally unaware of Matildas ability's and spend most of there time gambling and selling junk cars. It was up then to Matilda that even though her parents could not care less about her, that she would try to get them to see her point of view. Fortunetly, one day her parents actually listen to her and enrol her in the place she would always wanted to be: School. While at school away from her dreaded parents, she gains friends and her knowledge expands even more ( As she is already a whizz in the books anyway) But while she is also at school, she realises her full potential of her rare ability to pick up objects with her mind. With this ability, she plans to get back at her parents, her evil brother, and the child hater Miss truchball, the head of her school.This magical, fun and adventurous adaption of the classic tale of Matilda from rhoal Dal's book is a lighting and exciting story which involves many things that will make you want to see the film again and again. The plots excellent, the actors are perfectly suited to the film, and above all, the film is great and endlessly fun for all ages and the family. I will definitely watch it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another excellent adaptation of a Roald Dahl novel starring one time prolific child actor Mara Wilson. The story is about a little girl called Matilda, who after years of being ignored by her parents and bullied by her evil headmistress Miss Trunchbull,discovers that she has magical powers.This film is basically about how she uses these powers to sort her life out. Danny Devito,who directed and narrated the film,does well as Matilda's crooked father and his real off screen wife,Rhea Perlman is also good as her air headed mother.However i think the real stars of the film are Mara Wilson,Matilda, and Pam Ferris who plays the evil head Miss Trunchbull. This is a pretty wholesome family movie but Miss Trunchbull is so evil that she even gives me the creeps.She throws children out of windows,spins them around by their hair and in one pretty disturbing scene she makes a child eat an enormous chocolate cake which he does with a little help from Matilda. Of course being a family film Miss Trunchbull does get her comeuppance. As i said this is a family movie bur some parents might be a bit wary of showing the film to very young children as bits of it are quite frightening. In the end Matilda discovers that her magic comes from within and that everyone has a little of that magic in them. I give this film 8/10..</fullReview>

I think kids would love it because Matilda is a strong and smart character in this film. Plus, its got some GREAT funny scenes, especially the "cake eating" episode - any kid would love that! It's lots of fun to watch and I think that the main character actress does a wonderful job at convincing the audience that she deserves more than her family (or principal for that matter) gives her! Its definitely full of creativity and imagination. Probably best suited for kids who are a bit older (not pre-schoolers) since the principal in the movie is a 'bad lady' and can be a bit intimidating at times. Overall-I enjoy this movie a lot and can't wait to share it with my kids when they are age appropriate for it.</fullReview>

My youngest is 4 (almost 5) and I think that maybe she was a bit young for it. I explained to them that it was a good way of showing that not all adults are good, but I still think she was too young. They did go on to enjoy the second half of it more because it got less abusive and more revengeful and fun.As for similarities to the book - well I have read the book, but it was so long ago that I couldn't remember any of it.

(If it HAD to be cast with Americans, maybe Steve Buscemi would be a much rattier Mr. Wormwood!)

This film came from the fantastic mind of Roald Dhal and if any of you have ever read any Dhal then you will know how it can change your view of the world forever. This film is a masterpiece and will more than likely never be considered for it's apparent qualities. It has taken the conjuring of one of the world's greatest children's authors and made it real. It has encapsulated all that it means to be young and the power that we once felt. The direction is flawless and the acting of the young actress is spectacular. I think that if we all just indulged in films like this and picked up those simple messages then the world would be a much more glorious place to live in. But alas I think we all prefer to wallow in the hideousness of the world rather than what we can achieve if we only value our young. I can't really say much about the relative artistic merits of this film barring the fact that it is well scripted, acted and directed. I just know how it makes me feel and that feeling is an overwhelming feeling of joy and power. Now I have always considered art to be of a high quality if it evokes an intense wave of emotion in me. ?Matilda' does this and so I don't need to analyse it. I never question a Van Gogh painting when I look at it, I simply enjoy the vision. Dhal and DeVito evoke similar emotions in me and so I pay homage to them with this review. Thank you both for lifting the veil of cynicism and woe which so often hangs over me. Thank you for showing me that maybe life isn't all that bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singaporean 6&amp;7 year olds write reviews during a holiday course.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My class of primary 1 and 2 students ( 6 &amp; 7 years old) have just finished a week's holiday course here at the British Council, Singapore, where the week's topic was Roald Dahl's "Matilda" - book and movie snippets. The students are all non-English speaking children (Mandarin is their first language, though they use English at school), so I think their work is pretty good. And we all enjoyed their movie (though I enjoyed their reactions more, as watching the movie week after week gets a bit tiring!) Here's a small selection of what was written:My favourite characters are Miss Honey and Matilda. Matilda has long brown hair and likes to read books. She is really smart. I really didn't like Miss Trunchbull because she is so cruel. I think the funniest part of the movie is when Zimma tries to take Harry's hat off and he falls in to the cakes. The scariest part is when Miss Honey and Matilda go to the Trunchbull's house and the best part is when Miss Honey and Matilda get to live together. I really like the movie a lot because it is so interesting.by Davinna Lim, 7My favourite character is Miss Honey because she is lovely. I really don't like Miss Trunchbull because she is cruel. I think the scariest part of the movie is when Miss Trunchbull punishes the children. I really like the movie because I like Miss Honey. I think she is sweet. I wish my teacher was like her.by Tina Hung 7My favourite person is Miss Honey because she is so friendly. I was scared of Miss Trunchbull because she is so fierce. The funniest part was at the end when everybody threw their lunch at Miss Trunchbull. I liked the movie a lot because it was quite funny &amp; scary too. I'll tell my friends to go and see it.by Jian Tong 6</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyable story about a sweet young genius with absolutely horrible situations to overcome (family &amp; school) before she finds true happiness with a stranger. Would have been better if a bit shorter. School principal overdone and too long -could have gotten the point across with less clubbing over the head. Also a little bit hard to believe the parents could be so awful -would not recommend showing to very young children for this reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Carrie" for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember as a child watching Matilda, I thought it was the coolest movie and wished so badly to be like Matilda. But I only saw the movie on TV, it was one of the rare movies I didn't have on VHS. So I hadn't seen the film since I was a kid, but I noticed while I was at the store that they had Matilda on DVD for five dollars. I didn't really hesitate to buy it and feel some good old nostalgia. Being a kid of the 90's was an awesome time, we had some great shows and this was the last time where movies were very cutting edge and not afraid to scare or to not insult the audience's intelligence. I couldn't wait to watch this again thinking that this film was so cutting edge at the time, but now realizing as an adult, this film is kinda mean spirited.Matilda is an intelligent child; however, her gifts are unappreciated by her family. She is left alone in the house all day while her father Harry, works as a crooked car dealer, her mother Zinnia goes to play bingo and her bullying older brother Michael goes to school. Matilda is enrolled at Crunchem Hall Elementary School, where children are routinely terrorized by the cruel principal, Trunchbull. But Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey, is a kind and caring woman. Miss Honey attempts to appeal to Miss Trunchbull and Matilda's parents, but they refuse to listen. Matilda realizes she has developed extraordinary powerful telekinesis. After she gains more and more control of her new-found telekinetic ability by practicing, she decides that it's no more Miss Nice Girl.I don't know, as a child this movie was so amazing to me. I think it means something; this was a movie that was totally meant for the children. Even though I think that this was somewhat disturbing for young kids, it's still a fun fantasy. As a child, it seems like a daily thing where you're constantly reminded of how you're not important or you're too small or too young to do things. Also when the adults get busy, not saying Matilda's family was out of control with the self absorbency, but it's easy to feel neglected. It's a great idea to think that you could have super powers and make the adults pay for the mean acts that they've done to you; it's awesome for a child.As an adult, this movie seems a little too mean spirited. The family isn't just mean, they're beyond cruel, and not saying that some families can't be like that, but it's just a bit much and hard to believe that from their cruelness Matilda is a sweet girl. The principal is just out of control and granted this is a fantasy, but again, it seems like she's insane crazy out of control where in the real world not only would she be fired as principal for abusing the students but arrested. And I was wondering if she hates children so much, why is she a principal? Also the way Miss Honey accepts Matilda having these disturbing powers was a little too easy as well as the children accepting it and laughing at it. Matilda's brother tries to throw a carrot at her and she uses her power to make him choke on the carrot, no matter that it's meant as funny, I thought it was weird. I think this film is fun for the kids as a fantasy but as an adult I grew out of the love I had for this film. I wouldn't dismiss it, at least for the kids, but for the adults, I think it's safe to say that it wasn't meant for the grown ups.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exaggerated Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is essentially a story geared for children, with a familiar theme that the kid is smarter than any adult, which has gotten tiresome in the last decade or two. Here, though, you can't take any of this seriously because everything is exaggerated so much it's like a pure fantasy-comedy story. Author Roald Dahl, as he did with Willy Wonka, liked to create exaggerated characters.'Matilda' (Mara Wilson) has outrageous parents and a super-outrageous school principal. All of the, frankly, are fun to watch but, once again, it gives kids bad messages, such as (1) parents are no good; (2) authority figures are no good; (3) you be the boss, not the adult, etc. etc. I know this is an "exaggerated" wild story but those are irresponsible messages typical of filmmakers. You see them all the time.The movie moves along at a good clip with few, if any, boring spots. It gets a bit carried away at the end, but most comedies are guilty of that. Summary: as the cliché goes, "fun for all ages."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, horrible, ghastly adaption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You take a book about the love of reading and turn it into a 101 story for children about revenge!Basically all the elements from the book are there, put in chronological order, more or less, but what in the book is a MIRACLE - the power to move things, and thus have influence in the world, explained as a product of all the books Matilda read, bubbling away inside of her - in the film becomes a SUPER POWER with which she can take revenge on the horrible headmaster of her school!In the film Matildas many read books are no more than an explanation of Matilda being very different - a special child, whom no one can really relate to. Which is why her family has to be portrayed as even worse than in the book, total trailer trash, criminals, scum and un-caring in all ways - in order to shift all attention to Matilda. And then her powers are regarded as magic, incomprehensible, which is exactly what they seem, seeing as they come out of nowhere. Or rather: They come from ANGER in the film. A product of anger - rather than, what they really are in the book: An analogy of what reading books can bring: The power to move things. i.e. affect the world with absorbed knowledge. Watching it today for the first time I found it more and more unbelievable: Its a movie about PAYBACK! It's got nothing of the relevant framework making the book such a great identifier for children: That cruel and unimaginative adults can be countered by curiosity and knowledge!Avoid this movie like the plague. Do NOT serve to your self or any children. READ it to them instead. And revel in your own memories of horribly, terribly, ghastly stupid and cruel adults, as you take on the role of headmistress and hear your children giggle from all of Roald Dahls inventive cursing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my least favorite films ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matilda is a depressing, boring, poor, stale movie. Matilda disappoints in almost way possible. The plot is completely uninteresting and just plain boring. The acting is just mediocre to be honest and there is literally nothing to brag about. The effects are not very good, and the scenes where the power/effects are used are boring. I don't see how anyone can even stay awake during this dud. I especially don't see how children could be interested. For one thing, it is a little dark for children, and the headmaster is very threatening. And another thing, the parents in this film are literally the worst people ever! Like its shocking and just depressing whenever the parents come on screen. I mean there isn't all that much to say about this movie, it falls completely flat on its face. Even the ending is just sad and depressing in my opinion, much like the entire film. 1/10 for Matilda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matilda (1996): Dir: Danny De Vito / Cast: Mara Wilson, Danny De Vito, Rhea Perlman, Pam Ferris, Embeth Davidtz: Creative yet misguided family film aimed at the wrong audience. Mara Wilson plays Matilda, a smart little girl with telekinetic powers. Danny De Vito plays her father who sells stolen auto parts, and Rhea Perlman plays her mother who blows all income at bingo. Matilda is interested in school but her parents insist that television is a faster source of information. When she is finally enrolled in school she becomes quickly aware of the principal's abusive tendencies towards students. She locks kids in a closet, and force feeds one boy until he cannot eat anymore. Fine setup becomes predictable with a mishandled conclusion. It plays like a juvenile version of Carrie but director De Vito has fun with the dazzling visual elements. Wilson is charming as Matilda whose willingness for education is admirable but her handling of the principal may warrant discernment. De Vito and Perlman are funny as her deranged parents but their decision regarding Matilda's future in the conclusion is too convenient. Pam Ferris as the ruthless principal is difficult to believe since what parent would send their children to her? She is about as psychotic as the standard slasher film villain. Embeth Davidtz plays the cardboard role of a teacher with whom Matilda connects. Themes support learning and address social isolation. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matilda Wormwood (Mara Wilson) is a brilliant girl born to neglectful boorish parents Harry (Danny DeVito) and Zinnia (Rhea Perlman). She goes the library by herself in search of books to read. As she grows older, she gets into ever greater struggle against her father as she punishes him. He's under surveillance by the FBI. He sends Matilda to the rundown Crunchem Hall run by the cruel headmistress Agatha Trunchbull. She finds solace in the students and the kind-hearted Miss Jennifer Honey (Embeth Davidtz).This is a movie for little kids who yearn for power over the adults who don't pay attention. I don't want to discount that demographic. It's not necessarily for me. There's really nothing for anybody over 12. The movie needs Miss Honey earlier in the movie. She's the only nice adult in the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful and Very, Very Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matilda is a children's novel by Roald Dahl brought to the big screen by Danny DeVito in one flick that everybody in the 90s knows and loves. I have never read the book, but I did read some pages that say how different the movie is from it. DeVito's directing must've been for the better. Matilda, like Dahl's other works are dark and over-exaggerated humour and content. As a kid, I really felt bad for Matilda and Miss Honey. There are also plot holes and things I would there to have been added. But for what it is, it is good.In Mara Wilson's best-known role, she plays the titular character born into a family of neglectful and mean parents (DeVito and Perlman). She is super smart and learns how to take care of herself by age 2, while her dumb mother goes off to gamble and her father sells phoney and stolen car parts for unfair prices. We get a good look into her family life and feel really bad how horrible she is treated. The older I got, the more I couldn't help laughing. Although a serious subject and lots of sympathy towards Matilda, it is a lot funnier than it is sad. That is the kind of dark humour that Dahl loved to do. She enrols in school where she is subjected to a principal worse than her parents: the evil, former-Olympian Agatha Trunchbull (Ferris). Trunchbull throws kids out the window and long distances for any bit of misbehaviour; she also has a non-deadly iron maiden in her office called the "chokey." It is very unrealistic how none of what she does goes unreported. But, this is part fantasy. I think that Pam Ferris should have won an Oscar for her role as Ms. Trunchbull. While Matilda's parents are cruel, it is down in a very hilarious manner; but Trunchbull is even funnier because she is worse. it is over-the-top at its best. Matilda's teacher is the kind Jennifer Honey, who has parallels to Matilda. She soon learns that she has special powers which she can uses for good and bad. When Matilda learns the secret connections between Miss Honey and Ms. Trunchbull, she devices a plan to destroy Trunchbull once and for all. This takes place over the course of days, some of which can be frightening to younger audiences. I know I was when it came out. Matilda's parents move to Guam by the end to escape the keen FBI and Miss Honey adopts Matilda. I do like the fact that Miss Honey and Matilda end up together, but I wish that she destroyed her parents in a similar manner to what she did to Trunchbull. Matilda's parents have abused her her entire life while Trunchbull was mean just a few weeks. We do see Matilda do funny pranks as acts of revenge, but it's not enough. At least it has a happy and realistic ending. Despite flaws, Matilda is a genuine movie that keeps the laughs and smiles rolling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Childhood memories aside, this movie barley holds up.Its antagonist is ridiculous, being able to get away with torturing children in a society where their parents can enjoy TV shows. Any child in their right mind would have told their parents or the police and that lady would have been fired.Furthermore, Matilda's parents are some of the worst characters ever spawned out of film. Were they supposed to relate to children with abusive parents? Its as if the main demographic is mentally abused children and yet that number of children pales in comparison to the number of children who love their parents and attend a good and caring school. This movie will end up labeling school principals as incarnates of hell and would make parents look like the biggest douches in the world. And people LOVE this movie! Are you kidding me?This film is laughable at best. Its 'redeeming' aspects stress strength in solidarity, and a love for learning. But in the context these things are being shown, they are nothing. Lessons that fail because they are overshadowed by the utterly stupid parents and a demonic principal that will never exist in the real world.I suppose people will blame me for failing to address other aspects of the film, like the good teacher, or Matilda's friends. Of course the teacher is also laughably perfect, as if to say that such a person also exists in the real world. Giving children the expectation that maybe they will meet a person that nice, further inspiring mixed feelings toward their own parents and their school. But neither do I address Matilda's powers, which she uses to solve problems, making everything look laughably easy to do in an abusive situation. Which would make children fail to realize that a lot of their comforts in life come from the hard work their parents put in.This movie is fine and fun to watch. But it is most certainly not a good movie, regardless of how much you loved it when you were 6 years old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Children's Fantasy!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny DeVito directs, co-stars &amp; narrates this 1996 fantasy with Mara Wilson, Rhea Perlman, Embeth Davidtz and Pam Ferris based on the book. Wilson (Mrs. Doubtfire) plays Matilda, a sweet, young girl who discovers she has telekinetic powers. DeVito (Taxi) and Perlman (Cheers) play her parents, Harry and Zinnia Wormwood who often yell and neglect her. Davidtz (Army of Darkness) plays Jennifer Honey, Matilda's nice teacher and Ferris plays Agatha Trunchbull, the mean headmistress of their school who is also Miss Honey's aunt. Soon, Matilda decides to help Miss Honey find peace in her life as well as her own. Paul Reubens (Pee-wee's Big Adventure) and Tracey Walter (Batman) also appear as FBI agents. This is a good children's fantasy with humorous, spooky and dramatic moments mixed in. The cast is great and there's neat effects. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Takes Me Back To 1997</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie in the movie theaters in 1996, and really liking it. I remember, that same year getting this movie on VHS for Christmas. I remember watching it in 1997 on video and think it's interesting how we still have something from almost 18 years ago that works really well today, that I can easily watch anytime I'm at my parents house, on a VHS we have from back then that still works today. Yeah, I forget how often I saw this movie as a kid, but I have some memories of watching it with friends and really enjoying it. When I watch this movie today, even if it might be after a long time of having previously seen it, the whole movie looks so familiar, I mean like every scene. I could almost have this movie memorized from back then. That reminds me how my best friend I've grown up with since childhood, he watched this movie a lot back then too. We even watched it together. I remember one time when I was on a camp out with him in a tent and he was quoting all these lines from the movie. Oh, childhood memories. Ever since I've seen this movie while I've read the book and we almost always prefer the books over movies, I've always thought this movie was better than the book, and the book left out a lot. I mean we seem to get to know who the Trenchbull is in this movie better, along with the house she lives in. The Wormwoods in this movie seem more realistic, and they add a couple of things to make them realistic. There's also the FBI in this movie, including one guy played by Pee Wee Herman, Paul Reubens. This movie is also an entertaining movie. But, mostly it just takes me back to my childhood whenever I see it. I give it a 9/10, it's a good movie but still could have been better. It's probably one of the movies we most remember of Mara Wilson who does not act anymore. I don't think she's done movies since the year 2000. Well, for one I guess one reason to not give this movie a 10, is I feel like Matilda's character is a little annoying at times. I mean she seems like a girl who is obsessed with reading, like she has nothing better to do. Sometimes, she acts too smart and like she is always right when everybody else is always wrong. She's slow at speaking. So, yeah it could have been better but again it's nice to have something take you back to your childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful fantasy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny DeVito's Matilda is one of the very best fantasy movies ever made along with Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the Harry Potter franchise, as well as some Disney classics. DeVito's lovely film is based on Roald Dahl's book of the same name which tells the story of a little girl named Matilda Wormwood (played by Mara Wilson) who was born with these mysterious powers, and how bad her parents (played by Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman) and her older brother (played by Brian Levinson). DeVito directs this movie as if he read the story over 20 times before he chose to make this film with so much passion for Dahl's work. After Matilda gets a small break from the meanness of her parents she finally gets one of her dreams to come true and that is when she gets her own education from a wonderful teacher named Ms. Honey (played by Embeth Davidtz), and a lot of fear at the same time because of a principal who hates children named Trumbull (played by Pam Ferris). The screenplay to this movie by Nicholas Kazan and Robin Swicord is just fantastic, as well as the special effects used for Matilda's powers. While watching this movie I had just one question and the question is why would Matilda be treated so badly for such a sweet little girl?, and till the end of the picture I found the answer to that question which was because she was small and was thought of to be very wimpy when she wasn't. This movie was a delightful treat for me to watch. One of the best movies of 1996.</fullReview>

Wilson, in the titular role, is very relatable to kids from the era, and Ferris is fun to despise. It is odd that DeVito chooses to narrate this story when he also plays the deadbeat dad.

The dialogue is wonderful and it has an A+ cast. Danny Devito? has put some "blood, sweat, and tears" into this film. I love Mara Wilson as the title character because she knows what she's doing and her physical appearance is just like in the book. I like how Matilda uses her powers and wits to outsmart the evil Ms. Trunchbull. I like how Pam Ferris, who portrays Ms. Trunchbull in the film, embraces her dark side as the principal. Even though the movie is greatly based on the book, this comedic movie is for anyone to entertain!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likable little girls take a bite out of their sullied reputation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like "Pippi Longstocking", "Curly Sue" and "Annie" sometimes take the character of pre-teen little girls and make them either too overly cute or so hatefully bratty or obnoxious that you want to pull a Miss Trunchbull and pick em' up by their pigtails and whirl em' around till they are physically sick. In the case of Ronald Dahl's "Matilda", however, Mara Wilson makes you just want to adopt her, much like Embeth Davidtz's kindly school teacher, the step-niece of the evil Pamela Ferris who is unforgettably mean as "Miss Trunchbull", seeming cousin to the Wicked Witch of the West and her crushed sister with the red shoes.Danny DeVito and Rhea Pearlman get the prize for Daddy and Mommie Dearest, the most unloving and neglectful parents on the screen. They obviously didn't want to have a second child, and the oldest child certainly didn't want a sibling. This leads the growing Matilda to become a gifted learner, eager to go to school and independent in her desire to read. When DeVito encounters Ferris at his used car lot, he gets the idea of how to punish the unwanted Matilda, unaware that this will lead to his own downfall and Matilda's discovery of eternal happiness.Colorful and magical, "Matilda" is a great story from the same writer as "Willy Wonka". Matilda discovers the wonders of the imagination, and her magical life takes on a meaning of its own as she gains special powers. This gives her delightful revenge on both her neglectful parents and the evil school mistress, so hateful and hiding a vile secret of her own, leading to a conclusion of justifiable revenge that will keep its audience, young or old, in stitches.The entire cast is uniformly excellent, especially young Ms. Wilson and the imperious Ferris who goes into the villain hall of fame for her over-the-top performance. The recent Broadway musical takes this character to a new level by casting a man in the part, although there are several female actresses I could see in that part that could add to the fun of the character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My childhood obsession albeit its Americanisation and slight differences from the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved reading Roald Dahl's books from around the ages of 9 to 11 and I also loved watching this film repeatedly. Admittedly I watched this film before reading the book and I remember drawing a comic strip of the film but sometimes my dad would disagree with me watching it since I pretended the boiler cupboard in my bedroom was the Chokey and my dad threatened to throw the video away if I kept imitating that dark part of the film but luckily he never did. A few years ago, my sister was given the DVD as a Christmas present from a friend of hers and because she had it already, she kindly let me have what she had been given. I appreciated that very much because Matilda is my favourite movie adaptation of a Roald Dahl book. Everything about this film is perfect ; the acting, the memorable dialogue, some equally memorable pieces of incidental music (especially those accompanying the scenes of Matilda going to the library alone, Miss Trunchbull throwing Amanda by her pigtails and Matilda rushing home from school when Mrs Wormwood is on the phone), the two songs, the creative cinematography, the marvellous special effects and, of course, Danny DeVito's captivating narration. Although the film is Americanised and somewhat different from the book (the same can be said for other film or TV adaptations of books), it is one of the darkest adaptations of a Dahl novel, as is the 2005 film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, with a touch of hilarity. Mara Wilson's (can't believe she's my age now albeit a bit younger) performance as Matilda is one of the best performances from a then- child actress I have ever seen. DeVito as Harry, Rhea Perlman as Mrs Wormwood and Brian Levinson as Michael are equally as good as Matilda's horrible relatives as are the cast members as Miss Honey, Ms. Trunchbull, Amanda, Bruce, Hortensia and Lavender. Standout scenes include Matilda putting peroxide in Harry's hair tonic and putting superglue inside his hat; Matilda breaking the TV; the Chokey; Trunchbull hurling Amanda by her pigtails as mentioned earlier; Bruce's sickening cake-eating scene; the moving back story of Miss Honey's troublesome childhood; Matilda and Miss Honey trying to escape from Trunchbull's house; Matilda using her powers to move everything around the living room; Matilda making a carrot zoom into Michael's mouth; Matilda making everything in Trunchbull's house go haywire; the schoolchildren turning the tables on Trunchbull and the ending where Matilda's family flee to Guam and Miss Honey adopts her.Overall, this is an absolute childhood favourite of mine with plenty of aspects that will remain on my mind for many years to come, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and good source material but too much like X-men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm reading Road Dahl's "Matilda" with some of my classes and I just finished it a couple days ago. So far, it's my favorite children's book.While I was lesson planning, I discovered that there was film version done in the 90's. I'm surprised I'd never seen it considering I've seen so many other of Dahl's works on the silver screen. Now I need to read his other stuff.It was surprisingly good. I think Devito's re-imagining of several scenes was done with great care, and it was nice to see a lot of direct quotes from the book. The Wormwoods, The Trunchbull, and the children were all cast very well.Unfortunately the movie had two significant faults. First off, Matilda's telekinetic powers shouldn't have become the focus of the story. In the book, her powers supplemented her intelligence and are only highlighted at the climax of the story when they are used subtly to move chalk on a chalkboard. The movie turned her into a super powered X-man.Which leads to the second thing stuck in my craw. Both Miss Honey and Matilda are watered down.In the book, Miss Honey has a sage-like Obi Wan quality to herself. Mysterious, exceptionally wise, and kind. It first appears that she is Matilda's mentor, but that image is flipped when we see how broken she is and Matilda takes charge. By the end of the story, Miss Honey sees Matilda as an equal.In the movie, Miss Honey is just a nice school teacher who has probably read a handful of books from classic literature. And Matilda... well she's still a sweet and smart little cookie, but she's not the extraordinary character crafted by Mr Dahl."There's nothing' you can get from a book that you can't get from a television faster!" ? Harry Wormwood (Matilda's father)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding family film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Outstanding film is a great way to get a family including young children to spend quality time together. Not only is it comical for all ages, it teaches young children valuable life lessons. I've watched it time and time again to the point I can mouth the words, yet it never gets old. It's full of joy and laughter as an ordinary young girl discovers she isn't like her friends at school. It's a great film to chill out and bring back the child in you. Although its a children's film, it can make you think in ways you wouldn't of previously done. It uses catchy phrases to make your mind wonder. Once watching it the first time, you Will be edging to watch it again or buy it on DVD whilst children will be nagging for it to Be On. It's one of the most memorable films I've seen, and I highly recommend it to viewers of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Hope Every Child Sees This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl addressed the problems adults face when they must deal with bratty children. In Matilda, he addresses the troubles a sweet child faces when she must deal with problem adults. I was surprised this adorable movie was not receiving better ratings, so I read the reviews of the people who hated it. One wonders what the moral was. Of course, not every children's movie has a moral. What's the moral of Harry Potter or Goonies? But this one has an obvious moral. Are there not bullies in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Are there not kind people in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Beyond morals, there's an important message. The movie tells mistreated children, in more ways than one: "you are not alone". For those wondering why Dahl did not create a dark, depressing, hopeless story for children surviving in bad homes, rather than a funny comedy, I suspect it's because the children facing such struggles don't need more darkness and hopelessness in their lives. Sure, it's a dark comedy, but that's the only way to reach such children about their problems and still bring them an uplifting movie. What's so bad about a dark comedy? Research shows that a child's quality of life is directly correlated to their mother's IQ. Most abusive and neglectful parents are simply idiots. Do mistreated children exist in this country? Ask CPS. Why should all children's movies ignore this fact? There was a time when everyone just ignored the problem completely, because it made adults that uncomfortable to deal with what was actually happening to children, but I'd rather move forward than backwards. To make matters worse, the brighter a child is, the greater his risk of abuse by jealous, stupid parents. Abraham Maslow had an IQ of 195. When he was a child, his abusive mother discovered some kittens he'd rescued and killed the kittens by beating their heads against a wall. He had many moments of despair during his childhood, and surely would have appreciated a movie like this. Being forced to care for one's self and cope so early no doubt forces kids to grow up quickly. True, many mistreated children might just be intellectually average kids who, unfortunately for them, happen to have stupid parents, so perhaps Dahl should have worried about inflating those kids' egos. There is a genius kid in the new Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, but none of the reviewers are pouring venom about it. Is it just because Matilda's a girl? Heaven forbid kids get the idea that educating themselves might help them solve some of their problems, or that a love of learning is something to be proud of. Harry Potter and Annie are both movies with evil adults, some of whom try to kill the kids, yet the reviewers don't seem confused about why the adults are evil. If every adult you met in your childhood made perfect sense, was smarter than you, and never subjected you to mistreatment due to their own insecurities, then good for you. This movie is not for you. It's for the rest of us.I commend the creators of this movie for having the guts to reach out to such kids, before their despair drives them to suicide, even if some people say "but my parents were good, so why did you create a movie with bad parents?" Take a look at white trash America. I am also thrilled it was turned into a Broadway musical. Obviously, some people get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Though I'm Not Ten, This Movie Is Still Very Magical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've come to realize that re-watching my beloved child hood movies is a bad idea. After rewatching them I see exactly how poor my taste in movies was. Thankfully, this is not one of those movies. The movie is about a very gifted girl named Matilda, who lives in a household of blithering idiots that force her to watch mind-numbing TV shows and scold her for reading. Her dad is a croaked used car salesman, and her mother really just plays bingo every day. They leave Matilda at a young age to fend for herself. Luckily, her amazing intelligence helps her adapt to her unfortunate circumstances. As the movie goes on she wants to go to school. Her dad, however, does not think she's even old enough. Which is hysterical considering her dad uses her idiot mother as proof that Matilda is four when she is indeed six. Her father meets Principle Trunchbull, a hideous, lesbian-looking ex-athlete who hates children and even says she's glad she never was one. Upon hearing this, Harry sends Matilda off to the elementary school from hell: Crunchem Hall. The story takes off from there as Matilda discovers she has an extraordinary talent: she can move things just by thinking really hard about moving them. She hones her talent and uses this to her advantage as she attempts to get revenge on the Trunchbull for Ms. Honey, her sweeter than sugar teacher, and as she takes back the school for the kids. I found this movie immensely entertaining and very well acted for a movie that involves A LOT of children. The Trunchbull, though, is my absolute favorite. She's evil, sadistic, and crazy... but she's also deathly afraid of black cats and believes heavily in superstition. Overall this movie is magical, and still stayed magical even after watching it years later. I definitely recommend this fairy tale to everyone. (Although, I actually found it more geared towards adults, considering it's serious atmosphere at times. Especially the back story of Ms. Honey and The Trunchbull.) Have fun watching it! :) EIGHT OUT OF TEN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mara Wilson is beyond superb. What a prefect performance! I will have to see the remake of "Miracle on 34th Street" if she is in it.I watch this film frequently. Frankly, I identify with Matilda, as unfortunately many bright females no doubt do. When a child is put down for being bright or creative or talented by their own parents and siblings, the spirit and self image suffers.But not Matilda's. She is able to see that she is, "somewhat different from her family," and thus has perspective about worth. Wouldn't that be nice? Here is a little girl who discovers adults can be just as "bad" as children, and hence, should pay the consequences. Here is a little girl who does not take the flaws of lousy parents onto her own shoulders, and instead whips out that ol' peroxide bottle. I like that Danny Devito is also the narrator. It softens his on-screen character and enhances the movie.The only criticism I have is that "Miss Honey" should occasionally speak above a whisper. After a while it gets irritating.And definitely, the scene of "kicking the cat" should not have been made; there are other ways to convey someone's meanness without trivializing an act of cruelty; in pretense or not.In conclusion: please, Mara, come back to film. You are wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Family Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been one of my favorite movies from my childhood to my growing up situation and I've never lost touch of this film. "Matilda", based on the novel by Roald Dahl, is a classic family film that not only I love, but my sister does too. Ever since I had this on video (I have it on DVD now), I never got tired on Matilda's adventures. Mara Wilson is perfect as Matilda Wormwood, a clever and smart 6 and 1/2 year old girl who has been misunderstood by her mother and father (Real-life couple Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito, who directed the film) because they think that she is nothing but a lame-brained girl who does nothing but read books all the time. The worst comes to worst when she is sent to a school run by a kid-hating principal called the Trunchbull (Pam Ferris), however she is saved with love by a new teacher, Ms. Honey (Embeth Davidtz) who has some secrets left in the closet. And yet, Matilda uses her telekinesis to use it for good (i.e. causing parents and principal some disastrous mayhem) and not for evil. Being a classic family film as it is, it's not that dark, it's well appropriate for everyone, and is more lively than I've ever seen. Mara Wilson is wonderful as Matilda, while the director and star Devito does a good job being nasty, selfish, and just plain dumb along with his real life wife Perlman. I hope that you can check this movie out again and again until it will bring you back to why you remembered it. I hope it will be a family classic forever, so I hope you keep looking for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever Roald Dahl Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyable kids' flick concerning the misadventures of young Matilda Wormwood, an exceptionally bright girl who is trapped in an uncaring family who find her a nuisance.Danny Devito (director/narrator and actor) has fashioned Roald Dahl's children's book into a clever, humorous tale that young ones are bound to enjoy. DeVito and Rhea Perlman (husband and wife in real life) are effective as the misfit parents of extraordinary Matilda, played with glee by newcomer Mara Wilson. The lovely Embeth Davidtz ("Schindler's List") is charming as the kind Miss Honey, a meek figure who fears the horrible headmistress of her school.I am at a loss as to what the moral of the story is- perhaps intelligence and education are good things and not to be scorned. Whatever the case, this one was fun.Saturday, June 19, 1999 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for older kids...but think twice about showing it to the little ones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie MATILDA but was also a bit horrified by parts of the story. This isn't all that surprising, as many of Roald Dahl's books are pretty gory and horrific. Now for older kids (perhaps 7 or older--depending on the child), this isn't a problem--they know that this isn't real. But with younger kids, the film is probably too brutal and it's best they wait a few years to watch it. Such nasty things as the Trunchbull putting kids into the "chokie" (like a nastier version of an iron maiden) and throwing kids by their hair are amazingly scary and surprised me when I saw the film. I personally wish they had made the violence more cartoony--more obviously fake so that the film could be enjoyed by all ages. This is especially so because without a few vicious scenes, the film would have been fine for all ages. As it is, it's a very flawed but entertaining film that parents and older kids can enjoy. The acting is good (particularly of young Mara Wilson) and the film has a strange other-worldliness that is quite satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matilda is good fun for both kids and adults. Mara Wilson is excellent as the strong-willed title character who copes with philistine parents (Danny deVito and Rhea Perlman, both good) and a tyrannical principal, the devilish Pam Ferris. Ferris' over the top antics could have been toned down. Still the kids will have fun watching her get what she deserves. Danny deVito's voice over detracts from the storyline as it doesn't make sense for the narrator to have the same voice as one of the villains in the story. Some of the kids' antics are a bit childish. Embeth Davidtz is charming as the aptly named meek school teacher Miss Honey. The film does the good job promoting reading and books over television.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moby what?! ? Matilda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leave it to the warped mind of Danny DeVito to take a Roald Dahl book and adapt it into a very enjoyable children's film that has enough crazy fun for adults to watch as well. A very apparent passion project for him, DeVito stars as the father to the titular Matilda, the story's narrator, (which is a bit confusing since the father neglecting her is also the one telling the audience about what she is doing, but it's just the same voice, not the same character), and is the film's director, making sure his vision comes across. I'll admit to never having read a Dahl book, but I do generally enjoy the films made from them, (except the Burton Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). This one is no exception, as the heightened reality is played just tongue-in-cheek enough to stay cute while also having an edge of danger and eccentricity. Kids should love this little girl with powers and intellect, punishing her parents, and adults will enjoy the absurdity and fantastical elements, reminding them of a time when stories and fun ruled the day.Who better to portray this savant's white trash, crooked parents than the unique pairing of real-life husband and wife team DeVito and Rhea Perlman? The two of them exude sleaze throughout, always trying to make their daughter into a true Wormwood, one who doesn't waste her time in books when she can get all the information she needs, quicker, by watching television. I mean, who would rather read Great Expectations when you can watch the Million Dollar Sticky game show? DeVito excels in roles like this, just put a salesman moustache on him and he's the conman stereotype you know and love, putting stolen car parts (how great are the packages wrapped in the shape of the part they are?) into cheap shells and making 200% profit. And Perlman is transformed into a shrill gaudy looking woman, so confident that her wardrobe and appearance are beautiful that the fact she looks like a ten-cent prostitute is even more entertaining. Her whiny voice and ability to laugh at her husband is priceless; I'd have gone to the library to Xerox adoption papers, just in case, as well if they were my guardians.As far as the story goes, what at first just appears to be a hyper-reality?bright colors mixed with drab and dull sets, a precocious six-year-old making breakfast and going to the library herself to learn, and a very black and white delineation between good and evil?becomes so much more in the second half. Eventually Matilda learns that she has telekinetic powers; she can move things with her mind. This aspect brings the tale into even more of a fantasy world, but it works in spades, especially with the introduction of a new villain besides her parents, Agatha Trunchbull. This taskmaster of a school principal will not allow the children to learn anything creative. She is unafraid to throw a child into the next town with her super-strength, nor to berate anyone who crosses her path. With a revelatory relationship between this witch and Matilda's favorite teacher Miss Honey, the young girl does what she can to save her classmates from the abuse and intellectual prison they are being educated in.This trio of actresses is at the core of the film's success. The always radiant Embeth Davidtz plays Miss Honey as a woman who wants change, going behind the back of her boss to attempt at teaching the children something good and wholesome, to get them to find their creativity. Very much a child herself, enjoying the simple things in life and just as afraid of Trunchbull as the children, her calm, shy demeanor is a perfect sidekick to Matilda's strong-willed older-than-her-years heroine. As far as Agatha Trunchbull goes, Pam Ferris is absolutely perfect. A DeVito favorite, (she is also in the classic Death to Smoochy), Ferris is witch incarnate. Possibly having killed her brother to take his mansion, she has oppressed her niece, kept everything sweet and nice for herself, and became a strong-woman with immense throwing ability. A formidable foe indeed, her scowl and heavy-hitting footsteps as she runs through her house trying to capture an intruder are so over-the-top that they work.The true star, though, besides some great art direction, is young Matilda herself, Mara Wilson. Yes, that cute little girl with the lisp from Mrs. Doubtfire is the heroine of the film. Able to handle the appearance of a six-year-old while also acting like someone so much older, Wilson embodies the character three-dimensionally. The facial reactions when she is thinking what the narrator is telling us are perfect, her smile and sheer joy at helping herself and others, and the girlish voice saying such educated things all make for a role that little kids can watch and aspire to be. Because at the heart of this story is the message that no matter where you come from, no matter what hardships and obstacles stand in your way from being an important contributor to society, you can find a way to succeed. Maybe you shouldn't leave the house to explore the neighborhood at four-years-old or put peroxide in your father's hair-oil, but you get the idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matilda Wormwood is a gifted child who loves to learn, but is suppressed by her stupid and ignorant family. Things look up when she is allowed to go to Crunchem Hall School, but there she meets the principal, the dreaded Miss Trunchbull ?Matilda is a beautiful movie, a kind of weird cross between Anne Of Green Gables and Carrie, but with a terrific children's message of rebellion against selfish, bullying adults. Author Roald Dahl had a special gift in his children's books of capturing the unfairness of childhood and the unimaginative, petty, pathetic qualities of many adults, and DeVito's movie visualises that perfectly, without ever being boring or preachy itself. It's just full of great moments - the gross-out cake-eating scene, the Little Bitty Pretty One dance / effects number, the scary sequence where Mathilda and Miss Honey get trapped in the house, many others. Unlike most actors-turned-directors, DeVito has a real visual eye and Stefan Czapsky's low-angle child's photography looks great. There are fine performances by all the cast, particularly eight-year-old Wilson and the suitably horrible Ferris (I love the moment where her dragon's breath snorts against a window like the velociraptors in Jurassic Park). Davidtz is lovely, Reubens and Walter do a great comic double-act as a couple of dopey cops, and real life husband-and-wife DeVito and Perlman are brilliant as the loathsome Wormwoods - people who are not actually evil, just so horribly awful and greedy in their narrow-minded suburban banality that you want to choke them. DeVito deserves just as much appreciation as a filmmaker as an actor - he's made some terrific movies (Throw Momma From The Train, Hoffa) and produced many more via his Jersey Films production company (Get Shorty, Gattaca, Man On The Moon, etc). With a nifty score by David Newman, this is an all-round showstopper entertaining movie for the young and young at heart, with laughs, scares, satire, great acting, a great story and a beautiful message.</fullReview>

I wonder what they are doing now? They are terrific actresses and should be seen more of!!Maybe I could contact Danny DeVito and he could shed some light on the where-a-bouts of these two great actresses! DeVito did a great job as narrator and playing Harry Wormwood. Ditto- Rhea Perlman as Zinnia Wormwood!I think Matilda takes the initiative in the relationship between her and Miss Honey when Miss Trunchbull leaves and Matilda says to Miss Honey "let's go get your doll". Miss Honey gets very apprehensive then and says "Matilda-no!" --when Matilda takes off for the house! She (Miss Honey) then takes off for the house following Matilda and from that moment on will follow the lead of Matilda! WHAT A GREAT MOVIE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Better Kids' Movies I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matilda Wormwood (Mara Wilson) lives in a broken home where her father (DannyDeVito) is a car salesman who may very likely be doing something illegal with automobile parts. Her school is run by a mean old woman, Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris), who hates children and looks just a little too butch. Matilda's only escape? Her teacher, Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz), who loves her and legitimately cares about her children. That, and Matilda's ability (never really explained) of telekinesis.I probably never would have watched "Matilda" if I hadn't spent the afternoon with my friend. I rarely get around to watching children's movies outside of with those few friends (generally female) who seem to delight in viewing them. But don't get the wrong idea -- I'm not complaining. The film was fun, and had a really positive outlook for the audience to follow. The message of hope and perseverance was strong and pushed the idea that everything will turn out alright in the end. (Realistic? Maybe not. But don't tell the kids.) Everything about this film seems to blend well together. All the actors and actresses are well-cast. Miss Honey is incredibly sweet, the principal is about as nasty as can be, Matilda is a strong lead (hard to find in younger actresses). Danny DeVito is the absolutely perfect choice to play the father. And Paul Reubens ("Pee-Wee Herman") does a fine job as a police detective, being far less silly than in other roles (such as "Mystery Men"). I wasn't sure why Danny DeVito was narrating (because I don't think it's the father telling the story) but that's only a minor concern.The special effects are decent, and in fact better than the effects in many movies today. Not only was this film made in the same time period as "Casper", but it shares a similar feeling. I suspect if you like one, you'd like the other. Little girl, a tormenting older woman, magical or ghostly powers to help fight the naughty old woman. I'm a bit more partial to "Casper" (maybe because I love Christina Ricci) but both are good and might even make a solid double feature.If you don't have children or fond memories of this film from your own childhood, you probably won't watch it. But I'd say there's no reason to avoid it. I was a bit suspicious with how easily problems seemed to get solved, but it's a happy film so I'll let it slide. Especially after seeing the cake-eating scene... not sure why, but even though it was gross it made me really love these kids. If you have kids of your own, pick up a copy of "Matilda" for them... it will be better than a lot of the gross humor that passes for kid's movies today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pam Ferris is brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast is first rate with Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman playing unsuitable parents of an advanced child, Matilda Wormwood. The Wormwoods don't understand their daughter who prefers to read big books rather than watch television with them and their son. Mara Wilson is unforgettable as Matilda Wormwood. She steals the scenes sometimes away from DeVito and Perlman. Embeth Davidtz plays Miss Jennifer Honey, the teacher who loves Matilda. Miss Honey has her secrets like her relationship with Agatha Trunchbull, the demon principal, who enjoys torturing and taunting her students. Pam Ferris (she should be on the Queens Honors List) is brilliant and unrecognizable as Agatha Trunchbull who is masculine and quite monstrous at times. I didn't recognize the actress until I read the credits. Roald Dahl's children's books like Matilda and others are quite similar with themes regarding children's relationships with adults. In this film, I didn't understand Trunchbull who enjoyed the hell that she inflicted on her students. Miss Honey is her niece and it's possible that Honey's father Magnus' death was no suicide but held responsible by Trunchbull herself. There is not one redeeming quality about the Trunchbull and that's what bothers me the most. Not all monsters look like Trunchbull or act like one. No principal would ever get away with such inhuman behavior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matilda is one of the best children's movies out there, the novel is great too but personally I prefer the movie. I love how this little girl (Matilda) had the powers to levitate objects and the knowledge of an average adult. There is some differences from the novel but there is still a lot of comedy and sad moments within the movie. Mara Wilson performed the role of Matilda perfect and Miss Trunchbull was definitely like what she was in the novelization. While the novel takes place in Britain, the movie took place in America which kind of annoyed me. Nevertheless this movie is much better suited for child audiences and you can watch it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful film - Matilda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fascinating film. Matilda is a powerful, wonderful and independent little girl. I always wonder I have magic power. Seeing this film, it seems my dream has come true. All the actors play excellent well, especially Sara Magdalin and Mara Wilson, who play Matilda at four years and six years. They are very cute that I can't forget them.Also I think Pam Ferris, who plays the headmaster, is a great actress. Although I hate the headmaster that she hurt the student and throw them away, Pam Ferris can play this character extremely vivid and amusing.After watching this film, I know that I should read more books so maybe one day, I can be as smart as Matilda. Also, I have to be more independent since our parents cannot always know what we want. When we grow up, we can only count on ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a family movie should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Matilda" is one of those few family movies that appeal to every age group. It's sweet, well acted, very well directed, and funny.Matilda (Mara Wilson) is a brilliant 6-year old girl who's parents (Danny Devito and Rhea Perlman) don't care about her. Her brother bullies her, and when her parents finally let her go to school, she has her evil principal Ms. Trunchbull to deal with. The only adult that knows how to nurture her intelligence is her sweet teacher Miss Honey. After being treated bad too many times by her family, Matilda finds she has a power to make things move with her mind. Unlike most mistreated girls, Matilda uses her powers for good.This is a really good movie in every way. The acting is spectacular, where all the main cast are standouts. Mara Wilson is great as the title character, and Danny Devito and Rhea Perlman are hilariously evil as her parents. Pam Ferris plays Trunchbull, and after her performance it's hard to picture this woman as anything else. The direction is picture perfect, just as good as you would imagine while reading the Roald Dahl book it's based on.Overall, this is a fun movie for all ages, and Devito did an excellent job with this one.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 95 mins. PG for mild language and morbidity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderful family fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved reading Roald Dahl books and was eager to see this adaptation about this smart girl with extraordinary powers, who wants nothing more than to go to school.It is simply a wonderful tale of a girl who wants to go out and live when the world is against her. It is a great tale for children who can be inspired by the central character Matilda Wormwood, played with wonderful charm by Mara Wilson (Mrs Doubtfire).However what makes this film work is Danny De Vito (Get Shorty) He stars as Harry Wormwood, a strict father to Matilda. And it's through his character that we see the true Matilda. The relationship between the two is tense and very interesting to watch, bringing up modern issues about upbringing and social status. De Vito does an outstanding job at directing, with many close shots used to reveal character expressions. But it's the narration where he really shines. As the narrator De Vito brings the story alive by bringing out the emotions of Matilda and delivers a heart warming story about desire, happiness, sadness and love.The acting and direction are all great by everyone involved. My favourite character has to be Miss Trunchbull, played brilliantly by Pam Ferris. Her evilness as headmistress is remarkable, watch for the famous pigtail and chokey scenes. Her authority is masked by her appearance in dark clothing and her size, portrayed wonderfully in extreme close shots.The use of the chokey is great. A dark hole in the wall where naughty children are sent as a terrible punishment, a great signifier of what the school and what the headmistress are like.The only down falls are a few unnecessary long scenes and an overuse of certain issues but otherwise this is the perfect family film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Matilda" is one of my all time favourite movies. The story is based on Roald Dahl's classic novel. The story: Matilda Wormwood (played by Mara Wilson) is an exceptionally intelligent young girl, but her neglectful parents couldn't care less about her (they can't even remember her name and how old she is!!). Matilda attends school at Crunchem Hall, which is run by the most diabolical, nasty and psycho woman ever: Agatha Trunchbull (played by Pam Ferris). However, not all is bad at Crunchem Hall; Matilda's kind teacher, Miss Honey (portrayed by beautiful Embeth Davidtz) quickly start a sort of friendship with Matilda and soon reveals a terrible secret. After all of the abuse she gets from Miss Trunchbull and her parents, Matilda gradually becomes telekinetic and uses her power to help Miss Honey.A truly great movie that people of all ages will love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't speak to the exact faithfulness of the film version of Roald Dahl's "Matilda", having never read the book, but it does manage to capture the spirit of Dahl's writing in general. I would say overall it is one of the better films made from his books, and I would recommend it to young and old with just a few reservations: the set-up is a bit more interesting than where we finally end up in a story that lacks subtlety and overdoses somewhat on the sentimentality inherent in the teacher/student relationship between Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz) and Matilda Wormwood (Mara Wilson).Matilda is the prodigy offspring of a couple (played to perfection by Rhea Pearlman and director Danny DeVito) who see no value in learning (or, for that matter, for truth itself). She's treated as the ugly duckling by her entire family because of her intelligence and character. The parents are so over-the-top that it's impossible to be offended by them because you can't really take it seriously (as "Entertainment Weekly" recently pointed out, Dahl's book probably influenced another famous UK fantasy writer, J.K. Rowling). But it is seriously funny, especially when Matilda's mom insists that the two cops (one of whom is played by the always funny Paul Reubens) staking out their house to bust Matilda's used car salesman father are actually speedboat salesmen. "I'm smart ? you're dumb. I'm big ? you're little. I'm right ? you're wrong" is the mantra drummed into her head by her ignoramus dad and echoed by Miss Trunchbull (Pam Ferris), the fascist principal of the school she attends. But when dad lets slip that a "person" should be punished for their wrongdoings, a chain of events is set into motion by which Matilda begins to discover her own individual righteousness (symbolized by her magical powers which she uses to right injustices).All the roles are well performed, especially the parents, though Ferris is a bit too over the top even for such an extreme role as the one she's performing. I also think that the introduction of Matilda's magic was a bit too abrupt and I didn't particularly like the world music styled pop that was playing in a lot of these sequences, which are quickly becoming dated compared to the rest of the film. After all, Matilda's true magic isn't the showy telekinesis brought to life by movie special affects, but her confidence and thirst for knowledge in the face of a brand of ignorance that verges on evil. This film should be praised for placing the narcissistic values of modern society in stark contrast with a heroic character who seeks truth for its own sake and who finds beauty in the most unlikely places. That makes this film a treasure, rough edges and all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matilda is a bright little girl who is very eager to learn. Eventually, her insensitive parents send her to a school run by Miss (The) Trunchbull. She is a cruel authoritarian that loathes children. Matilda befriends her school teacher, Miss Honey. She soon realizes Matilda's talents, but is later amazed to see the full extent of Matilda's powers.I love the fact that this movie is rated PG for "exaggerated meanness and ridicule". I liked this film because every meanness and ridicule are so exaggerated, it looks inhumane, but it's funny at the same time! There are, some times, where you can see that thing is pushed to its limits.This movie feels a little bit long, even though it's short. It's one of those school movies, where it feels like they're going through the whole year, which makes it feel long (like Harry Potter or Mean Girls). I love the exaggerated acting by Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, and Pam Ferris. I also liked the acting by Mara Wilson.The visual effects in this film is quite good. In one particular scene, it's quite a spectacle. There are some cinematography I liked, which most of it are used for horror movies.This movie is fun for the family. It's a good, heart filled story. Some might go "oh, no, they didn't!" in many parts of the movie because of the exaggerated meanness and ridicule, but I think that's the point of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but they totally Americanized this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the book when I was very young, and when I saw the movie, I thought it was good, but it doesn't hold a candle to the book. For one thing they took out several characters and meshed them into one (Amanda Thripp) and like I say in the comment they totally americanized this film. They had Julius Rottwinkle eat M&amp;M's, an American candy instead of Liquorice Allsorts, The story itself took place in Great Britain, not in America, you must hear Danny DeVito say "American" at least 10 times, and in the end they are running away to Guam, an American territory, instead of Spain, another country in Europe. They also gave it a different kind of humor, while the book is a bit dark, they give the movie a crazed comedic look in scenes with the trunchbull, which did give young children a laugh, but did not necessarily follow the book. The actors were perfect for their roles, except they should have had someone younger then Mara Wilson, for the sake of the story, but she did do an amazing job as Matilda. Embeth Davidtz was a perfect as Ms. Honey, but the showdown with Matilda's parents was shortened and changed. Rhea Pearlman and Danny DeVito are at their best, but don't fit into the books description. It is a great film, and I watch it every time it is on TV, but they could have done better than what they did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I read Roald Dahl's "Matilda" in third grade, I got the feeling that it would make an interesting movie. Apparently, Danny DeVito got the same idea and made good on it. I agree with a previous reviewer that this probably influenced J.K. Rowling in writing the Harry Potter books, the way that the title character had a family ignoring her and so she had to come up with her own way to do things.Anyway, it's a lot of fun. I like that her father was a car salesman; I mean, would you buy a used car from anyone? Worth seeing. Also starring Rhea Perlman, Embeth Davidtz, Pam Ferris, Paul Reubens and Tracey Walter.PS: Danny DeVito later cast Pam Ferris in a similar role in the under-appreciated "Death to Smoochy".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Girl makes things fly to frighten evil adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Roald Dahl and this is a good adaptation. Danny Devito directed it well and kept the feeling throughout. He was also brilliant as the crass, crooked father. Matilda is a little girl with extraordinary gifts, but neglected and derided by her family. She reads and reads and wants to go to school and finally as a punishment her dad sends her. She has the sweetest teacher, and a violent, hateful principal. One of Roald Dahl's tricks is to make everyone into caricatures to enforce the meaning. The parents and principal are constantly telling the kids "I'm big, you're little. I'm right, you're wrong." He makes the kids the hero in a battle with adults and empowers the children in a cartoonish setting. Matilda learns that she has the powers of telekinesis and uses them to teach Ms. Trunchbull a lesson and vindicate Miss Honey. A enjoyable ride for children and adults alike.This movie is like Tang, the drink of the astronauts. It is sweet (sometimes too much so), and fortified with vitamins. Mix those neon crystals with water, stir and enjoy. Kids love it, can't get enough of it in fact, and adults secretly love it as well, unless they've become big and right and full of themselves. 7/10http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Natzta of 8may06?. This memorial film glows in the dark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matilda 1996 is dedicated to Suzie Wilson. At first I got her confused with J. Madison Wright (b. July 29th 1984 - d. July 21st 2006), the girl who played Sam in Shiloh 1996. Best I point out the following: From IMDb detail of Mara I assume that Suzie is her mother, who died of cancer during the filming. Dedicated to a mum due to this, but the film includes many more of the little people than usual and the special edition DVD extras include very little bits and pieces about their world in this sort of project. Features I have, when there are a lot it is usually teens played by older. Not in this case. This is special. THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS A memorial. Should one stipulate sugar? This has lots of bad guys, Matilda's mum included, real evil people, but many age six might not be too frightened by most of this story? With the exception of the cook they are also obvious victims, hurt people. The cook is real evil. But the cook knows sugar. There is plenty of sugar in this. Madeline 1998, an unspoken memorial to Fred. Now my comments get tangled. Matilda finds smelly solutions to the evil. They are obviously smelly, though some will still get confused. I need to write about how I think Matilda's approach was smelly, but I need to do that without defacing a monument. To me this is a story showing error correction systems gone wrong. Correction that, on the surface, seems to give excellent results anyhow. DeVito put in signatures that link Matilda with Girls Just Want To Have Fun 1985 and Heathers 1989 in a way that helped to make this story comfortable and also more interesting for me. I could really enjoy it despite of all the disease. Some parallel stories: With Practical Magic 1998 I just soak in the romance and I rate the story as a pinnacle. All those acting in it are at a peak, possibly drawn out by how Griffin Dunne was approaching romance. If I took meaning seriously it would change to become true to life horror, a Poe pit. Jimmy Angelov is certain to be a long term victim, from early childhood, in a pit he cannot escape from without skilled help, since early childhood. Peter pan. Griffin dunne? The memorial Peter Pan 2003 has a duality for me. A pinnacle until the death of Hook. But Hook is just another lethal lost boy. I have not seen Mean Girls 2004 or Blast 2000. I assume they might be too rough for my taste, but obligatory viewing, them including saints Lohan and Liesel. Dirty Harry 1971 and The Silence Of The Lambs 1991 and Liesel's AFO 1997 I feel able to dismiss as right wing distortions. I should not have said that. Matilda faces evil in her day to day life. She is a family dog cum serf. Despite that and the lack of greenhouse nurturing of her basic skills she is a rare flower that can grow in that desert. At age four she discovers the public library and at age six she finds a world that she can be happy with. The baddies are now far away. She has reached a land of milk and honey. I am a fool to consider that she has just reached a promised land promised to those still in need of some basic good sense. At least she has gained Honey. The film ends with the previously damaged Moby Dick sailing to her. Extras mention a guy with a fishing rod. I consider the baddies and note how much their evil is a parody. The story thrives on that. I note how the police are also a parody. How did these people get tied up to be such clowns and gargoyles? Matilda solves the problems and finds her dream home? For me, reality is Hell, but I can enjoy this adaptation. I assume that Matilda of age six has just found a way to sweep the problem under a carpet while leaving the real issues un-faced. This reminds me of the villagers in Picking Up The Pieces 2000, parts are true horror. Matilda only being age six and her having had to put up with a self education system that tends towards inversions and parody and decay. If this was reality I would expect her to be a smelly wreck who maybe appeared to practice covert vengeance. Here she identifies classes of people who she feels entitled to attack covertly. She gets a start with practical skills for such attacks. Teaching people. She is at risk of a vocation to be a teacher or a healer. Entertainer. She feels that morality is on her side. At age six I do not expect her to guess that all of the failings of the world will soon be due to her ways. But obviously blameable on the pigeons. I should not have said that. The UK, like elsewhere, has many long term oppressed minorities. For me, this De Vito Mara Dahl is a classic up side down sci-fi story about the day to day world. It is so much nicer than my real world. A powerful story about parables. Matilda americanised says it is not just the UK. Mara, aged nearly eight, is real nice. x Send me on my way. Pancake. Rumour is that once upon a time Hiroshima glowed in the day time. This is a memorial film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film adaptation of a marvellous book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matilda is my favourite book by Roald Dahl. It has everything you'd expect from Dahl's best work. A plucky heroine. A fantastic sense of black humour and a tone refreshingly clear of over-sentiment that never patronises it's target audience.Ever since Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was first adapted for film, I've been eagerly awaiting for Matilda to arrive on the big screen. Not everything about the film works. Moving the action to America was a bit questionable, but since it was directed by Danny DeVito, and with his penchant for black comedy, the film succeeds far better than it might have in the hands of a more mainstream director.Matilda (Mara Wilson) is the extraordinarily bright child of Harry and Zinnia Wormwood (Danny DeVito &amp; Rhea Perlman). But how she managed to be daughter to these two is a mystery. Harry is a crooked used car salesman, while Zinnia is a bingo junkie. And where Matilda has a keen intellect and a generous spirit, Harry &amp; Zinnia are selfish mental slugs.Since Matilda's parents have little to no time for her, she must learn to take care of herself. The film manages to encapsulate very well the book's theme of self-empowerment in the face of parental neglect. The first 25 minutes are my favourite, because they show how Matilda learns to fend for herself. By the age of 4, Matilda can not only cook, but she can read fluently. She has read everything from CS Lewis, to Charles Dickens.As Matilda's mind continues to expand, she feels ready to take on new challenges. And that comes in the form of public school. Matilda has always wanted to be around kids her own age, but there is a problem. The headmistress of Crunchem Hall. The nightmare of kids everywhere... Miss Trunchbull (brought frighteningly to life by Pam Ferris).Miss Trunchbull is a strict authoritarian. She rules her school with an iron fist, and is fierce as any drill sergeant. She used to be an Olympic athlete. Her speciality was the Hammer Throw, and she's not above using it to enforce discipline. One particularly shocking scene has Miss Trunchbull picking up a 6 year old girl by her pigtails and throwing her over the school fence when she dares oppose her. Or throwing a boy out a window with all the grace of a javelin.But not all the teachers are like that. Miss Honey (likably played by Embeth Daviditz), Matilda's teacher, has a kind and gentle spirit, and strikes up an instant rapport with Matilda once she learns of her ability. Matilda and Miss Honey are kindred spirits. Both are lonely. And both come from families that shunned them.Matilda's brain power eventually develops to the point where she becomes telekinetic. She uses this newfound power to turn the tables on the adults in her life who make her miserable.Matilda has always seemed very similar to Stephen King's Carrie. A girl who was bullied at school and tormented by her mother, and her anger eventually turned to telekinesis, allowing her to take revenge on those who tortured her. But Matilda is not a carbon copy. It has it's own line of thinking.Matilda has no desire for revenge. But she does intend to teach those a lesson if she feels she and those like her have been mistreated. She punishes Harry when he unfairly admonishes her reading ability, and gets rid of Miss Trunchbull who is really Miss Honey's aunt. She stole her house from her, and Miss Honey is too afraid to stand up to her, trapped within a controlling relationship.Danny DeVito shows a flair for bringing the world of Roald Dahl to life. There are many quirky camera angles that seem to heighten the sense of oppression from a child's eye point of view. Images of Miss Trunchbull towering over a child, or closeups of her face grinning evilly. Matilda really is quite a hard film to watch at times, because of it's disturbing moments, like a boy being forced to eat an entire chocolate cake, or kids thrown in the Chokey, a narrow cupboard with nails and shards of glass sticking out of the door.But Matilda is still a refreshingly intelligent kids film. It's DeVito's first children's film, and he does superbly. Never too nauseating. The comedy is funny, and it doesn't dumb down. The casting is truly inspired too. Real life husband and wife Danny DeVito &amp; Rhea Perlman are perfectly obnoxious as the Wormwoods. Mara Wilson finds just the right balance between wide eyed innocence and burgeoning intelligence without ever lapsing into precocity. And Embeth Daviditz gives a very sweet and appealing performance, making Miss Honey an always sympathetic figure.But it's Pam Ferris who's the scene stealer. Mad as a hatter, a blaring voice and intimidating frame, she brings Miss Trunchbull to life in ways I never thought could be possible. She is the image of Miss Trunchbull. She was born to play the role. Filling out the character with obvious relish and perfectly evil, you won't easily forget this Hammer Throwing Olympian in a hurry.The ending is perhaps a little too happy. It expands upon a few things that were done more subtly in the book. And I didn't like the way Matilda's power stayed with her instead of fading like it did originally. But for the most part, Matilda is a largely successful endeavour, and pays respect to my favourite book from the wonderful Roald Dahl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The novel 'Matilda' was always a firm favourite of mine through childhood and most certainly my most dearly loved of all Roald Dahl's books. So, it came as a delightful surprise that the film adaptation was able to match the excellence of the book.The film, based on the much-loved novel by Dahl, centres on six-year-old Matilda Wormwood, a little girl raised in a home where she is very much the neglected second child with parents who have no time for her. On the surface, things don't improve much for her when she is sent to a school ran by the brutishly authoritarian Miss Trunchball but she thrives, easily making friends with her classmates and finding a maternal figure in her teacher Miss Honey. Matilda is not a child to be a victim forever, and when she discovers she has telekinetic powers, she determines to take back control of her life!Mara Wilson, who plays the lead role of Matilda, proves why she was one of the most favoured child actor of the late Nineties. She gives a very endearing, bubbly performance throughout the whole film. Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, as Mr and Mrs Wormwood, are excellently cast as they depict their characters out to be as self-obsessed, lazy and neglectful as they are in the novel. But it is Pam Ferris who steals the show as the wonderfully cruel Miss Trunchball. She clearly throw herself into the character, thoroughly relishing emphasising Trunchball's loathing of little children!'Matilda' is a very charming film that would easily appeal to all members of the family and remains as timeless as ever. It retains the childlike wonder of the novel, the feel-good quality of seeing the bright and brave Matilda beating back against the big, bad adults and the particular brand of dark humour that only Dahl could get away with (not many authors could depict child abuse in a comical light). It also avoids the usual family film trap of being overly-sentimental and condescending in an attempt to pander to small children in the audience. The only real bone of contention with 'Matilda' was the unnecessary Americanising of the story since the book was set in Britain complete with British characters and British terminology. But that's doesn't impact too much on the quality of film and its actors.A very enjoyable film that I'd recommend to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Matilda" tells the story of an amazing young girl who is smart as a whip. Matilda was neglected as a child and was pretty much left to look after herself. Her dad (DeVito)is a used car salesman, her mum is a skank (Pearlman). Her folks don't want her to go to school because they need her to sign for parcels. She begs her folks to let her go to school and when her dad comes across a local Principal at his car-yard, he eventually agrees as he feels she'll "straighten" Matilda up.Matilda is stoked. She soon discovers though that this school isn't all it's cracked up to be, due to the nasty female Principal, who is a strict disciplinarian. Her Saviour though is a lovely teacher named Miss Honey. She encourages and looks out for Matilda.Underneath this all we have a brewing subplot- Matilda has magical powers! She doesn't fully utilize them though until the bullying of the Principal has gone too far. Will she play some wacky pranks on her, will she go Charles Manson on her- see it to find out! Decent for a kids movie, something the family will enjoy.</fullReview>

Danny De Vito is the real star with the best acting and consistent character but Mara Wilson puts in an average performance. Overall the film contains lovable characters a few unexpected moments and a 'villain' that will and has been hated for generations. My rating is quite generous for a film of this standard but it was a good watch and it killed an hour or two.

		<shortDescription>Oh, you beautiful Dahl!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First up, I want to start this review by saying that I am a mom who really enjoys Horror movies. I think that is why movies based on the works of Roald Dahl appeal to me: Instead of being overly cutsey they have a "dark side". I had seen MATILDA a few times with my nieces when they were little girls and it was one of our favorites, mainly because it has appeal for kids AND adults. Now that my daughter just turned 7 I decided it was time to show her MATILDA. My daughter is easily scared, so when The trunchbull showed up on screen she let out a little gasp and I thought "Ooops....she's gonna make me turn it off". But ya know what? Everything in Dahl movies is so over-the-top that you cant really be too scared. The life and adventures of Matilda are so surreal (A teacher throws a little girl over a fence after swinging her by her pigtails....that's actually scary and flat out funny at the same time!) that you cant help but find them goofy rather than appalling. Our hero is a brilliant little girl named Mathilda, born into a family that doesn't appreciate her. Her mom, Dad and older brother are couch potatos who live for watching wrestling and game shows while eating TV dinners in their living room. Matilda would much rather read a book. She taught herself to read and write as an infant and has been into taking home books from the library as of late. She also wants to go to school. Her father doesn't want her to go to school because he's a used car salesman and needs her to stay home and sign for packages: Packages that are stolen car parts. One day he meets the evil Trunchbull, the sadistic headmistress at the town grammar school, and he enrolls Matilda in school. The school is full of terrified kids who are tormented by Trunchbull. Luckily, their teacher is Miss Honey, an aptly named sweetheart of a woman. Miss Honey is the one beacon of light in Matilda's world. Her family is negligent and they belittle her. Trunchbull is ugly inside and out and freakin' scary. It's a good thing Matilda is such a resilient little girl. Things get better for her when she finds out that she has telekinetic powers (Making MATILDA sort of a kiddie version of CARRIE!) and starts using them to get even with her family and principal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Book to screen movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read Matilda 7 years ago and watching this show on Cable was just as refreshing as reading the book. Danny Devito did a great job on importing the book content into the show. The Casts were great and i especially like Pam Ferris as the evil Miss Trunchbull. Her role was done really well complete with her english accent. I always laugh everytime she taunts the school children and its downright amusing. Apart from that, a scene which was added in the movie which i don't recall from the book adds to the eccentric and mad-jock like character of Miss Trunchbull is just as entertaining like in the scene where Matilda and Miss Honey sneaked into her house and she hunted them down like rats.A fun and entertaining movie for the whole family. If this is not enough, do check out the Roald Dahl books. His characters in his books are just as funny and eccentric.</fullReview>

She likes reading books, so she goes to the library every day. She can read for hours! She loves going to school, too. At school, she meets very different people. Miss Honey, her teacher, is sweet and Matilda loves her very much. But Miss Trunchbull, the headmistress is an ogre! She doesn't like children and she is really strict. In this film there is a lot of fun, especially for young learners of English. CEM English 2nd. Children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems like a mixture of two movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie is wonderful for all ages. It seems like a mixture of two movies: "Carrie" and "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." Just like "Carrie" Matilda has an abusive family and she discovers she has the gift of telekinesis. Her telekinesis gets stronger when she is angry. She then uses her powers to get even with her principal and family (with less gory results.) Just like "Harry Potter" Matilda has an abusive family. She then finds out that she has magical powers and uses them the right way. (Sometimes, that is!) I give this movie 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some who think that the book is better than the movie said to have been based on the book, well in this case, I cannot say. The reason is because just like a lot of other popular books written into screenplays to become movies, the book is totally different. I am basing my theory upon "The Wizard of Oz" book and movie, and "The Lord of the Rings". The stories of them have the same basic structure, but the details are fuzzily explained as well as the book explains them. For "Matilda", it is almost the same case. Although it is not a big and huge movie like the Rings trilogies coming out, it still has interesting parts and like all movies, has it's downfalls. The real book "Matilda", by Roald Dahl, had different ways of putting the scenes in which he described to create the story. But everything mainly follows the basic procedure of how the book was originally structured. The book is a lengthened version of the movie, to put is simply. Since this was not just an adaptation of a silly story that took someone five minutes to complete the main idea of the story and put it to text, it was a movie based on an actual novel, making it a full and well done movie.Mara Wilson, who played Matilda, is a child who was adopted at a young age and is raised in a chaotic family of cheaters, liers, and gamblers. At her school, there is unorthodox things happening which are questioned about in the movie. There is a lot of comedy in the movie, which adds to why this is a family film. There is also some frightening things that that lead to the slight suspense it brings fourth with the frightfulness. All of the actors and actresses do a wonderful job of playing what seems to be the most abnormal of characters. Danny De Vito not only played Matilda's Dad, an eccentric car salesman, but also directed the movie. This movie definitely deserves two thumbs up with the great acting, adaptation to the book, character development which I forgot to mention, and marvelous directing. I give this phenomenal family flick a 10 out of 10. Roald Dahl wrote a tremendous book that turned into a miraculous movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: This review does contain spoilersI saw this film on Boxing Day a couple of years ago.Based on a story by Roald Dahl, this film is about a young girl named Matilda Wormwood [Mara Wilson from "Mrs Doubtfire"] who loves reading books and wants to have a proper education and a happy childhood. But unfortunatly, Matilda's father Harry [Danny Devito from "Taxi"] works as a businessman selling used cars for prices way above their value [conning his customers]and hardly notices his daughter. Her mother Zinnia [Rhea Perlman from "Cheers"] spends all day away from home indulging in her own luxuries instead of looking after her child.Matilda is a very smart young girl, so her father decides to send her away to a school named "Crunchem Hall", a very dark, gloomy and old building which is ran by the maniac schoolmistress Agatha Trunchbull [Pam Ferris from "The Darling Buds of May"] who diciplines her pupils by throwing them out of windows [!], forcing them to eat chocolate cakes and locking them in a gas filled room called "The Chokey".Matilda becomes friends with a kind young teacher named Miss Honey [Embeth Davidtz from "Bridget Jones Diary"] who recognises the girls intellegence and becomes a mother figure to her whilst her own parents are still neglecting her. Matilda discovers that Trunchbull is Miss Honey's aunt, who, after her father died, looked after her and treated her with the same cruelty Matilda's parents treat her.Matilda discovers that she has magic powers and tells Miss Honey about them. Matilda uses these powers to get her own back on the cruel adults around her, notably Trunchbull. Matilda uses her powers to bring up the past on Trunchbull [who killed Honey's aunt] and subsequently scares her away from town. Matilda's family end up running away from the FBI after Harry Wormwood's schems are discovered. Before they leave they entrust Matilda to Miss Honey's care and the two live happily ever after.This film is enjoyable for the all the family. I recommend that you see it as soon as you can.10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched Matilda at least a million times, and I still love it. It's a pretty good movie, humorous and entertaining, delightfully derived from the novel by Ronald Dahl. I must say, I thought the casting was really great, but my favorite people were the Wormwood parents, played by a real-life Hollywood couple, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlmen. In my humble opinion, they really stole the show. And of course, Matilda herself was fantastic, and The Trunchbull was out of this world.</fullReview>

It is a wonderful modern day fairy tale - one of my favorites. I give it a 10. Devito, Perlman, and Pam Ferris are great as cartoonish over the top caricatures. Mara Wilson is wonderful as the title character - she really carries the movie - amazing for a young actress (you may remember her from Mrs. Doubtfire) and it is Embeth Davidtz' performance that allows that. Davidtz defers to Mara in a film that should be on everyone's shelf!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I can't resist watching this movie every time it comes on TV. It always brings a smile to my face. Mara Wilson does a very good job of portraying the prodigious Matilda. Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman are hilarious as her neglectful white-trash parents. Probably one of the best performances is Pam Ferris as the kid-hating principal of Crunchem Hall (gotta love that name). There are a few minor annoyances or inconsistencies in the movie....Matilda's teacher Miss Honey is just a bit *too* perfect (although still very likeable) and I have to admit I am puzzled at how, despite the oppressive atmosphere of the school, each and every one of the children was perfectly sweet and well-behaved...not a single brat in the bunch. Kind of unrealistic, even with a super teacher like Ms. Honey. But that's minor stuff. For the most part, I think adults and children alike can cheer along as Matilda gets her revenge on the adults who have failed her. A really good movie.</fullReview>

I think it is so amazing! She works very hard and learns as much as she can by reading. She tries to love her parents even though they never love or care about her. They are so irresponsible. Then Matilda meets her teacher, Miss Honey, who has similar childhood experiences but she still loves everyone. At end they live happily together. I think it?¦s a very good ending, Matilda can find someone who really loves her. Love is the most important thing between people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I like Miss Honey, who is Matilda?¦s teacher best because she is very nice and she helps Matilda to solve her problems. At the end of the film, she adopts Matilda, gives her new hope and changes her life. I don?¦t like Harry Wormwood, Matilda?¦s father. In the scene where Mr. Wormwood brings Matilda and her brother to the garage, he teaches them how to cheat the customers-decrease the mileage of cars sold. And he doesn?¦t want to give Matilda a chance to study in the school and doesn?¦t let her read books. I think the climax of this movie is where Matilda uses her telekinetic power to fight against the headmistress-Miss Trunchbull. In this movie, the author gives Matilda a gift of telekinetic power and intelligence in studying .I think it is a very good story line. In real life, I don?¦t think people will have such ability. If I can choose to have one of them, I think I will choose to have high intelligence in study because I can get a higher mark in school and the knowledge from the books. I read is very useful. In one scene, Miss Trunchbull picks up a schoolgirl by her ponytails, spins her around, and throws her out of the window. If you hear that in real life, you may be shocked, but it happens only in a film-an imagination. The characters are very funny and we feel excited rather frightened.</fullReview>

Danny DeVido out did himself in this great comedy for kids and adults alike. Now, speaking from a Radio DJ / Movie Critic's, I had to watch it over 20 times on video, and another 50 when it was on Premium Cable TV. The best part about this is that I found out it was based on a book, meaning its in a libary near you. Take a good look at this movie, at least 20 times or more. Out of a possible 10, I give it a 10! Nothing was missing. There was comedy, action, thrill and more. This is the movie Steven Speilberg should of directed. Forget Saving Private Ryan, rent Matilda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matilda is not without a certain charm, a charm that has you take to it come the death. You sense that children watching it will enjoy the way it depicts imperialistic grown ups implementing their rule upon young kids, of whom appear to think they know the way of the world, and then later failing to hold up said values as the tots, or singular 'tot', garner revenge and strives to put everything straight in the way they initially envisaged. There is enough to watch and get involved in, a Carrie-esque spin on what would normally be described as Disney does Kitchen Sink drama, as lowly people get in foggy circumstances and expressing their philistinism at any occasion they get - the Home Alone inspired finale does not do enough to extinguish what is a colourful comedy-drama about some rather delicate issues thrust through a tough blender.True, the film is about a very young child getting their own way over certain adults; but when their respective 'own way' is as indelible and forward thinking as it is in Matilda, who's complaining about, or indeed accusing, the text of exuding disrespect towards superiors whilst neglecting authority? In the case of the Danny De Vito directed 1996 film Matilda, those adults are narcissistic parents and tyrannical head-teachers; head-teachers so stubborn that, in spite of the fact the film unfolds in America, make it so that the doors to their offices sport the very British "Headmistress" engraved on a plaque as opposed to the more American "Principal". Later on, we find out such a Headmistress, Mrs. Trunchbull (Ferris) even represented Great Britain at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the Shot Put discipline - one wonders if Team GB's true-to-life athlete from that year in that event ever got round to seeing De Vito's film, and if so, at all got a kick out it.But we'll come to said headmistress. First and foremost, there is Matilda, who is deftly played by a certain Mara Wilson. Matilda is the daughter to Zinnia Wormwood (Perlman) and Harry Wormwood, played by Danny De Vito in a role thus seeing him contribute to the film in one of three capacities (the others being the narrator, who's incarnation is not linked to the body of the movie, and that of the aforementioned director). When we first witness her coming into contact with Harry and Zinnia on the day of her birth, we observe how different they both look in comparison to the other parents at the hospital whom are welcoming newborns; maybe it has something to do with the fact the Wormwoods' first born, Matilda's older brother Mikey (Levinson), arrived before her and had all of that attention and love parents lavish upon their babies, whereas those other newfound folks are here experiencing it for the first time. Whatever it is, and in spite of the fact it is no excuse at all, the fondness for childcare and such has long since evaporated from the Wormwoods as we witness Matlida develop through the stages of growth into an infant.In this sense, she had to, because any other child would have died. Her father, Harry, is a short and stocky individual; a slimy and fast-talking businessman; an optimisation of greed, a man about as oily and greasy as the mechanical interiors to those second-hand cars he flogs to unsuspecting customers when many-a thing are wrong with them. Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her. What little joy she has with her parents during the early stages of her life occurs when she plays practical jokes on them; a scene at a restaurant after they've all gone out for dinner begins with a shot of a tray of cakes being wheeled out of the kitchen and around the bunched up tables ? then we realise Matilda's father has his hat stuck to his head on account of some super glue, and if we cannot anticipate the messy end to the scene involving said cakes, we just aren't trying hard enough.It is whilst at school that the events which set in motion Matilda's change in life occur, only it is initially a school run by the aforementioned Agatha Trunchbull and it isn't so much a school as it is a prisoner of war camp - a place with high fences accompanied by barbed wire; a solitary confinement room as well as, and it'll probably upset others more than it did me, a large brick chimney on top of one of the more lower key structures in the compound which acts as a somewhat misplaced piece of concentration camp-like iconography. At school, she meets the wondrous Miss Honey who's played by actress Embeth Davidtz of whom, rather unfortunately in its keeping up to speed with the previous point, three years earlier starred in Schindler's List. Miss Honey is Matlida's teacher; a prim, slim and elegant person; an intelligent woman with a delicate look about her, someone is stark contrast to Trunchball's big blundering brute of an authoritarian ? where Miss Honey will waltz around her classroom clutching a flower by its stem implementing education, Trunchball will stomp around the playground wielding a riding crop instilling fear. The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience. It's a very difficult film to hate, a very easy film to get into but a tough film to feel an awful lot more than indifferent about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is is pretty enjoyable. I enjoyed watching it in school on days when we had no work. It's certainly not a perfect movie, and it's not a classic, but I like it quite a bit. It just seems to have a feel to it that I wish more movies today had. I'm talking about that good magical feeling older Disney movies had.Matilda is a movie that certainly has it's share of flaws, but when it's good, it's really good. I talk about the flaws first: The acting is over top at points, a few characters are over the top, and the story has some unrealistic points. The story is about Matilda, a young girl who is neglected by her weird, unlawful, dysfunctional family. She is a very smart girl, however, and can take of herself better than most adults. The one adult she can rely on is her teacher. The actors that play Matilda's parents and principle really overact their evil persona's almost to a laughable point, and the battle between Matilda and her principle is pretty cheesy.However, like I said, the movie has it's really strong points. I love Matilda's character and the way she bonds with her teacher, miss Honey. These two actresses did very good jobs. The relationship they form is played out really well. Many of Matilda's pranks are pretty funny to watch. The story is also interesting despite being unreal at times. The ending, which I won't spoil, was almost pretty nice. It was probably my favorite part of the movie. The movie had it's dark and scary moments, and also had it's sweet and sugary moments. In the end it made a nice tone and atmosphere for the movie.In the end I'd call it a pretty good fantasy family flick. It has it's flaws and downsides, but it also has many upsides. If you like family or kid's movies, check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully gruesome family fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this film since I first recorded it off the television many years ago but decided to watch it again to see if it would be a good Christmas gift for my niece... I enjoyed it so much that I think I'll also get it on DVD for myself.This is an utterly charming film almost entirely due to Mara Wilson's performance as the eponymous Matilda. With the exception of her teacher all of the other characters are delightfully horrible; her parents don't care about her discourage her attempts to learn to such an extent that they oppose her reading saying that she should be watching television and her headmistress, Agatha Trunchbull, is so vile that she hates children and routinely picks them up by the hair, swings them around and hurls them over a spiked fence. Thankfully her teacher Miss Honey sees that Matilda is a gifted child and does all that she can to nurture her talent. As they get closer Matilda helps Miss Honey right an old wrong involving the wicked miss Trunchbull.As one would expect from a story written by Roald Dahl it is dark without being too scary and slightly anarchic. I'm sure it will appeal to all but the most timid of children. The acting is great, young Mara Wilson is perfect as Matilda, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman did a great job as her uncaring parents and Pam Ferris was suitably grotesque as the vile Miss Trunchbull.I'd certainly recommend this film to people of all ages, although it might not be a good idea to show it to younger children just before sending then to bed... I wouldn't want them having nightmares.</fullReview>

But "bad guys" of the film were so outlandish and cartoon-like that I found them more comical then disdainful. I know it's not meant to be a realistic film, but the villains of the film are so unrealistic I find them hard to hate. It's a good film for kids, as they would not really notice the flaws. The one that bugged me most was the Headmistress. I'm not insulting Pam Ferris's acting, but the character was unoriginal and two dimensional. And if she hates kids so bloody much, then why is she that principal at an elementary school? If you're after a truly good Roald Dahl film, skip Matilda and just watch The Witches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MATILDA, in my opinion, is an excellent movie for all ages! The characters I really couldn't stand were Mr. Wormwood (Danny DeVito) and Miss Trunchbull (Pam Ferris). This was because they were pure bullies and were not very nice to Matilda (Mara Wilson)! But each time Miss Trunchbull freaked out when the clock in her living room struck the hour, I laughed really hard. I also laughed really hard when Matilda got even with her father. Personally, I believe he got what he deserved. In my opinion, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman make a good couple on-screen and in real life. To wrap this up, I'd like to say, "To all you Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, or Mara Wilson fans who have not seen this excellent movie for all ages, I highly recommend it!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the best examples of a book based film that I have ever seen, especially based on a Roald Dahl book. Director and star (and narrator) Danny DeVito has made Matilda a lovable little girl and based the whole film through the eyes of a child, an excellent idea. The Wormwoods are not very nice people, and they have given to a little girl. As a baby, and growing, this child seemed very clever, but they never noticed, they named her Matilda. Mara Wilson as Matilda is just perfect, and her parents, Harry (DeVito) and Zinnia Wormwood (DeVito's real wife, Rhea Perlman) are a really good mean mean couple. Matilda made many friends in school, including teacher Miss Jennifer 'Jenny' Honey (Embeth Davidtz). The only person she or no other kids could go near was the very good villain Miss Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris), who throws children for punishment! A very good film about a wonderful girl and her magic powers, perfect family viewing. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Matilda came out in theaters, I was 37 and my girls were in their early teens. We watched the movie in the theater and bought the video as soon as it came out. When the DVD came out, we bought that also. However, I have never felt it was enough! I wanted more...... I would love to see Danny Divito and the gang reunite for a sequel."Matilda, Return of Trunchbull!" The original may not have done that great in the theaters but its video following has been tremendous and a sequel would be gangbusters. Who cares that they are all older. That would be the added charm of having the same cast and pick up several years after the original. I can just see the trailer now. A sweet school yard with children playing merrily. All is well. The music is precious and the voice over says, "Everything is perfect at Chrunchem Hall. The children never want to go home, the teachers actually enjoy teaching and the sun always shines. That's about to change!" At that point you see the back of Miss Trunchbull in her trademark garb as she steps in front of the camera, hands on hips. That would send a thrill through most of the theater audience. Now, if they can just come up with a worthy script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matilda is a wonderful movie that I ever seen and very exciting. I loved the movie and in the movie, Matilda has great powers to make everything go in motion. I first seen this movie after I bought it from Hollywood Video in almost the end of 1996 before 1997. In the movie, Matilda's family is insane and ignores her then, Ms. Agatha Trunchbull puts the students in the "chokey." Anyway, Matilda can be "Lil' Mss. Know it All" 'cause, she's knowing all the things she reads about. There's a part that I like when Ms. Trunchbull shook her "Djibouti" (Which I mean "butt") while she gets that newt off of her chest. I was wondering what was with her family and her brother calling her, "Dip Face" although, at the end, she lives with Ms. Honey and I wuv it. I feel very impressed about the movie and I think I watch it for... Oh, yeah! 6 times. It's much like "The Simpsons" because, the Wormwood family watches TV and eats their dinner. The yuckiest part I didn't like was when Ms. Trunchbull made that boy eat so much chocolate cake and all the students didn't like it. That boy would end up with indigestion or a heartburn. I good and although, I wuv it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no patience for the kind of exaggerated, one-dimensional children's movies that Hollywood tends to churn out (incl. the Harry Potter franchise), which is not to say that those movies are necessarily bad, but simply that I am not the target audience - or rather, the target age group. However, some of the best children's movies are sufficiently well-produced as to be enjoyable for adults as well - at least some adults. I do consider myself (to quite a high degree, even) to still be young, imaginative and playful, and as such I like to think that, if a children's movie is really good, I would also enjoy it. "Matilda" certainly does the trick for me. It is wonderful in every way, and unlike the Potter movies it hits the exact comical tone that makes the exaggerated things - like the cruelty and insensitivity of the parents - really work. I was entertained throughout this movie, and with a children's movie this doesn't happen often.My rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

But she makes friends with her teacher (who has the appropriate name of 'Miss Honey') and begins to understand she has certain special powers...Story by Roald Dahl brought to the big screen by Danny DeVito, who plays Matilda's father as well. And he does a good job as well, as from an acting point of view, there isn't much wrong with this film.The characters are way too flat though, and in the end the story really isn't that magical or even entertaining as it could be. Great scenes in the house of the principal though! 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant children's book gets debasing "Goosebumps" treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roald Dahl wrote books and stories that could inspire and embolden children (and for that matter, adults) to challenge a daunting world in which bullies, tyrants and other malefactors would seek to oppress and manipulate them. "Matilda" (the book) is a tour de force by the author, presenting his "child-empowering" politics in the most realistic, relatable setting of any of his most popular novels."Matilda" the movie grinds Dahl's crafty, subversive story and his ability to write such a story into "Nightmare on Elm Street" for the grammar school and pre-teen set. Dahl's novel, which with its scant, succinct, read-in-a-couple-of-hours subtlety, nuance and subversion matches the entire "Harry Potter" canon, is ironically the victim of the very authoritarianism it encorages subverting. "Matilda" the movie contains so many revisions and diminishments to and of Dahl's story as to be a completely different tale. The text "Based on..." in the credits of a movie has become so common that few people give any thought to the source material. In the case of "Matilda" the movie vs. "Matilda" the book this is not only unfortunate, it is a dis-service to their children and to any parents who value having their children learn, understand and engage in critical thinking. And the possible "Spoilers" begin:---1)"Matilda" the book: Matilda is the daughter/sister of shallow, materialistic, vacuous parents and brother; the worst possible common-denominator of the "Me Generation" of the 1980's. They are not the inevitable result of their era, the Wormwoods have made choices that result in both their vapidity and perhaps as counter-balance, Matilda. ---1A)"Matilda" the movie: Matilda is the daughter/sister of cartoons. One-dimensional, stupid to the point of begging the viewer to question how such adults could achieve adulthood much less be thriving, these caricatures raise the first of many questions: Where is the cleverness, the craftiness Dahl provides the Wormwoods? ---2)"Matilda" the book: Matilda's reading exposes her to thought processes, ideas, concepts, motives not generally available to elementary school age children. Her favorite author is Charles Dickens, and from him and other writers she develops an intuitive understanding that the world is not in balance. ---2A)"Matilda" the movie: Matilda reads voraciously, but what does she learn from that reading?---3) "Matilda" the book: Ah-Ha! A critical idea emerges; Matilda, through her reading has obtained crucial insight into adult motives, behavior, actions. She develops the understanding that size and age are not impervious barriers to ethical and moral actions. ---3B) "Matilda" the movie: Matilda is inspired by her amoral, criminal father to consider the possibility that she (a child) is as much a person (and therefore as powerful) as any adult.An aside: Which is more potent, more effective, more persistent, sustainable? Insight or information?---4) "Matilda" the book: Matilda makes scant use of her "powers." ---4A) "Matilda" the movie: Matilda dances about, moving furniture, controlling electrical switches, ad infinitum... and directly relevant to... ---4.b) "Matilda" the book: the first time Matilda seeks to demonstrate her powers to Miss Honey, she succeeds. Miss Honey is never, ever doubtful of Matilda's abilities. ---4.A.b) "Matilda" the movie: Matilda is unsuccessful in her early attempt to demonstrate her ability to Miss Honey. And the "Hollywood-ization" of "Matilda" takes it first big step.---5A) "Matilda" the movie: the entire, long, drawn out episode of Matilda psychically invading Trunchbull's (yes, I know) house is contrived. No version of it exists in Dahl's book. This sequence is the most shameless, pandering and demeaning scene in the film (although it has credible competition for this dishonor). ---5) "Matilda" the book: Nothing like this scene occurs in Dahl's novel, for good reason. Matilda's power, its existence and her use of it is, as will be evidenced at the story's end, purposeful, deliberate...righteous.An aside: In "Matilda" the movie Matilda has magic powers which she maintains after the story's climax. In "Matilda" the book, Matilda is never able to manifest her telekinetic ability after she rectifies the wrongs committed against Miss Honey. I suggest that the movie's ending is much less "spiritual" than Dahl intended.---6) "Matilda" the book: Having overcome Trunchbull and redressing the wrongs committed against Miss Honey, Matilda never again manifests her telekinesis, suggesting the ability was specific to a situation...that is, spiritual. ---6B) "Matilda" the movie: Matilda continues to demonstrates telekinetic ability, which would beg the questions "What will a human with such power do?," "How will Matilda affect and influence the world?," etc., etc., etc..And lastly, but not "leastly:"---7B) "Matilda" the movie: In Dahl's book Matilda is never mean or malicious. The treatment of Trunchbull at the film's climax depicts an act of vengeance severely out of character with Matilda's nature and her manifestation of her telekinetic ability. It is consistent with the "Hollywood-ization" of the story in that it provides a slapstick, child-pleasing and child-accessible conclusion. ---7A) "Matilda" the book: Matilda earns an understanding of empowerment, but also learns that the power she had and used was a metaphor for being responsible, intelligent, clever, wise, compassionate...all the traits she sought in the adults around her.Even granting that the movie versions of books are generally criticized for the liberties, variances and accommodations that are part of "getting the movie made," Matilda, the movie, is too much a violation of its source to be worthy of viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adversity serves as the mother of invention for the characters in director Danny Devito's "Matilda," imaginative juvenile fantasy inspired by British author Roald Dahl bestseller. Previously, Hollywood tapped another Dahl effort "James and the Giant Peach" that met with indifferent box office results. The best rendering thus far of a Dahl tale was "The Witches" (1990) where a little boy is turned into a mouse by a local coven. Although aimed at an adolescent audience, "Matilda" emerges as a tolerably sticky gray (just short of black comedy whose rich visual style provides something for adults to savor. Distorted lens and low-angle photography give this yarn an optical sophistication that older audiences will appreciate and a carnival atmosphere that will delight younger audiences. Devito appears to be imitating Terry Gilliam's bizarre film fantasies like "Brazil" and "12 Monkeys." Aside from the title heroine and her peers, the adult characters are not only warped but downright freakish. What could have been a depressing tale about a neglected and unwanted little girl takes on an upbeat mischievous quality. The filmmakers suggest that the younger you are the better, and that adulthood sabotages the joys of adolescence.As the film unfolds, Harry Wormwood (Danny Devito of "Batman Returns") takes one look at his newborn baby daughter, screws his face up in disgust, and walks out. Wormwood is a sleazy, low-life, miser who sells junk autos at sky rocket prices and traffics in purloined car parts. The FBI assigns two oafish field agents (Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee's "Blow") and Tracy Walters of "Batman") to keep tabs on the unscrupulous car dealer. When Harry takes his wife Zinia (Devito's real-life spouse Rhea Perlman) finally bring baby Matilda home from the hospital, they leave her in the car. Matilda grows up with virtually no adult supervision and is better for it. Her parents as well as an older brother leave her to her own fantasies. As her cretinous father observers at one point, somebody has to stay at home to sign for the packages delivered to the front door. But Matilda refuses to languish under these trying circumstances. She masters basic culinary skills by age four. Later, she plunges herself into the world of literature. She devours hundreds of books from a nearby library, all to the chagrin of her parents.While parental neglect prompts Matilda to read books, her father's anger precipitates the appearance of her strange telekinetic powers. Matilda learns that she can pour her own bowl of cereal and eat it without touching the box, bowl, or spoon. At this point, "Matilda" stops being a John Hughes comedy and turns into a precociously bratty version of the 1996 John Travolta tearjerker "Phenomenon." Eventually, Harry and Zinia send Matilda to school. This school would make the Bastille look like a daycare center. Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris of "Death to Smoochy"), a child-hating Amazon with an attitude, rules the school with an iron fist. If a child arouses her wrath, she hoists them aloft and hurls them out the window like a javelin. At school, Matilda finds love and understanding in a meek, spinsterish first-grade teacher , Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz of "Bridget Jones's Diary") and they grow to be best friends. Eventually, the tyrannical Ms. Trunchbull turns her rage on poor Miss Honey and Matilda abandons her forbearance. She devises several frightening but harmless stunts that send the hated headmistress into a tailspin. Antics such as these are calculated to draw applause from the younger set.Adults on the whole take a beating in "Matilda." Their stereotypical depiction places them at either end of the extreme. If the obnoxious Wormwoods and Ms. Trunchbull represent hideous extroverts, then Miss Honey epitomizes the humble introvert. Clearly, "Matilda" endorses the latter behavior. The only good adults are the docile adults. Mara Wilson steals the show as the eponymous protagonist. You may remember Mara from the Robin Williams comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire." If you adore her saccharine personality in that movie, you will love "Matilda." Arguably, "Matilda" falls short of being a classic because both the character of Matilda and actress Mara Wilson are far too cute to be credible. Funny and inventive as it is at times, "Matilda" never escapes its repressively formulaic origins. Children will obviously have more fun at "Matilda" than adults.</fullReview>

The movie is filled with little cynical jokes and moral lessons for children and adults (just like Willy Wonka) with you wanting to see everyone get what they deserve and of course you are not let down.Matilda is a young girl who is extremely intelligent despite her foolish parents and brother. She desperately wants to go to school but her father who is involved with buying stolen car parts won't let her because she must, "Sign for the packages." Eventually he gives in sending her to the school where he has schwindled the Principal who is a terror to all children but then reserves a special wrath for the sweet Matilda.

		<fullReview>Given the Irish propensity for whimsy this review may be skewed somewhat from the statistical norm so apologies for that. Having said that - in my ever-so-humble opinion - Matilda is worthy of better than the curmudgeonly score of 6.6 that graces it as I write today. With IDMB's weighted voting system I know that my one vote will do little to alter it's standing but if my comments can convince a few more to vote then perhaps those viewers can help too. I'm not saying it's the Godfather (1 or 2) but if you feel that a film, a really good film, can have you leaving the theatre, or rising from the sofa in these home cinema days, feeling challenged, exhilarated or just with a big silly grin then Matilda is just the ticket. Yes there are plot holes and yes it does take liberties with Dahl's book but then it's a movie - if you've ever seen Harry Potter you know what can happen when you're too faithful to the original material. Ferris, Davidtz, DeVito et al are note perfect in their performances and if Wilson's joyous performance doesn't make you smile then I think it's a hard heart indeed you must have beating in your clearly cynical breast. It's a film for the child in all of us, from the chubby kid who eats too much cake but still turns out a winner to the pigtailed mousey girl who just doesn't want to be a unwilling projectile. Go see, rent or even buy if you're the well-heeled, monied adventurous type and enjoy 98 minutes of high adventure thrills and smiles - especially the smiles - whether you're big or small, short or tall, right or wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Ever since Matilda was born into the Wormwood family, her parents Harry and Zinnia paid little attention to her. Also, they were a TV watching family. Matilda wasn't in to TV all that much. Ever since she was 4, she's been going to the library.Harry Wormwood was in the automobile business. He owned and operated a dealership that sold faulty cars at unfair prices and he liked it just fine that way. He took Matilda and her older brother Michael to his place one day and showed them his business. Matilda put's some super super glue in his hat and can't get it off. It served him right I suppose. One afternoon, a large woman named Agatha Trunchbull met with Harry. She was the headmistress at Crunchem Hall Elementary, so Harry arranged for Matilda to go to school there. Trunchbull was a big, mean thing. She yelled at kids and threatened to hurt them. She was in the 1972 olympics. She would often lock kids in the chokey: a small room with nails that stick out. But Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey, was the complete opposite. Kind, sweet, and loving of children. But she had a deep dark secret. You'll find out later.She was also astounded that Matilda could multiply large sums in her head, but neither Miss Trunchbull or Matilda's parents were at all amused. The Trunchbull continued terrorizing the school. Because a young boy ate a piece of her chocolate cake, she made him sit and eat an entire cake infront of the whole school. It's later revealed that Trunchbull is in fact Miss Honey's aunt. And her father's supposid suicide was supposid. Trunchbull killed him. Matilda discovers she has a power to levitate objects by looking at them: telekinesis. She uses it to get even with the Trunchull once and for all. And our story soon comes to a happy ending when the bad people in our story get their jusdesserts. A good movie! Good work, Danny DeVito. Mara Wilson is Matilda. In all her movies, she plays that same kind of character: A fast talking little girl. Typecasting is for life. Watch for an appearence by Jon Lovitz as the host of "Million Dollar Sticky". Also watch for Paul Reubens (Pee-wee Herman) as FBI Agent Bob. So, I recommend this movie! They do some good jobs turning Roald Dahl's books into movies.-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good cast and catchy quotes make this family movie special. It's abetter than average comedy with some thought provoking serious bits thrown in here and there. I must confess I've no idea how Miss Trunchbull could have become headmistress in the first place - she must have done some serious bullying or maybe bribing with Magnus' money! The real husband and wife team of Danny deVito and Rhea Perlman make an excellent combination as Matilda's selfish and shallow parents. The script contains some real gems that can be appreciated by adult and child alike. Some scenes such as little Amanda being swung by her hair probably need some parental guidance for more sensitive little ones.I'd love to know where Trunchbull landed up after leaving the school, a showdown between "her" and Harry (apart from a mere telephone conversation), would have been rather interesting and juicy. Matilda herself, of course, ably played by Mara Wilson, and her class teacher Miss Jenny Honey form the "good" team. This movie is very well put together and receives from me an almost perfect 9 for sheer entertainment - a modern day fairy tale with the grim bits such as the Grimm Brothers would have written had they lived today. I haven't quite been able, perhaps fortunately, to make out what type of car Miss Trunchbull bought from Harry, when she's turning it to return home after it stalls, one can almost make it out. Another brilliant scene is the sight of the ancient cook carrying a huge cake into the school hall, looking like some hunchbacked witch. There's not one scene in the movie that can't be described as highly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matilda, the film, succeeds the difficult challenge of coming up from a great book. Different enough from the original story to fit in the movie format, but keeping most of the plot, its humor, sarcasm, fantasy and depth of ideas, the film -as well as the book- proves to be an amusing and gratifying tale for children, as much as an entertainment very adequate for grownups who look for fun and reflection about how the relationships between children and adults may become tough. Dany De Vito shows, once more, his talent to tale twisted stories with a smiling view, fitting naturally with writer Roald Dahl's style, and proving again that comedy is not a minor genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessarily dark and cruel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay this yet another recovered piece of my childhood nostalgia. With all these movies I can find at least one or more good things to say about them, Some are even my favourite movies. I decided to look at this and... Out of all of them I find myself disliking this movie more than almost all of them.The plot is that Matilda Wormwood is a little child prodigy who is raised by a crooked car salesman and a TV obsessed mother who consistently wears bad cosmetics. She has one brother but he is just as bad as the rest are. She learns to adapt to life and how to take care of herself by the age of 6 and a half. She then decides to go to school after reading so many books from the library (and her parents don't care).The school is lead by a woman named Trunchbull. What she does is think up new ways to punish children. One of them being to lock them in a closet with nails and broken glass sticking out so they can't move. On Matilda's first day Trunchbull throws a little girl out of school by her hair... Why? Because she has pigtails! Matilda's teacher - Ms Honey is pretty much the boring character of saint figure.Over time Trunchbull figures out better ways to punish children, if not that then sticking their photos on a dart board and then Matilda finds powers of telekinesis which she uses to accidentally throw a neut at Trunchbull and then she decides to experiment with these powers. Then we find out that cops are watching the Wormwoods because Matilda's father is selling used car parts. When they search the house Matilda fools them by ripping off a routine from The Secret World Of Alex Mack.Then we find out that Miss Honey's aunt is Trunchbull and she might have killed her father so she can get his house and she ran away to a cottage where she lives now. Over time Matilda gets Ms Honey's childhood doll out of the house while using her powers while along the way convincing Trunchbull that Miss Honey's father is haunting her. At school she uses her powers again to convince her that he is haunting her again while convincing every kid in school to throw stuff at her needlessly. To cut a long story short and they all lived happily ever after.So you see kids, the moral of the story is that if you don't like someone - drive them insane and have people throw stuff at them. I mean with better direction and writing the moral could have been to stand up for yourself but with what happens there is never any balance... All it is is being dark and cruel just for the sake of being dark and cruel. That just simply doesn't work for a kids movie. What made something like Return To Oz good was that yes, it was dark as well but you have kind leading characters who want to turn Oz into what it once was and to have Dorothy re-unite with The Scarecrow and save him. Here?... I don't see anything like this, only one character was kind and that was Miss Honey and she was as bland and transparent as water.Here's another complaint - Danny DeVito. His character in this film is a crooked car salesman and ignorant father, so essentially - he's a prick. But that is contradicted heavily when you hear DeVito's narration over what is going on... I mean he couldn't hire a narrator to do the voices? It almost points the film to unintentional humour when DeVito badmouths his daughter, then you have DeVito saying what's going on as we are following Matilda. That just doesn't work.If there was anything to compliment this movie on then I would say Pam Ferris does play Trunchbull over the top in the way that if the material was better it could be laughed at. It was in such a way that I knew she was giving all she could into the role. It wasn't much but it was something. Everyone else does admittedly an okay job (even Danny DeVito with his schizophrenic narration in contrast with his character).So this movie deserves a three. I can see why some people like it if they can handle my complaints. The cruelty never amounts to anything, it's just being dark for the sake of being dark without balancing out the right elements to make this seem more like a funny, charming, whimsical adventure and less of a mean-spirited and unpleasant movie that doesn't get it's moral right by never having these elements balanced out. I can see why some people might like this movie but I personally thought it wasn't that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a "Kid's Movie" in my Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Danny Devito's "Matilda" a lot, but I have never thought it to be a children's movie. It's ok for kids to see, and it does have a cartoony energy, but this is basically a film about parental abuse. It has that fairy tale quality, to be sure, but this is the Grimms fairy tale realm--dark and scary. Actually, this quality is common in Roald Dahl's stories.Embeth Davidtz's adult character is really the movie's main focus and the Matilda character almost seems to be a fantasy created in her mind as a way to deal with the demons of her own dark past.The last thing I would call this challenging film is "pleasent."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary even for 8 year old!,,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was super scary even for my 8 year old. She cried and almost felt sick because it was very gory. Advisable to watch with a parent that can explain to kids that movies are not real. My daughter watched this at school, and quite a few kids had to leave the auditorium. She did mention that there were some funny parts but the plot was very scary to her. I think that i may eventually watch this again with my kids a few years from now. I think the minimum age should be 10 years old, but i guess it depends on the kid. On another note, my 6 year old little man, did not find it too scary. We are writing this review by her urging, because she is concerned that other kids will watch it and feel like she did. So she just wants to warn everyone!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, it seems that every reviewer here either 100% loved or 100% hated this film. I was just the opposite. To me, this film was like every other family movie ever made. It wasn't bad, it was just nothing special.Although, I must admit, it was great seeing Paul Reubens back in a movie. And Danny DeVito did an excellent job acting and directing, but, like I said, the movie as a whole is just so-so.One last thing-- that Mara Wilson girl is nauseating. I'm so tired of cutesy child actors. She makes me literally want to vomit. Oh well, she'll grow up soon, then be out of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly not a comedy, nor a family movie, it is actually against the family. I would easily compare this to An American Crime (2007) movie. Filmmakers understate and trying to make funny a vy sad situation of a girl born to an egoistic and dysfunctional family with a crook bad tempered father, self centered mother and a bully brother where no one cares about one another. How can someone say that psychologically abused children should watch this movie, it would only reopened their wounds and would have to take more antidepressants then before and watching that crazy monster headmistress throwing kids around or chasing them in that dark filthy house full of chambers of horror. Common, this is not a family or comedy movie. And the last scene, where they easily signed the adoption forms and got rid of their daughter was so hard to watch that any child watching this would get the whole life trauma and would have nightmares long after. And that nauseous scene where the fat boy is punished by eating the whole cake, and ... and ... But maybe it is just me, I don't know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bedtime story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just purchased this lovely film, on DVD at last, and i think it is a well told story.i quite like Danny Devito 's narration and that he also directed and starred in this film, as Matilda 's Father Mr. wormwood. it is a shame that Matilda 's parents never bothered to see just what a bright child they had, and that she was delightful as well. I found Miss Trunchbull very vile, but Pam ferris brought her to life very good!! I would not want to pick an argument with Miss trunchbull mind! I would also not go into her private room, and pinch that cake. on the DVD, you get lots of extras and Games to keep you entertained and there is a good quiz on there as well. I would be proud to be Matilda 's brother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and well adapted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly, filming Roald Dahl books is hard enough - they are often weird, over-the-top and very exaggerated. Matilda is a lovely story, and they have done a pretty good job adapting it to the screen. What I didn't like was actually Danny DeVito, who just didn't fit the description of the idiot car salesman and father of Matilda. He seemed misplaced throughout the movie. Maybe it's just me - I'm not very fond of DeVito at all.Other than that, most characters are well envisioned, especially the shocking monster Trunchbull, taking every awful detail from the book to create something very similar on the screen. A good, fun film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horribly disappointing due to miscasting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently everyone here loved this movie, judging from the user reviews. But I, as someone who read and owned the book long before Hollywood made it into a movie, was terribly disappointed. My single biggest complaint is the casting of the atrocious, gratuitously cute Mara Wilson. Matilda's character in Roald Dahl's book was much more dignified and introspective. Mara Wilson, even if she was able to achieve these characteristics in her acting, would still have been wrong for the part because her cutesy-cute persona is distracting and annoying. I'm not usually bothered by cute child actors, but Mara Wilson just nauseates me. Another thing which gave the book a lot of charm, in my opinion, was the British dialect. The movie's creators switched the setting from England to America, and so we got American white trash, instead of British white trash, which I think would have been more entertaining to watch.An animated movie based on Quentin Blake's illustrations for the book, and complete with British accents, would have been much more satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lowbrow family film that barely meets its very low expectations as run-of-the-mill family fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to find out that this movie had a theatrical release ? because I don't think it deserved one; at best, it's a somewhat passable run-of-the-mill family TV movie; at worst, it's simply bad film-making in all aspects of the word. "Matilda" is just a saccharine family film with a pseudo-cute lead surrounded by dumbbells or eccentrics. I haven't read the Roald Dahl book on which this movie is based, so I can't judge comparatively ? but if the movie is a faithful adaptation of the book, then the book was either not movie-adaptable or plain sucked.First of all, I was blown away (and I mean blown away out of disgust) by the incredibly lazy way of storytelling. A hazy narrative by Danny DeVito, the movie's director and one of the lead actors, is the main tool of storytelling here, rather than what you see on screen. The story is basically about an over-smart girl with telekinetic powers who has to learn to get through ill-meaning and not-so-good family members as well as a disturbingly mean headmistress.While the story could've been handled decently ? once again, I haven't read the book, so I'm open to positive deviations ? it is populated by paper-thin, ridiculously one-dimensional cartoon characters played as a joke by their actors. As our lead we have a buck-toothed little snob whose only criteria for acting is to "look cute" (which is apparently the norm in most family films starring a child actor these days) ? which she's admittedly good at, but with standards this low, no wonder she is. The story, which could've carried a meaningful message of child abuse or adult vs. child psychology, is also brutally slaughtered thanks to the obnoxiously developed characters.The only redeeming factor about the movie that I can think of is the character of Ms. Trunchbull, the Olympian headmistress (literally) who should've been given a life sentence in the real world for child abuse. Admittedly, the character itself is very screwed if you think of the kind of treatment she metes out to her students in real life, e.g. javelin-throwing a student, cussing another's mother, and humiliating an obese student by force-feeding him among other acts of intimidation ? not very funny, is it? The character is also cartoonish and one-dimensional like other characters in the movie; however, it's played to perfection by Pam Ferris. Her genuinely intimidating on screen presence lends the movie a macabre sense of humor, which is the only humor that seems to somehow work; but unfortunately, it's not enough to save the movie.All other characters are clichéd and poorly acted, especially Matilda's family (the dad is played by film's director Danny DeVito), while her ultra-nice teacher Ms. Honey, who has a history of childhood abuse, is also a wasted opportunity and is poorly played by Embeth Davidtz, who tries too hard to be sentimental and hence fails.Instead, the childhood abuse theme would've better fit Ms. Trunchbull and helped to move away from the movie's incredible one-dimensionality (even if a little bit). The entire movie could've been put to some good use with serious undercurrents, such as the aforementioned childhood abuse plot. But in the end, "Matilda" is a wasted opportunity ? poorly acted, has low production values and is one of the most one-dimensional and lazily made family films I've ever seen, despite it having considerable potential. Danny, please stick to acting and stay away from family films. RATING: 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone has commented in their review that this film is an insult to Roald Dahl. They are so right. The book Matilda is a beautiful story of girl lacking the love or acknowledgement she deserves. This film has none of the charm of the book, and takes gross liberties with the original text. The tale of love winning through over terror and poverty is completely lost, the wonderful characters are now compleatly unlikeable and there is really nothing to justify this film at all. Give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just can't see the "fun" in this movie. I find it incredibly boring, stupid, and cheezy. "Cute" and "Good for every age" seem to be the common praises for this movie here. Maybe I don't appreciate it the same way most people do, but I simply cannot see the cuteness or the goodness. By the way, I saw this movie at The Super Station. Right after "Matilda" was aired, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" and "The Wizard of Oz" followed. Now those two are what I call "fun" and "great for every age" movies. By comparison, "Matilda" is just so inferior to the other two. I am simply amazed how many positive reviews are posted here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laziness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.DeVito annoys me because he is so smart, and when he does something this stupid its just a waste.We know he's smart because of `Throw Momma' which merged the shifting reflection of Nabokov with the mixed narrative of Hitchcock. No, I'm not joking, and the depth of the preceding sentence reflects the sophistication of thought in that little project. But DeVito is also lazy too. I suppose it is from his TeeVee days where he learned that viewers will swallow almost everything if you make the label plain enough. In `Taxi,' the jokes were terrible, but people laughed when the sign clicked on. Here, he believes that Dahl's meanness will be taken as charming if he tells us to.This is one thing in children's books and another in film. In kiddielitterature, the very notion of mean darkness was part of the conspiracy of gremlins and children against adults. In film -- at least this kind of film -- the adults are asked to conspire against ourselves by being brought into the collaboration. Well, I suppose some can be duped; many people laughed at `Taxi.' But this is far, far beneath the cleverness and skills of DeVito. Shame on us for letting him be lazy.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember that when i was younger i fell in love with this book. It was just that kind a book that kids like. A little child beat the evil headmaster &amp; parents.And when i watched this movie,i was so....soooooo boooored. Thank god, that there is a fast forward on remote control. Everything was so predictable and dull. Sure, i can find a thing or two that i like. For instance, Danny DeVito. As always a great storyteller and not bad acting here + the camera movement is unusual and some scenes actually provides some black humor.But hey, if you're IQ isn't below 80 (kids excluded), you'll see that this movie contains just far too many mistakes too classified as a classic "children-stories" such as Neverending story (part 1), The Goonies, E.T., etc. and it certainly doesn't deserve a better grade.2 out of 10 (and please, rather read the book!)</fullReview>
