		<shortDescription>All For Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent noir film was somewhat copied forty years later as "Sea of Love," with several changes bringing it up-to-date. One surprise in store for viewers is the comic talents of George Zucco, obviously kept hidden throughout most of his brilliant acting career. He is an excellent comedic sparring partner for Lucille Ball. They work well as a team, providing laughs that are sorely needed in an otherwise serious murder mystery thriller. Boris Karloff adds to the fun as well, giving a monster performance as an insane dress designer--can you believe? The stellar lineup also includes the likes of George Sanders, Charles Coburn, Cedric Hardwicke, and Alan Mowbray. The cast alone is worth the price of admission.Directed with savvy by Douglas Sirk, the film has a script put together by a hodgepodge of writers. Still, the dialog is filled with witty and intelligent lines. The mystery will keep the viewer guessing until the serial killer is revealed. There are red herrings along the way to lead the best sleuth astray. Even when the movie seems to be ending with the mystery solved, it becomes the wrong solution to the case under investigation. The film proceeds to fool the viewer a second time before the ultimate meanie is apprehended. There are thrills aplenty throughout this delicious cinematic whodunit.The story involves a serial killer running amok in London who kills beautiful young women lured by newspaper ads. The madman fancies himself a poet copying his style from the dark poetry of Charles Baudelaire, who once wrote about a tempting woman being more beautiful in death. One such poem is sent to Scotland Yard before each murder. Inspector Harley Temple (Coburn) is determined to catch the psycho any way possible, even using a young woman, Sandra Carpenter (Ball), as a decoy to lure the monster out into the open. Sandra is chosen when she inquires about her good friend's disappearance. Coincidentally, her friend's moniker is Lucy. In the process of finding the perpetrator of the crimes, Sandra makes several interesting encounters, eventually meeting a stranger named Robert Fleming (Sanders) with whom she falls in love. Their favorite song becomes "All For Love," which serves as a clue in the mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An EXCELLENT film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who only know Ms. Ball as the "dizzy redhead" in the 50's sitcoms, you're in for a TREAT!Before making the above, she was in many films -- Marx Brothers, The "Annabel" series, and this great film.Backed by a solid cast (Zucco, Sanders, Karloff, Napier, Coburn), she acts as the "bait" to lure a London killer out of hiding.Even tho (at least to ME) it was obvious who the killer is, it is fascinating watching her in a non-comedy role! And, she certainly was lovely!If you get a chance to see this, DO SO! You won't be disappointed! It's a shame that she didn't make more films in this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lured (1947) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting curio for Lucille Ball fans as well as those who enjoy old horror and mystery films. This one is worth seeing for its cast alone, featuring (in addition to Ms. Ball): Boris Karloff, Sir Cecric Hardwicke, Alan Napier, George Zucco and George Sanders! This solid mystery/thriller stars Lucille Ball in a dramatic part before she became Lucy Ricardo. She plays a feisty American gal in England who is hired by Scotland Yard to go undercover to trap a serial killer who claimed one of her friends. Boris Karloff's role is a small one but it's absolutely wonderful, and it's an essential watch for the actors' legion of fans. George Zucco is a cop who keeps an eye out for Ball to make sure she doesn't get into too much trouble. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Douglas Sirk, later best-known for sappy Hollywood melodramas, makes this early Lucille Ball vehicle about a killer that writes poetry to the police about the victim he is going to kill. Ball plays a dance hall girl that loses a friend and decides to help by joining the Scotland Yard force. She begins to answer personal ads by men looking for attractive young women. Along the way she comes in contact with a slaving-like operation and a bizarre eccentric fashion designer played with incredible gusto by Boris Karloff. Karloff has roughly 5 minutes of screen time, but boy does he know how to use it. This is a very enjoyable film. If you are looking for a lot of action - look somewhere else. What you get here is a lot of talk and character studies. The cast is one of the most complete I have seen in some time. George Sanders, Cedric Hardwicke, Charles Coburn, Robert Coote, Alan Napier, George Zucco and Alan Mowbray round out this incredibly talented cast. Zucco really stands out as a plain-clothes policeman. Ball is beautiful, and she does a very credible job in the lead. Sometimes I forget that she was a gorgeous woman with a lot of talent other than making you laugh. But that was certainly her greatest gift. Lured is a good, old-fashioned mystery yarn. The killer is painfully obvious about halfway through, but the actors go through the motions with obvious relish. Unfortunately the DVD release I had by KINO had nothing on it all all in terms of extras...didn't even separate chapters from main feature!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Douglas Sirk is generally known for producing weepy melodramas, so 'Lured (1947)' seemed like an exciting exception to the rule. The title alone has the feel of a dark and claustrophobic film noir thriller, with stark silhouettes skulking in alleyways and the shadow of gnarled fingers reaching toward a heroine's throat. The Production Code Administration apparently took a dislike to the film's name, perhaps conjuring up similar mental images to my own, and the film's title was subsequently changed to the less-lurid 'Personal Column,' which sounds more like a Lubitsch romantic comedy. Neither title quite does justice to the film's tone, which is somewhere between thriller and melodrama, stranded hopelessly in middle-ground between the two distinct genres. An impressive cast ? including Lucille Ball, George Sanders, Boris Karloff, Cedric Hardwicke, Joseph Calleia and Charles Coburn ? does its best with the uneven material. The tone of the screenplay shifts markedly between the moody and sophisticated first half and the less-interesting second, when each character abandons all the traits that had made them appealing.Sandra Carpenter (Ball) is a smart-mouthed taxi dancer, the sort of girl who doesn't take any nonsense from the opposite sex. When her colleague goes missing after answering an ad in the newspaper personals column, the police suspect that she is the latest victim of a deranged serial killer, who sends the authorities flowery poetry readings to boast of his crimes. To prevent the next murder, Sandra is unexpectedly recruited to identify the man responsible, going undercover as his next prospective victim. Among the suspects is Boris Karloff, unfortunately underused as a hilariously demented fashion designer, and George Sanders, playing one of those charmingly smug suitors that he always played so well. Veteran cinematographer William Daniel's creates a nice, moody black-and-white atmosphere, perhaps lacking the grittiness of your typical 1940s film noir, though that would hardly have worked alongside a screenplay where even the most depraved murderers speak with a high degree of elegance and sophistication. Apparently, that's just how everybody is in England.The first half of the film delicately develops a mysterious and slightly Gothic air of uneasiness, and then something happens: Douglas Sirks' melodramatic instincts kick in, and his characters suddenly become less interesting than before. Lucille Ball's sassy and independent woman becomes enamoured with George Sanders, discarding all her saucy wise-cracks in favour of the anguished cries of a weepy and vulnerable damsel-in-distress. Sanders, likewise, is effectively neutered by the onset of love, losing his indomitable lust and becoming all quiet and contemplative. George Sanders quiet and contemplative, you say? Outrageous! Even so, Cedric Hardwicke singlehandedly rescues the film's final half, refusing to subdue his grotesque depravity even before we're supposed to guess that he's the man responsible for the serial murders. I don't know if I could confidently recommend 'Lured' to fans of Douglas Sirk, but the excellent cast of actors means that most viewers should find some degree of fulfillment in his unusual brand of film noir film-making. This is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Split Personality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A killer lures lonely young women via the "personals" column in a London newspaper. A friend of one of the victims, an attractive dancer named Sandra Carpenter (Lucille Ball), acts as bait to catch the killer, under direction of Police Inspector Temple (Charles Coburn). One of the suspects is Robert Fleming (George Sanders) who may, or may not, be the killer. Fleming, suave and sophisticated, charms Carpenter into romantic complications.The whodunit element of "Lured" gets off to a strong start, with good direction, some spooky lighting at the beginning, and an assortment of interesting suspects. But, as the film progresses, the whodunit element gets undercut by the developing romance between Carpenter and Fleming. The upbeat "All For Love" musical score, combined with elegant costumes, reinforce the romantic theme. The whodunit element sputters out about two-thirds through the film.My impression is that the screenplay for this film was adapted from "Pieges", a 1939 French film (which I have not seen), billed as a romantic thriller. In "Lured", we certainly have a romantic theme; thrills maybe, depending on how you define "thrills". You get the feeling that the film's director (Douglas Sirk) started with the intention of making a whodunit, but later changed his mind and decided to make a romantic melodrama. The film's split personality may also be the result of the casting of two strong lead actors (Ball and Sanders), whom we do not usually associate with murder mysteries."Lured" certainly has entertainment value. I love Lucy no matter what role she plays. Coburn and Sanders are nearly always engaging. The film has good B&amp;W cinematography. The dialogue is crisp. And the film provides some great nostalgia, via 1940's clothes, hairstyles, and music. Overall, "Lured" has a great cast and some wonderful atmosphere. But, when I want to watch a murder mystery from the 30's or 40's, I will be more inclined to watch a film whose sole aim is to present a whodunit puzzle, such as, for example, a good old fashion Charlie Chan film with Sidney Toler ... romance be damned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lured is not very lurid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a serial killer film, this one must rank as the most reserved and dignified ever made. No blood nor gore, just urbane and sophisticated dialogue throughout, and especially from the killer, plus a bit of very enjoyable George Sanders-Lucille Ball romantic wit. Perhaps all victims die without bleeding/suffering/discomfort in meddy old England? "In England, we musn't dirty our hands while killing, musn't we?" But, that was typical of the bloodless killings of crime movies of that time.George Sanders as a good guy was a total waste here. He is at his best as a witty, sarcastic and selfish cad, which he was somewhat at the start but then soon lost his lust and fell hard for Ms Ball, at which time he lost my interest as he became just another central casting rich guy in love. Unfortunate decision by the studio, as he would have been much better using more of his well known crackling wit.As a result, Charles Coburn and Cedric Hardwicke were the best things in this film, after the radiant and gorgeous Lucille Ball. Coburn had most of the best dialogue, and came off as a brilliant mix of the philosophical and practical. The methodical way he discovered the killer was a bit long in coming, but interestingly effective overall.The film needed editing and story tightening to eliminate a lot of the too-long and languid story development dragginess that held it back from being one of the better mystery flicks I've seen over the years. I still give it a 7 out of 10, mainly for quality of dialogue and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven thriller with top notch cast...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LURED starts out promisingly with Scotland Yard on the trail of a serial killer and enlisting a friend of the latest victim (LUCILLE BALL) to help them solve the crime. CHARLES COBURN is the police inspector who sends Lucille on a dangerous mission to trap a killer. GEORGE SANDERS, in one of his more colorless roles, is the man with romantic designs on Ball the minute he has a phone conversation with her when she applies for a showgirl job opening.Sanders without witty dialog plays his straight role in a rather bored fashion, but there's some colorful work by ALAN MOBRAY, SIR CEDRIC HARDWICKE, GEORGE ZUCCO, ROBERT COOTE and ALAN NAPIER.Best of all is BORIS KARLOFF in an offbeat role as a mad dress designer who gets the chance to chew all the scenery in sight and then some.But somewhere towards the middle, the story loses steam and whatever dramatic tension was built up in the earlier scenes. Still, it manages to hold the interest with several red herrings tossed in the mix to throw off suspicion. However, any true mystery fan ought to be able to guess the murderer from the start.Best when it's going along at a brisk pace, but it does slow down to a trot toward the end. Lucille Ball does well in a dramatic role (delivered with some typical light touches) and all in all it manages to entertain despite some flaws.Douglas Sirk, noted more for his Technicolored melodramas in the '50s, does a nice job of direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much surprising and over-looked crime drama. Lucille Ball in Film-Noir. Miss Ball, fresh, leggy and lovely, plays Sandra Carpenter, an American living in London and working as a taxi-dancer. Her friend Lucy(Taris Chandler)goes missing after answering a job offer in the "personal" column; just like several others who've vanished without a trace. After being questioned by Scotland Yard, Sandra is talked into being a decoy undercover cop by Chief Inspector Temple(Charles Coburn). Not knowing that Sandra left her dancing job, she is squired by a mysterious and wealthy Mr. Fleming(George Sanders). Miss Carpenter hopes to lure the killer by answering personals herself.Very nice Black &amp; White photography with a brisk moving story and strong supporting cast that includes: Boris Karloff, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, George Zucco and Alan Napier. Ball is very impressive and strong in this roll; almost a shame she had to turn to comedy.</fullReview>

The differences between the treatments are minimal.-George Sanders is a better choice than Maurice Chevalier ,cause we do believe he might be a serial killer,which is difficult with the French chanteur.-On the other hand the scene featuring Boris Karloff is weaker than its French equivalent where Stroheim was more disturbing.-In both movies,the weakest link is the part of the story where the heroine is a servant in a shady house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lucy Trying to Find a Killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason LURED has not shown up on television very often. I don't know why, as it is well acted and directed. Possibly because of a flaw in the 1947 telling of the story that would be handled differently today. The villain is killing women because he cannot attract them like other men, and sees that they are at their most beautiful when they are dead (which oddly enough would have been the viewpoint of Reginald Christie, the Rillington Place strangler who was alive in 1947 and killing). But today the character would probably be latently homosexual. There are signs of it in his intellectual interests and even his use of poetry, as opposed to the other males in the film (especially the hero). I think that might have made the film a trifle more believable.LURED is based on a 1939 French movie that starred Maurice Chevalier, and possibly gave that great entertainer his meatiest dramatic role. The cast here is damned good one, with Lucille Ball as an American dancer in London who is searching for a missing friend. She is recruited by Charles Coburn (as a Chief Inspector from Scotland Yard) to assist him, Alan Napier, and Robert Coote in trying to find her friend and solve the disappearance (in two years) of eight other woman. She is supposed to be bait for the criminal - to lure him into a trap. Lucy is given the personal columns and is to answer all that pertain to some man seeking a woman as a companion.Ball is good - first as a tired American down on her luck (she is now a taxi dancer). She is hard boiled, but she seeks to improve herself. She does get a chance by answering an invitation to work for a nightclub owned by George Sanders and Cedric Hardwicke. But then her friend vanishes, and she finds her sense of public duty overcoming ambition.Except for one thing. Fate keeps throwing her and Sanders together, and the latter (from his phone call with Lucy earlier) has been very interested in her. Slowly they are falling in love.But she is determined to help Coburn. And the screenplay allows Douglas Sirk to go to town here. Sirk was brilliant at using the riches of materialism to manipulate his audiences (best shown in the 1950s in his color films). But in black and white he is just as effective, illustrating the situations Lucy finds herself in by his use of sets and costumes.First the meets Boris Karloff, a well dressed man who seems to be offering her a modeling job. He is. But(in a switch for Karloff) he is an insane couturier (ruined years earlier by unscrupulous competitors), and he is putting on his greatest show (with Lucy wearing a twenty year old (1920 style) gown for a non-existent audience of blue-bloods (the main seat supposedly for a Princess has a British bull dog growling in it!).Next she answers an ad for a maid in a banker's house. Interestingly this involves Lucy with a gang run by Joseph Calleia and Alan Mowbray (as a crooked butler - Topper's butler would not have approved). The gang is also causing young women to vanish, but for commercial reasons. Again the script is forced to change what is probably going on: the women, in the finished film are being shipped to become thieves working for Calliea in South America. In reality they would probably be turned into prostitutes in a white slavery ring down there. Again Sirk manages to translate a vision of the danger Lucy is in by the claustrophobic lower kitchen of the house where she is alone with a suspicious Calleia and a dumbfounded Mowbray.Finally Lucy agrees to marry George, and everything seems headed smoothly ahead, except for the mysterious criminal sending another poem to the Yard that seems to aim at Lucy. Then she finds disturbing items in Sanders' desk. And the story takes us back to the serious elements we saw earlier when Lucy was trying to find her missing pal.The film is quite good, and bears good comparison to later Sirk masterpieces like MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION and IMITATION OF LIFE. I only wish to add what several have pointed out: the performance of George Zucco as a Scotland Yard Lieutenant who works with Lucy, and is brave, but is also a perfect comic partner for her. Watch his interest in crosswords, and how she unconsciously helps him on them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baudelaire, Beauty &amp; Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of Robert Siodmak's "Pieges" (1939) is an engaging thriller about Scotland Yard's pursuit of a London serial killer who attracts his victims by advertising in the newspapers' personal columns. The mysterious maniac, who's clever enough to have avoided being caught by the police, is also conceited as he regularly sends them notes that include poetry and clues to the identities of his forthcoming targets. Checks carried out by the police reveal that the killer's verses are strongly influenced by the works of Charles Baudelaire and betray a preoccupation with a perceived link between beauty and death. Furthermore, the typeface of these notes is so distinctive that they could only have been produced by one specific typewriter.Sandra Carpenter (Lucille Ball) is a brash New York City dancer who'd travelled to London to work in a stage musical which had closed prematurely due to poor box office returns. After working for a while in her next job as a taxi-dancer in a popular dance hall, she becomes concerned when her fellow dancer and good friend Lucy Barnard (Tanis Chandler) goes missing. Police Inspector Harley Temple (Charles Coburn), is convinced that Lucy has become the killer's latest victim and so interviews Sandra. He quickly recognises her strong personal qualities and so invites her to assist in his hunt for the killer by acting as the bait to catch the culprit. Sandra readily agrees to work undercover as a temporary detective and then starts to systematically reply to each new personal ad that appears.Through her work, Sandra meets a variety of contacts including a seriously deranged retired dress designer called Charles van Druten (Boris Karloff) and a strange character called Dr Nicholas Moryani (Joseph Calleia) who it later transpires is involved in transporting young women to work as slaves in South America. In another of her blind dates, her contact, who she was due to meet at a classical music concert, fails to turn up, but that evening at the concert she meets nightclub owner Robert Fleming (George Sanders) and very soon, they fall in love.Robert is a sophisticated womaniser who lives in a large house with his business partner and close friend, Julian Wilde (Cedric Hardwicke). On the night of their engagement party, Sandra finds a number of suspicious items in Robert's desk (including Lucy's photograph) which lead to him being arrested and becoming the prime suspect in Inspector Temple's investigation but finding conclusive proof of his guilt proves to be extremely difficult."Lured" features a colourful collection of characters and the performances of its top quality cast are consistently good. Lucille Ball is irrepressible despite the number of times that her character has to be rescued from threatening situations and the unorthodox ways in which her bodyguard, Detective H.R. Barrett (George Zucco) finds the solutions to his crossword puzzles are also quite amusing. The emphasis in making this film was clearly on producing an upbeat thriller which has many of the characteristics of a routine whodunit (e.g. numerous red herrings) and judged purely on this basis, it is very successful and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poet Killer Believed To Be At Bay!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lured (AKA: Personal Column) is directed by Douglas Sirk and collectively written by Leo Rosten, Jacques Companéez, Simon Gantillon and Ernst Neubach. It stars Lucille Ball, George Sanders, Charles Coburn, Cedric Hardwicke, Joseph Calleia and Boris Karloff. Music is by Michel Michelet and cinematography by William H. Daniels.A serial killer in London is murdering young women whom he meets through the personal columns section of the newspaper. Taunting the police with cryptic poems, the killer is proving most illusive, so much so that when a friend of dancer Sandra Carpenter (Ball) disappears, the police enlist her to act as bait to lure the killer in.There's a lot to like about Lured, on proviso you have your expectation level correctly set as to what sort of film it is. It's a very uneven movie in tone, which when one sees that there were four writing contributors involved in bringing it to the screen, perhaps comes as no surprise. A remake of Robert Siodmak's 1939 film Pi?ges (set in Paris), it is never sure if it wants to be a comedy mystery or a dark brooding thriller. A shame because in spite of it being a set bound production, Sirk and Daniels create a sinister visual mood when the story lurks around the constructed London sets.The cast are ever watchable, though you can see Ball struggling to rein in her natural comedic bent during the more dramatic sequences, but she leads off from the front and looks positively lovely and radiant. Karloff fans get a fun extended cameo, with the great Uncle Boris playing up to a caricature of unstable characters he could do in his sleep, Sanders is suitably stand-offish, Coburn ebullient, while Hardwicke and Calleia add a touch of class to the support ranks.Michelet's musical score is in keeping with the mixed tonal flow of the picture, in fact sometimes sounding like it should be in a screwball movie from decades previously, but with competent professionalism coming elsewhere from Sirk, Daniels and the lead cast members, it's an enjoyable movie. Even if it's all a bit too jolly and nonchalant for its own good at times. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great, atmospheric tale of a struggling chorus girl (Lucille Ball)who is used as bait by London police to catch a serial killer who preys on women through newspaper personal advertisements. Douglas Sirk is the Director of the Moment due to the release of the superb Far from Heaven -a remake of Sirk's All That Heaven Allows- and his films are now being rented and talked about as if they never existed. This film is a beautiful showcase for the almost larger-than-life characters, incredibly detailed sets, and use of lighting that would become trademarks for his later films. Lucille Ball makes a great 'dame' and her dramatic abilities were sensational. Boris Karloff takes his one scene and plays it to the creepy hilt while George Sanders was a rather cool and sexy guy before he sealed his film fate as Addison DeWitt in All About Eve. Lured maybe hard to find in most video stores but give it a chance if you come across it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film noir thriller about an American dancer (Lucille Ball) in London recruited by Scotland Yard to help nab a serial killer. The killer, who taunts the police by sending them poems about the killings, finds his victims through ads in the personal column of the newspaper. Lucy's investigation puts her in contact with several odd characters played by fine character actors. The identity of the killer is fairly obvious even if you managed to avoid being spoiled by plot descriptions or other reviews. That being said, it's still fun to watch Lucy play detective and fun to sort through the red herrings. She snaps off quite a few 'tough dame' lines as well. The cast is just fantastic. In addition to Lucy, there's George Sanders, Charles Coburn, Alan Napier, Alan Mowbray, Boris Karloff, Cedric Hardwicke, and George Zucco. What a lineup! Karloff's part is tiny but he makes the most of it. If there's a major negative with the film, it's the length. For this era, it's unusual to see an 'A' runtime given to what is essentially a 'B' movie. The cast and Douglas Sirk's direction make it an enjoyable watch but it really should have been cut down some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Producer Hunt Stromberg of Lured wanted to make very sure his audience couldn't possibly suspect whoever the elusive strangler of young women might be in post World War II London. So he gathered a cast together any one of the men could have been that strangler who gets his victims through personal ad columns in London's papers.Lucille Ball is an American entertainer there who is raising quite a row with Scotland Yard over the disappearance of a friend. So Chief Inspector Charles Coburn decides to use her as undercover bait. A risky business, but Lucy has moxie.So Ms. Ball has a couple of adventures and even uncovers a white slavery ring, but no strangler. One of the cast is arrested, but he's not the right guy. At the very end we learn who it is without a few harrowing moments for our leading lady.When you've got a cast with people like George Sanders, Cedric Hardwicke, Joseph Calleia, Alan Mowbray, George Zucco, Alan Napier and Boris Karloff that could be any one of them. Stromberg and director Douglas Sirk counted on the movie going public's instinctive reactions to these people.It works nicely too. Even Coburn has seen some villainy on the screen. Lured is a nice mystery to it. I will give you a hint, it's the most cultured character in the cast.</fullReview>

Because of his counter-casting, even though there has never been any doubt that this great mostly-unknown English actor (except to horror &amp; comedy-mystery fans) would have pulled it off with his usual style &amp; class, and here, humor (remember, he was a hoot in "After the Thin Man" &amp; "Topper Returns").It's a fun whodunit with a really solid cast from top to bottom, including favorites Alan Mobray, Gerald Hamer, Joseph Calleia, Charles Coburn,and Alan Napier (Alfred the butler on "Batman")."Lured" is about a lady killer on the loose in London, and includes a cast with such leading stars as Lucille Ball, George Sanders, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and George Sanders - but it's Zucco who always demands that the viewer watch.Horror legend Boris Karloff shows up in as a crazed dress designer. His moment is priceless.Hopefully, one or two of the terrific new retro networks will add this to their rotations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meanders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oddball film with a thriller premise?a poetic serial killer is on the loose. However, the movie soon turns into more of a psychological drama than anything else. Sandra (Ball) goes undercover in a house full of suspects to smoke out the culprit. Now, mystery thrillers usually thrive on atmosphere and suspense as we sort through suspects while tension mounts. However, the narrative here meanders, especially after we're tipped off to the culprit, while the photography remains fairly gray and uninteresting. Perhaps the movie's direction isn't surprising. Director Sirk made his name helming high-class soap opera, which the lengthy romantic side here resembles.Nonetheless, Ball is ravishing and gets to play dress-up. Seeing her here reveals a whole different side from the slapstick comedienne. Sanders is smooth and charming as expected. But the movie can't seem to figure out just what his role is. Speaking of roles, the brief Karloff freak-out is a head-scratcher. He's a name star, yet gets only a 15-minute cameo and then disappears. I'm guessing the segment was inserted to spice up the marquee.The concert scene, however, remains an amusing surprise with the bearded man and the clever dialog. But the screenplay itself is just too flabby and the direction too slack to effectively realize the promising premise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a way, it's easy to see why Lucille Ball did not achieve mega movie stardom. By the time she was getting decent roles, she was in her thirties, and back in those days, that was getting long in the tooth. Though she was beautiful, she had the delivery of a character woman -- great comic timing and dry wit. I suspect Hollywood wasn't sure what to do with her -- too pretty for the Eve Arden roles, and not ingenue enough for the leading lady ones.In "Lured," Ball plays Sandra Carpenter, an American dancer living in London whose good friend and fellow dancer disappears after answering a personal ad. The police, led by Inspector Temple (Charles Coburn) have been frustrated by a series of poems they have been receiving before a murder of a young woman takes place. They feel helpless. When it turns out that Sandra's friend is a victim of the mad poet, the Harley asks Sandra to act as bait and answer suspect ads. They will be watching her at all times.Sandra has some strange adventures -- one with a whack job (Boris Karloff) who wants to paint her in costume, and then she is invited to a concert where her date does not show up. There, she meets wealthy Robert Fleming (George Sanders) who sweeps her off her feet. Could he be the killer? Could it be the strange doctor she meets? There are a few suspects.Well directed by Douglas Sirk, known later for his big glossy soap opera type films, "Lured" has suspense and atmosphere, though it moves from a mystery to a love story mid-script. However, the performances are very good - Lucy looks stunning in her gowns and she plays the down to earth, savvy young woman very well; George Sanders is smooth as silk, and the two have good chemistry. Sir Cedric Hardwicke gives a standout performance, and Coburn is excellent. "Alfred the Butler" from the Batman series, Alan Napier, is also in the film, as is George Zucco.Recommended. Very enjoyable. Just wish the emphasis had been more on the mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To nab a serial killer on the loose in London, Scotland Yard enlists an American woman whose friend was a victim. It sounds good on paper and has a respected director and a good cast, but it doesn't add up to much. In the 1950s, Sirk become one of the masters of melodramatic soap operas, but here he seems outs of his element. The lame script doesn't help matters. A change of pace for Lucy, playing the American woman that the police enlist on the spur of the moment in a ridiculous scene. Sanders is the debonair, rich fellow who falls for Lucy, but is he the serial killer? Coburn and Karloff are wasted in poorly conceived roles. The identity of the killer will not come as a shock to many.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It gets fully eight stars because it succeeded well in what it set out to do: provide an interesting suspense story with enough light moments to keep it from getting too one toned. You get a little ahead of the story at times, but it doesn't matter because it's interesting watching the way the film deals with the various plot points. There's one point when you think the police are stopping and you want to say 'Hey wait a minute, what about...' and then they address the issue. A fun movie-watching moment. The cast were all very good; Lucille Ball is great in these crime stories; it makes me wish she hadn't gone fully into comedy. If you like her in this, I recommend 'The Dark Corner'--a good noir in which she plays a similar role and does so very well, available on DVD as one entry in the fine Fox Film Noir series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointing, though only because it begins so promisingly. Lucille Ball stars as a dance hall girl, an American in London, who becomes a detective to find out what has happened to a missing friend. A serial killer poet is on the prowl. The police have Lucy answer personal ads, which is how the killer found his eight victims. This provides some excellent vignettes, the most amazing and memorable of which stars Boris Karloff. He's only in the film for five minutes, but, man, he is so good here. He's the only thing that can steal the movie away from Lucille Ball. Fortunately, Ball is wonderful, too. This is one of her best performances. George Sanders also stars as a night club manager who develops an interest in Lucy. He's good, but I never ever believe that his initial lust ever turns into love, as it supposedly does here. Though the mystery is in the first two-thirds of the film, all the secrets are revealed rather poorly at a certain point. And then the police investigation drags on and on and on. Lured screeches to a halt from which it never recovers. The faults are all in the script. 7/10.</fullReview>

George Sanders co-stars as the man Ball falls in love with, although he's a prime suspect. The movie is decent enough and the two leads offer good performances but overall it has the feel of been there done that.

		<fullReview>I like Douglas Sirk in his early Hollywood days. I'm not a fan of his later, more famous work, such as "Imitation of Life," which I consider in every way inferior to the version from the 1930s. (Of course I like "Written on the Wind." Who wouldn't!) He is at his very best in this intentionally creepy, suspenseful film noir. Lucille Ball volunteers to be a decoy in solving a string of murders of young women. The murderer writes a poem about each victim, in the style of Baudelaire. (Though I'd call it a true noir, it is generally high toned, with excellent music. This includes a beuatifully played Schubert's "Unfinished" Symphony that Ball attends live, as part of her work.) What a collection of suspects we have here: Boris Karloff, Alan Mowbray, George Sanders, Cedric Hardwicke, George Zucco ...! This is not to mention Police Chief Charles Coburn, whom the viewer never holds above suspicion.Far be it from me so much as to hint at who the killer is. However, I must eliminate one of the suspects, who is eliminated in an early scene: Boris Karloff posts an advertisement to which Ball responds. He is a precursor to Norma Desmond: an aging recluse trying to relive his days of glory. He was, of all things, a dress designer. Ball has to model a beautiful gown he created years earlier. Karloff attacks this role with relish and he is superbly bizarre. The scene in which he lashes out at his faithful housekeeper is truly chilling.It's a trifle long, but I cannot imagine anyone's finding this cornucopia of luscious women -- Ball is at her best -- and unsavory suspects less than fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big cast suspense film set in London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before her 1951-57 smash hit TV sitcom, "I Love Lucy," that would make her a household name forever, Lucille Ball was an accomplished actress. She will always be known for her comedy, but she had many talents. She could dance up a storm, and sing a tune. She was a very attractive starlet who played nicely in some dramas and romances. Throw in a couple of Westerns and several mystery-suspense-thrillers, and you have a well-rounded, excellent actress. She made more than 100 movies in her lifetime, besides her "I Love Lucy" TV series, followed by "The Lucy Show" in 1962-1968, and finally, "Here's Lucy" that ran from 1968 to 1974. TV Guide called her the greatest TV start of all time. "Lured" is one of the mystery-crime movies that starred Ball, with a wonderful cast of other big names of the time. She does an excellent job as an American, Sandra Carpenter, who is stranded in London when a stage show she was in closed after just three nights' run. George Sanders plays Robert Fleming; Charles Coburn is Inspector Harley Temple of Scotland Yard, Cedric Hardwicke is Fleming's partner, Julian Wilde. All give very good performances. As do a number of other very talented actors ? Alan Mowbray as Lyle Maxwell, George Zucco as Officer Barrett, and a host of others in small or cameo roles. One is Boris Karloff, and all I'll say about him is that I don't think I've ever seen Karloff laugh at all, let alone laugh so long and hard and convincingly, as in this film. To give the plot of this film might ruin it for viewers. It's a very clever script. It's in black and white, which lends a nice touch to the scenes of foggy nights in London. All the technical aspects of the film are very good. This is a nicely engaging movie that's sure to entertain. And give people who only know of Lucy Ricardo from her first TV show, a look at a very talented actress who could do almost anything on stage or film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's kind of fun, an example of an early serial killer, just as tricky as all the more modern ones. This madman advertises for pretty girls then murders them because he's too shy to reveal his love. (It's murky, but then the whole plot is a little turbid.) It's more amusing than suspenseful. Lucille Ball, doing a fine job, is swept up in the police effort to nail the murderer. She's used as bait.Of course, the agony columns carry lots of advertisements for pretty girls available for promising jobs, and Ball has to answer the most suspicious-looking adverts. (This is in London.) One of them is Boris Karloff, more menacing than ever, who has her wear a formal gown of his own design and displays her before an audience of dogs and mannequins in his shabby loft. He goes berserk and begins to chase her around with a sabre. He is, however, more of a red herring than a monster.The real killer is strongly hinted at, about two thirds of the way through the movie, as the movie grows less comic and somewhat darker.The cast is exceptionally good. George Sanders is always a splendid cad, and he has a sort of above-it-all character here, minus the sneer but with that built-in superiority. He's also believable as a male romantic lead. Lucille Ball is not nearly as dumb as Lucy and gets to stretch her acting chops a little. She has no esplaineen to do regarding her performance. But then everyone is quite all right. Interesting to see Sir Cedric Hardwicke as a villain. He's certainly convincing. What a marvelous voice. Joseph Calleia is so overcooked as another villain that his eyes pop out like the thermometer button that comes with the Thanksgiving turkey. George Zucco, for a change, is a lower-class cop, on the side of the angels.It's a good example of the kind of films that used to be put out in the 30s and 40s. It's overscored. The music tells us exactly what sensations we should feel, just in case we're confused. Loose ends lie all over the place. It's unpretentious but it includes poems from Baudelaire and Schubert's Eighth Symphony without any apology or judgment.You'll probably like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This picture telegraphs every pivotal point in the story, so much so that it ceases to be in the upper echelon of mystery stories or film noir movies. It has a lot to recommend it, including a first-rate cast and a good premise, but lacks suspense and tension - and it telegraphs the unsatisfactory ending. It is a transparent picture which holds your interest to a point.Sandra (Lucille Ball) and her friend Lucy (!) are taxi dancers. Lucy answers a personal ad in the paper, hoping for a better job and more money, but she is never seen again. It so happens there is a murderer loose in London, preying on single girls, and Sandra goes to Scotland Yard to report her friend missing. Chief Insp. Temple (Chas. Coburn) overhears her story and enlists her as a decoy in the case."Lured" is a showcase for Lucille Ball. Dressed up for a nightclub date, she is breathtaking and never looked better. She is the nominal star of the film, and she is good. She just lacks gravitas for such a role, which should have gone to the likes of Ann Sheridan or even one of the Lane sisters. I disagree with a previous reviewer in that I found precious little chemistry between George Sanders and Ms. Ball and their relationship seemed forced. But as mentioned, the support cast is a fascinating mix with Sanders, George Zucco and Boris Karloff. They do their best to bring some menace to a movie which wanders off point and with too many red herrings for a higher rating.</fullReview>

But, never mind, Lucille Ball is excellent and we can see just what a loss to cinema she was when swallowed up by TV. Indeed all the cast a great, helped by the dialogue and plotting. George Sanders is his usual likable self but it is the Karloff cameo that shines and for me his surreal scene makes the film worth seeing on its own.

		<shortDescription>Well-acted detective story...some funny, cynical asides, though the script doesn't hold together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early directorial effort from Douglas Sirk offers an offbeat role for Lucille Ball, ably playing an American dancer in London who is enlisted by Scotland Yard to catch a poem-writing serial killer who preys on showgirls. Leo Rosten's screenplay (culled from perhaps various treatments by Jacques Companéez, Simon Gantillon, and Ernest Neuville) is loosely-hinged at best, thin at worst. A sequence with Boris Karloff as a delusional designer goes on far too long, as does a tiresome thread with Ball working as a maid for a possible pervert. Entertaining on a minor level, especially for Lucy-addicts (her dryly comic exasperation is very funny, as is her rapport with the inspectors on the case). George Sanders is ideally cast as a wealthy nightclub owner who takes a shine to our heroine--and who wouldn't? Ball may be photographed in black-and-white, but she exudes both sophisticated glamor and attractive street-smarts. She's a peach. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What if once upon a time in Hollywood a young adventurous movie director decided to buck the studio system and pull together a creative independent ?lm? And suppose he hired the queen of B movies to star as the heroine, and he dressed her up in beautiful gowns and made her look very alluring. What if he then places her in a dark and brooding London setting where a murderous, madman is on the loose, killing pretty young women by advertising for them in the personal columns? Then just to spice up the cast he adds the king of horror movies as one of the villains, the quintessential movie playboy/cad as the love interest, and one of England's top stage actors to make things interesting. What if all these things did in fact come together and were ?lmed in glorious black &amp; white, and the subsequent ?lm was rushed into theaters and after a very short run it quietly faded away without anyone ever really knowing much about it? Well now, after 52 years, this hidden jewel has now been rediscovered! The movie is entitled `Lured,' and it stars, Lucille Ball, Boris Karloff, Charles Colburn, George Sanders, Cedric Hardwicke and George Zucco. It was directed in 1947, by Douglas Sirk, written by Leo Rostin and produced by Hunt Stromberg. After viewing this movie I was struck by the outstanding performance of Lucille Ball in a very rare dramatic portrayal. Her Sandra Carpenter is a saucy dish with an penchant for adventure, and she gets her chance to experience all the adventure she can stand when Scotland Yard employs her to go undercover to help trap a lunatic, serial killer. The plot is intricate, with plenty of red herrings thrown in to mislead you to the wrong suspect. The gorgeous sets are all top notch and add to the over-all dark, moody atmosphere which permeates this ?lm. My hat is off to KINO for ?nding and bringing this nearly lost classic back to the public. They have just made it available on DVD and I can't wait to see it that format too. I highly recommend this ?lm for anyone who has never seen Lucille Ball in a dramatic performance and also for anyone who loves a good murder mystery, this is a great ?nd!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh-feeling horror-themed thriller features Karloff and Zucco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fairly typical murder mystery set in the cobbled streets of London (and seemingly sharing many of the sets and cast of the Rathbone/Holmes series with it) is enlivened by the presence of a distinguished cast who breathe life into some of the more stuffier characters in this film. The brisk direction of Douglas Sirk is generally assured, although the film does get bogged down in romance in the second half and is also a tad overlong. What I liked most about this film were the unexpected plot turns: Ball manages to capture a maniac and undercover a secret woman-smuggling operation before she even begins to get close to the real killer in this film! There's certainly a wealth of plot strands which make the film well worth a look for fans of the period who know what to expect.Lucille Ball makes for a pretty, yet feisty heroine, while George Sanders is equal charm and anguish as a lover turned murder suspect. For the horror fan, the film is chiefly of note for the presence of three distinguished genre veterans, although it also skilfully succeeds in working up some atmosphere and a few chills in the gloomy streets of London where danger seemingly lurks on every corner. Firstly it is the great man himself, Boris Karloff, who makes an appearance. Karloff plays a mad clothes designer who gets Ball to model in his abandoned theatre, the only witnesses being a couple of dummies and a dog. Karloff really has lost it, and when Ball snubs him he turns murderous. Although his is only a ten minute scene, Karloff is brilliantly convincing in his role of a distinguished man who has lost his mind, and his performance is both moving and frightening. Secondly, under-rated veteran George Zucco (usually a poor man's villain of the '40s) has a fun comic turn as a policeman with a penchant for crosswords; fans will be pleased to hear that he gets to engage in a (brief) fight with Karloff too, as a bonus! Cedric Hardwicke - a veteran of half a dozen classic horrors - has a minor role as a secretary.With an intelligent script, good performances from the cast and plenty going on, LURED is a film which is rarely boring and passes the time well for those who watch. My only quibble is that the identity of the killer is rather obvious throughout, but they still manage to throw in a final twist to put us off the scent at the end. While not a memorable film in any respect, LURED fulfils what it set out to do (i.e. involve and entertain) and is worth a watch on a rainy afternoon for those looking for something different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie used to turn up a lot on Australian television during the 1960's, but now seems quite rare with the DVD fetching a high price if Amazon is any guide.It's a serial killer movie before the term was actually coined. The film is set in Hollywood London with plenty of fog, sumptuous interiors, loads of atmosphere and a terrific cast.Lucille Ball, a few years before "I love Lucy", plays Sandra Carpenter an American working as a taxi dancer. When a friend of hers becomes a victim of The Poet Killer, she is hired by Inspector Temple (Charles Coburn) of Scotland Yard as a temporary undercover policewoman to act as bait.Although the way the police put the clues together with early attempts at psychological profiling is interesting, credulity is stretched when Temple enlists Sandra after a few questions and asking her to lift her dress to check the shape of her legs ? he also gives her a pistol. However Charles Couburn brings plenty of gravitas to his character, which makes up for the odd lapse in logic.The murder plot is woven around wanted ads in the paper and messages based on the poems of Baudelaire, "One of the most fantastic madmen who ever lived", according to Inspector Temple. Sandra also becomes involved with Robert Fleming (George Sanders) and his business partner Julian Wilde (Cedric Hardwick) who together run a string of popular nightclubs. Both men are drawn into the mystery, which keeps the whole plot pretty close to home.The film is full of red herrings including a bizarre sequence starring Boris Karloff.The reason why the film works so well is the brilliant mood that is established from the start, a clever script and the smooth direction by Douglas Sirk ? the film has a light touch without losing suspense. Then there are the stars; a very pretty Lucille Ball exudes feistiness and confidence, while George Sanders delivers that unique quality of unflappable sophistication and superiority, and he plays a nicer guy here than his Addison Dewitt in "All About Eve" ? he was a brilliant screen presence that was never replaced.Although a suspension of disbelief helps, this movie has something. I love the ending, but I wouldn't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it. It's one of those films, I can always watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A homicidal maniac is loose in London, murdering young women he meets through newspaper personal ads. When Lucy Barnard goes missing, her friend Sandra Carpenter (Lucille Ball) agrees to help Scotland Yard catch a killer. Along the way, however, she falls in love with number one suspect Robert Fleming (George Sanders). Despite all the evidence to the contrary, he can't be the killer, can he?Despite all the flaws in Lured, it's just too much fun not to give it a positive rating. The cast is strong. I really enjoyed watching several of them play against character. Sanders usually played men in charge of their environment. It was interesting to watch him play a character who has lost control of his situation. Lucy is obviously best know for her work in comedy. While she a few funny moments in Lured, I was really impressed with her efforts in the more dramatic parts. George Zucco, an actor I know best playing Egyptian priests or mad scientists, gets a chance to do comedy. He's more than up to the task. Throw into the mix the talents of Boris Karloff, Charles Coburn, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Alan Mowbray, and Alan Napier and you've got one impressive cast. Beyond the cast, other positives I found in Lured, include: fabulous costumes, nice cinematography, a witty script, and plenty of atmosphere. But as I said, Lured has it's share of flaws. Chief among them is that there's really not much of a mystery. I found it way too easy to spot the killer. And his motives are a bit muddled. If he did it because he loved Sandra, then why kill all the other women? If he did it because he loved Fleming (as some suspect), then why frame him? There's a lot of plot inconsistency. Finally, as much as I enjoyed watching Lucy and Karloff in their scenes together, it doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie. It almost felt like this part came from another film. These scenes really do nothing to advance the plot.Even with the multiple problems, like I said, Lured is a fun movie. A 6/10 from me.</fullReview>

This is a scatterbrained affair that changes tone many times and its 107 Minute Running Time can seem like an eternity to some.Not without flashes of interest, like the First Act, a bizarre Cameo by Boris Karloff, and an almost mind-boggling way it goes about being true to its Mystery Premise and then abandoning it for syrupy Romance and Upper-Crust Pageantry, and then returning. There are many unnecessary diversions and it is frankly overfilled with fluff and is certainly not Film-Noir.Not a bad Movie, but a strange one, and as a whole it is weighted down with an overload of side steps, and pieces that don't fit comfortably together.

This independent production released by United Artists has a lot to be said for it. It has a song called "All About Love". It has mystery, suspense and romance.Charles Coburn is as good as ever as the Inspector from Scotland Yard trying to track down a serial killer. At the beginning of the film, the killer claims his 7th Victim within minutes. Coburn keeps getting teasing poems from the killer after each woman goes missing.The biggest problem is the women are missing, &amp; presumed dead, but there are no bodies leading to no chain of evidence. Then, Lucy is enlisted by the police, as bait, to try and trap the killer. She eventually does, but not until shes goes up a couple of blind alleys.While it gets too easy to figure out who the killer is towards the end, the film does what it is supposed to accomplish. It follows an interesting plot through logically until the end. Lucy is very good playing this one straight. Sir Cedric Harwick is solid in support as well. A few wrinkles show in the production as the story is supposed to be in London, but there is very little scenery which makes it seem a little staged. Still, this is worthwhile viewing as the acting is well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not melodrama, nor film-noir, for Douglas Sirk it's like 'melonoir'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Douglas Sirk isn't one to usually associate with films of the night, shot in black and white and involving criminals and the police or femme fatales (or the would-be kind). He's most associated and revered for films like All That Heaven Allows or Imitation of Life, films shot specifically on 1950's color stock and featuring high-stakes emotional content with stories that sometimes are too incredible to be true - except in the way Sirk tells it. But there was a time he did other films, and Lured is one of them. It also features Lucille Ball before she was made iconic on I Love Lucy (oddly enough for the longest time she was called "Queen of the B's), and it's captivating to see her in this role in the film.Lured is about a killer, who, so it goes, the police can't seem to track down. They receive messages from the killer written in the want-ads, all addressed to women as personals, usually with a poem ala Baudelaire. So they recruit a tough-as-nails girl, Sandra Carpenter (Ball), working at a nightclub, to go undercover looking for who might be the killer. First she comes across a guy who could be it- a rotten scoundrel played in a really awesome if obvious scene of creepiness by Boris Karloff- but then gets closer to a talent agent (George Sanders) who seems to be the type, plus he's come into contact with all of the murdered girls, innocently he claims. So who is it, he, who wants to sweep Sandra off her feet and marry her, or someone else? Sirk navigates this story with some skill as a director, though it's mostly when the story takes its high-emotional turns in the second half that it really feels like a Douglas Sirk picture (it's nowhere near as melodramatic as All That Heaven Allows, but it comes close in its high-stake moves for its characters). What makes it interesting is a preference for dialog and a mind-chess-game kind of approach that is akin to a police drama rather than a usual crime film. Only once is there a big fight scene, when Sanders beats up a guy who is trying to attack Ball in a park, and another when the killer is revealed. It also has some fun with the undercover angle with Ball; while Sanders does well acting all dignified and leading-man-like (how could he not), and Coburn does a good job in a supporting role as the Captain of the police, it's Ball's movie all the way. I loved seeing her show this much range, being tough and sensitive, amused and refined, cautious and surprised. Lots of things for her to do here, and she pulls off a character that another actress might have been prettier in but not as deep a talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An edgy title for an easygoing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of old movies about killers stalking beautiful women in London. This one may be the tamest, but it is nevertheless a lot of fun. Though Lucille Ball as seen here is not yet the "Lucy" of TV sitcom legend, this "B" picture is essentially a comedy. She plays a down-on-her-luck American entertainer who's recruited by Scotland Yard to catch a lonely hearts killer. Her challenge is to find the fiend by weeding out all the harmless (and not-so-harmless) eccentrics who are also using the Personal Columns in the newspapers. It seems that most of the British actors working in Hollywood at the time wound up on "Lured," and all of them were clearly having a ball. The plot strains credulity a little too much toward the end, but by that time you care about Ball's character and are rooting for her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i've always wanted to watch this film and finally got the opportunity to see it recently. i have to say that it was worth seeing because it's not often you see lucille ball in a mystery thriller. she does a great job playing the lead role as a tough, independent, and brave dancer who tries to 'lure' the killer in. it's a wonder why she didn't do more films like this. her other great performance in a mystery thriller comes from 'the dark corner' which is also a must-see, although her role is not as big.this noir film is entertaining with the quality of 1940s. it emphasizes greatly on shadow and light, and it only becomes better with the London setting, using dark alleys and one source of light from a street lamp. adding to that "jack-the-ripper" mysterious setting is the plot, which tries to confuse you by showcasing different characters that you might suspect as the serial killer. the film is serious yet comical at some points such as when the investigator finds answers to his crossword puzzles through ball's random spoken words.overall, great film but some character development may be needed to prevent flatness and give more depth to the story. if this film was adapted for today's market where more emphasis was placed on the serial killer and killing and less on the G-rating, it could be awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic, underrated murder thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1947 horror was entering one of its most barren periods with only Abbott and Costello really having horror incorporated into their popular comedy films. The studios seemed to have run out of ideas and the stars languished. It is therefore a very welcome surprise to see this rarely mentioned psychological thriller that is every bit the equal of classic horror films from any era. The cast is amazing, George Sanders, Boris Karloff and George Zucco all co-star. A murderer is presumed to have killed seven missing women and is sending taunting poems to the police giving clues as to the next victim.The setting is a very well evoked London full of cobbled streets, street lamps and hanging fog. Lucille Ball in an early role plays a woman who helps the police track the killer becoming entangled with playboy George Sanders. She is very good and plays drama off against moments of comedy delightfully. The film is full of menace and red herrings, the plot twists and turns without becoming convoluted and the viewer constantly has to refine who the killer is in their mind. There are quite startlingly violent for the time fight scenes that provide strong highlights. Boris Karloff plays a suspect, more to be pitied than feared, a demented fashion designer whose mind was lost when his designs were stolen. He replays the launch of these designs that never happened in his run down house, full of pathos and uncontrolled rage. In truth, they could have made a whole film from this one section.George Zucco is great as the undercover police inspector protecting Lucille Ball, initially full of furtive glances he then plays a light comedy support role to fantastic effect. He clearly relishes the part and it could have been worked into a Sherlock Holmes style series that would have been very entertaining. The film moves along swiftly and an hour in you think the case is all wrapped up, but how wrong we are and it changes dramatically. The killer won't be guessed at the start and the person is very effective in an obssessional and delusional part.The direction is excellent, the sets plush and the feeling is one of professionalism and quality. I would have no hesitation in recommending this underrated and wonderfully atmospheric film. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective early Douglas Sirk-directed,Lucille Ball-driven drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before becoming a big name in the 1950's as Universal's house director(1954's "Magnificent Obsession", 1959's "Imitation of Life"), Douglas Sirk dabbled in westerns and film noir-ish mysteries. "Lured" is one such mystery that stars a pre-"I Love Lucy" Lucille Ball, George Sanders, and Boris Karloff. Ball stars as a showgirl in London who gets drawn into the search for a serial killer when one of her dancer friends becomes an apparent victim of this killer. The killer preys on London's most beautiful women via personal columns. Ball is hired by Scotland Yard to answer personal columns in an attempt to track the real killer. She encounters frightening situations and odd characters in her search. When she falls in love with one of the men, she begins to fear for her life as he may indeed be the killer. Sirk's direction is really quite impressive with his shadowing and his uncanny ability to beautifully capture women on film. Ball, too, is good, although she really seems to be a bit out of place when it comes to high drama. And the always excellent Sanders doesn't disappoint. Overall, "Lured" is a good, solid worthwhile thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Lured by Sirk &amp; Co...and Beautiful Lucille Ball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody who doesn't know that Lucille Ball was one beautiful woman, should see this lesser known film of director Douglas Sirk's.Sirk certainly knows how to pepper his films with great names and recognizable faces. Where else can you find Lucy, George Sanders, Charles Coburn, Boris Karloff, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Alan Mowbray, Joseph Calleia, and George Zucco (who is great in a role that's a refreshing change of pace for him) but in a Sirk film? Its use of time and place puts you right there in the midst of the action, and Lucy is right in it of course, in this whodunit tale of old London.My only complaint is its length and the fact that you can hear the voice of the killer at the very beginning. At least three of the male stars are known for their eloquent voices and the killer's voice is very recognizable to the keen ears and those who know him. Once the slow viewers finally get it, at a critical point, it still takes some time to nab the culprit.But, if you want to spend time with the best of Sirk's friends in this tale of a poet-like Jack the Ripper, then sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

Charles Coburn is an old favorite who always gets right into character. Hardwicke and Sanders were at the top of their game at this time and their performances show it. And that cameo by Karloff is super. Ideal writing matched with ideal actors. But, young Lucille Ball steals every scene from her older, more-experienced colleagues in this movie, as she did throughout her career. There's just something in her stage-presence and her commitment to the project that make every movie she's in 'Lucy's picture.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly a film noir, but noir influenced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To some people any movie shot in black and white in the 1940's that was not a western or a war movie is a film noir. Not that classifications are really important to one's enjoyment of a movie but they do guide the faithful as to which films to embrace. Since the term itself is retroactive (it was coined by the French in the late 50's and not used by US critics until the 70's)it is often very subjective.Whether it be thriller or noir, Lured is a great example of how the studio system (even though this was an independent production) could turn out top notched entertainment over and over again. It is an early take on the serial killer sub-genre and given the uniform excellence of the cast, Lured is the type of movie that you could show in mixed company (the company being those that love old films &amp; those that are indifferent to them)As a mystery it hold together pretty well. Is the killer Bris Karlof? Well he always plays a killer so it might be. Is it George Sanders? He plays the villain so much that no one would be surprised? Is the killer Cedrick Hardwicke (great as the old Pharaoh in "The Ten Commandments") is is the chauffeur? He looks guilty on occasion, and so on. In summation, I would say that Lured is more like a film noir than a true film noir but those interested in the genre will want to see for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too sloppily written to be anything more than a time-passer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's the matter with this film's casting--was Hollywood running out of genuine English actors? I can't understand with all the English actors in the film and the film being set in London, you'd sure think that all the actors would be Brits--or at least sound British. So why did they cast Charles Coburn (a great actor, sure) and Lucille Ball in this film? As a result, when the film started I felt puzzled to say the least but at least noticed that there were a lot of actors in the film other than these two leads who actually were Brits.The film concerns a serial killer who is killing pretty young ladies. Oddly, he has a calling card of sorts, as he leaves strange and rather cryptic poems for the police. When Lucille Ball is able to give the police some important information concerning her friend who just disappeared, the police instantly make her a police woman and send her out on assignments to find the killer. It seems that whoever is doing the killings is using personal ads in the newspaper to recruit victims, so they have Lucy go in response to many, many such ads.Here's the odd part--and I don't blame the film makers for this but the marketing jerks at Kino Video today. You see, on the cover of the DVD, there is a nice photo of Lucy and Boris Karloff and it's very prominent. However, Karloff is only in the movie about five minutes and he's eliminated as a suspect early on in the film--yet the DVD maker would have the viewer expect this to be a film in which Karloff starred. Heck, a dozen people were in the movie would could have easily been put on the cover with Lucy instead! Despite all this, Karloff is NOT the psycho (or at least he's a DIFFERENT psycho). So, Lucy goes on several more meetings until she is able to crack a smuggling ring--but not the serial killer. Along the way, she meets and almost instantly falls in love with George Sanders and they decide to marry(!). But, when it appears that Sanders may actually be the killer, Lucy may be in for far more than she thought.The film has an interesting plot and could have been a very good film...but it was not. There were several problems with the film. First, the casting was just all wrong. Second, what police force in the world would take an untrained civilian and make her an instant police woman? Additionally, why would they hand her a loaded gun--especially when the British police rarely carry revolvers! Third, the relationship with Sanders and Lucy just went way, way too fast. No offense, but he's rather erudite and rich--so why would he go all ga-ga over Lucy? Back in the 1930s, she was rather pretty but still so unlike Sanders. Now, in 1947, the match just made little sense--perhaps he was on the rebound from Zsa-Zsa. Sadly, so much about the writing was good--such as the nice plot twists in the latter half of the film. But it's just too sloppy and improbable throughout to be more than a time-passer.Sad, as there was a cast of wonderful actors that were unfortunately wasted. Other than the folks I already mentioned, the film starred Cedric Hardwicke, George Zucco, Joseph Calleia, Joseph Calleia and Alan Napier--all very, very talented men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's in the detail.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of some miscasting in key roles this mystery about a London serial killer never flags much in part to the energetic direction of Douglas Sirk. Sirk doesn't allow the viewer to rest a moment as he fills his scenes with sumptuous compositions of detail and action that give hint or distract from the murder trail. It is a work of superb craftsmanship and a very entertaining one at that.Sandra Carpenter (Lucille Ball) is a streetwise taxi dancer at a club in London whose co- worker and friend disappears raising suspicion she may be the latest victim of a well read serial killer partial to Baudelaire who enjoys taunting the police. She brings her concerns to police inspector Temple (Charles Coburn) who hires her on the spot to work undercover to trap the killer. She then gets involved with well known cad about town and prime suspect Robert Fleming (George Sanders) which totally confuses her handlers. Fleming is eventually charged with murder but Sandra remains torn.Lured is one suspenseful fun ride of a whodunnit with Sirk and top tier cinematographer William Daniels filling each scene with fluid, pertinent detail and camera movement that doesn't waste an inch of the frame. It does get convoluted in moments but even that can be rewarding as in the scene with Sandra believing she's luring the killer (a wonderful cameo by Boris Karloff) who instead turns out to be a demented eccentric into psycho drama. George Sanders as the rake is perfectly cast. Being one of the few actors capable of playing heel or hero convincingly he extends the guessing game. Cedric Hardwicke does exactly the opposite however with a tell tale staginess. It may be unfair to single out Lucille Ball as being miscast given the fact that their is no more famous a fictional character and actual person melding in entertainment history. What Daniels did for Garbo he does for Lucy (see) and she starts strong but then goes in and out with a wide eyed naive the rest of the way that doesn't fit a noir fatlale. Then again it may well have been Sirk's intention to give the film a lighthearted spirit while still making biting observations and giving a master class in mise en scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sirk's "most German" Hollywood film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LURED (1947) is interestingly enough, the most Germanic film Douglas Sirk directed in the US. It's not in his pre-war style, which was at least, on a superficial level, light and happy, no matter the dark world underneath in the human psyche. Rather this seems to be set in a certain milieu familiar to German film-goers for the 20s and 30s - urban paranoia. The settings are a dance hall, police headquarters, night clubs, concerts, we see men wearing evening dress and "ein zilender", black top hats, cigarette holders, the whole urban life which mixed French Fuillelades and urban decadence. Fritz Lang was the master poet of this genre whose films standout so much as individual works ("M") that it's difficult to envisage as an integrated genre. Try watching this film and ignore the English dialogue and it looks like one of these German crime films. The scenes in Scotland Yard with its strange antiquated high tech devises like the map case with its retinue of city maps. There are always maps in Lang's films, especially considering the fact that for Lang the dark world underneath is also very literal. All of the characters confirm to the typege of the German genre. There is the chief, an older man (here played by Charles Coburn), a Scotland Yard Inspector, wise and clever in the ways of crime and criminals. He has two assistants, the angular Alan Napier and the haimish Robert Coote. The film takes place in London, or rather a sort of London, London/Hollywood via UFA. The plot is rather simple. Someone has been placing personal ads attracting young women and murdering them with pseudo-Baudelaire poems to taunt the police. Lucille Ball is a tanner- a-dance girl who suspects her friend has met with foul play and goes to the police who recruit her to go undercover, answering likely personal ads. She goes on a series of "dates" all of which might be described as perverse in some way or another. In fact, ALL of the male/female relationships have a tinge of the perverse about them. They range from whimsy to the mentally unbalanced to the genre staple of the white slave ring (Alan Mowbray is the "catcher", Joseph Calleia the mastermind who rejects Ball as potential meat because she's too intelligent). George Zucco plays his usual menacing visage but turns out to be a cop guarding Ball. There are many juicy character parts. There are nightclub scenes with songs that one feels Sirk would have given to Zarah Leander before the war, highlighting what all of us dedicated Lucy watchers always knew ? she couldn't even fake singing. The songs bear the very Sirkian titles "All For Love" and "You Stole My Peace of Mind".LURED is a re-make. The original was PIEGES, a 1939 French film directed by German refugee Robert Siodmak who is generally credited with making the first true noir, THE PHANTOM LADY (1944). PIEGES was written by an important French screenwriter, the Russian born Jacques Companéez. If LURED resembles a film noir that is because it is assembled from a lot of the same bloodlines as noirs. From German expressionism there are the dark and shadowy streets, scenes of schattenspiel (scenes of the murderer typing his Baudelaire pastiche poem, the police in silhouette, examine a huge blow-up projection of the typed poem to perceive some clues from it). From the French there is the pre-disaster fatalism and poetic realism. Boris Karloff plays a top fashion designer who went mad when his designs were stolen. It's his one scene and he swallows three arrondissmont as he makes a true meal of it. Apparently the original version had Erich Von Stroheim in the role, whose performance must have been equally juicy. The first hour of the film takes place entirely at night. It doesn't brighten up until after the White Slave Gang has been locked up and a false climax arrived at. The film changes character as first Ball's fiancé, George Sanders, is suspected of being the killer and locked up, and then she is placed in jeopardy by the real killer who first plays a cat and mouse game with the inspector but is finally lured to his own destruction. So the concept of being "lured", as in the murder of women who answer personal ads is turned around, and it's the killer who is now lured. However these goings-on are just run-of-the-mill cop mystery film stuff of the era. A real noir would have invested the killer with some more of a character so that no matter how insane he is there is some empathy, some transference, and a sense of fatalism and inevitability for the mechanisms of the universe to grind on to the end. This is the Karloff/Von Stroheim character that is confined to the one scene. An error in construction perhaps. I guess nobody told the filmmakers that they were making a noir and had to respect certain niceties to qualify.There is something Sirkian strange about the last scene. George Sanders is drinking at his nightclub's bar. There is a mirror behind the bar. It is a real mirror as the bartender can be seen reflected in it. However there is a whole scene reflected in it of people coming and going from the entrance to the nightclub. Ball can be seen entering in an ermine coat, walking out of the mirrors frame and then entering the shots frame to stand next to Sanders. They have a conversation while life seems to be going all at full pace in the mirror. The curious thing is that I could swear the actions seen in the mirror are a reflection of a back projected scene, which seems to imply that it is easier to work with a technically difficult shot then to have to direct two different mise-en-scene actions at the same time in different places on the sound-stage.</fullReview>

Perhaps the best reason to see it is the cast which throws the likes of Lucille Ball together with Boris Karloff, Charles Coburn with George Zucco etc. You need to check your credulity at the door as Scotland Yard Inspector Coburn offers Lucille Ball a job as decoy having known her for something like eight minutes. Her job is to get next to a serial killer without winding up with a tag on her toe but along the way she tangles with Boris Karloff's disturbed dress designer - a sort of unBalenciaga if you will - and Alan Mowbray's White Slaver. George Sanders doesn't have to do caddish this time around thereby diminishing his performance whilst Ann Codee (uncredited) and Cedric Hardwicke round out an interesting cast in an interesting film.</fullReview>

Lucille Ball plays a dancer doing odd jobs who works as a decoy for the Yard when one of her friends mysteriously disappears and eventually shown to fallen victim to this maniacal killer.Ball is essentially Lucy without the laughs. Despite what others say, she shows absolutely no dramatic flare here at all. I expected Ethel and Fred Mertz to intervene at any time to save the day.It becomes so obvious who the killer is. Sir Cedric Hardwicke, who was so good in "The Ten Commandments" and memorable as Henry Cabot Lodge in "Wilson," looks like a real odd-ball here.The ending is predictable even with Sanders, the lover of Ball, in the film confessing guilt to draw the real killer out.</fullReview>

And nothing makes me cringe more than to read someone referring to this dumb-ass "Chick Flick" as being "Film Noir" - 'Cause if that's the category they place this film into, then they really don't know what the heck they're talking about.And, besides that - I'd say that Boris Karloff's over-the-top portrayal of the eccentric fashion designer, Charles van Druten, has got to be one of the absolute, most embarrassing moments ever recorded in the history of a big-budget, big-name Hollywood production.Here are a couple of things that, in my books, lost Lured some significant points - (1) Scotland Yard's laughable procedure for recruiting the gold-digging, dance-hall girl, Sandra Carpenter, as a "lure" to trap the infamous "Poet Killer" (and, yes, they even went so far as to equip her with her very own pistol).(2) The "real" identity of the killer was shamelessly given away about two-thirds of the way into the story, and yet this tale was dragged out for another 35 minutes, putting this annoyed viewer through pure hell as I foolishly stuck it out to the very end.And, finally - Speaking about Lucille Ball - Not only did I think that she was totally unconvincing and ill-suited for her part - But I sure got sick &amp; tired of seeing this tiresome clothes-horse strut out, in scene after scene, in yet another smart and/or elegant outfit.*Trivia Note* - Even though Lured was set in London, England, it was actually filmed entirely on an indoor set in Hollywood, California.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior film noir by Douglas Sirk ruined by the casting of Lucille Ball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a pity. Douglas Sirk, such a fine director, must have preferred not to remember this particular film noir which he made, or should I say tried to make. The casting of Lucille Ball in the lead doomed the project from the start. She was purely a comedienne, and with the greatest of effort in this supposedly serious film, she simply could not pull it off and ends up looking stupid. And I hope I do not say that with benefit of hindsight, since I mentally erased I LOVE LUCY from my mind, or tried to do so. Many comedians have done a wonderful job in straight roles, as a result of inspired casting against type. But Lucille Ball is not among that number. The screenplay of this film by Leo Rosten is also very poor. Sirk's direction is not bad, it is the film which is bad. George Sanders goes way over the top with his sinister and lecherous leerings. But then the script suddenly calls for this creep to turn into a prince charming whom Lucille Ball loves, and wants to marry. No continuity comes into this, it is just mandated by the script. Sir Cedric Hardwicke gives probably the best performance in the film, and almost manages to make his scenes work. The film is ostensibly set in London, with the Scotland Yard chief being absurdly played by the 'down home' American actor Charles Coburn, of all things! The film opens with some interesting stock night shots of Piccadilly Circus, with the prominent sign for the Trocadero displayed, but by and large this film is strictly a studio job. The scenes with Boris Karloff enacting insane fantasies are so ridiculous that one wonders whether this whole film was intended as some kind of joke. Don't bother with this one, even if you are a Douglas Sirk fan.</fullReview>
