		<shortDescription>A beautiful look at the classic book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one thing you have to know before even read about this movie, and it isn't the summary: There is already a LOT of things telling the same old story of the book. How the pilot and the prince became friends, all the adventures and beyond, in other animations and endless other media. This movie isn't about those two characters only. It's about how this story can touch people since it was created, from toddlers to grandpas, in different ways and in different ages. I've seen people say out loud "this is not little prince!", but I say "yes, it is!". Want to see a pure version? Read the book. The animation and the characters are rich and lovely, the CG and the stop motion are perfect and well used. Everything is heartwarming. If you don't know the book, you'll read it after seeing this. If you do, I'm sure you'll cry a lot. And at the end of the movie you'll want a fox for you too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make sure you know what this movie is - and is not - before you go to see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opened today - 29 July 2015 - here in France, and I saw the second show here where I live, the small town of Paimpol. There were perhaps 30 people altogether in attendance. I could hear that the few children among them were bored. So, first comment: 1) This is not a movie for small children. It won't interest them.2) If you are expecting a video reproduction of St Exupéry's story, you will be very disappointed. It's in this movie, but it only comprises a small part of it. Most of the movie is a frame for that tale, the story of a small girl who meets an elderly aviator who tells her, in bits and pieces, the story of his encounter, many years before, with the Little Prince. If you go expecting just what you know from St Exupéry's story, most of this movie will therefore be an annoyance to you.It took me awhile to accept the frame story. It's fairly banal, fairly Hollywood. Nowhere near the originality of St. Exupéry's remarkable tale. But if you let yourself go with it, it has an appeal over time.The part devoted to St. Exupéry's original tale is the best, as far as I'm concerned.We also see the prince as an adult, very changed. That came as a shock at first to me, but again, I let myself go with it, and it had a certain fairly obvious interest.This is not a great movie. "Ernest and Célestine" is a thousand times better. But it's worth seeing.Again, however, this is NOT a movie for little children. They will be bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such stories don't need working out you feel the characters as they evolve and identify with you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was so long ago that this furred creature talked of life and other miraculous things hoisted up by far fetched maturity and sensibility presumably alien for a being draped in fur, but it resonates louder and makes even more sense now, when after all this years I re-read the novella that was first published in 1943 after the outbreak of second WW, by French writer and artist Antoine De- Saint Exupery, The Little Prince. It makes me wonder if it ever were a children's tale, but again to decode such an honest, sincerely beautiful written work of art, a child's innocence and naivety is the only play. Such stories don't need working out you feel the characters as they evolve through the pages and identify with you. 2015 is about to see in a re-imagined spirit the animated adaptation of Exupery's invention, from Kung- Fu Panda director Mark Osborne of the same name. It is majorly awaited. The trailer was irresistibly delicious instilling a magic like atmosphere with the equally enchanting background score by Richard Harvey and Hans Zimmer. This movie got an amazing cast from Bridges to Cottilard, it will be dream on screen. The little girl's imagination of the Prince and the fox is done by stop motion animation resembling and staying true to those old painted images. Remember the dewy water color illustrations by Exupery depicting the Prince on the asteroid, the magical rose that grew on it?with flaxen hair and a scarf he just looked like a cherry boy who lost his way. Walking through the sands, if you please I would draw you a sheep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very successful in bringing Little Prince into today. The movie made me to read the Little Prince again and learn more. The challenge between living natural and living modern became fully alive in my mind again and again. Like my childhood. I have a neighbor very similar to Aviator. He had long white hair and a very old jacket. He had a magic smile. I think he was very similar to Aviator. All of my memories of him became animated in front of my eyes while watching the movie. Maybe everyone has someone like Aviator in his or her life or must find. The snake scene was very deep like book. The movie made me to believe yet there is hope for peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually love the French animations, because unlike American, the stories, musics, characters that influences the thousands of year cultural history. Definitely not comparable to the Hollywood standards, but it had its own technical brilliance. All I wondered was why this film was in English language.It deserves to be on the upcoming's big occasion (2016 February), if it is eligible for the American Academy Awards. From the director of 'Kung Fu Panda' original movie, which was partially based on the children's novel. The book adaptation is the stop-motion animation and the remaining story's the regular 3D animation.Just remember the movies like 'What Dreams May Come' and 'The Lovely Bones', those magical worlds and breathtaking landscapes. Usually animations are associated with comedy genre, especially when a child character attached to it. This film was not even a comedy, more like those two titles I mentioned.The screenplay wise it was a very 'Neverwas' type, except this one was an animation. But appropriate for people of all ages. The kids can realise the importance of their childhood and the older people can become kids again. The film compressed the gap and erected a bridge between the two hoods, the childhood and the adulthood."What is essential is invisible to the eye."I did not know what to expect from it, but I highly satisfied with the final product. The film characters had no names, but called, the Little Girl, Mother, Fox, Rose, Snake, King et cetera as what their role is and species. Barely there are only 3-4 characters where the story was focused. Obviously it had a villain, but very unusual existence time and in a crucial part of the story.I don't remember how the 100 minutes went so fast like a ray of the light beam flashed away. The pace of narration was not a rushy, except the opening part. But once the old man character, the Aviator, voiced by Jeff Bridge was introduced, the movie turned into completely different and awesome. Yes, Jeff Bridge's voice was so good for the background narration.This story is about an old man who refused to grow up mentally and believes the existence of the magical stars and planets. The whole neighborhood stayed away from him and his troubles, until a new girl arrives at the next door. The little girl befriends him and falls for all his stories discarding her daily routines, but later it complicates their relationship after her mother finds out what they're up to. What happens to them and how the story concludes is the remaining part."She was not a common rose. She was the only one of her kind in the whole universe."This story was finely fused between the reality and fantasy. Most essential storyline for the present world. In the name of education how the children were enforced by their parents to mechanical life with less time to play out and make their own friends. Especially as they were lacking the creativity to make up their own fictional worlds with their toys like the kids from a century ago were.It might psychologically affect their characters while becoming an adult like the Aviator in this film, but as one of lines from the movie say 'Growing up is not the problem. Forgetting is', the children are losing their innocence over the adult's reality world. Who knows, someday those kids may become the greatest writer inspired by their childhood days.If you ask me, I strongly recommend it for all. It is very encouraging film for the parents how not to raise their children and for the grown ups how not to get lost is the adult world. Most elegant flick of the year, along with a very few others.You don't have to ignore it because you have read the book, like I said it was not completely borrowed from the original material. Instead, two-third of the film was freshly established out of the same name masterpiece. I'm not familiar with the book, so I've no thoughts that differentiate between these two formats. But definitely the film deserved all the appreciation from critics and movie 9?/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling magical transformative hypnotic magical best animation ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Animation is under-estimated, perhaps because we tend to be afraid of what we do not understand.I have seen a lot of films, done a lot of reviews and thought I had seen it all.I was wrong.First, I had not read the book prior to seeing this film nor had I seen the earlier screen version.No matter. I was transfixed and stunned. I was still sitting there when the final credits rolled, which is really a feat because the credits roll for 10 minutes after the word FIN (THE END) rolls. (If you miss the credits, you miss the TURN AROUND song which itself could be highlight of one of the most incredible music scores in one of the most incredible movies ever).When computers were first being married to animation -- a marriage made in heaven I think -- I recall an interview with a senior animator who confided that when the day came that they could get the "eyes" right, they would have reached the pinnacle of their craft.That day has arrived. This movie is the herald.Watching the eyes in this film, I felt as though I was watching real people. Does that make me sound daft? I hope not. There is one scene where the little girl watches the Aviator go to the hospital in the rain. She is at the same time transfixed with sadness and soaking wet. The animation made both conditions "real" at the same time. I don't know how. But it did.Jeff Bridges, a brilliant actor with a record longer than your arm, gives the "voice" performance of his career here, and Rachael McAdams, former Femme Fatale, former "against type" actress (TRUE DETECTIVE) ditto.Running out of superlatives, something I seldom do, so I will stop here.See it. Don't argue. Just see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 is not enough for this!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could predict the movie ending by the first few minutes or so and I told my wife "okay, let's see if it can still be entertaining on the details...". Oh boy, I may never been so glad to be so wrong. I mean, of course I was hoping for it to be good, but I was expecting very, very little of it. Most animations I've been watching in the past 2 years or so, including Pixar's, have not being able to move me at all. At all. And IMDb score was just below what I'd expect from a good one.( Okay, Inside Out was an exception: great and cute. Maybe my hopes for that one were too high but I was hoping for a better neural representation there, and it had some weak science behind it ( don't take my or Steve Novella's word for it, do your homework ). I would argue it is even harmful, because it will certainly create new bad myths about the mind and the brain. )Anyway, Little Prince at least isn't about science - because else they'd get it wrong at very least on the lucid dreaming there... But it's perfectly done. Perfectly. Every little detail. Right near the beginning the girl gets a new friend and starts to wonder how his stories could be possible. While she is thinking, the wind in the background is moving engines. That's art. And science, even if only subconsciously. Even if.The symbolism there is exquisite. I have watched a few french movies, I do know a little about the culture there, I've toured through France more than any other European country in my 2013 tour... I haven't seen anything like this before. Maybe I will need to take my french classes back again, eventually.Here, let me tell you about 2 math formulas that appear in there (not the only ones, the first book she does open is about math, probably algebra, but in french sorry), for a few seconds: first one is about analytical geometry, and got an Escher picture in it. Now, in Brazil we don't learn any of that in school, not even Calculus, but I've gone to first year of Statistics and 1 got semester of Math in there... That shoot is complex! The only thing I can say about the first picture is she got a great compressed writing and thinking there. This to me means more than anything that whoever wrote the script (I haven't read the book) was an avid math enthusiast (like myself) at very least.On the second one, however, she gets on to some Calculus, which to me was one of the funnest parts in school (after geometry, and I didn't really enjoy Math in college). Math was always my favorite topic in school. And that's a "simple" 3rd degree expression. All I can say is it's not being properly resolved, at first sight. But I bet there's a meaning there I just can't see yet. This is how this movie was made. Filled with tiny little details at every single second.I'm very good at Math and at counting, but I can't even understand what the 6 year old is doing in her book there and those are images that just don't matter to the plot or for anything else, really. They're there on their own!I'll make a real bold guess here, but I think this have became instantly my favorite film of all times. On top of Forrest Gump, Matrix, any Pixar's, Bedazzled, Terry Gilliam's, Huckabees, Stranger than Fiction, BttF, 2001, Interstellar, The Martian (still unwatched), Terminator you name it. I know almost nobody would agree with me here, but that's just how I felt having just watched the movie less than 8 hours ago.It touched me deeply, and it did so by touching both my heart and brains, like no other one ever did. 34 year old, happily married, with no kids due to life issues, no job and lots of work to do. Specially after being this inspired. =)-- Caue</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in the end slightly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course this movie must be special. Anyone who uses the book "the little prince" for a movie must have something great in mind. Anything else is a total insult to one of the very best books in historyThis movie manages to go in-between. In the first hour or so I wanted to get up and applaud every 10min. It was stunning and great. The combination of animation and stop-motion worked perfectly. The contrast boring modern time and fantasy well pictured. The book was used well as carrier of the movie...And then the old man was brought to the hospital... and it was the movie that died. The search for the little prince was ridiculous, why did we need a chase and "happy" ending? Why not put more attention to the different planets the little prince visits in the book instead? It was all just touched to make space for the ending. Why not make an ending that worked out the relation little girl/old man better.Yes the movie is worthwhile, The first hour is stunning, but with the chosen 2nd part you leave the theater slightly disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, i never read the book even though i heard about The Little Prince since i was just a little kid. It's a well-known classic literature, after all. So, when i hear the book was made into a movie, i got so excited and couldn't wait to watch it. After i watched it, i do not regret it at all. It was a good movie and make me want to read the book version ( I read some of the review, that tell me that this movie was really different from the book version, so it intrigued my curiosity )My review is as an outsider who doesn't know it real story. So, i won't compare the movie version with the book version. For the movie version, i guess i pretty much like it. I agree that this movie is not suitable for kids, since kids will find it boring. The pace of the movie is kinda slow ( also, it kinds of hard to understand for kids ). The visual itself, went so well and beautifully finished with the combination of stop motion and 3D animation.Well, from my point of view, i think the story itself tried to teach us about life, happiness, sadness, and how to grow up without forgetting who we are. All those kinds of valuable things that we tend to forget, as we grown up and be part of the adult world.I highly recommended this movie for those who do not read the novel yet and those who like philosophical things wrapped in a beautiful visual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes and NO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read this marvelous book many times; first as a naive school boy and years later as a "grown up", have enjoyed reading it in 4 languages, so I was excited to see this new animation. I watched it having in mind to stay open-minded? hence the first half was somehow acceptable; the story of a little girl with St. Exupery in his last days, mixed with parts from the original story of the book. I tried to understand the director's viewpoint that: you can't present this classic, as it is, for today's audience... well, yes and no!The parts telling the original story; as animation, visuals, colors, textures? are beautiful and touching indeed! Bravo! but the second half: "Little prince in the 21 century" was rather average, and the ending more or less disappointing. I think there are works of music, literature,art? which are to be reinterpreted very carefully, or better be left in their pure original form.I feel Exupery's book is in that category. If you value the book as a treasure of human literature? it's probably better not to watch this animation. If you don't know the book? you may enjoy this animation, it is not bad, but it is not a successful interpretation of "The little Prince". At least, they could have the sensitivity of not using the original title! 6/10 ? for the first 55 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misguided Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest effort at adapting the classic book is not very good. The screenplay is in dire need of re-writing and the movie really needs an editor in order to excise about 45 minutes off the end. At about the 1-hour mark, the actual story ends, but it goes on and on off on its own meandering trying to find a proper ending. I guess the original ending is not something easily explained, so the screenwriter and director added to it. Those are probably the movie's biggest flaws. The animation was also inconsistent. It would've been better had they stuck with the style used for the actual story of The Little Prince. The animation used for contemporary time looked like some cookie-cutter, generic 3-D animation ? la Pixar. Mind you, it can be good, but it sits in stark, ugly contrast with the more charming style and design used for The Little Prince. It's as if the director tried to blend two different animated movies into one. The overall bad and/or miscast voice acting is nothing to write home about, either.Going back to the story, the screenplay misplaces or, worse, omits A LOT. Things that are supposed to take a longer time to talk and explain are brushed off in a matter of seconds, entire segments of the story are simply not used - at least half The Little Prince's dialogue and interactions are gone!, and things are replaced with a boring story about a girl trying to get into a prestigious academy and her controlling mother. As I said, the problem is the stark difference between the sublime and the heavy-handed.I commend Netflix for taking a chance on what would now be considered an esoteric project that few people under 40 would even know about nowadays. However, I can't help but think the writers and director simply were not into it or, sadly, probably gave up on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that thinks it is saying a lot, but is actually saying very little.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say something first: The stop-motion in this movie is gorgeous, and everything in this movie that actually deals with "The Little Prince" story is really well done. You can tell a lot of heart and effort went into the stop-motion segments. These few scenes are the best the movie has to offer, and I would say that the movie is worth watching just for those few scenes...Emphasis on "few".Now, it isn't an issue that this movie goes the route of "The Lorax" (actually it might be an issue), but it is more how it is told. The main premise of the movie (again, identical to The Lorax) is that a girl lives in a world that is highly focused on business, efficiency, money, and is ultimately fake. However, she encounters an old man who lives in the one "unique" house on the block (that is also taller than the rest) and listens to the stories of "The Little Prince" from the Old-man.This works... for a little while. If the movie were to tell the entire story of "The Little Prince" and make it feature-length, I would be totally fine with that. It could also make connections in the girl's life with her overworking mother, but the focus would be on the "Prince's" message and themes. Unfortunately, the movie is split into 5-6 acts, and The Little Prince is only in act 2 (or at least the original story).This movie feels like 3 different movies, and sadly the title of this movie is only one of these movies. The movie literally jumps ship into a new movie once it hits the climax of the first and second movie. This new movie involves the little girl going on a big journey to find The Little Prince; only to discover that he has grown up and his life is ruined because he decided to (get this) go to school, get an education, and try to enter the business world.Yes. This movie is one of those movies. It literally has no idea what it is trying to say. Is this a movie about death? Is it about love? Is it about strict parents? High societal standards? The death of childhood? Big business being evil? Education being evil? Adulthood being evil? WHAT IS THIS MOVIE ABOUT!?!?!? What makes it even more insulting is that the person who initially taught the main theme of the movie (the little prince) is the one the little girl has to teach... his own message. The more you think about this movie's theming, the more painful it becomes. And again, the biggest theme of this movie is "Big business and the education system are evil"... which... I don't know what everyone else thinks, but that is a very shallow message (especially when compared to the original story). To make it worse, it doesn't even truly give a fair argument for why it thinks it is evil? It just paints anyone who is an adult as evil and small-minded.All in all, watch this movie for the first half with the stop-motion segments. Those segments are beautiful, but, sadly, very little of this movie is spent on those segments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Little Prince" has some endearing elements, but is let down slightly by plodding scripting and a sometimes bland animation style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Little Prince" tells the story of a girl who lives in a well ordered, adult world. One day, she meets her neighbour, an elderly aviator whose eccentricities break from the mold of other adults around her, inspiring her imagination. He tells her the story of when he met "The Little Prince" - a boy who lived on a tiny planet, and how it changed his life. In turn, the aviator changes the girl's.Like most people, I saw this French-Canadian animation when it was released on Netflix, but I was unfamiliar with the original story by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, which is used here as a narrative device that's part of a larger, original plot.The celebrity cast for the English dub includes Rachel McAdams and Jeff Bridges, as the girl's mother and the pilot, respectively. Both add dimension to their characters, Bridges narrating the story with a grandfatherly wisdom, and McAdams conveys the mother's stringent character - thinking of her daughter's future career success ahead of her personal happiness.The relationship between the girl and the pilot was nicely developed and has some sweet moments, though I felt that the story he was telling to the girl seemed a bit removed from the main plot, and the lessons about foxes and roses seemed a little vague in context of the rest of the story. These elements do come into play in the second half when the lines between the two narratives blur, but the differences in animation (the expressive, painterly effects of the Prince story, and the more tactile look of the rest of the film) was distracting, as were the voice acting cameos from Ricky Gervais and James Franco - their characters' appearances were short and could have been voiced more effectively by others without taking the viewer out of the movie as much.The pacing was also a little slow in parts, and the simple conclusion that the ending arrived at could have been reached with a shorter third act and running time."The Little Prince" is an enjoyable children's film that is occasionally bogged down by a muddled plot and some stiff animation, but overall is worth watching for its touching story of friendship and some nice themes about individuality and accepting difficult situations that kids could learn from.MORE REVIEWS AT MY BLOG: dynamitefilms.blogspot.com.au</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made for illiterate people. The new movie of "The Little Prince" is an awful bastardization of one of the worlds most delightful books. I can not believe that permission was granted to rewrite and make this dribble. No wonder it is not being released. The family of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry should sue heavily. No emotions come through. It is like watching a Walt Disney cartoon, although Disney would have done better. I guess people today like pablum and cartoons. PC to the utmost, it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY. If this book was one of your favorites, as it was mine you will cringe. It is one thing to adapt something but to change it entirely is unacceptable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overrated Boring Movie with some good moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's trailer oversold the movie by cramming all the best parts into those few minutes, however, one cannot judge a movie merely by its best parts. The Little Prince is too down to earth and much too safe--the hero is never truly in trouble, and we never have intense action sequences due to our two heroes' inherent qualities in foil to the unexplained antagonists. That is not to say this movie has no good qualities, as I have mentioned, the movie trailer contains all the heart-touching scenes, and there is especially the core story of the prince himself as well as the narrator's story that makes this movie watchable to the ending. Overall, I was not that impressed by the film. It does stand out against all the unimpressive cartoons that I have seen, but yet again, it does not stand against Pixar's or even Disney's masterpieces, and in my opinion is more of a B-quality movie than an A. Despite this, I do recommend this for young children (although not too young), even if this movie may not be as entertaining for adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Grand Little Tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Little Prince (2015): Dir: Mark Osborne / Voices: Jeff Bridges, Mackenzie Foy, Rachel McAdams, Paul Rudd, James Franco: Enchanting old school animation about the spirit of the younger generation and the struggle to maintain it. Jeff Bridges voices an elderly man often scorned by neighbors for his accident prone habits such as starting his plane thus causing a disaster. He was an aviator and presents his stories to the young girl living next door. She is a bright kid with a loving yet over protective mother who is pushing her to grow up too fast with unrealistic demands. She befriends the old aviator and learns of his stranding in the desert and the vision of the little prince, the abandoned rose, the fox, and the need to allow the stars to shine bright and free. These themes may be a tad heavy handed for a really young audience but its intentions are great. The animation is brought out from a past design yet seems equally creative here. The aviator is young at heart but feel the end nearing and the need to pass his tale on. Mackenzie Foy voices the girl who learns of adventure. Rachel McAdams voices her stern mother who has her daughter's daily routine all mapped out. Paul Rudd voices the eventual prince when he does appear to help piece the rest of the narrative together. James Franco voices the fox who is the symbol of companionship. Message regards pushing our children to grow up too fast and risk missing out on childhood delights. It also addresses the risks adults face if they forget what it was like to be that age and lose that innocence and creative sense of adventure. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What went through their minds?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Little Prince fails almost on every aspect it tries to be. The books were meaningful and heart-warming to read, while this film is a forgettable, boring run of the mill film. Although there is at times fantastic animation and some pleasant bits, the mistake with this film is that it shows a clear lack of understanding of the book.The plot choices of this film are mind-boggling. There were several times where I thought to myself "what the hell is going on? Have they read the source material?". Surely it isn't bad to take an adaption in a new direction but when that direction leads off a cliff, you have problems. Its as if a great team started working on the beautifully animated Little Prince/Aviator sequences then ran out of budget, thus hiring some Hollywood writers and decent animators to get the rest done.Theory aside, while the Little Prince scenes were the most interesting, they are under-developed and rushed to spend time with the other dull story. The relationship between the Aviator and the girl is at times endearing, but also a little forced and cliché. Past that, the film's result of the Prince's character is unsurprisingly very badly handled.To quote the Businessman, the creators skimmed through the book and stated "There is nothing essential in here at all". Then the Little Prince movie came to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice story for humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all the people who already read the book, i must say might be it below your expectation. Especially when you hope to hear some "legendary quotes" that will be heard in the conversation between the little prince and all of the people that he met in his journey.But well, for the movie itself can say that this is less expected for kids that it should be for the adult since the word or term using in this movie is too heavy for kids. And also, the message that contained in this movie actually is for the parents all over the world.Overall, this is the movie that should be watched to bring back and restore the humanity in this near-insane world that filled with hatred, selfishness and greediness that illustrated in some of the character in the book and in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's basically a fanfic sequel with a Mary Sue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of really high praise for this movie so I decided to watch it. The screening I saw had the director come and talk about it with the audience afterward and included a Q and A, which certainly is appreciated. He mentioned that his daughter was a huge influence on him and his son was used as the voice of the little prince.The idea of this movie is about a little girl who reads the Little Prince stories, which are "true" in this universe. This is the framing device for telling the original stories in the book. The director stated that this movie was not an attempt to make the Little Prince book into a movie, which he says is "impossible", but rather an attempt to show how it felt to read the book for the first time. OK, cool. Sounds good so far.I will sum up exactly what this movie is: Basically, someone wrote a lousy fan fiction sequel to the Little Prince and dropped a Mary Sue into it as the lead character. If you don't know what a Mary Sue is, Wikipedia defines it as "an idealized and seemingly perfect fictional character, a young or low-rank person who saves the day through unrealistic abilities. Often this character is recognized as an author insert and/or wish- fulfillment."So basically: The Little Prince story continues years later after it ends with the book and this girl is inserted into the story and she saves everything because she's so amazing and smart. If that's what you want to watch, it is nicely animated and amusing enough. It definitely has its moments of wonder and keeps your interest. But in my opinion this Mary Sue character idea ruins the entire thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Homage to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Le Petit Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, this animated adaptation is very well done. It is different from Disney-style cartoons and looks more like independent art - of the very good kind. I can only recommend this movie for kids but it is very watchable for adults. Given the book, it is difficult to say whether it was meant solely for kids. It does fall in line next to Peter Pan (of similar thematic, but I will not spoil it for you). The characters are also fairly well-contoured and have sufficient depth for the story being told. One minor flaw that the movie has - although, I feel that it is purposefully made this way so it can be enjoyed by kids, is that the movie does not take a little more time to focus on the metaphors of the fantasy and instead follows the action at a slightly disappointing pace. Otherwise, it makes a great movie with a fine line of humour and lots of scenes that will warm your heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is NOT Saint-Exupéry's Little Prince</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Little Prince is timeless story for both, children and adult.It is so carefully and thoughtfully written so there is no wonder it's still so popular and inspirational. For some it has such influence that Saint-Exupéry's thoughts guide them through life and are reminding them of beauty, simplicity, but also absurdity of today's life. Reading The Little Prince several times I must say that this movie is nothing like Saint-Exupéry's Little Prince. Yes, it is hard to put such a story on screen, especially to make every book fan satisfied, but this should just not have happened. Sadly, in a movie industry called Hollywood it is already usual to make movies with a superficial plot and well known American patheticness. This 'The Little Prince' movie is not exception, it gives people who have never read a book a totally different and wrong perception of this outstanding literary work. To finish this review I will go back to the headline and say that this is definitely NOT Saint-Exupéry's Little Prince IT IS Hollywood's Little prince.</fullReview>

And I'm deeply disappointed by how the director killed the Little Prince. The first part of the movie was nice, and the animation that told the Little Prince's story was amazing. Loved how it was created.The second part...you see how a book is killed. It was disappointing seeing how the movie director mutilated the personality of the Little Prince. In the end, this movie is not about The Little Prince. Indeed, it sends nice messages about friendship, love, what is really important in life, and how we can see the unseen. But it's horrible to see how the Little Prince story is simply destroyed. Catastrophic! Catastrophic!</fullReview>

Take a poetic masterpiece, add one scoop of Hollywood, a tablespoon of marketing and a pinch of focus groups and you get this schlock. Gross and sad.Better off rereading the book and watching Coraline and Up. This is too slow and boring for kids and too simplistic and poorly thought out for adults. It's in no-man's land.Grand deception - this movie makes France sad and Saint-Exupéry is rolling in his grave depressed that the evil characters of his story, jumped off the pages, got their nasty little hands all over it and ruined it in movie form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, horrible movie. Make sure you know what it's about, then avoid it at all costs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all - I'm a fan of The Little Prince. I've read it ever since I was a very young kid, and now that I'm a middle aged adult, it still holds tons of surprises and things to thoroughly think about. It may as well be my favorite book ever.So, when I saw there was going to be an adaptation of the book, I hoped for a somewhat true to the book story. Anything close to it would have been fine by me, really. I mean, the book just doesn't lend itself to a movie, IMHO. It's just too deep and complex, and too simple and sweet at the same time. The book, to me, it's the sweetest and most delicate balance of what being a human being is all about. What moves us, as seen from the eyes of a wise, sweet, innocent child.The movie, therefore, is an atrocity and an insult to Antoine De Saint-Exupery. Period. It's the grossest, vilest insult to The Little Prince I could ever imagine.First - I should have known from the ads. The Little Prince is a little icon, far away from the main characters - The Aviator, The Fox, and... The Girl???? Where did the little girl come from? Apparently, the movie makers thought they just couldn't make a movie without adding extra characters. And then, I suppose, they thought making a movie about the original story would have been too difficult, so they just tossed it all away and wrote an original story about a little girl and her mom.I wish I was kidding. I'm not. The Little Prince story is just an excuse to move along a primary story about something else. It's treated as an extra, as something superfluous, as something - I guess - they had to do because the movie was named "The Little Prince", If you went in, expecting to watch something related to the real story, you are going to be very, very disappointed.Second - the story never goes into what makes The Little Prince so special. You get to see the Little Prince traveling through asteroids, talking to his rose, taming his fox. Is any of this explained or explored in detail? No. It is treated as a distraction to the main story. The filmmakers never even bother to explore the symbolism behind the story. It's merely treated as an excuse for telling an alternate story.Third - and this is where the spoiler goes. The Little Prince is all about love, tenderness, anger, happiness and ultimately, sadness. It's a moving story, told in the sweetest way possible - through the eyes of a small child. What on EARTH were the filmmakers thinking when they threw in action scenes? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?!?!? I won't spoil it all, but when I saw scenes straight out of a video game, with violence, planes zooming in and out, adventure, etc., I almost walked out of the theater. The only thing that made me stay there was my child.Fourth - another spoiler. The aviator was a child with a wonderful imagination, who grew up to become a jaded person. The Little Prince helped him question his beliefs and rediscover a sense of wonder he had lost. In the movie, the aviator is a childish old man. Not "child-like", or full of wonder. The whole point of the book was how an adult can become responsible, knowledgeable, yet retain his sensibility and sense of wonder throughout. Nowhere is this to be seen - the aviator is just like a spoiled, irreverent, incoherent child. Which is even more absurd when you see the real Little Prince's sequences, and you realize how different both versions of the aviator are.Fifth - another spoiler. If you ever want to see part of your childhood ruined and torn to pieces, go watch this movie. You'll see where The Little Prince ended up. And believe me, you'll want to shout your lungs out at the filmmakers for destroying your childhood image of what his little Majesty would end up like. It's a travesty. It's depressing. It's false. And it's absolutely, completely wrong.This is the most misguided, insulting and infuriating book adaptation I've ever seen. It's as if Star Wars: Episode 7 was about a kid watching Star Wars: A New Hope 30 minutes at a time. It's just... wrong. Shame on everyone involved in making this travesty. 2 stars, because the animation showing what The Little Prince was really about was actually very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning visuals, talented cast, unique story, disappointing third act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised this film hasn't been promoted more; even if you haven't read the book it's based on (like me) the film boasts a fantastic cast with the likes of Jeff Bridges, Rachel McAdams, Paul Rudd, James Franco and more. The animation style is similar to that of Pixar, which is interwoven with stunning stop-motion moments. So in general this film has a lot going for it.For the most part, I really liked The Little Prince. As I say, the cast do an amazing job, each role is brought to life with very unique voices and delivery. You can have a film with unknown cast and sometimes that works quite well but sometimes when you hear these voices and you instantly recognise them, it gives you as sense of comfort and familiarity; and the lines delivered by ones such as Jeff Bridges and James Franco make them really stick with you. Like a lot of good animated films, The Little Prince gives you a lot of mottos and life lessons to remember; some of the ones in this movie though, I felt didn't come across as clearly as intended. Something would be happening and I was left wondering exactly what it was trying to tell me, and that's the thing with this movie, there seems to be a lot of metaphors, all of which are presented beautifully, but are left up for interpretation. So in terms of cast and dialogue, I really thought the film was something special.I mentioned the animation before and I'll just elaborate. The majority of the film is computer animated and although not as detailed as the more popular animation studios can give, which is to be expected, the look and style were enjoyable enough and it seems like they took a few notes from Pixar, which is never a bad thing. The animation though is nothing compared to the visually stunning stop-motion sequences that are presented. It's nothing like I've seen before and was by far the most interesting parts of the film; a visual experience.I'll move onto the story now. The summary of which is a little girl moves to a new house with her very controlling, almost OCD, mother and meets her neighbour, an old man who has a hoarding problem that tells her about his supposed experience he had in the Sahara desert. The first two thirds I really enjoyed, some could argue it's a bit slow, but for me I enjoyed the storytelling element and the sometimes very real depictions of life spliced in with the wildly imaginative metaphors. The friendship between the little girl and the old man was a charming and entertaining watch, and the stop- motion story always had me invested. The third act however took quite a turn in the narrative, the tone changed somewhat and I was constantly waiting for some degree of explanation. I felt it got a little too mixed up into what was real, what was metaphorical, and it didn't quite give closure to some of the plot threads. According to some Internet articles both the book and the film try to base it's logic on a child's imagination so I suppose in that way it makes sense...in a nonsensical kind of way.In the end, The Little Prince was a visually stunning film with a great script and voice work but the narrative was a little shaky, especially towards the third act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Little Prince?Meets the Little Girl: A French Children's Classic Gets a Makeover that Truly Works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.......................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL *** This review may contain spoilers ***The expectations you have going into a film have a tremendous influence, as you no doubt have experienced, on your take away after viewing! Other than a couple general comments, only God knows their origin, that The Little Prince was really "worth it", I did not have much in the way of any well-defined expectations. Lucky Me! RESULT: A Nine Star experience! Although my wife, Carmen, was the only person accompanying me, soon after initiating viewing, I imagined my granddaughter and daughter in the room, sharing the experience with us! My granddaughter, as is the case with most eight year old girls, loves anything involving a princess! If you have grand kids, you must watch this with them. If thousands of kilometers separate you?Use your imagination, as I did! Little Prince seems tailor made for Grandparents/Grandkids viewing? a la "UP" ? There are a few comments that need to be made regarding Little Prince "purists"?But let's first focus on analyzing it. This 2015 French version has European Production written all over it?But in the best sense. It is artistic, tells a touching and delicate story, has a number of songs in French that manage to be uplifting and, yet, simultaneously haunting, and, perhaps most importantly, interweaves the Classic 1940's Original story line with a cautionary helicopter parent tale that both compliments and underscores said original! POSSIBLE SPOILER COMING UP:Obviously, one of the great ironies of this 2015 version is that the old man/pilot takes it upon himself to help the Little Girl learn just what it is to be a kid! At the heart of both story lines is that one of the most important things in life is keeping that spark of being a kid alive within us, even if we live to be 100! Earlier, I mentioned Little Prince purists? Well, whenever a movie brings a classic literary work to the screen, there are always viewers who want to see the original literary work brought to the screen with no changes, whatsoever, to dialogue or story line! Forget that we are dealing with the now one century old, two different medium conundrum! Needless to say, many of them simply could not get past this point. Obviously, this was absolutely no problem at all for me! To the contrary, it seemed quite a plus! IMDb Stats (Only 37 other reviews and 12,000 ratings votes) indicate that very few people have seen the film?Don't miss it! And make it a family affair! (However, kids under 7 year might find PRINCE a bit "Slow", or might not "Get It"!) 9*...ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA! Any comments or questions, in English o en Espa?ol, are most welcome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some thoughts on reviews, on people's reactions, and very light spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading many many reviews of this film, I've noticed that the people who didn't like this movie are people who are big fans of the book. And I mean "big fans", because most people who did review the movie have read the book; but the people who rated it very low are the ones who really LOVE the book. The common complaint is that stylistically and tonally (tonally? ._. is that a word?) it's not very similar, and that that way, it undermines the spirit of the original, which I sort of agree with. But I think this is a little unfair as, to a certain extent, movies should be judged as a stand-alone. For the same reason, a movie based off a book is not a terrible movie just because the work it was based on was terrible. Films don't get plot-hole passes for the "this was explained in the book" excuse, because the movie should stand by itself. Movies in many cases should be able to be watched on their own, and In this movie this is especially crucial and I'll get to that later. If you're a REALLY big little prince fan, I don't know what you might think, and maybe I can even say you probably won't like it. It does take elements/themes from the book, but they are not really treated the same way as in the book. And it's nowhere near as tragic as the book (actually, every little prince adaptation I've seen has never been as tragic as the novel and I'll also get to why later).I realized if you see this movie as a movie with the Little Prince book as a *big element* of this film, and not really as an *adaptation* of the book itself, it's a very good film. The movie is not really about the little prince, it's about the little girl. The film is centered around the little girl reading the book and how it connects with her own life, thus it becomes her own story. She's a daughter of a mother who puts her through this "life plan" to ensure she goes to a great school to have a great future. That doesn't sound too bad in retrospect, but she's just a child; and as the little girl begins reading the book, she starts to evaluate what she really thinks is essential. To the businessman, money is essential. To the man selling the pills (in the book), time was essential. And to the girl's mother, her grades are essential, and everything else are non-essential things that are only done as absolutely necessary. As the movie goes on and it becomes clear that the aviator is using the story to help the girl cope with his impending death, the little girl begins to realize that being a great grown-up is not composed of what the grown ups impose on her.I would say that emotionally it's not a very intense film. There are some moments that might make you cry, but the movie is either too subtle or too in-your-face to have that big family-animated film tearjerker moment that makes the theatre cry. It's a very gentle movie even though there is a big climax, and I also think this might be the reason why so many audiences saw the film as emotionally kind of weak.And here we get to why this movie is never able to hit as hard as the book: I have never seen a little prince adaptation that included the epilogue of the book (the part where the aviator realizes he never drew the muzzle correctly) even though I have always personally considered it a really essential part of the story. In the book the pilot draws a sheep for the prince to eat the baobab sprouts, but also promises to draw a muzzle and a little fence for it to ensure it will not also eat the rose. In the epilogue, The pilot realizes that the sheep he drew may or may not eat the rose on the little prince's planet, and because of this sometimes the stars are laughing, but sometimes they are crying; but he will never really know the truth (and no grown-up will ever see why it is important). The aviator also wonders if they'll ever see each other again, but these questions are never answered in the novel and this is also why it cannot have a sequel, because in reality we don't really know if he is happy back on his planet, and the not-knowing is the big thing here. In the movie they straight out answer these questions because she's able to finally meet the little prince and find out what happened to him after he left. In the context of the film of how the girl is making her own ending to cope with the idea of death, it's not bad, but in comparison with the novel's ending it feels very sugarcoated, and it gets a bit too complicated thematically (especially considering the implication that outer- space = the afterlife in the novel and in the movie it's used as both that AND a "growing up" thing).It's not a perfect adaptation of the book, maybe not even a good one, but it is still a beautiful movie. If people watched the film with not with lower or lighter expectations, but with different ones, I feel like it would have been received very differently by the die hard fans. I am SO excited for the upcoming Netflix release. It really feels like America is the centre of the world if I can't really find any English- language talk about the movie anywhere on the vast internet (I was able to see it because Canada seems to be the only English-language release of this film?). And of course the Hans Zimmer music is so so wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but a touch too fantastic for my taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Little Prince" is the newest adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry famous work and the two writers here, in the past, worked on "Shrek 2" and "The Boxtrolls". And this is actually the first full feature directorial effort in 7 years by 2-time Academy Award nominee Mark Osborne after "Kung Fu Panda". And even if "The Little Prince" did not make the Best Animated Feature shortlist at the Oscars, it is still a decent watch and has a fine collection of voices actors. These include Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Paul Rudd, James Franco, Paul Giamatti, Ricky Gervais, Benicio Del Toro, Jeff Bridges and last but not least Mackenzie "Renesmee" Foy for the girl who is the main character. She is probably even more lead than the title character as this story begins with her and ends with her.I think it was a nice idea to split the animation into 2 completely different styles. On the one hand, there are the modern sequences with the way animation looks always today, like for example in "Frozen". And then there are the sequences with the little prince, the stop-motion parts. I must say I am generally not the biggest stop-motion fan, so I am a bit biased here. This is also why I certainly preferred the more "modern" parts, which were thankfully the majority of the film. However, this is obviously just personal taste. Maybe you will enjoy this even more if you like stop-motion. A more neutral criticism is that the story sometimes became too fantastic and absurd for my taste with the modern Prince, the random space flying, the love for the rose etc. At least to some extent, this is still also personal perception. As a whole I enjoyed the watch. I never felt there were any truly great moments, but it was kinda nice I think and I recommend it. There is one pretty bad moment though when the girl and the old man have their crucial argument moment (or really only the girl). It felt pretty forced and the reaction from her did not feel authentic at all. That is just a minor thumbs-down though. As a whole, easily among the better 2015 films in terms of animation. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the mall in Tel Aviv, the movie theater had pulled all the stops out. Popcorn was being sold in Little Prince containers. The movie was playing in 3D dubbed, 2D dubbed, and 2D subtitled. A bookstore in the mall was displaying a large-format Little Prince book with a picture from the movie on the dust jacket. I flipped into the book and saw it was no more or less than the Saint-Exupery original. Some kid who receives it is going to be disappointed, just as anyone expecting the movie to reflect all the beloved aspects of the original story will be disappointed too. Inside its framing story of a little girl who reads the book, the movie gives us only bits and snatches of Saint- Exupery, and sometimes the compression is jarring. The story of the fox, for example, mentions taming but the taming seems like a matter of seconds and the color of the wheat is not mentioned at all. The Little Prince mentions watching a succession of dozens of sunsets but it isn't shown to reflect on his state of mind. On the plus side, the stop-motion graphics and computer graphics are impressive and well used by the plot-- although the movie does contain the kind of gratuitous swooping sequences that obviously have no purpose beyond 3D amusement. If there were no Saint-Exupery book, I would be the first to call the movie completely successful in terms of concept, execution, and message. But the book is a bit injured by incompleteness, and it's sad to think that several years must pass before someone brings out another ambitious Little Prince movie. The people who made this one could evidently have done a terrific job on a faithful movie of the original, but I'm sure they had their reasons to abbreviate and supplement it. Especially that the ending of the original is hard to take. Just as the little reader in the movie doesn't like it, maybe the filmmakers-- even more than they feared the public reaction were they to leave the ending as is- - didn't like the original ending either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like to think there is two act to this movie. The first act that still relate to the book, and the second act the script writers just added in to fill the last 35 minutes.The movie begins wonderfully; full of artsy and inspiring animation. All the little side story and characters were left open for the audience to interpret - the same way the author did in the book. The characters were as interesting as they were in the book and the writers adaptation of telling their tale were flawless executed. However, the second act of the movie felt like a straight-up socialist propaganda. Blaming all the problems on businesses. Mocking academic achievement and hard work. Painting the grown-up world gloom and dread; and anyone who obtain any wealth must be evil. Remember when I said leaving the characters open for interpretation? Nope, The Little Prince has been exploited and any of the original story's meaning has been killed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not very familiar with the book that this is based on and so I wasn't sure what to expect. In short, it's a delight. I think it blends in two very different kinds of animation seamlessly, and it's very well constructed. I do think the first hour is stronger than the last 45 minutes, which go to being a film that is more about a quest that needs to be accomplished. Saying that, some of the segments here are incredible. The film does a nice job of telling its story in a gentle, sweet way that seems approachable and applicable to what the source material may have been. I can see this being a hit with a lot of families (although I also think many younger kids may think it is slow). I definitely recommend it and I hope more people seek this film out because it deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film - it took the original story and made it as it was meant to be and added the present day to it. The little girl is overly scheduled and expected to excel and therefore is missing out on other things. Until she meets the eccentric aviator next door. It took time for their friendship to happen and when it did - wow. The automatic love in that friendship is something every child should have and remember when they grow up. To meet the Little Prince and find that he has grown up is a treat for her. The love she has for the aviator is priceless. The realities of growing up are shown - no one wants to lose someone who means a lot to them but the love is still there. The human connection is so important for all - no matter how old you are. I was teary many times in this movie and will remember it. A great adaptation of the story and current life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Book Was Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Little Prince is a modestly budgeted animated feature based on the Antoine de Saint-Exupery book of the same name. In it, a Little Girl (Foy) is told the story of a lonely Prince who once lived on a faraway asteroid covered in baobab sprouts. He leaves the comfort of his asteroid after a falling out between his lone, vain friend, a Rose (Cotillard). When he arrives on Earth, the Prince plops himself in the Sahara desert where he tames a fox and meets our narrator, a kind-hearted Aviator (Bridges). As the Aviator continues his story, the enraptured Little Girl ignores her chores and summer homework, which is assigned by her Mother (McAdams). She continues to visit the Aviator, a neighbor and local pariah who swears not only is the story true, but when his plane is fixed, he'll resume his search for the Prince.The original book is a poetic children's story whose somber tones, feelings of isolation and layers of humanism has crossed the generations to be a must read. It's a short book yet it's ambiguity lends itself to being appreciated and mulled over like first course charcuterie before your middle school English teacher brings out Tim O'Brien's "The Things They Carried". It's accredited for having some astute observations on human behavior. It highlights various various human faults: vanity, greed, selfishness etc. through the point-of- view of an innocent child while keeping the language whimsical and the watercolor illustrations near-universal in their simplistic grace.The Little Prince movie takes a bold risk adding another layer; a story within a story, using the Little Girl's narrative arc as a framing device. Through the eyes of the Little Girl we enter a world resembling the soulless mis en scene of Mon Oncle's (1958) modern living scenes with the frantic banality of Brazil (1985). It's a sight to behold and one can't help but be taken in by the sumptuous tactile animation even if it's meant to be occasionally grotesque. The get-up-and-go attitude of the Mother only adds to the feeling of imposing isolation, one that's motivated largely by the trappings of modern life; a life that the Little Girl and the Prince seems poised to join.Yet the matryoshka doll of a plot is also the film's Achilles heal. By framing the story just so, we get a feeling of place and time, which is to say modern. Thus we get a feeling for the ominous force pulling all the strings, making our protagonists oh so unhappy (it's the man, man!). Taking the ambiguity out of the original story and making such a strong if popular statement on contemporary wage economy problems robs an audience of their interaction with the story. It also guarantees that the film will have a shorter shelf- life while alienating those who never had to deal with eccentric neighbors, only-child isolationism and helicopter parenting.Of course as a children's movie, subtlety is not the highest of priorities and despite a third act that falls apart like the stitching of a buttoned-eyed fox, there's so much to redeem this film. It's got a gentle sense of humor, fun characters and some very solid voice- acting by Jeff Bridges, Rachel McAdams, Ricky Gervais and Paul Rudd who plays the older more world-weary Prince. Director Mark Osborne of Kung Fu Panda (2008) fame makes it clear The Little Prince is not a product, it's a delicately and lovingly assembled piece of art meant to be enjoyed by all ages. Catch it on Netflix Streaming while you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Little Prince is one of those wonderful movies that fly under the radar. The kids story that isn't a kids story reminds us what it was to be a child and why it's so important not to forget that.The visuals for this film are stunning and creative. The stop-motion style and vibrancy of the colours during the Little Prince's story are particularly breath taking.The energy and creativity of the production team have to be applauded. Adults and children alike will find this story of growing up deeply moving and one to be remembered. Animation has the power to tell unique stories just like this and it's a great that other studios are giving it a shot that aren't run by Disney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"All grown-ups were once children... but only few of them remember it."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Proving that Disney doesn't have a monopoly on adapting classic stories with whimsy and wonder, Mark Osborne has successfully brought 'The Little Prince' to life through a beautiful mixture of computer generated and stop motion animation. It's already an instant classic, with a thought provoking, multi-layered story and some visually stunning animation. We start off the film in a CGI world where a Little Girl (Mackenzie Foy) has just moved houses so that she can be within correct district to attend a prestigious school. This is all part of her Mother's (Rachel McAdams) life plan to turn her in to "a wonderful grown up". This life plan includes planning out literally her entire life, giving her daughter clear instructions of what she should be doing down to every hour, including a summer break that includes nothing but revising from text books.But all this changes when her old, eccentric neighbour, The Aviator (Jeff Bridges) enters her life and begins to tell her the story of The Little Prince (Riley Osborne). Thus we are introduced to a stop motion animated world, telling a tale of how the Little Prince fell in love with a Rose (Marion Cotillard) and then travelled across the stars meeting many strange characters, including the Businessman who seeks to own ever star (Albert Brooks), the conceited man who believes all should admire him (Ricky Gervais) and the Fox (James Franco) who the Prince seeks to tame. Much is added to the original novella, but director Mark Osborne ensures that the film never strays too far from the original novellas tone or themes. Instead the messages of the novella, such as needing to explore in order to learn and grow as a person, are given an entire new layer through the girls interactions with the Aviator. On top of this every voice performance (which includes the directors own son playing the Little Prince) seems perfectly cast. This includes a great performance from Jeff Bridges who is able to balance both the eccentric and heartfelt side of the Aviator. Both of the animation styles complement each other very well. In the CGI world there's a lot of emphasis on the blandness of what growing up can be like with grey colours and the lack of any uniqueness or identity. The houses in the neighbourhood are so similar that the mother even drives past her own home since you can't tell them apart. In contrast the stop motion style is so full of life and colour. It's as if the pages are literally coming to life with the stop motion focusing on details like shadows and the crinkled paper look for each of the characters. The film does falter a little within its third act that favours trading out its focus on its characters and story, instead having the girl travelling on an exciting adventure across the stars to save the Little Prince. It never detracts from either the messages of the film or of the original book and it's still an entertaining third act. But it does depart from the rest of the films unique and subtle beauty, in favour of an action sequence that feels out of tone to the rest of the film. Although this is only a slight misstep as the films finale is emotional and leaves a deep impact that is bound to resonate with viewers of any age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and I adored it from start to finish. Based around a classic French tale, The Little Prince is a truly wonderful animation that features a delightful and uplifting story, brilliant voice performances, stunning visuals, an exceptional score, and a powerful and poetic central message that will move you to your core.I think it's best to start off quickly explaining what this film is before explaining why I loved it so much. The main portion of the story isn't in fact about The Little Prince, but a young girl living in a dull modern world. Throughout, her life is changed by hearing tales about The Little Prince, which are interwoven within the story in various delightful storybook-like sequences, remembered by the old man living next door.Looking solely at the plot and narrative, this film is a good watch for kids. Its central themes aren't as light-hearted as most Hollywood family films (and I'll get onto that in a bit), but as an adventure story, I think that kids will love the imaginative and uplifting nature of this film. However, there is a lot more that makes this film truly outstanding.There were so many things about this film that blew me away, and one of the most impressive was the animation. On the one hand, you've got the contrast between modern-style animation in the little girl's story and stop-motion for The Little Prince segments. That's a technique that works perfectly throughout, as it lends a very magical tone to the fantasy sequences, and really emphasises the idea that the old man is reminiscing fondly about these tales, heightening the nostalgic power that comes in tandem with one of the film's main themes.Meanwhile, director Mark Osborne brilliantly portrays the dull, grey modern world, a setting which is furthered by the stunning animation. Whilst the characters look like typical Disney leads, the backgrounds, settings and weather are pretty much photo- realistic, giving a powerful and sombre sense of realism to the depressing world in which the little girl lives.The contrast between the two animation styles leads me onto what I thought was the true heart of this movie, and what made it such an incredible watch: its message. Although not particularly subtle in the opening act, the way the film touches on the way that many children nowadays have to live their lives, and never be able to have a true, care-free childhood, was extremely moving to watch.Throughout the movie, we see the little girl's relationship with the old man whom modern society has shunned blossom, and she begins to see the world with more wonder and awe, as a child should. In contrast to her controlling mother, the little girl's transformation over the course of the movie into a fun-loving, excited and hopeful person is wonderful to see, providing such emotional power that I was genuinely crying with joy on a good few occasions.I'm not saying that this film tells a revolutionary or extremely original story, but what makes it so special for me is its use of a classic tale in a modern context, and its deep and powerful exploration of so many fascinating themes, something that is very rare amongst modern kids' movies.Beyond that, there's even more to unpack and love about The Little Prince. For one, its stellar A-list voice cast, including Jeff Bridges, Rachel McAdams, Paul Rudd, Marion Cotillard, James Franco, Albert Brooks and Mackenzie Foy, is exceptional throughout. All the performances feel just as special as the rest of the film, and the huge variety of voice performances in the film's more fantasy-oriented sequences give it a great vibrancy, adding further to the positive and uplifting atmosphere throughout.And finally, the cherry on top of the cake is Hans Zimmer and Richard Harvey's score. The whole film is a truly wonderful experience, and the music is the perfect detail to bring it all together. Mixing together a sense of importance and drama with excitement and positivity, it features a series of beautiful themes that were the final element that broke me down into tears on multiple occasions. It's a stunning score, undoubtedly one of the best of any animated movie, and it sums up exactly everything that I adore about this film.Overall, The Little Prince is a truly special watch. On the surface, it can be a fun kids' movie, and so it should be, but I think it's possibly even more powerful and engrossing for adults. It plays on childhood nostalgia, always reminding you not to forget the happiest days of your life, and also looks at the way that the modern world has impacted on traditional childhoods. It's animated, written, performed, directed and scored beautifully from start to finish, and it makes for what I think is a real work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I can not stress how much I absolutely fell in love with this movie. When I saw the preview for this about oh a couple months ago I knew it would be decent. After seeing it for the first time tonight, I have to say it exceeded my expectations, and hit right home for me. This is one of those movies that touch the heart no matter how old, or cold it is. The only thing I can for sure say is put this on your must watch list and I guarantee you it will be the best one you watch. When I started to watch the movie, it talked about goals and how that's all you have to focus on all day every day. This is a common problem in today's society, we focus on the how to get by and lose the wonder. I can not stress how important the message is in this movie and how many people I will be recommending to watch it. So all in all this is a must see movie and I highly recommend watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Boy Lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606; out of 5 )THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A noble effort by an animator whose artistic talent exceeds his narrative skills.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: Saint-Exupéry classic tale of The Little Prince is told with a modern day parallel story about a little girl coping in an adult world.JIM'S REVIEW: Mark Osborne's film, The Little Prince, is a flawed work of art, an animated effort to weave Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's beloved novella with a more conventional story about a sweet little girl (Mackenzie Foy) dealing with an overbearing mother (Rachel MacAdams). The parallel stories never gel and the heavy-handed plotting of the more modern tale frays and unravels the lyrical narrative structure of the original classic source.Purist beware! The Little Prince is a misnomer. More time is spent with The Little Girl than our regal hero (Riley Osborne) who is merely a side story to her modern day tale. Saint-Exupéry's story is parceled out sporadically as vignettes as the girl befriends an eccentric neighbor, The Aviator (Jeff Bridges), who proceeds to tell his account of the lost boy who loves a rose (Marion Cotillard). The filmmaker takes far too many liberties with the plot and downplays or ignores some characters in the book, only hinting at the philosophical dialog of the parable.That said, visually, the film is artistry of the highest order with images and details that are lovely. Mr. Osborne's creative vision melds old-fashioned line drawing (similar to the book's actual illustrations), stop-motion animation, and computer generated imagery in telling his dual stories. At times, the techniques work and other times it creates a jarring mood swing. (It actually takes 20 minutes before the moviegoer is transported to the world of The Little Prince, and I must admit that I grew impatient and my thoughts questioned the artistic journey that took place in Mr. Osborne's sub-conscious. I thought. "Imagine what he could have created if he only stayed more closely to Saint-Exupéry's original text! If only The Little Prince would not have been a tag-along story to The Little Girl!")Still, his images are noteworthy and masterfully done. Here are just a few moments to admire: a roomful of glowing stars, line-drawn characters that bounce and distort handwritten words, that yellow sunlit scarf blowing in the wind, shadows transforming into birds and planes, and finally becoming a free-flowing kite, aerial geometric views of streets and buildings, a colorful parachute that slowly drapes around its characters, a Rube Goldberg chain reaction involving the takeoff of an airplane. Just stunning! All of the various styles of animation are beautifully rendered.But the screenplay by Irena Brignull and Bob Persichetti loses its way, especially in its third act when the screenwriters take our heroine on a magic mystery flight and cheat death by making the story more uplifting and crowd-pleasing. It does a disservice to Saint-Exupéry's tragic fable of life. The filmmakers falter when they try to connect the modern day counterparts with the more poetic characters and their encounters. The analogy comes off forced and the journey burns and crashes at this point, becoming a trivial pursuit.Mr. Osborne is a creative talent to watch and one can only look forward to his next endeavor. Technically, his re-imagining of Saint-Exupéry's parable is well crafted and quite impressive in animation terms. Although the film's two parallel tales align in spirit, they do not in their individual storytelling. They remain literally worlds apart and the result is a mixed blessing. The Little Prince is a visual stunner but its narrative ultimately lacks the poetic vision of its inspiring and more memorable source.NOTE: The behind-the-scenes making of Saint-Exupéry's book had some strange occurrences and Mr. Osborne's animated film had its share of odd happenings as well. Made nearly two years ago, and a modest hit overseas, the movie was unceremoniously dumped, never received proper distribution from its studio, Paramount, and just opened theatrically this past weekend at select cities while being streamed simultaneously on Netflix. It deserves a wider audience and should be seen by any serious fan of animation.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

It went in an unexpected direction at the black moment, and the development was very creepy and sad and a bit hopeless, but it pulled itself out of an ending that would've made me heave something through the screen and did it beautifully. 3. Because it's intended for kids, as an adult and a writer I found several plot holes that perhaps kids would accept as kids accept fairy tale conventions. Not so much hand-waving and misdirection as "Here's the important part; don't worry about how we got from the last scene to here." 4. Yes, I cried. 5. The stop-motion animation did a SUPERB job bringing the book's illustrations to life. 6. WATCH IT NOW.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really great story but perhaps an underwhelming delivery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I adored The Little Prince cartoon as a child and I keep meaning to see the 70's film and I think I read the story as well. I was so excited to see this possibly with my daughter but it seemed like it was a flash in the pan opening and the revenue would say this is true. The thing is there is nothing bad about this film. It is heartwarming, beautiful animation and style, excellent voice performances and a lot of morals either obvious or more subtle for child and adult. A lot of die hard The Little Prince fans seem put off that this is a story within a story but I thought that was brilliant. You're not remaking a classic for a modern age but rather using the classic to demonstrate how the concept is timeless. The film has this dark sadness to it which The Little Prince original cartoon always had too. There was something sad and offputting about his adventures and his quest for his rose and the bleakness of his planet and those he visited. It was indelibly lonely and I think this version did a very good job of capturing that especially with the two styles of animation. The biggest problem is that it feels very potentially emotional and it takes you to the edge but then never really delivers the goods.Jeff Bridges is absolutely perfect as The Aviator/Old Man. Something about his voice fits the entire demeanour of the character and the child-like aspects of the old man and his acceptance of life and the little prince. Mackenzie Foy is also excellent as the little girl and the two of them together forge the perfect friendship. Rachel McAdams absolutely nailed the role of the concerned but overly anxious Mom and her voice is hardly recognizable, she disappears into the character. The rest of the cast is full of familiar voices and famous people including Paul Rudd, Marion Cotillard, James Franco, Ricky Gervais (loved his role), Benecio Del Toro...I mean they pulled out the stops to get this cast together. The problem is there were so many unique and interesting characters that I wanted to know more and see more and I think that each one had subtle nuances and lessons behind their characters.Ultimately The Little Prince had a lot of content for a little movie that was already focusing more on the modern day little girl than The Little Prince himself. Imagine this as a mini-series or a franchise of some kind but somehow it's too dark to be on par with the other animated films out there and might actually be too spiritually intense for it's own good. Mark Osborne has definite animation ability having done Kung Fu Panda, Spongebob and more but I think he tried something of great power here and maybe didn't deliver like it could have. I still loved it. I think the style was great, the story was sweet and I actually think adults will get far more out of it than youngsters might but they can enjoy the animation for sure. It's a very different style of "cartoon" for certain and I do think they tried to pay homage to the original material and did so. 8/10</fullReview>

Self claimed artists who have nothing to say use other peoples' work to pretend at the front of world that they actually have their own thoughts and they are capable to do something relevant. In fact, they cannot.Cant wait when Hollywood decides and re-paint the the Sistine Chapel.Do not watch this whatever. Read the book again!</fullReview>

Its a story of the the little prince traveling around the little planets. Its a good bed time story for the kids and kind animated movie for the elder kids.

		<shortDescription>Little prince disguised as a little girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will definitely hurt the feelings of the "Original Book Fundamentalists." In fact, if anyone would make a film only out of the book then there is no way this film can be long enough to be shown in movie theatres across the world. On youtube maybe. Anyway, the film does explain what the author wanted to: When one grows to be one of the "Adults,"his little prince,or what he stands for, curiosity, imagination, love, friendship, the ability to view the surrounding world with an aesthetical eye, or romanticism,dies with him. In the movie, the little girl has to learn about the society's materialism, to handle the relationship between her material life and her loved and beloved ones. So basically in the movie the little girl stands for the little prince, and again IN THE MOVIE the little girls experiences, although partially, what I understand that the little prince goes through in the book. The part I don't like about this film is it's rated that children are watching it. Why on Earth should they be recommended or even marketed to read or watch Le Petit Prince, Alice in Wonderland and so on? Shouldn't they be enjoying their childhood instead of pleurnicher and worrying about losing it? The author said so clearly and frankly that the book was written in a sad mood and he does not want it to be read as a bright fairy tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie is excellent. Give it a chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Huge fan of the book and the original 1975 movie. I thought the animated movie was amazing. YES. They switched up the story to create something more family friendly. I watched it with my 10 year old. The original story would have troubled him. The story is still there. Intact. Its just been mixed in with this girls story that matches that of the book. He loved it. The soundtrack is superb. Helps with the story. Even though its all french, my teen sons all downloaded it. Give this "adaptation" a chance. The voice acting is really super. Jeff Bridges doesn't mumble his lines and the scenes with the girl are real touching. YOu become attached to the characters quickly. The animation is incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever seen the rain with your bare feet, have you ever wondered the streets in search for something more, have you ever felt the life itself? With all the lives lived and all the tears swept away i'm still just a grown up child who wonders on any new toy on any new step I take further in the unknown. With all the pain and joy together I am who I am, I have not forgotten any bad or good thing in my way, yet I am here, a bit of gray hair, a bit of bitter taste in memories and a lot of smiles, love and hugs all around me. I have lived, yet I am still a child, still a little wonder. I am happy as one can be, in my own way, with tears and pain and sunrises all over the world, with billion stars at night. With all the special people who was, are and will be there for me. And I'll be there for them, for those who matter the most, for those who never give up to live, to search, to seek for more and for better. I am here for the special ones, the hidden ones and the magical ones. For every rose there is a drop of rain and a sun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Little Prince finds what is essential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Little Prince doesn't tackle adapting the classic children's book head-on. It takes place in present day, introducing an unnamed little girl (Mackenzie Foy) who is being groomed by her mother (Rachel McAdams) for life in the prestigious Werth School. After a disastrous first attempt, they move to a new house and resolve to spend the summer getting ready to try again. This new house happens to be beside the house of the aviator (Jeff Bridges), a seemingly crazy old man with an airplane in his backyard. The little girl and the aviator become unlikely friends, as the little girl finds respite from the routine of her studying in the aviator's wild tales of a boy that lives on an asteroid somewhere out in space.The decision to not simply adapt the book is a wise one. Beautiful and graceful as it might be, it is also a very thin volume that doesn't have nearly enough plot to sustain a feature length film. This movie instead holds on to the themes of the book, and recreates the wonder of the story through a whole new context. It is a little broad at times, and perhaps a little lacking in grace when deliver its messages. But all in all, the film finds really clever ways to bring this story to screen. One of the most remembered and beloved lines from the book has to do with what is essential. And this film mostly concerns itself with the question of what it is essential. The opening sequences of the film depict a world that has been reduced to everything essential: a world of adults zipping around in identical cars, going to home to the same gray boxes. The little girl in the film looks like a kid at the beginning of the picture, but she is already well on her way to becoming another functional cog in this larger societal machine. She is on her way to becoming essential. Though a bit lacking in lyricism, this is a pretty good way to bring the book's themes to the fore. The film still gets to many of the scenes from the book, but it grounds them in a smaller, personal story that does feel altogether relevant. And when the film starts to go beyond the book, it actually becomes inspired. In imagining a life beyond the ending the book, the film starts to draw from different inspirations, and develops a true voice of its own. It hits its themes a little hard, but that's forgivable in the end. The film provides enough beauty along the way that it doesn't really matter.This is a very beautiful film. The CG animation is crisp and benefits from a very strong design sense. And the scenes taken from the book are visually breathtaking. These scenes have paper and paint coming to life, capturing a sense of whimsy that is really important to the story. Voice acting is well done all throughout. Mackenzie Foy delivers a solid lead performance. Jeff Bridges is perfect as the not-quite-all-there aviator. Paul Rudd, James Franco, Ricky Gervais, Bud Cort and Albert Brooks are all pretty memorable in their performances as characters of the book. It's great stuff all around.The Little Prince is a little heavy handed, and the gap between the second the third acts is maybe a little too long. But it is quite lovely all the same. The film is clearly the product of a great love and understanding for the source material, and a real yearning to do justice to it. Whether it is in the beautifully conceived stop motion scenes that cover the book, or the cleverly put together CG sequences that go beyond it, the film always keeps The Little Prince in its heart. It is looking for what is essential, whether it be visible or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best animation feature I've ever seen. Insane photography. Wonderful story. The cutouts scenes are absolutely magical. This movie uses all the powers of animation. With this incredible tool nothing is impossible, as far as you can imagine it, you can do it. Shots and compositions that would have been impossible to do on a normal movie can be easily done in animation. And this picture makes this philosophy real. As a big fan of good photography I couldn't be happier of how it's used. I love that 3 different techniques are used to create something original and so incredibly beautiful. This movie takes the story we all have read as kids and, in a way that only children could imagine while reading the book, takes it to another level, making it even more magical. It doesn't matter if your a kid or an adult, when you watch this movie you go back to your childhood and see things differently, using your imagination. Love the nice touch the French songs give to the film. Not only the poetic picture is insanely wonderful, but it also is full of beautiful life lessons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best animated film I have seen where the whole family can enjoy. Although there is more for adults than for kids, but it plants the root for children and the generations to come. Don't get me wrong kids will enjoy most likely enjoy this movie, they might be a bit confused when it comes to the deep messages. But they will most likely enjoy the journey of the main protagonist. As a matter of fact if I have seen this movie as a kid, I would have been a bit confused. But watching this movie as an adult makes me truly appreciate this film. Watching this movie was like watching a dream on screen. It delves into dreams, passion, hope and love. And some of the ridiculous aspects of being too serious and following a routine path while constantly staying in the comfort zone. It's just unfortunate that this movie will probably not hit is off big when it comes to the mainstream audiences. Because when it comes to animated films, they want something more on the lines of wacky, romantic, cut and fun over a animated film with deep messages, metaphors and symbolisms. It's just clear that the main motive of the director wasn't to make a lot of money, but make a impactful movie that will make audiences gain a broader spectrum of thoughts. The animation is even marvelous with it's mix of CGI and stop-motion. To the audience that is looking for a exact replica of the book this movie is based on will be left disappointed. But this movie it carries over the essence and the heart of the book. About keeping that dream, passion and hope alive despite the harshness of reality. It has a deep message about humanity which really intrigued me as an audience.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was, at first, disappointed that it wouldn't be about the 'The Little Prince.' When I watched the trailer, I thought it would be about an old man and a young girl reading the story, and then the viewers would be able to see the book come to life. You know, like how The Princess Bride movie was narrated. Though it was shown in bit and pieces, they did just that and more. A lot of the people I know who read the book and watched this movie were very disappointed. They actually hated it, thinking it was too far off and saying it isn't The Little Prince. But, to me, it was. A story is not only about the story, it's also about the impact, the emotions, the lessons and everything else that revolves around it. I get that it didn't tell the story, but it showed everything else beyond that. The ending of the story of The Little Prince will be the most annoying thing, if you read the book and expected it to be like the book. Let me tell you one thing -- I think it was the girl's choice of ending. She didn't like the ending of The Little Prince, so she gave it her own twist. And through that, you can see how much she's changed. She's exploring her mind, her imagination, letting it run wild, allowing herself to be young. Her former self didn't do this. Everything was fixed for her, scripted and dull. Because of the old man and The Little Prince, she changed. I believe a person who watches this with an open mind will love it just as much as I do. But if you're one of those people who judges a movie because you have the book glued inside your head and it's taking up all the space, not allowing the movie to wiggle in, then I suggest don't give this a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What's essential is invisible to eye"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Little Prince is widely known as a children's book, nevertheless, it actually offers journey to one's inner world for adults as well as children. The movie Little Prince is in the same conjuncture, but in a visual way. In the point of fact, the movie consists of two parts. In the first part, the book was treated a bit of quick and broad brush. Yet, it was really good to see Little Prince as it is seen in the original pictures on the book. Stop motion scenes were successful enough. Second part of the movie, mostly related to "grown up prince" which I've found artificial and far away from the main theme of book's fiction. Dark scenes might be considered as frightening for children somehow. Still, seeing disguise of how king, vain man and businessman might look like in a real world were witty and good details. For the one's who like to read and imagine it in their own world, the movie might be below expectations, however, the book itself deserves credit for anything, therefore the movie was worthwhile to watch in the theater. Film version of The Little Prince would not change what you get from the story, as it says "what's essential is invisible to eye." Just one final note to the soundtracks which can make you watch all the credits; Camille has done a decent job especially with "Suis- moi".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeous adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up reading The Little Prince, an abstractly contemplative, profound book by wartime pilot Antoine de-Saint Exupúry. It's a wonderful story of his adventures stranded in the Sahara desert, and a curious extraterrestrial voyager he encounters there, who calls himself the Little Prince. He asks him to draw a sheep, and tells of his adventure on asteroid B6-12, and various creatures he meets. It's a frank, heartfelt allegory for the way the human heart and mind goes through a paradigm shift when age works it's spell, and gently reminds it's readers not to forget the wonder and disposition of being young. It's otherworldy, self contained and a very specific, poetic narrative, which is why I was worried that a big budget reimagining might shatter the tone of the source material and taint it with modernized mechanics. While it is jarring to see the styles meld, the French American co-production is a dazzling, loving ode to Exupúry's book. It frames the story of the prince around a little girl (Interstellar's MacKenzie Foy) who movies into a ticky tacky little suburban neighborhood with her overbearing mom (Rachel Mcadams), who has rigid plans for her daughter's academic success. Soon she meets her curious neighbor, The Aviator (Jeff Bridges, lending his warm-hearted voice to comforting perfection) a kindly old man who shares with her, page by page, the story of The Little Prince. We see these unfold in stunning, esoteric stop motion animation that compliments the CG of the rest of the film, equally gorgeous. She learns from The Aviator how to appreciate the perceptive qualities that we often lose later in life, and that the problem isn't growing up, but forgetting. We see in episodic fashion the prince's encounters with his beloved rose (Marion Cotillard), the malevolent Snake (Benicio Del Toro) who promises to help him return to his planet, and The Fox (James Franco, excellent) who teaches him that only with the heart can we see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye (always my favourite part of the book). The girl learns of the sadness and hardships that await her adult life, as reality puts a wrench in her idyllic friendship with the Aviator. The filmmakers beautifully gild the themes of the book which were so important to Exupúry by adding many elements in screenplay, animation and new characters that not only make the prince's story more accessible to youngsters of this generation, but enhance the story with the parallel of The Girl. An end sequence slightly stretches the boundaries of what some fans of the book may be willing to except, but I warmed up to it, and it's inconsequential when you step back and see the film as a whole, which is stunning. The voice cast is perfect too, with further work coming from Paul Rudd, Bud Cort, Ricky Gervais, Albert Brooks and Paul Giamatti. A treasure for those who hold the book dear, a triumph of animation and a story anyone can learn from and relate to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A children's movie that's hits home to both kids and parents alike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's story, characters, and general flow don't really suit the general movie going audience, even those who frequent children's animations. This is because The movie deals heavily with imagination. Most people will literally stop to think, unwilling to suspend their already owned knowledge and beliefs, resulting in the movie's story being hard to digest. But once someone give in and flow the story's current, they'll find that they're seeing something that has been missing from their childhood. Especially for kids nowadays. Now parents often don't have adequate time with their children due to overwhelming work. Even after work some parents prefer to spend their time on their pleasures and not with their children.Kids nowadays also lose much space for imagination as they are stuck with electronic gadgets, restraining them from imagination sparking physical activities. That is how this movie hits home to them. The voice acting is done well enough. It's nice that the weight of the cast members' name didn't overwhelm the story as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually speaking, this is the most beautifully crafted animation to my liking (very subjective, i know). The watercolor stop-motion part was especially stunning. Besides, the occasional use of symmetrical shots gave it a plus for me. Instead of making the visual more 3D, it made the shots seemed more of a 2D painting when in fact it's 3D. Which is not a bad thing. It did the same thing to me as the drawings in the original book. It made me sure it's a drawing; but it's alive and real. Icould feel the magic thanks to the visual.I wouldn't talk about how the story was. Let's just forget about it. (I wouldn't have given a 9 star for it tbh) But the one part that disturbed me the most was the part when the little prince *spoiler alert* turned little again when he watched the sunset with the girl (i've already forgotten her name, or was it never mentioned? Oh nvm). I remember saying, "who are you?", even when i was watching it alone and there was just myself to whom i could talk to because the seats in my row was completely empty except for mine and yeah. I was talking to you, little fake prince.And by the way, "S'il vous plaît... dessine-moi un mouton" would've been a googolplex times better...</fullReview>

It's probably a bad thing to do since, the movie is not a reflection of the book, but a continuation if you want. A little girl who discovers a new life through the readings of "The Little Prince". As you can imagine, the visuals are sumptuous and the graphics perfect. However, when it comes to the storytelling, I must admit I felt a little apathy during the movie. It didn't really make me feel emotional. Maybe in my mind, I was expecting to feel what you feel when you read the book (sorry I have fallen into the comparison trap).

It has good storyline and gosh, you really should appreciate people who work on stop-motion movies. It requires lots and lots of patience.While I really love Coraline, The Little Prince caught my attention. The animations is so delightful! Especially during Little Prince storyline. Since Caroline, this is the first time I also paid attention to the story and not just the animation. It was just as superb.Little Prince storyline is full of symbolism, I think. It makes you think about life, how you live and what you chose to be. It's quite inspiring, I must say. I originally thought the kid was just a projection from the aviator.

		<shortDescription>The magic of Exupery's "The Little Prince", all told in two interwoven narratives.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This animated adaptation of the Antoine de Saint-Exupery truly exemplifies the morals and ideas of the timeless literary piece. Clearly, every avid reader of the book will truly admire the visual transition of Saint-Exupery's illustrations to impressive 3D paper-like images. Every detail is loyal to the iconic handcraft of the book. Though the images perfectly match its source material, its narrative jaggedly slides through the remainder of the running time. Its succession so far comes from being faithful to the story about the Little Prince. Its timeless story sweeps with fancy, even when its ambiguity gets drained by the B-plot, involving the little girl. Her character, voiced brilliantly by Mackenzie Foy, makes a remarkable innocence of a child empathetic. However, her Mary Sue presence is a tired cliché that substitutes Saint-Exupery's ambiguity with a predictable story. One may forgive her presence, especially when she goes through a shifty (and debatable) third act where admirers might be tested. Though young readers will find it understandable. For all its worth, "The Little Prince" is a whimsy tribute to Antoine de Saint- Exupery's classic, delightful and heartfelt in all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>December 30The trailer was wonderful and the first three-quarters of the movie was wonderful as well. It just got a bit weird so abruptly that I didn't have enough time to prepare myself. That aside, I ALMOST CRIED.I say almost, even though there formed actual tears in my eyes, because I didn't sob uncontrollably. I guess I just expected it to be a whole lot sadder. Keeping in mind though that this is a children's movie, okay. It's okay. Not the greatest book-to-movie adaptation, but it's not worth hate. The insertion of additional characters was a brilliant move.The old man (I don't even know his name!) was a perfect character. He developed well as the story went. The only thing that devastates me is that I KNOW he's going to die soon after the end of the movie. But maybe that's why some believe that nothing happens after a story ends, so it will hurt less.Filed under: Movies to watch when you're losing sight of what's important.</fullReview>

Watching the movie made me remember my grandmother that provided me so much happiness during my childhood years, allowing me to be the child I was. It also provided me a looking glass to the lives of my kids today, and how I may improve it.It is a smart movie, made with lots of love and wisdom. It is a movie made by people that still hold dear the little prince in their hearts. It is a movie to see and show your kids, so they hold it dear as well. Chapeau.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry would adore this movie.Do you know how I know this? Because he wrote Le Petit Prince and he above anyone else would understand what this movie represents. It is a work built upon another work of art, think of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead. If you don't get it I'd suggest a rereading of the book. If you still don't like the film I'd suggest some sort of professional and immediate medical treatment because if you are looking for a direct film interpretation of the story then you didn't understand the book. Tant pis pour toi, as they say in French.Wonderful, as in "full of wonder" is a word we use so often that it loses a bit of its punch but I think this film brings us back to its true meaning. I was brought around to this wonderful film in an ironic twist and it was just what I needed. After reading extensively in the French press about the terrible events of 13NOV15 I somehow came across a mention of this classic piece of literature disguised as a children's book. I started to reread my original copy when a serendipitous click of the mouse uncovered this recent cinematic gem.It's worth the price of admission solely to hear the joyous tunes of Camille, namely Suis-Moi and its English flip-side Turn Around. The rest of the music is equally as playful and completely suited to the theme at every step in the narrative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This THING is so NOT The Little Prince</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is intended for all those fans of Le petit prince, the original book, and all those who like the character of Le Petit Prince.The Little Prince (original story book) has a very simple storyline (although it's quite rich and complex in analogies and depth), written in French, first published in 1943, shorty before the untimely death of its author/illustrator, a real pilot.I am a French teacher who has always included Le petit prince in my classroom whenever possible and for almost any age group (making the necessary modifications of course). I am a big fan of Antoine de St-Exupery and Le petit prince IS my favourite classic of all time. I don't have a problem with the storyline of this film. I actually think it was made to entertain and even educate a little. My great concern arises from the fact that this film is NOT Le petit prince.This film is trying too hard to cater to so-called modern audiences who like disproportionate faces and odd looking animations that barely resemble human faces. This is an insult to the author whose goal was to put his readers in touch with what's human, as opposed to money, business, rush and all those mundane exigences of the modern world.Instead, the makers of this film exploited a well-loved story and broke it down to pieces, placing the Le petit prince story in a totally unrelated frame story to make it what I call Hollywood-friendly. Even worse, they did not bother to give it a more appropriate title such as Discovering the Little Prince. This film is not the story of Le petit prince. They named it after the original story to attract more viewers and create a poster which makes you believe this is the story of The Little Prince. If I believed in the afterlife, I'd say Antoine de St-Exupert must be shaking in his grave.I have a three year old daughter who is very intelligent and although part of the modern generation, she already knows about this book. Do yourself and your children a favour and if you understand French, read the original. If not, read the translation of the book. Do not go for this film unless you have already read the main story.</fullReview>
