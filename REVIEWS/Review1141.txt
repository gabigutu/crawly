		<fullReview>In the IMDb Guidelines for Top Reviewers, Rule 19 says that, when in doubt, be honest.So I will.I have no idea how most members do their ratings these days. But I do know that often the ratings make no sense. This is one example. This is a stellar western, borrowing the "retired gunslinger" theme from the 40s and 50s, the type of western that Glen Ford used to do best.The script is solid, the acting ditto. I mean, Brian Cox and Demi Moore in supporting roles. Wow. The elder Sutherland as always gets a little trapped in his one-dimensional character but the part was written for a character actor not a lead. The younger Sutherland effortlessly spans the full spectrum of emotions and holds the attention of the viewer like glue. And Wincott makes for one of the most articulate western villains in the history of the genre.The cinematography is stunning.Again, looking at the low IMDb rating, you would think there are so many quality westerns being made these days that viewers are overpowered by choice. Nope, that's not true. Is it? If I were grading on a Bell curve, this would be a 9. As it stands it gets a solid 8. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Made Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in the era when the western was king. I really love a great classic western and Forsaken brought me back using classic tropes that many seemed to see as clichés but I welcomed as old friends. The cinematography is gorgeous, the acting is stellar, especially the Sutherlands, Demi Moore and Michael Wincott. At it's heart this movie is a beautiful father and son story, more drama than action flick which is also something I appreciate. As one who has not particularly been drawn to the revisionist western of today, ( zombies? aliens? incredible disgusting violence and nastiness? ) Forsaken was a breath of fresh air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Old School Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a number of westerns being released recently, from the excellent Bone Tomahawk, The Hateful Eight &amp; the Revenant to the decent Diablo.The Forsaken doesn't compare with the greats, but is still an excellent old style Western. The problem with this, is that it will be judged for being to old fashioned. If not for the swearing by the great Brian Cox, this is a Western that could have been made in the 60's with Glenn Ford or Randolph Scott.All performances are excellent, and the reviewer saying that Kiefer Sutherland overacted, he must have been watching another movie. Donald Sutherland is equally as good as his son. Michael Wincott Wincott is also worth mentioning, in a memorable role as a hired gun. He seems to be channelling Val Kilmer in Tombstone. As mentioned before, Brian Cox is excellent as the villain, using up the films swear quota. The only poor lead role is Demi Moore, which is not down to her acting, but limited screen time and development. Still give her points for not being vain and letting her grey hair show through.The plot isn't the most original, but gets the job done. Jon Cassar does a great job of directing and the Canadian scenery that is used looks terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confession is good for the soul.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie was done before by different actors, the whole drifter son who returns back in town, where ornery blokes are driving the town people out by using unsavory tactic to take possession of their property and land. Keifer returns to his father's home Donald, filled with a guilt of his past, only to realize that there are those who sometimes will not allow to forget it. I gotta say, the Sutherlands did a decent job on screen as a father and son duo, in which neither out stood the other in neither script or performance. Cox, WIncott and Moore, were also great co stars. In this film again, that has been done before. What moved me was the scene in the church were Keifer breakdowns and confesses his guilt to his father, who walks in on him talking to God, in whom Keifer never really believed in. That part had me little teary eyed. And of course end the retribution is handed down to those who have terrorized the towns people, and we all fill good at the end of the film. Cliché? yes. But a good cliché none the less, that stands the test of time and to see a father son duo do it so well, then I say we need more cliché films to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely done western from father and son Sutherland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a slow drive that ends with a sudden violent car crash, like a good western should.Kiefer Sutherland plays a soldier who waited far too long after the war to put down his guns, but something tragic hits him hard, and he tries to change his ways, with the help of his father, played by Sutherland's real life father, Donald Sutherland who plays a small town preacher who disapproved of the life his son once lead, and is threaten to get back into when a banker tries to buy out the town by any means necessary.It's a very typical western story made timeless by it's focus on being character driven. I don't know if this is the first time Kiefer and Donald have done a movie together, but it must have help with the relationship between their characters.But my favorite interaction was between Kiefer's John Henry and Michael Wincott's Dave Turner, who plays a rival gunslinger hired to influence town people off their land. The mutual respect these men showed for each other despite being on different sides of the coin was masterful, something I never seen done so well in a western. Brian Cox was also in the movie playing the banker that hired Dave Turner. His role as James McCurdy is what tells us that this timeless Western was made in 2015, because he's all about taking people's homes who don't want to leave, and his level of cold heartiness is done brilliantly, reflected this day and era. Though I'm sure she was trying to due some respectable acting in this film, Demi More is still some impressive eye candy. The story is nothing out of the ordinary, but it's strengthen by a great set of actors doing their thing, lead by father and son team Sutherland. Good western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely unoriginal, yet enjoyable throwback western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a fan of the genre, there isn't a single plot beat in FORSAKEN that you haven't seen many times over. In most instances, you'll probably be able to deduce what's going to happen next, or even what the next line is going to be.That said, I still enjoyed the movie a good deal, primarily due to the beautiful locations, and Donald Sutherland's exceptional performance in what could have been a thankless, cut-out role. Kiefer, in full-on Kiefer mumbly mode fails to impress, but it's still interesting to see the father-son duo share the screen.I'd give it a 6.5 if I could, but since I can't, I usually round up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I could save this movie but, sincerely, it is not that great.The plot is the usual, the good-hardened man who returns home from war to redeem himself. The usual very nasty guys who take advantage of expropriating people lands. Obviously the never forgotten ex-girlfriend, by this time married, which is in difficulties and ask for help. The good-hardened man that is brought (beyond measure) to the predictable despair.The only nice thing about the movie are some good actors but, mainly the relationship between Sutherland father and son that it is interesting to see acting together in their "real" roles.Otherwise a mediocre film, just a good set and a couple of moving scenes but overall a forced series of clichés from start to finish.By not considering the recent eccentric "The Hateful Eight" or the particular "The Revenant", if you want to see a good - usual - now day western, then "The Salvation" or mostly "The Dark Valley" are on other level.Just watchable6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cinematography and strong performances, but a somewhat unoriginal story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a slightly above-average western with great performances and directing but is a bit shallow on the story front. The plot is very ordinary and has a good amount of clichés. That being said, it wasn't a bad film at all.The performances from father/son duo Donald and Kiefer Sutherland were extraordinary. In fact, I think this might be Kiefer's best performance. I'll have to think about that, but there's one scene in particular that almost moved me to tears. The rest of the cast, like Brian Cox, are all great as well. The film had a lot of talent on the acting front.The actions scenes were all handled pretty well, surprisingly. They didn't feel low budget at all and were very intense towards the end.Overall, this film is nothing too special but it is worth a watch. I do recommend it just for the great cast. Don't expect anything too original, and you'll have a good time with this one.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best father-son film I have ever seen. Younger Sutherland delivers arguably his best performance ever which I am guessing is confidence with sharing the screen with his dad. The older Sutherland has a more typical role something like he has been performing over the years but the variety of emotions displayed by his son are captivating. Like any typical western, the ending is more or less predictable but this movie is not about the final chapter but more about a father and son's relationship in difficult times and no one could have done it better than these two. Definitely not to be missed if you are into emotional family flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a new western done right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the last few years I have watched pretty much all the newly made westerns. They all lack the old western feel. I walk away disappointed and time wasted. Finally The Sutherlands done it right! The background music right from the start put me in the mood to watch this one.I liked the way Kiefer played the main character. IMO he was one of the best actors to play the leading role in this western.For all the western fans out there I don't think you will be disappointed when you watch "Forsaken" Hats off to the directors of this film. This movie is not perfect (we always like to see more lol) but I give this western movie a solid 10 out of 10 compared to the westerns I have watched since 2000. Cheers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Fashioned Western is Well Presented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's deliberate pacing in this old-fashioned type Western, but I thought it was quite well presented and absorbing. The acting was top- notch with believable characters, a good script from Brad Mirman, and able direction by Jon Cessar.We've seen many of the plot elements here in varying degrees over the years with a vile and greedy land baron forcing the townspeople of Fowler to sell their land to him, with the knowledge that the railroad will be coming to their town soon. The fine veteran actor Brian Cox plays the land baron McCurdy, who employs a gang of violent goons to make sure the land owners sell to him.Aaron Poole is very believable as the sadistic Frank, who heads up McCurdy's mob, and Michael Wincott does well as Gentleman Dave, also in McCurdy's employ but has a whole different style of getting the job done.Amidst all this turmoil, Keifer Sutherland, as John Henry Clayton, is returning to Fowler for the first time in 10 years. His psyche was severely damaged in the Civil War and he has spent the last eight years carving a violent and checkered path across the country. All of that much to the chagrin of his father the local Reverend William Clayton, portrayed by Donald Sutherland, who's a strong believer in God and non- violence. I might note that it was good to see Demi Moore back on the screen, giving a most solid performance as Mary Alice, who loves John Henry and waited for him to return from the War, but eventually married and now has a son.Overall, you can for the most part, but not entirely, predict which way this movie is going, but I thought it was very well presented, and I would recommend it to those viewers who like this genre of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid western, Michael Wincott is a badass!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's refreshing that in an age populated by revisionist westerns and snazzy new takes on the ancient genre, some filmmakers just want to play it straight and deliver a good old oater without any newfangled bells and whistles. Jon Cassar's Forsaken does just that, arriving a few years late (turbulent post production issues) but in modest, simple form, here to tell the age old tale of one man who stands up to some evil frontier bankers with stoic heroism. Kiefer Sutherland is John Henry Clayton, a man who has been away from his quiet hometown for nearly a decade. Following a traumatic stint in the war, circumstance led him into the life of the gunfighter. His unannounced return home stirs up old wounds in his preacher father (Donald Sutherland) who cringes in the very presence of his violent aura. John has thrown down the guns and sworn never to pick them up again, but we all know that just ain't true, and when he meets a certain group of unsavory dudes in town, he becomes a time bomb of righteous anger that's liable to go off any time. He spends some time mourning his mother and reconnecting with a lost love (Demi Moore), until the inevitable conflict brews. Corrupt banker James McCurdy (Brian Cox) is buying up farms and forcing families who don't want to sell off their land, using despicable methods carried out by his two goons, vicious Frank Tillman (Aaron Poole) and mercurial 'Gentleman' Dave Turner (Michael Wincott). Tensions arise and everyone finds themselves headed for an unavoidable and blistering conclusion. Kiefer always has a jagged rage simmering just below the surface, which is what made him so perfect as Jack Bauer, another time bomb. He's downright implosive here, delivering the best work I've ever seen him give. He's got a touching scene with his father in which he goes to places I didn't know he was capable of in his work. Donald is quiet, resentful and compassionate, wrestling internally to keep his serenity in the face of injustice. Cox always puts on a good show as the villain, and he's exactly what he needs to be here: bureaucratic menace with just a dash of swagger. It's Wincott who steals the show though, with the best work in the film. He inhabits Dave (and his incredibly dapper costume) with a relaxed, lupine calm, punctuated by sudden bursts of danger and always presided over by the midnight black, raspy croon of a voice that makes him so special. He jaunts along the line between villain and sympathetic antihero so well, the only character in the film to shirk the archetypes, and I was please try reminded of Jason Robard's Cheyenne from Once Upon A Time In The West. His best work in a while as well, but then he's always perfect. The film is refreshingly violent in its gunplay, with an earned brutality that never feels gratuitous, and always satisfying. The production took place in wildest alberta, a trip worth the taking for the breathtaking scenery we get to feast on, especially in an opening credit sequence that is very reminiscent of Eastwood films of yesteryear. It's a landmark in the sense that although both Kiefer and Donald have been in the same film before (Joel Schumacher's underrated A Time To Kill) they never have shared the same frame until now. Trust me, it was worth the wait. They are both excellent, along with their peers in a simple, honest to goodness Western film that should please fervent fans of the genre and moviegoers alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Respect between professionals in this old fashioned western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Kirk and Michael Douglas, Donald and Kiefer Sutherland waited far too long to team up for a film. Forsaken casts them as a frontier preacher and his gunfighter son who wants to give it up and settle down and work the family farm with dad. But there's a lot that has passed between them, a lot of misunderstanding and judgmental behavior ever since Kiefer went off to war and didn't return. He also left behind Demi Moore who up and married Christopher Rosamond and has a son with him. This is an old fashioned western in its villains because back when all those poverty row studios were churning out B westerns the way Ford did Model Ts, the town banker in New Deal Days was always the villain. Brian Cox portrayed this villainous town banker with real relish, stopping short of twirling the mustache like Snidely Whiplash.Donald played a three dimensional preacher with both faults and strengths and resisted the temptation to make his role a caricature. Kiefer Sutherland is a Jimmy Stewart like western hero who the locality depends on to be the strong man who stands up to the villains.Like in John Wayne's classic El Dorado, Cox like villain Edward Asner in El Dorado doesn't use a gun, he 'hires it done'. Cox has a stable of gunfighters to enforce his will, but one of them is a professional played by Michael Wincott. Wincott and Sutherland have a mutual respect between professionals the way John Wayne had with Christopher George in El Dorado.For those who like old fashioned westerns like me, Forsaken is your type of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know there is a new sheriff in town when it comes to Westerns. This isn't one of them and quite frankly, I'm thankful. This is a throwback Western. A Western plucked from the golden age of Glenn Ford, John Wayne, Alan Ladd, Jimmy Stewart, and Henry Fonda. It also has some of the feel of more recent movies like Open Range with Duvall and Costner. Beautiful scenery that was beautifully shot. Good acting, good cast, good story, and for me a dark, but very effective score. I'd give it a 9, but there are very few 9's out there. Without the extraneous use of "f..." by one character 7 or 8 times this would have been a movie that families could watch together with their teens. Michael Wincott played a most likable bad guy, true to his name in this film. In the Western genre, its a home run in my book. Glad the Sutherlands finally made one together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Westerns! The Donald and Keifer Sutherland tandem here was irresistible and made this a must watch for me and it did not disappoint.Here is a heart warming tale about a prodigal son who was lost to the world and comes home 10 years after going off to war. The son haunted by a decade of wayward wandering and misdeeds. The father trying to overcome the bitterness of losing his family and community piece by piece.Throughout the movie is a pleasant, persistent but not overbearing theme of how God works through his servants to achieve His divine will. Fans of the genre will enjoy all the classic elements that make Westerns great. There is a scene in the church between father and son that had such raw powerful emotion it made me cry tears.Gentleman Dave Turner, played by Michael Wincott is my new favorite anti-hero.If you like Westerns you'll love FORSAKEN. Well done!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old, Tried and True</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brooding, intense, and dreary, Forsaken is an old fashioned Western told in an old fashioned way. A former Civil War soldier returns home after a series of ill-defined violent exploits only to be met with a deceased mother and a disappointed father. Eager for redemption, though not sure how to find it, he soon finds himself in the midst of another bloody conflict. Sound familiar? Yes, but the execution proves too good to write off.Though there are some clichéd motifs, to be sure, the film still feels authentic and offers some of the best acting in a genre that unfortunately has become awash in straight-to-DVD mediocrity. The characterizations are liking in some parts, yet their emotional integrity and presence is nearly visceral in this film?with an all- star ensemble cast featuring real-life father and son combo Kiefer and Donald Sutherland, Brian Cox, and Michael Wincott. Besides the acting, the film itself is restrained, with a slow build. Thought it has a short run-time, it never feels rushed, the action beats feel earned, and the ending resonates with the nearly poetic vibe of the film. Narratively it may seem slight, yet the parts work too well to be ignored in Forsaken.3.5/5 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good old fashioned western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good movie, it had a good story, the movie as a whole wasn't stretched out too long, it had some good acting, and the fact that real life father and son played father and son in the movie was just a great idea. It does feel like it drags on at times, and it kind of makes you sit on the edge of your seat waiting for the good guys to start standing up for themselves but it is something that is completely necessary for the story. The bad guy does drop the F bomb a few times, which I suppose isn't breathtaking but it feels out of place because that it is the only swear word spoken in the entire movie by a single person, multiple times, so it actually feels out of place. So here you have a guy dropping the F bomb and nobody reacts to it, not sure if they get it, don't get it and its one of those things where there is either too much swearing or not enough because its only one word by one person. I like the movie though and if I were to compare it to anything I think Clint Eastwoods Unforgiven would be a good comparison. If you liked that movie then you will definitely like Forsaken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modest But Decent Nod To The Classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blockbuster classic westerns are, of course, past-tense. If you still crave a good one you won't care as long as it respects the genre. Forsaken is a modest nod to the classics with many elements of those woven in. The story is anything but original, and the cast plays it straight and low-key. Overall it works.Keifer Sutherland and Donald play a father and son reunited after a decade of exile due to deeply held differences. The occasion is a visit to see the ailing matriarch who has died before her son has returned unknown to him. Both Sutherlands are pros and they don't overplay their roles, bringing a bit of real angst underpinning both's desire for reconciliation. With the elder's disdain for violence, he's the town's preacher, and the son's penchant for gunslinging, he's renowned as man not to be trifled with, their division couldn't seem wider. This will be a dilemma put the test by the town fat cat who seeks to buy out the locals prior to the arrival of the railroad. His henchmen are plying their trade of murder to achieve their employer's goal. This, of course, puts John Henry Clayton, who has laid down his arms in a bid to make peace with his father, in a situation he can't extricate himself from.Those who want to fault modesty in movies may turn away. I'd say they're missing out, as well as missing the point. This is like an ensemble cast and reverent director tipping their hats to the great westerns of all time in a purposely stripped down story. What it lacks in complexity and originality it makes up for in reverent simplicity. The backdrop of a west past is beautifully photographed. The roles portrayed seem right - even as the role the boss's right hand man, Dave, seems strange but will win one over by the ominous tone the fine actor Michael Wincott brings (he narrates a bit too). All in all, this is a small-scale enjoyable for those who appreciate the classics.</fullReview>

It reminded me of "Destry Rides Again" and "The Violent Men" among others. Of course it lacks the directors those films had, they were superb George Marshall and Rudolph Maté, but Jon Cassar does a good job, specially in the shootouts. The three main actors Kiefer and Donald Sutheland and Demi Moore have a good performance, also the villains, Michael Wincott as Gentleman Dave Turner reminded me of Val Kilmer. Also Jonny Rees as Tom Watson is not dramatic enough considering the difficult situation he is in.

		<shortDescription>Familiar story, but well executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Forsaken" having the particular title it has, it's obvious that the filmmakers were trying to package it in a way to make viewers think they were getting a western in the same vein of Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven". (Another similarity is that both movies were filmed in Alberta, Canada.) Anyway, if you have seen your share of westerns, it's highly likely that you'll find the majority of the story pretty familiar and predictable. (It's more or less the old land-grab plot.) While there are no real big surprises with the movie's story, it is a pretty well executed telling of a familiar story. The dialogue is pretty good for the most part. While the chief bad guy uttering the "f" word several times did seem out of place, the various other characters (good or bad) talk in a manner that gives them some dimension and makes them believable. The cast also does well, particularly the elder Sutherland, who gives one of his best performances in years, helping to make his character with some sympathy instead of a stern stereotype.Director Jon Cassar gives the movie a nice feel. There is a relaxed and down to earth attitude that while admittedly is a little slow at times, manages for the most part shows life in the wild west was for the most part hard work and not constant action. And the movie looks great, from the background scenery of Alberta to the costumes and sets. To sum up, while "Forsaken" doesn't offer an original story, and is not for western fans who are looking for tons of action, patient western fans who don't mind seeing a familiar story once again will find this western a well crafted retread.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great western!!, and I am a harsh critic of modern movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in westerns or anyone who wants to watch a nicely developed story that is not driven by special effects or flashy montages.This movie is a slow burn, with beautiful scenery and decent acting all around. The story is very simple to follow yet still interesting enough to keep you anticipating and wondering about the outcome.Keiffer Sutherland plays a retired gunman looking to live a simple life with his aging father, although there is a local brute who is forcing towns folk from their homes by using violence and intimidation. Should Keiffer pick up his guns and fight back? Or strive to live a life of non-violence and pacifism. It is up to you to watch and find out.If you like period pieces and westerns you will very much enjoy this movie. It is not perfect, there are a couple badly delivered lines, but other than that I was immensely drawn to the southern scenery and plight of the characters in the movie.I assume that this movie did not get great reviews because these days the average critic or audience member are not impressed by slow moving historical movies without flashy special effects. That said, I am very interested in period pieces and dramatic movies that rely on acting and tension without all the excess.A great refreshing movie! Watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing original or particularly remarkable in this template- following production. On the other hand, there is nothing weak or obviously objectionable about it either. It is actually quite well done, for what it is, which is nothing special. It follows the formula with confidence and without shame. I am, actually, inspired to be moved by such a stereotypical western in the year 2016.That said, "Forsaken" is no "Unforgiven", a masterpiece to which it owes a great deal and to which it offers an obvious nod. Nevertheless, it is certainly not a waste of time. The pairing of father and son actors to play father and son characters may well be a blatant marketing ploy, but it really does work. Also, I always find it fun to see 50-something women play convincing romantic roles. Say what you will about Demi Moore, but in my opinion, she's still looking better than good. Old Donald Sutherland is still quite functional as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully Clean Western I've Seen In A Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We paid $3.99 to rent this movie on Amazon while it is playing limited at Theaters right now. Although I checked the Parental Guide comments for this movie; I was still afraid of renting it without our Clearplay DVD player filtering; but to my SURPRISE "Forsaken" was surprisingly clean and heartwarming. When Rev. Clayton (Donald Sutherland) saw John Henry (his son) coming towards the Chapel: his eyes got watery - it made me cry (with tears of joy). Towards the end, when John Henry and his dad had tears in their eyes: it made me cry - not every actor has that effect on me - just the good ones. I like the father and son acting together so it was a must see for me. I'm glad that it was clean enough for my kid to see it with me. The one character using the "F" word, in different scenes (which got the rated R rating, for language). I liked seeing Demi Moore (About Last Night) since I haven't seen her in any movies in years. She looked so thin that I believe, she was thinner in this movie than in "About Last Night" (1985) . I liked the gunman Dave Turner (Michael Wincott) and the Bully character (like the leader of the bad guys) played his character very believing (cause you just hated him in the movie). To my delight, I really liked that there was no cheap-looking saloon women in the Saloon (bar). Now, my husband can watch it with us, next time. Thank you Writer and Producers of "Forsaken" and putting together a very good movie for Father and Son Sutherland and Demi Moore - hope to see her in more Theater Movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I watching a Bruce Willis rip off?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cliché is the word that absolutely describes this movie. Imagine all western common places and you get this movie spot on!Nothing here is a surprise. Sutherland, the son, does not have what it takes to hold the movie. His performance is bland and has a conflicted tough action guy he leaves a lot to desire. All the time I got the impression I has watching a bad Bruce Willis impersonation, brrrr! And it only got worse when the long-last ex girlfriend end up to be Demi Moore. Did the producers wish they had Willis? Some catching phrases also seem taken almost literally from Die Hard's script.In the ending scene, I just laugh. The always-the-same narration over the image of the "hero" horseback riding to the horizon has he leaves town after saving everybody's live... LAME. I didn't care about him. He just wasn't THAT type of hero. The movie misses everything that could make it agreeable. Performances, scenery or direction AREN'T enough to help it. It's a forgettable one.Solid performances from «the villains» and Sutherland - the father, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Show, don't tell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...is what "Forsaken" doesn't really do. It prefers to tell us instead of showing, and this is where it ultimately fails in being anything else but an OK western.But if you're alright with an OK western, this might be worth your time. It's ultimately a carbon copy of many westerns, and if I am to draw any comparisons, "Unforgiven" comes to mind. "Unforgiven" had also plenty of moments where things were spelled out for the audience, but it dared to show these things as well, and it had depth to it.Anyway, the plot of "Forsaken" is simple and one that's been done many times: A man (Kiefer Sutherland) wants to forget his violent past and live a decent life without murdering anyone, as he tries to reconcile with his father (Donald Sutherland, Kiefer's real life father). Then bad things happen.Two things keep this movie alive. First thing is the Sutherlands. While this movie can be quite hollow and superficial in its emotional depth, these two share a couple good moments. The best moments in the movie, in fact. Outside of those moments, both can rely on their natural charisma.The second thing is the anticipation for the inevitable breaking point and violent showdown. We know it's coming, and it can be quite fun to wait for it. But when it comes, it's quite underwhelming. It's executed in such a boring, flat manner that at no time did I see a remorseless man with a murderous past, or any death-defying rage. Don't just give us a standard, emotionless shootout as a payoff, when you set up something more satisfying. This doesn't only hamper your movie's entertainment level, but it also goes against the character you focused so much on.That said, "Forsaken" can also be taken as a reconciliation story, and that's where it delivers. It's not very deep and most of it is hammered to your head, but when it works, it works. There's an element of Christian faith somewhere here too, without any modern obligation to put it down (which is what I liked in another western called "Bone Tomahawk" too, but that's more of a horror movie than a western in the end). Donald Sutherland plays a preacher, and is a man of faith. His faith and His son's cynical, traumatized mind are somewhat clashing throughout the movie. Kiefer and Donald Sutherland carry the film when nothing else seemingly can, and I can't help but wonder: what if the whole movie was about their relationship, instead of having your run-of-the-mill revenge story at its core? I see a missed opportunity here.Demi Moore plays a character that wasn't really needed. She felt a bit forced. One could argue that she was only there to let us know more about Kiefer Sutherland's character, but it still seemed off. At least her story wasn't as predictable as I feared. Brian Cox has played a villain many times, and he was just here to get his paycheck. Don't get me wrong, a paycheck-collecting Brian Cox is still better than no Brian Cox at all, but his character was lacking and ultimately didn't carry much weight.Michael Wincott gives a really enthusiastic performance though, which is funny because his character is really restrained. He is very good in this, and they even managed to not make him as clichéd as it first seemed. Shame they didn't utilize him more, but he stole almost every scene he was in. Also, I think it was Kira Bradley (not sure) who played a grieving, angry widow for a few seconds. She was intense, and worthy of mentioning in a movie that sadly often lacked intensity.I didn't pay much attention to cinematography and score. Some might say that's a good thing, and sometimes it can be, but then again I wasn't impressed either. I liked the costumes though, and some of the sets and props.To summarize: "Forsaken" is okay, nothing more. It's a story we've seen many times. Sometimes it absolutely nails the father/son reconciliation story elements, but ends up being a little emotionless and flat in the action/revenge department. It doesn't feel as tight and intense as it should have been, and they could have scrapped a few characters and sub-plots for some extra focus. Both Sutherlands are good enough though, and Wincott eats the screen whenever he appears. It's decent, and sometimes decent is enough. Set your expectations accordingly and you might like it. I wasn't impressed, but I don't regret watching it either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a great Western even if its been done before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kiefer Sutherland gets better as he gets older. I love a good Western, this isn't in the same league as Unforgiven but watching Kiefer Sutherland play the role of John Henry Clayton is great. He gets the mood and the emotion right playing a man returning from a war he wants to forget and wants what it made him to be consigned to the past his presence on screen is always the one to watch. The movie theme has been done before, but this is better as there is a feel of anticipation throughout (as with westerns like Shane and Pale Rider), you begin to feel for the character of John Henry Clayton -The brought and paid for thugs act their part bringing their menace to every scene they are in; and eventually there is a showdown-Any fans of westerns I recommend you watch - it is worthy of just seeing how Kiefer Sutherland and his real life Dad act so well together and make the film a cut above many other Westerns</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A standard western but very engaging none-the-less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Wyoming just after the Civil War. An ex-gunslinger returns to the homestead after a decade away only to encounter seething anger from his reverend father who deplores his son's violent ways and a mother long dead. He additionally finds himself in the midst of a town bullied by land-grabbers who systematically murder whoever refuse to sell their land to them. This puts his newly pacified ways seriously to the test.This is an old fashioned western in many ways in terms of its fairly straightforward story. But in some respects I kind of liked it for this, as it made a change for the genre to reach back into the past for inspiration. Truthfully, this is a story full to the brim with very familiar tropes of its genre and you will not be very surprised by any plot developments or characterisations if you have seen a few westerns. But despite this, it's still an engaging piece of work. I would imagine it's been marketed primarily as the film where real life father and son Donald and Kiefer Sutherland play an on screen father and son. The two actors work well together though and, perhaps unsurprisingly, do have some chemistry. Demi Moore appears too and does solid work in what is a fairly basic character but maybe Brian Cox is the overall standout as the chief villain, an amoral businessman; Cox gets to spit out a few poisonous lines of dialogue and he does it well.This is not a western that is ever going to break the mould, as it doesn't really ever go anywhere westerns haven't been before. In fact, it actively embraces the standard plot-lines and characters of the genre. But it's a well-acted and is economically delivered never-the-less. Its very unpretentiousness entertainment and, most importantly, enjoyable viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be brief-If you have nothing else to watch, Donald Sutherland and Brian Cox do enough to make this clich? western work. Think of it like a poor man's Unforgiven condensed to 90 minutes. Kiefer offers his typical underwhelming performance while Papa Sutherland shines in comparison. Brian Cox has always had a knack for harnessing the villainous roles and he treated this one like any other. Demi Moore did nothing for me and was more of just a "name" that will catch your eye when the credits roll. The plot has surely been done before-ex gun slinging cowboy returns home and struggles to keep his past bottled up when confronted with a gang of outlaws- but nonetheless a few strong performances and decent production make this western watchable.</fullReview>

With Beautiful Cinematography and Period Customary the Movie is a Well Acted Story of a Father-Son Reuniting and Fighting against Evil Doers.Dad Sutherland is Ashamed and Appalled that Son Sutherland became an Unrepentant Killer (or is He) after a Soul Searching Stint in the Civil War. The Film's First Two Acts are all about the Evil Encroaching and the Two Sutherland's finding a way to Survive the Indignity with Dignity. While Initially of Like Mindedness, Western Fans will know what Must be Done. And it most Certainly is.Michael Wincott, Demi Moore, Brian Cox, and Aaron Poole all make Their Presence Known in Strong Supporting Roles. The Movie Never Wavers from the way it Presents Itself as a Solid and Stalwart Story of Good vs Evil and is Old School Throughout.The Finale is Unbridled from the Stable of Past Era Cinema Aesthetics with a Violent, No Holds Barred Concern about Displays of Gunplay and Moderns with an Expectation of Bloody Commences will Not be Disappointed.</fullReview>

Demi Moore was a bit old for the character that she played so it made her a little unbelievable.Spoiler Alert: Why didn't a new sheriff ever come?

		<fullReview>This movie was interesting, but not to exciting. It is incredibly slow paced.John Henry Clayton, played by Kiefer Sutherland, was out at war and had finally made his way back home. But when he made it back, he was a stranger in ways. His father Rev. Clayton, played by Donald Sutherland, ignores his presence. Besides John Henry's conflict with his father, there was also conflict with James McCurdy, played by Brian Cox. McCurdy is a dirty businessman who wants the Claytons to be no more of the town.John Henry was no longer fit for his father and his town. So he takes it upon himself to put things right as people once did in any western story.It was almost an hour and a half of complete boredom just to see a poorly put together shoot out at the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ten years after the Civil War, Gunslinger John Henry Clayton (Kiefer Sutherland) returns home to his estranged minister father (Donald Sutherland) and claims he is done with that kind of life. Meanwhile James McCurdy (Brian Cox) is threatening and killing all the farmers who won't sell their land to him. Normally, I would jump for joy to see another western, but this is just watchable. The plot is very simple, too simple, and no actor stood out. All were good, but nothing memorable. We watch as John Henry does nothing to help the farmers who are at the mercy of McCurdy. We are left with hoping for a JOHN WICK (great movie, btw) moment from John Henry. We know it will come, but it takes a looooooong time. And when it does come there was nothing special about it. Like I said: watchable. The best scene in the movie was when John Henry was going to face off against Gunslinger Gentleman Dave (Michael Wincott), who says he cannot back off from the duel with John Henry because he is employed to engage John Henry. What happens after that is pure gold. The cinematography was good, but most of those scenes didn't last as long as they should have. Brian Cox as McCurdy was the only one to constantly use the "F" bomb and that was annoying to say the least. (Maybe he thought he was in the DEADWOOD series?)Notable: Demi Moore as Mary Alice, who waited for John Henry after the war.So no jumping for joy for me with this one. As I said: Watchable. (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes by the McCurdy character</fullReview>

There's some fine acting, especially from Kiefer Sutherland who gives his best ever performance (I had always considered him to be a mediocre actor before this).Some say it's a remake of Shane, but there are many movies similar to Shane such as Pale Rider. However, this one is actually somewhat different than Shane, with the father-son relationship being a major theme. It's somewhat predictable, but in a good way.It's never dull throughout, and the climax is definitely worth waiting for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a good Western, well, a good film for a Western. I'm not the biggest fan of Westerns but Tombstone and 3:10 to Yuma are much better films. The story here is nothing special - man comes back to his hometown, but the town isn't so welcoming. The action is good, cinematography good, acting is good, I can barely remember the soundtrack having just seen this film an hour ago. Everything is just okay. A film like this would've been considered a great film many years ago, but with the passing of time, every generic western appears to us more and more generic. Directors have to try new things - the tried and tested is becoming slowly becoming boring. There's no need to stick to a stock story and stock characters. A director can do whatever he wants, yet westerns are becoming very predictable, following a type of story as if it were a film adaptation of a Shakespearean play.A good effort nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If he takes his pa's side in this it could be a problem." John Clayton (Sutherland) has just come back home after years and years of being away in hopes of making amends with his father William (Sutherland). The strain of the relationship begins to worsen when a group of land- grabbers begin to take over the town. Torn between his past life, and the life he wants to begin John is forced to make a choice. This is one of the better westerns in recent years, because of the cast and the acting alone. The story isn't all that original but the cast really brings it up and makes the movie seem interesting and new. I liked this, but I thought it was missing something to make it great. The movie did seem real and never over embellished anything, which really helps a movie like this. Western fans will enjoy this, as I did, but again there was just something missing. Overall, finally a western that is watchable and entertaining but had the possibility of being better. I give this a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dad and son Sutherland work together for the first time in this Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On DVD from a Redbox rental, my wife was too busy to take time to see it.The movie was crafted partly to give the two Sutherlands a way to make a movie together, and their characters are also father-son. The story never quite reveals where or when it is set, but references to the Civil War and the Tennessee battle at Shiloh would indicate a southern location maybe 6 to 10 years after the war, perhaps the early 1870s. However outdoor shots clearly show the Rocky Mountains because it was filmed in Canada.The movie starts with images of a shocked mother yelling, covered in blood, and holding her dead young son. Only nearer the end of the movie do we learn the significance of this scene.Then we see Kiefer Sutherland as John Henry Clayton riding his horse, eventually coming upon a homestead. The man that comes out is Donald Sutherland as his father, the Rev. Clayton. They aren't very friendly, dad only says "Your mother is dead", it had been about 10 years since John Henry had left home to fight in the Civil War.Aside from the estrangement of son and dad, the story here is of a ruthless man, Brian Cox as James McCurdy, who is out to buy up all the land belonging to a number of farmers and ranchers. In case friendly persuasion and dollars don't work, he has also hired a few gunmen who are more than willing to help him in his quest.So John Henry has quite a reputation as a gunfighter, something he is bent on changing. Back in town, lawless because the sheriff got afraid and ran, John Henry chooses to not carry a gun, and also sets out to gain the faith of his father again. But we know this type of western, it has been done before, many times. The gunman trying to shed his past but pressed again and again until he can't take it anymore, puts on his guns again and makes gets the bad guys. We know it will happen, it always does, we just don't know what the route will be.This is a good movie for this genre, and it is good to see the real father and son team up for a father and son movie. Also good is Demi Moore as Mary-Alice Watson, John Henry's former flame who was now married and with a family. Her husband is Tom Watson, but not the famous golfer from Kansas City.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen at least one Western this will look like a copy of that.I generally love Donald Sutherland so when one of his first lines is, "You're mother is dead," and he huffs into the house (I don't remember if his hand was covering his brow)you just know the film is going to stink. Too many shots of Kiefer's forlorn scowl while he contemplates his newfound holiness. Even Brian Cox phones in his performance. Michael Wincott has a thoroughly unconvincing southern accent which poisons everything out of his mouth. Here's some free advice to Hollywood: some people really care about language so be very careful throwing around accents that people can't pull off. Very few actors can do a Southern accent so simply having them say, "I do declare," isn't going to cut it. Demi Moore...why? The story is utterly from the big box of Hollywood Western paint-by-numbers scripts: former gunslinger now seeking to change his ways forced out of retirement to kill an entire town of evil monsters. Guess what happens at the end? I dare you. Guess who prevails? I know it's hard but just try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has everything for the true Western aficionado.First off, Kiefer Sutherland hands in a virtuoso performance as John Henry Clayton. Although far from the beloved Jack Bauer character from TV's 24 fame, this character is quite the bad-ass in his own right - with the reputation to prove it. The younger Sutherland's role spans a broad range of emotions. At once, frustration and sadness due to a violent past - to tenderness, romantic regret, and vengeful rage - he is not your typical cowboy.Donald Sutherland is a cinematic tour de force as the former gunslinger's bitter yet ultimately forgiving preacher father is yet another triumph for this veteran actor. This father and son team has found the perfect project for their on screen debut together.Demi Moore gives a tender performance as Clayton's former love, now married with children to a decent, hard-working husband who is jealous of her romantic past with Clayton.Michael Wincott's turn as a highly-principled gun-for-hire is the perfect antidote for the local land baron's unruly gang of violent thugs.Finally, Brian Cox is his usual superb self, providing us with a classic villain who is a perfect fusion of Gene Hackman's merciless and cold-blooded Little Bill character from Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven" - and Michael Douglas's greedy financier, Gordon Gekko from "Wall Street." Finally, the breathtaking cinematography is reminiscent of the backdrop for previous classic films, "Shane" and "Dances With Wolves". This outstanding film is destined to take its place in the annals of great American Westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forsaken is simply a good Western - it has at its heart a sense of honor and morality that involve you from the get go. This is nicely judged throughout - it is not so clean as to be antiseptic, but neither does it go down the Deadwood path. It is reminiscent of John Ford and the classic films of the 1950s. As a major bonus the cinematography and sets are done right.The father / son combination of the Sutherlands on screen together is great, Keifer is measured, and Demi Moore reminds us that she is a solid actress. Above all, this is a solid plot and solid characterization.Finally, we loved the pacing of this - not as slow as Slow West or The Homesman (Both of which were good), but in no sense frenetic, it is a film about homecoming, love lost, and eventually, a man doing what a man has to do. For this reviewer it was one of the most enjoyable films of the year: simple, captivating and surprisingly lingering and memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Forsake "Forsaken"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Forsaken" is a traditional, old-fashioned western that evokes memories of "Shane" and "Pale Rider." "24" director Jon Cassar and "Truth or Consequences, N.M." scenarist Brad Mirman have recycled all the familiar clichés, but they have done so with reverence and charisma. The added treat is that "Forsaken" marks the first time that Donald Sutherland and Kiefer Sutherland has shared the screen with several scenes between them as a father and son who effect a sincere reconciliation. Kiefer plays a remorseful gunslinger that has grown weary of the way of the gun. He returns home to see his father and learns to his chagrin that his mother has passed. Donald plays a man of the cloth, and he feels shameful about his son and all the hardship that he brought onto his family with his pistolero reputation. Eventually, these two men come around to each other. The force that drives them back together is the standard-issue empire building storyline about a wealthy man, James McCurdy (Brian Cox of "The Glimmer Man"), who wants to buy up all the land around town in anticipation of the arrival of the railroad. McCurdy is a lowdown dastard and he keeps a small army of gunslingers on his payroll to intimidate the farmers and ranchers. Demi Moore plays an old flame of our protagonist, John Henry Clayton (Kiefer Sutherland of "Young Guns"), who waited for our hero to return from the American Civil War. Predictably, John Henry refuses to go home and he has been making his living by the six-gun. During a shoot out in a Kansas town, John Henry bested his adversaries but in the process one of his bullets strayed and killed a youngster. This unfortunate circumstance prompts our hero to hang up his hogleg, but McCurdy and his gunslinger shatters his resolve when they try to kill John Henry's father. The shoot-out and the deaths of the villains takes a long time to occur in this 90 minute horse opera, but you get to savor the shooting. In some ways, the gunfight in the saloon recalls the John Wayne western "The Shootist." Meanwhile, before his buckles on his six-shooter, John Henry clears some land of trees that his mother wanted him to do when he came back from the war. She had hoped that the Reverend Clayton and his son would rekindle their mutual love and respect, and it is a touching moment when father decides to help son. Top-notch character actor Michael Wincott is cast as one of McCurdy's villains who doesn't always see eye to eye with his employer in regard to his strategy. Gentleman Dave Turner feels that John Henry and he are doomed to face each other down in the street and settle their accounts with gunpowder. "Forsaken" is for spectators who crave a good western. Some of the scenes between Donald and Kiefer Sutherland will bring a tear to your eyes such is the intensity of their performances. Sure, it has all been done before and done better, but you have no reason to forsake "Forsaken."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An often derivative morality play with no clear moral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chekhov's gun is a dramatic principle that states, according to the Wikipedia article by that title, "every element that is present in a narrative is to be irreplaceable, and anything that is otherwise is to be removed.""Forsaken" features a LeMat revolver. This is a somewhat unique weapon. It was manufactured in the South for use by Confederate troops. It's cylinder holds nine rounds and it has a second barrel that fires buckshot. It is also a bit heavy at 3.1 pounds. The weapon was the subject of two conversations. But the only unique feature of the weapon that had any dramatic impact was its weight. If the buckshot was fired, it wasn't apparent. The movie assembles a number of unique elements, but doesn't quite seem to know what to do with them. It ends with a narrative evocative of "Unforgiven," but less forceful, as it suggests a character continued to struggle with moral questions that remained unresolved at the end of the story. Brian Cox plays a land baron intent on scaring off the ranchers and buying their land, but he's trying to be a nice guy about it (sometimes) and if he isn't paying a fair price for the land, nobody complains about it. Why he wants all the property, which one character describes as the same dirt and rock as anywhere else, is never clear. Kiefer Sutherland plays a Civil War veteran who lost his religious faith and became a gunslinger. He was somehow traumatized by the Battle of Shiloh, but we never learn quite how or on which side he fought. He also feels guilty for the death of his younger brother, but it's not quite clear what his role was. The scenes are evocative of scenes from "The Outlaw Josey Wales" and "Ordinary People," the latter perhaps because it also starred Donald Sutherland as a father who loses his favorite son in a boating accident, but lack either the impact or economy. He was further traumatized by an incident depicted in the opening scenes that isn't explained until later.I am tempted to describe the movie as a chick-flick western. Some parts seem distinctly cornball and contrived.In many westerns, the gunslinger comes to town with his own sense of morality. Here a former gunslinger comes to a town that desperately needs a man of action and moral conviction. Instead, they get a man of uncertain faith who sets to work exhausting himself by clearing a field as a tribute to his dead mother and submits to various forms of humiliation to avoid action. The movie wants to be a morality tale, but doesn't have a clear moral. The tone is a little uneven. Some of the gunshot wounds are graphic and seem fairly realistic. Sometimes the costumes seem like something out of a Hollywood musical. It is probably reasonably accurate in that nobody seems able to shoot very accurately, in stark contrast to many westerns where gunfighters shoot from the hip with uncanny accuracy. However, it seems a little surprising that professional gunfighters would be so consistently inaccurate. #OscarsSoWhite activists probably won't like the film, as the cast is about as colorful as Donald Sutherland's hair. There aren't many women or children either and the ones who have the greatest impact on the protagonist are already dead. Demi Moore's character seems like it was transposed from an old Gene Autry singing cowboy movie. The one bedroom scene would probably pass the Indian censors without cuts. One modestly clothed barmaid walks upstage through a bar full of drunken gunslingers who could all be gay for the amount of attention they give her. The wife of a farmer vows to spit on the grave of the land baron. Otherwise, the womenfolk stay quietly in the background and leave the action to the men. There are several Civil War veterans, but none is crippled or handicapped. Generally, in this type of story, the protagonist works his way up the hierarchy of henchmen to a final showdown with the antagonist. This movie takes a detour or two, one of which is kind of interesting. Cinematography is good in the static shots. Action photography is less impressive. Overall, the film is worth viewing, but isn't anything I'd want to watch a second time. I was often reminded of earlier films that handled similar material and situations more adeptly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You must be joking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the reviews on this site for "Forsaken" and find myself wondering if there is another version of the film out there. Kiefer Sutherland does his absolute best to overact - this the main reason I stopped watching "24" years ago. His father is difficult to fault as he goes through the motions on autopilot. The direction is at times okay but overall sparks of a Canadian production - extras on the street are laughable. The well-dressed villain does a fine job, while the hateful villain is nothing special. Brian Cox is a favourite of mine and he must know he is wasted in this plot that has been done many times before with greater success. Demi Moore manages to keep her cool but cannot save what is really a movie with little to recommend it. A_Different_Drummer: "the script is solid, the acting stellar" - possibly correct when compared with a daytime soap. I believe the Sutherlands are capable of better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sutherlands play father and son for the first time in a western that is a deep character study.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Originally published on Blogcritics) Forsaken is the first film to co-star father and son actors Donald and Kiefer Sutherland as father and son. That's the hook, but there is way more to this western than anyone would expect, although a glance at the credits of the director, writer, and impressive supporting cast should give you a hint that this is an exceptional film.The StoryThe story, on the surface, seems deceptively simple and one any fan of westerns has seen a dozen times. The railroad is coming and a corrupt business man is using a bunch of thugs to force farmers to sell their land to him. But to leave the description there would be like saying High Noon was about a town's law enforcement human resources problems.Set in 1872 Wyoming, the story begins as John Henry Clayton, played by Kiefer Sutherland (24, L.A. Confidential, The Lost Boys), returns home from the Civil War; only it's ten years later than everyone was expecting him. Everyone includes his father, the Reverend Clayton, played by Donald Sutherland (The Hunger Games, The Italian Job, MASH), and his former girlfriend, Mary-Alice, played by Demi Moore (A Few Good Men, G.I. Jane, Ghost).John Henry's father, the Reverend, is bitter, and his former girlfriend has moved on, but his problems run deeper than that. During his ten lost years John Henry continued to use the lethal skills he'd learned in the war, earning a reputation as a gunfighter. He tries to leave that behind, reestablish a life in his old home, and rebuild his relationships.The FilmmakersDirector Jon Cassar (24, The Kennedys, La Femme Nikita (1997)) and Writer Brad Mirman (The Good Shepherd, Joshua, Highlander: The Final Dimension) bring John Henry's struggle to life through finely crafted words, beautiful cinematography, and touching symbolism. The music by Jonathan Goldsmith is also exceptional.Cassar does a lot with looks and symbols. His actors get to act, not just repeat the lines. But the lines that Mirman provided them are excellent. The film begins with a shocking scene of violence that we won't understand until much later. That is followed by and contrasted to John Henry riding home through settings that suggest an idyllic country life. The very first words we hear spoken are from the Reverend Clayton, who upon seeing his son for the first time in ten years says, "Your Mother is dead."Shortly thereafter Mirman clues us in to the theme of the film, when, after noticing that his son is no longer wearing his six guns, Reverend Clayton comments, "I don't know if a man can get away from who he is."The CastThe supporting cast which helps John Henry answer that question includes a variety of antagonists. Dave Turner, played by Michael Wincott (The Crow, Alien: Resurrection, 1492: Conquest of Paradise), is a Southerner who fought in many of the same battles that John Henry did, but on the other side. He has embraced the gunslinger life from which John Henry seeks to escape and provides a mirror into which John Henry can gaze.Brian Cox, who played the first screen incarnation of Hannibal Lecter in Manhunter, is the businessman who is driving people off their land. He is a devil-like corrupting influence to all around him.Kiefer Sutherland enters the saloon to fight half a dozen bad guys. The head of the thugs is played by Landon Liboiron (Hemlock Grove, The Howling: Reborn, Terra Nova). His creepy visage personifies yet a third kind of evil, ignorant and sadistic.The rest of the cast does a fine job as well, with even minor characters having impressive credits.Violent Yet SpiritualWhen Forsaken gets down to fistfights and gun fire, it does not spare the blood. Yet, above all, it is a spiritual and intimate film. Set in a world separated from us by over a hundred years, the questions it asks about loyalty, morality and family are timeless. It explores human nature, community and violence. And, did I mention that it's a kick- ass western with Kiefer and Donald Sutherland? Forsaken is rated "R" for violence and language. It opens in theaters and VOD on February 19.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Run-of-the-mill Western with a single unusual deviation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a scene much seen before in the Western genre ? or rather, done better ? as Eastwood would shoot it or Duvall play it. A dusty frontierville in the grip of a gunmen gang can only mean one thing; that a renegade outsider is passing through (or coming back) to rectify the situation and bring justice to the folk. By no surprise, it's exactly what happens here. The draw for me was to see the two Sutherlands in combined action, though while I like the father's roles and charisma, I'm not much impressed or familiar with his son's work. One thing only sticks out as unforeseen, or otherwise mediated, at the end of the inevitable shootout that wraps it up; albeit anticlimactic, it's a respectable choice of events. Watch it or not, it's pretty much the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just screened at TIFF. A paint-by-numbers movie that lacks finesse let alone originality. Every hoary western movie trope + cliché - and then some. Downright ridiculous at times. Kiefer Sutherland wasn't bad - just the material he was handed. Father Donald clearly understood the dilemma as his performance was on autopilot. Demi Moore was actually OK-ish in spite of obviously being the director's idea of stunt casting. Michael Wincott did the least-affected work with arguably the most affected character - he also got to be beautifully dressed (as every gentleman killer with a code of honour should). Cameron Bailey introduced the film as a uniquely "Canadian western". I understood how sly he was being about half-way through the screening. Good news; it was only 90 minutes long. In conclusion, rent 'Unforgiven' if you want to see how it is supposed to be done.</fullReview>
