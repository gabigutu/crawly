		<fullReview>...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've played warcraft and wow for many years since when I was 13 or 14 years old. Ever since then, I haven't stopped playing. Therefore you can count me as a fan. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it at a pre-screening, and I kept wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for the fans. I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence.Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the lore lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? OK, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Duncan's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the lore and books which may or may not be compatible with that of Duncan's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Chris Metzen; that's the thing with story: each player / reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, Stormwind, Goldshire, Ironforge, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the story a lot. The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I had never seen orcs in such detail before, hulky, robust, terrifyingly but also relative.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the next movie... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again when I can. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually play WoW. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsibility, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. That will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WarCraft: The Beginning - Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually thought this film would be bad. Like most other video game movies I thought this was going to be a massive flop and just suck. This movie broke the video game movie curse with style. WarCraft surprised me even though I am a WarCraft fan.If there are sequels WarCraft could easily be this generations equivalent of The Lord of the Rings. The acting was great, the effects were spot on and the action was epic. I was really impressed with the motion capture on the orcs, they looked amazing. Travis Fimmel as Anduin Lothar was a good choice. He did a really good job of portraying the lion of Stormwind. WarCraft has a lot of lore that could easily be made into a film series and I think this film did a good job of establishing the world of WarCraft for future sequels. Do I recommend watching WarCraft? Yes, WarCraft is a movie everyone can enjoy, although it may be too intense and violent for younger children. If you were a fan of the games there are Easter eggs for you. If you have never heard of WarCraft you will be amazed by the world and want more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft fans, LOTR fans, Fantasy fans and even non fans, GO SEE THIS MOVIE ! You will love every second of it !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello. First of all i have to tell you, i am a Warcraft fan and i had no expectations from this movie at all. I am NOT a Blizzard fan boy and i know when they do something poor and when they do something good.If you like the cinematics that they make and if you like LOTR like me and fantasy, you will absolutely love this movie. I was really scared about this movie being another video game movie chaos. Not by a landslide.Warcraft is astonishing. The visuals are ground breaking, the acting is very strong and the emotional involvement between the viewer and the movie is breath taking. The familiar zones from Warcraft universe are all and are built exactly how they are suppose to be built, every Warcraft fan will feel like home and on the brink of shedding tears. I will watch this movie again in 10 June and gather all my friends that were not lucky enough to see it yet and go again, maybe twice. I need more, there has to be more Warcraft movies. Dunca Jones working alongside with Blizzard was a genius move and it shows throughout the movie. Almost 2 hours of pure awesomeness. 10/10 from me. GO SEE THIS MOVIE, you will not regret it !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is The Video Game Curse Broken?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, i would like to point out Duncan Jones has made another fantastic flick. Better than source code, but me personally i loved moon so.... Warcraft isn't good enough to beat it lol. So Everything about this movie felt right. And i would like to point out this movie is about the warcraft storyline (First game) Not World Of Warcraft. The acting was good, the pacing was great. The CGI was amazing! Gul'dan was an awesome villain. Never heard of Daniel Wu But i feel like he will be voice acting more characters soon. I love how they wear that ridiculous armor that a normal person can't stand up in. Lothar was an amazing main character, and I only know Travis Fimmel because he's in the show vikings but i feel like if the rest of the critics like this movie this could be his breakthrough movie. If there is a sequel then i would definitely go and see it. And lads, The Video game curse is broken! Hopefully Assassins Creed will live up to the hype! Fans will love it, people who like lord of the rings or the hobbit will love it, just regular people who has never played WoW will love it! All in all, i think that the hype was well worth it and it is definitely going to be a recommend for me! After you have seen Captain America go see Warcraft, you wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to give away anything, but my god was this movie amazing! The motion capture was superb, the acting superb, and the plot itself was great. For the Warcraft fans you will see plenty of easter eggs that will make you grin or laugh. Over all it's what of my favorite movies I have seen this year.I went to an early screening with my girlfriend and a friend of mine and even though they know nothing of the storyline or world of Azeroth, they absolutely enjoyed it. The characters were awesome (Duncan Jones did amazing) and so were the actors. From what I could gather, the entire crowd who went to see it enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just seen it with a bunch of friends and it was amazing. My friends who came with me aren't even Warcraft fans and they even said they can't wait for a sequel, they said it was nothing like they expected, which is another shitty fantasy movie. They were on the edge of their seats the whole time and wanting more! Whenever they'd show Easter eggs in the background i'd go nuts and they had no clue why but they were too busy being into the movie to care to ask. I CANNOT WAIT to see another one of these movies!!! I even noticed a lot of people outside the theater who have never played the games or know anything about it, loved it. I even talked with an older couple for a good 10 minutes who loved it but didn't understand a few things and i cleared it up for them, they were very thankful. They were excited for another movie too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this movie in a IMAX 3D theater. The sound makes it well worth seeing in a theater with a state of the art sound system. The Orcs are believable from the start. Well rounded characters with great motivation. The motion capture work by the actors was a work of passion.Ben Foster and Ben Schnetzer did a wonderful job playing the magic wielding Mages. Perfect depth, effort and really showing the strain magic has on the human body.Paula Patton did a fantastic job with Garona. Duncan Jones made a compelling ass kicking female character. But more important for the fanboys, feel comfortable bring non-WoW playing friends and families to the movie. All non-WoW movie goers seem to enjoy the movie and really liked the CGI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A MUST watch for all the Fantasy genre lovers and not only.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** This review may contain spoilers ***I was lucky enough to get an invite to watch the movie in LA 2 weeks ago, in a screening about press.I was the only one foreign guy there(Cyprus but got invited since i am making my after-master practise here).I have to note to everyone here that i am aware of World of Warcraft and the Warcraft games as IPs but i've never played any of them.I am a huge Fantasy genre lover and this movie exceeded my expectations. My biggest concern minutes before movie aired was the quality of the CGI.I Knew this movie uses a lot of CGI.Well the CGI is breathtaking easily equal or better to AVatar and Dawn of the Apes, equally to JUngle book(what a great movie!) BUT with the difference that it is used in massive scale, which makes it even more impressive. Watching Hundreads of Orcs with unique characteristics and facials is mind boggling(with the positive way of meaning).Orcs are beautifully beautifully made, main character Durotan is just awesome he is my favourite character, HUmans are OK at start i had an issue with how armors looked but people told me it is exactly how in-game is.IN terms of acting Ben Foster is hands down the best performer also Paula Patton and Travis Fimmel are nice, rest of the cast its slightly above average not great, but serviceable. Orcs overall are better portrayed than Humans, BUT thats the important thing if CGI was bad in this movie i would be really turned off, but the CGI is perfect so i can easily bypass the fact that 2-3 human chars weren't the best.I Loved the plot, it is so rich and u can easily understand why some people said that this movie isn't even the 15% of the whole Warcraft Lore.Duncan Jones has done a great job for non-fans like me to easily udnerstand the movie, even though there are a few times that let u hanging which proposes hinds for a sequel.Visuals are stunning and we can see probably the best implementation of magic that has been made in a movie.Summing up this is a MUST watch for every person that loves Fantasy genre, easily the best fantasy movie after the last LoTR release(IT would be at LOtr level with 2-3 more decent actors). ANd easily the best video-game adaptation that has been made. 1-- Breathtaking CGI 2-- It feels more like a movie(rather than a video game movie) 3-- Incredible and rich lore/plot, Warcraft universe is HUge and after this movie i really want to explore it.Give this movie a chance i know many are sceptical to any video-game adaptation, but this one it wont disappoint u.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Combining primitive textures (hides and sun-bleached bones) with the glowing whoosh of magical elements, Warcraft is a big-screen, 3D game that the viewer enters, to the martial beats of the elegantly ominous score by Ramin Djawadi (composer of the Game of Thrones theme). Its use of multiple cameras to film the motion capture performers in the same take as those playing human characters is one of the ways that it's new. And then there's Durotan's eyes, and Garona's grit. Dramatically and technically, Warcraft gives the concept of "hybrid" new punchthe movie's story is as simple as its visuals are elaborate. Beneath the richly textured layers of motion capture, animation and 3D modeling lie the basics: conflict, survival, family, loyalty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Visuals and Strong Soundtrack but not much else going for it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here in Denmark, Warcraft had its premier today so obviously I flocked to the cinema to watch the movie. And the movie turned out to be exactly what I expected. The film looked and sounded wonderful (I'm already thinking Oscar nominations for visual effects, sound editing, and sound mixing), but the story was weak and the characters vanilla. The CGI, which I had feared, turned out to be pretty gosh darned good (especially in relation to the orcs). The acting department of the film was not anything unexpected with a few decent performances and otherwise plain and wooden acting that seemed to gloss over the otherwise dramatic and interesting situations that some of these characters were thrown into. The largest issue with this film however is the weak story, the unbelievable screenplay, and the fact that the movie relies on the audience having previous knowledge of the Warcraft lore (which I don't).Travis Fimmel, who I've only ever seen in Vikings, plays the human protagonist, Anduin Lothar, and does so decently. Now this is obviously not a groundbreaking or jaw dropping performance, but for a big action movie like Warcraft his acting was fairly good. Fimmel makes the character interesting, relatable, and easy-to-root-for, which is frankly more than anyone could have expected, so props to him. But Fimmel was by no means excellent; on several occasions when he had to deal with loss there seemed to be a weird and inhuman lack of emotion. Paula Patton plays the half-human and half-orc female protagonist, Garona Halforcen, who flip-flops from Horde to Alliance and vice versa. This character, just like Lothar, has a nice relatability and is easy for the viewer to get behind. Patton's performance is also pretty decent, but just like Fimmel, she had moments of uncomfortable stiffness and lack of emotion. I do think though, that in this case that could also be due to a screenplay that totally lacked any sense of believable dialogue. Ben Schnetzer also has a major role in this film as the mage, Khadgar, who accompanies Lothar for the majority of his journey. Although the character is cliché (I'll be saying that a lot), Schnetzer's decent wit and mildly sarcastic approach makes the character fairly compelling and interesting. The character's major moments however are ruined by unpleasing directing and weird dialogue, but Schnetzer did alright.Ben Foster also features in this film as the Guardian of Tirisfal, Medivh. Now I can honestly proclaim that I was lost for a large portion of his scenes which were something about mages and magic and 'fel', I think? But all that aside, Foster did not help much himself. Foster's portrayal was awkward and inconsistent, sometimes he'd loudly speak to himself and sometimes he'd have a large unjustified outburst of emotion with no true reason behind it, but for the sake of the story. Dominic Cooper portrays the young and dashing King Llane Wrynn, who rules Azeroth. Cooper's character is awfully clichéd, but is wonderfully grounded and believable and seems to mend some of Foster's scenes. But ultimately the character fails to get the audience to back him and it seems truly outrageous that the same actor who made Howard Stark a likable character played such a dull character in such a big movie. Toby Kebell plays the noble yet awfully underused character of Durotan, the leader of the Frostwolf Clan (a clan of orcs). In the very beginning of the film, the character is seen with his very young son, and this helps make the character appeal to the audience. Although the character itself is interesting, and Kebell's acting is decent, the character is so underused and pushed aside for story lines and plots that fall incredibly short of Durotan's.Robert Kazinsky and Clancy Brown (Mr. Krabbs in Spongebob) play Orgrim Doomhammer, the reluctant follower and occasionally good friend of Durotan, and Blackhand, the aggressive war chief of the Horde, respectively. They both do decently in their roles and Kazinsky especially has nice chemistry with Kebell on screen. Daniel Wu is also thrown into the film as the classic evil manipulative magician-type character. Though the character itself is cliché and has no true backstory or anything (at least not in the film), Wu does play the role well and if it were not for IMDb, I would never have guessed that Wu had played that character. Ruth Negga and Anna Galvin also feature in the film as Lady Taria, Wrynn's wife, Lothar's brother, and queen of Azeroth, and Draka, Durotan's wife respectively. The two are really just shoehorned into the movie to make Wrynn and Durotan more relatable (I guess) and serve no purpose but to be wives, and although Draka especially gets a few moments to shine, she is? despite significant screen time? absolutely forgettable. Negga's acting in the film is depressingly and cringe-inducing wooden, while Galvin's was a little more believable, but was still to a certain degree weak due to the lack of emotion she put into the character. And finally? because I'm tired of writing about these dull character? Callum Keith Rennie plays Moroes, Medivh's assistant (maybe). The character is never really explained and although having a significant handful of scenes with Medivh I have no clue why he was in the film or what his relationship was with Medivh. But despite all that I can still point out the fact that Rennie's acting (like countless other's) was uncomfortably wooden and he seemed to put no effort whatsoever into making the dialogue believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many characters, bad acting, lacklustre plot, no character depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(I labelled this 'Contains Spoilers' but I am not mentioning anything in particular. Someone might disagree so I figured safety first.) I grew up playing Warcraft II and III extensively. When I heard a Warcraft film was in the making I thought this to be a good thing. There was so much material to draw from. So I went to see it at my local Cineworld on the opening day (30 May here in the UK).Sadly the film does not deliver. With so many characters to keep track of and so little time for them all, I found that I didn't really care about the fates of any of them. It didn't help that two characters looked very similar and it was hard to tell them apart.Then there was the acting. Ye Gods. I imagine this might pick up a few Razzie nominations. One particular line was so woodenly delivered I thought I was watching the Phantom Menace.The plot was simple enough but because they were leapfrogging from character to character it didn't really have a chance to truly get interesting. For this film to do its characters justice it would need to have been six hours long.They should have stripped away maybe eight or nine of the 12 main characters and focused on them. Plot is character. Character is plot. This was drummed into me in university. If you want us to care about the characters then give us time to see them fail, win, live, love. With one a few to focus on you can then develop the plot. Throw some emotion in there. They want to go the serious route? Fine. Make it serious then. But give us things to care about. Show us some character depth. Don't just throw a bunch of characters and names at us, expecting us to be so 'wowed' (no pun intended) that we forget that we're really just watching a mediocre advert for World of Warcraft. Because that's what it felt like.Why am I being so critical of a film about orcs and humans? Why can't I just give it a 10 because I loved playing the games? Because I loved playing the games. See, when you really like something you want it to be as good as it can be when they do a film based on it later. Also, despite a few mediocre jokes the film wanted to go the 'serious' route. So I have to treat it seriously. And not go into 'fanboy mode' and give it a 10/10. Because this is not a 10/10 film.Maybe it's all the Marvel films' fault, going in with a huge amount of characters. Somehow they pull it off, though. Warcraft didn't. They say 'go big or go home' but in this case they should've started off with something smaller. There are enough fans for this to make a profit. I don't know if they should make a second one, though. Because if this first one is so bad but makes money, I don't think they'll learn from this mistake. They don't care about making a good Warcraft film. But that's the industry's problem in general and a debate for another day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WarcraftAfter being a fan of the game, and having read a lot of the Novels on the lore it was kinda expected that I would go watch Warcraft the movie. Did I have a lot of hopes? Not really, they normally always find a way to butcher a game movie. In fact that's always been the case where games and movies don't match that well. This movie was not that different from my expectations. The acting was really bad, the script was really bad, the sequence was really bad. The Lore was sub par as far as the story went, in fact it was distributed by Blizzard so they had to get that part right. But the casting was poorly done, and the actors don't portray the lore that well. The only good part about this movie was really the effects, which I have to say was spectacular. The visuals were very well done, the CGI was very realistic, I mean you can tell the bulk of the budget went in the visuals and not the actors.I would recommend this movie to fans of the game still, it's worth a least 1 watch even if it wasn't that good. I would not recommend it to anyone who's never played the game. The story is fast paste on the lore which expects the audience to already know a background of who people all.I give Warcraft a 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I thought, yet still...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I even get started: Yes, I have played the games. I actually did play all WC-games, starting in the mid 90s, and have been playing WOW on and off ever since 2005. So, with that said, I was a bit worried about the movie when I saw the trailers, as a lot of the stuff looked very artificial and even cheap. Don't get me wrong, the CGI is pretty damn good, and you can see how much motion capture etc. has advanced. However, it falls apart for me whenever one of the really good-looking orcs (as in: great CGI) are in the same scene as humans. Once that happens, it starts to look very artificial. Actually, the riding-wolves the orcs use look artificial in EVERY scenery, regardless of who else is in the frame. It's not their size, it's that they look really bad. Also, some of the makeup looked pretty bad too. When I first saw the elves, I was rather amused, even though we only got a quick look at them, as their ears looked totally cheesy and artificial, especially the color. It looked like bad cos-play ears. Well, of course, it's hard to pull it off, so let's get to the other parts: - The acting. I didn't enjoy the acting. There was almost no vibe at all between the actors. Some overacting happened (Wide-open stare of Lothar, who totally looks on the edge all the time. Yes, he tragically lost his son, but it was tiring). - The plot/setting. Yes, they have a lot of story to set up, as they apparently really want to make sequels. However, what was the goal here? Was this supposed to get new fans for the franchise, introduce people who have never played the games to the world of Azeroth? Why then have such a convoluted plot and such a huge cast, with so many things (Medivh being possessed etc) being unexplained. I can't even imagine how confusing some of this must have been for people who don't know any WC-story.Was this supposed to be fan-service? Why then change so many things, have so many inconsistencies? I don't doubt that some of the changes to the lore might have been an attempt to create a better story. However, if you want to satisfy fans... they do NOTICE when you change things too much. Why is Dalaran flying? This didn't happen until much later. Why does Stormwind look like it did after it was rebuilt after the orcs actually razed it?So much of it seemed forced... the Murloc-sound might make some people smile, but it was like "OK, let's just throw everything in there, all these innuendos and clues! Oh, and let's plaster the Kirin Tor icon EVERYWHERE"- The dialogue was... ridiculous- The love-scene/love-story. Gee, yeah, The Hobbit showed me that it apparently is totally and absolutely impossible to make a movie without a love-story thrown in. Regardless of what happens, someone has to fall in love with someone, no matter how forced or silly it looks. So the little love-story here feels much too forced, develops much too quickly (well, at least that part is over quickly) and just is not needed. It's like they went through the checklist and went "OK, love-story, done!"- The music... what happened? I did actually listen to the score by itself as well, because it does not stand out at all in the movie, I hardly noticed there was music there, it was that bland... and not only does it sound rushed, with way too many repetitions, it also sounds like a sample-library-MIDI-score from about the late 90s. I have heard B-movies with a better-sounding and better-produced score. - The armor. Yeah, I know, WOW is well_known for ridiculous armor, its like a big inside jokes. Gigantic shoulderpieces etc. However, that's not the point here. The armor here looks ridiculous, like plastic with a tiny bit of gloss on it. It looks cheap. I heard some guys from WETA were involved here and I imagine that going like this: "Hey guys, so you make a fantasy movie? So OK, here is how you make armor, this is how you make it look a bit worn-in, here is to make it look like something smithed by hand and having been used" Reply: "Oh cool. Yeah. We don't have the time/patience/workforce/money for this, so let's make some casts, pour plastic into those, done". I was almost reminded of the props in movies like Flash Gordon seeing some of the plate armor in here.- The movie takes itself much too seriously. We all know that WC and WOW always had some silliness to it, that's part of it. And the slapstick-like little bits with Lothar and Khadgar were not like that. The only FUN scene was the hyper-aggressive gryphon in the end, when that went to work on the orcs in the background while Lothar again was over-acting in the foreground. - I didn't care at all about what happened to these people. Everything was so rushed, so crammed, so it was hard to feel anything when someone died. I know that the "this movie has no warmth/no heart" is criticized as something critics use when they have nothing else bad to say or whatever. However, I have played these games and still love them, I have spent so much time in Azeroth, have read and experienced these stories. And to me, this movie feels dull, bland, cold, overstuffed, badly paced, badly written, badly scored, rushed and undecided whom it wants to be for. It's not quite as bad as I thought when I saw the trailers, but a 4/10 isn't exactly awesome, and it gets those points because you can tell they actually tried to do well...but IMO failed.</fullReview>

I'll try to look at this movie from the point of view of a long time Warcraft player as well as someone who might be unfamiliar with the source material.The movie is edited badly, there is no real sense of time lapse in it. The characters are all over the world within minutes between each scene and it causes an unrealistic presentation of how large the world actually is and how fast these characters can travel from one place to another. While the movie wanted to keep the focus on many different characters at the same time, they could have made a slower and more realistic approach where some events could have simply been mentioned rather than presented.The CGI is great, however it only looks great next to other CGI. Inexperienced viewers won't notice this much, however the CGI definitely stands out when real objects come into scene such as the actors. For the most part they've done a great job at making it all look as real as possible, but towards the end when there is a orc vs human battle in front of the dark portal, it got a bit sloppy.The acting appeared to be "okay" for the most part, however the person who plays Khadgar definitely had some issues. He never seems quiet into it and comes across pretty self aware.The aesthetic of the movie tries to copy the game nearly 100%. It's subjective whether this is a good or a bad thing, but I did not think it was a good decision. In a movie, the ridiculous and silly objects such as house sized anvils and shoulder armor twice as big as the wearers head looks the way they should, very very silly. They might have kept the style yet tried to make it seem a bit more grounded to decrease the silliness of it all. Though this is subjective.The fight between Medivh and the others are, to put it simply, clumsy. It was sloppy and wasn't the fight the story deserved. With Khadgar and Lothar playing around with the silly clay monster and Medivh just walking around chanting. It might have been best for them to stick to the actual story where Medivh puts an aging curse on Khadgar and gets stabbed through the chest, causing the demon Sargeras to slowly emerge and get it's head chopped off. It is simpler and more direct. The way it is in the movie was simply too silly.Generally speaking, the best parts of the movie were those of the interactions within the Orc society. The drama was there, the struggle was there and most of the development was there also. The same care was absent from the human side of the story, having a very forced and unemotional death scene for Lothar's son as well as an awkwardly revealed secret of Medivh's possession. No matter my opinion, it appears the movie is set to have a sequel, and hopefully they will address most of these issues. Personally I would try to reduce the silliness aspect of the aesthetic and try to have there be more focus on the story so the characters don't just jump around so much. Also there should be more explanation for those who are not familiar with the story. A movie can't survive only with fan service.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much potential, so little satisfaction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start by explaining that I am not a fan of comic books, movies made from comic books, nor movies that have a comic book type story, with the utter and complete lack of plausibility in every single scene. I do like magical realism, and fantasy though. This movie had a few good elements. Some of the giants were cool, and the costumes were probably the best part of the movie. But, the movie was so overwrought, so chock full of hundreds of different elements, it would have been nearly impossible for even a top director to bring all of that together. It turned out to be a wish mash, a jumble of elements. Toward the last 45 minutes it was nearly entirely incoherent. I had no idea of who the players were, and it became a tangled mess. At the beginning of the film, I thought there were enough elements, to create a satisfying story. At the end of the film, my two friends and myself all looked at each other, and felt the same way.There were several occasions during the last hour that I was compelled to walk out. The only reason I stayed, is that I am currently overseas, in a location with few theaters, and few English films available.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The epic battle at the center of "Warcraft" isn't the clash between humans and orcs. That's just what takes up roughly two hours of screen time. The true conflict comes from filmmakers trying to tell a story with soul and struggling against the inherent ridiculousness of the movie. Despite the noble effort of director Duncan Jones, who helmed the lower- budget sci-fi wonders "Moon" and "Source Code" , Warcraft just couldn't save itself from its unconventional and poor story tale.With its meticulously detailed realms built out primarily on soundstages and enhanced via CGI during extensive post-production, "Warcraft" aims for fresh and eye-popping and yet ends up shopworn and rather tacky. I am totally disappointed by Duncan Jones 'Warcraft'. I would give 1.5/5 for this heartless movie without any soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah so ill receive many glares at this review but i can only be honest with my opinion here. Having watched this movie and upon ending seeing hundreds of people around me applaud it left me in total bemusement! Perhaps i was over expecting for this movie but besides the really well made CGI, i was left in utter disappointment. I mean, how can we as movie lovers and somewhat "part time critics" actually completely ignore that this movie was not well made?? I get that we're lovers of Warcraft and its massive franchise as well as having been so attached to its characters for so many years just as i have been, but to say that the movie was brilliant is absolutely misguided to the fact that the acting was one of the worst i have ever seen in any movie ever made. Not only that but there was little to no thought at all put behind fight scenes. Did we all watch the same movie or am i missing something here? Surely fight choreography could have been taken seriously? Having spent loads of money on CGI why not add a little diversity to a battle? Whoever swung a sword first would defeat his opponent...zero blocking, zero shields used...why did any of them have shields anyway?? Scenes were rushed in and rushed out, the rookie Madge was so badly played by someone who can barely act. Please re-watch the movie and look at his facial expressions or even his acting skills for goodness sake! This disappoints me because it was like "okay we're going into this movie and we're just going to love it because its Warcraft and we've been waiting for this all our lives". Give me a break! The potential this movie had for so much more is crazy and yet we all turn a blind eye to what matters most about a movie spectacle all because we're thinking emotionally. Sorry but i enjoy watching a well made movie and this movie was far from well made. #notsorry</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did I miss the post-showing brief?! Little exposition leaves non-WoW playing viewers in the lurch; characters, locations and the very crux on the film ? the Fell ? are given very little explanation of base-building. "Our world has been destroyed" feels cheap and lazy for the whole Horde-invading premise. This poor foundation made the remainder of the film totally uninteresting to me. The CGI is classically Blizzard-esque and the Orc scenes and settings are the best in the film ? character design is colourful and engaging ? they all look different. However, the same cannot be said for the Humans ? beards are dyed and have such well-groomed demarcation images of the Berlin wall are conjured. Their sets feel unlived-in, clinical and tacky in a Stargate SG-1 kind of way. The casting is equally uninspired ? specifically in the plucky mage turned hero ? an entirely average, intellectual-type who I imagine the aforementioned players are expected to relate to. A half-breed predictably attractive and buxom female Orc also seems to play to this demographic. The villain is lame and doesn't scare me or even his Human counterparts. Don't get me wrong, fight scenes and visual effects are certainly high points in what was a drudge in mediocrity, playing far too heavily to its existing fan base.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casting is bad and acting is horrible! Come to think of it, why is Travis Fimmel always acting as a thrift store version of Johnny Depp, even in Vikings? Characters are flat and uninteresting. Everything is happening way too fast! Things that would otherwise need ages to happen, happen in just one or two sentences. Didn't bond with any of the characters, as the matter of fact, got annoyed by most of them. Clichés and tropes all around the movie, and i mean that in a bad way.Been playing Warcraft since my early childhood, than started WoW and i really loved the entire universe and story, to some extent... And i got this movie?Truth to be told, I would recommend watching it, but only for the visuals and overall spectacle, but the movie in general is not good at all... the real value of the movie will be visible once the hype river runs dry...PS When i left the cinema, i felt a bit angry.

		<fullReview>From the hype-machine that brought you "Avatar", the species that brought you George Bush 1, 2 and 3, and the consumer indices that made glow-in-the-dark tampons a thing, comes Duncan Jones' "Warcraft", a high-fantasy film based on a high-fantasy video game based on high-fantasy films and novels."Warcraft" opens with a human soldier circling an orc warrior. What initially seems like an unconventionally patient action sequence quickly degenerates into stupidity as the two warriors suddenly charge at one another. The orc wins; he's a giant humanoid with massive biceps and a mighty hammer. We're then introduced to an orc named Durotan. Chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan, Durotan pledges allegiance to Gul'dan, a green-skinned shaman who is also a REALLY BAD VILLAIN. Gul'dan plans to use his SUPER POWERS to do BAD STUFF. This BAD STUFF includes STEALING ENERGY FROM NICE PEOPLE, creating a BIG ARMY, and turning the beautiful land of Azeroth into a SICKLY HELL-HOLE. Gul'dan's powers include mixed martial arts, green laser beams, soul-sucking hand waves and PAINFULLY DULL MOVIE VILLAIN DIALOGUE.Duncan then takes us to Azeroth, where we're introduced to various human characters. These include Commander Anduin (Travis Fimmel), King Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), Guardian Medivh (Ben Foster) and a young wizard named Khadgar (Ben Schenetzer). All are generic white dudes with cumbersome names, designer facial hair, bad dialogue and the finest muscles four-months of intense cardiovascular can buy."Warcraft's" second act watches as our human heroes fumble about, desperately hoping to uncover the nature of Gul'dan's plan. As we the audience know what this plan is, as the plan is cartoonishly silly, and as our heroes spend most of their time in dreary libraries and chambers, all these scenes feel painfully dull. Compare to Miyazaki's "Princess Mononoke", a similar fantasy flick in which exposition is cunningly disgorged."Warcraft's" first major action sequence occurs at the twenty four minute mark. Here a band of humans are attacked in a CGI forest by CGI orcs. It's a routine sequence, filled with the usual hack and slashing, growling, stabbing, light-shows and silly action-movie-poses. We're then introduced to Garona (Paula Patton), a half human, half orc. A cliché in such adventure films, Garona exists to bridge divides between Man and Other. She leads the humans to an icy valley in which Anduin and Durotan negotiate a war-treaty. Unfortunately these negotiations are interrupted by Gul'dan's forces, whose arrival instigates the film's second major action sequence. Occurring at the 58 minute mark, it climaxes with Anduin's son dying as Anduin watches helplessly behind an energy shield. Recalling Qui-Gon-Jin's death in "Phantom Menance", or Spock's in "Wrath of Khan", this Big Emotional Moment reeks of cynical reverse engineering.More dull dialogue and pseudo-political manoeuvrings occur, in scenes which play like a cross between "John Carter of Mars" and a perpetually buffering Youtube video. These scenes include a trip to a manna-pool, a "conversation about love", hokey teleportation devices, irate griffins, and a journey to Dalaran, a floating city in which a powerful sorceress (Glenn Close) is kept in a maximum security prison because she knows the truth about stuff the audience doesn't really care about."Warcraft" then ends with one of cinema's most cumbersome action movie climaxes. Whilst orcs and humans battle to the death, our human heroes perform an exorcism on a possessed wizard. These "exciting" sequences have no sense of style, tension or rhythm. Lacking originality, interesting tactics or psychological clashes, they largely involve hundreds of CGI characters yelling, hack-and-slashing or lunging inanely at one another. Compare to the large scale battles in Kurosawa's "Ran", the climax to Michael Mann's "Last of the Mohicans" and of course Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies, which offered a blend of adventure, Olympian seriousness and slap-stick silliness. Duncan's film, in contrast, is solemn and one-note to a fault.Despite its 160 million dollar budget, "Warcraft's" vistas and visions are mostly unconvincing. Its orcs live in uncanny valley, with dead eyes and goofy tusks which better art designers would have reworked. The film's cities, forests, mountains and tribal encampments look similarly generic and/or cartoonish. And like most high-fantasy films, the fact that we're positioned to root for feudalistic monarchs and thuggish warlords isn't questioned; in the grand scheme of things, Gul'dan's no more a jerk than the film's supposed heroes."Warcraft" ends with several of its major characters perishing, a bit of audience-contempt designed to set up future sequels. It was financed by Legendary Pictures, one of the first production companies exclusively set up by hedge fund managers, private equity firms, banksters and big Chinese conglomerates; the far East being the modern blockbuster's new El Dorado."Warcraft" was based on a series of real-time strategy games by Blizzard Entertainment, in which players harvest wood and minerals and slowly build little forest enclaves. A better film would have devoted its running time to such bucolic resource gathering and simple community building. Compared to Duncan's vision, 120 minutes of orc manual labour sounds like bliss. Work! Work! 3/10 ? Needs more woodcraft. Worth no viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have two thing to say right off. Me and my 11 year old only made it through about 15 minutes of this before we both agreed to leave. And 2) I was one of the biggest LOTR fans ever out there (books and movies), and the little I saw of this was total dreck. So PLEASE don't say gee man if you liked (the exquisitely grounded) LOTR well you're sure to like this. NOT. The best stories dealing with complex worlds start you out with a relatable character and go real slow, they add one piece at a time. This one throws you into an unpleasant setting and expects you to know everything right off the bat. It has the feel of manufactured substance when in fact this movie looked to me to be without much substance at all. Some of the scenes are impressive in Imax (the only way this was offered on premier, probably another tell on its quality), but that isn't nearly enough for me. I need a character I can relate to and a story I can understand and enjoy. There was a lot about this that reminded me of the dreadful Strange Magic, I think on that one we lasted about 5 minutes more than on this. I'm not saying there isn't an audience for this movie, I'm just saying I loved LOTR and liked Star Wars and I had no interest in watching another single minute of whatever this was supposed to be. Also note in the short time there there were scenes which troubled my 11 year old, and the Imax was way too loud for him. So my vote is save your hard-earned money for something else. I also must say that the chorus of positive IMDb reviews for this movie are just not believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft: The Beginning Movie Review (SPOILER FREE)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft: The Beginning is directed and co-written by Duncan Jones. It stars Travis Fimmel, Toby Kebbell, Ben Foster and Paula PattonWhat's it all about then?The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilization faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonize another. As a portal opens to connect the two worlds, one army faces destruction and the other faces extinction. From opposing sides, two heroes are set on a collision course that will decide the fate of their family, their people, and their home.What are my thoughts?Serving very much as a passion project for Duncan Jones who is widely known as a huge fan of the source material, Warcraft serves as the British director's third feature length movie, with Moon (2009) and Source Code (2011) proceeding this movie.Warcraft also hopes to end the nearly twenty year running streak of by-and-large horrendous video game adaptations. Therefore the movie-going public is looking to either this or Assassin's Creed (December) to wipe the slate clean. Warcraft as an IP has an immense worldwide following of millions, I have never played the game and know nothing about the mythology, so I was going in as a "Newbie". As a result I felt a little bit short changed, I wouldn't say I was baffled by the proceedings, knowing the above premise is pretty much all I needed to know, what's more being a huge fan of Peter Jackson's middle earth masterpiece trilogy certainly stood me in good stead. However, The Lord of the Rings though - this is not, it really tries hard to be and each scene by Jones is lovingly crafted but it just does not resonate on anywhere near the same level. Visually though, Warcraft is impressive, and at times stunning. No more so than the mo cap work of Toby Kebbell as Duratan (My favourite character). We really are starting to enter a new era as regards what can be achieved on screen. The humans are a mixed bag, Travis Fimmel as Lothar, Warcraft's answer to Aragorn and Ben Schnetzer as a trainee wizard are probably my favourite. They at least go some way to offer levity in what is at times given some plot twists a pretty grim movie. Paula Patton as Garona is good as well. Ben Foster is miscast though, as Medivh the protector of Azeroth, they needed a much older actor to pull off the Gandalf-esque part. Finally, Dominic Cooper of all people phones in a wooden performance as Azeroth's King. The story and dialogue is without question the Achilles heel of the movie. It seems to cram a huge amount of protagonists and story strands into a fleeting two hours. It clearly places itself as a franchise set up movie, but let's hope, (Given the general reaction thus far to the movie) Jones gets a chance to tell us the middle and end.When you have been spoilt on an amazing trilogy such as The Lord of the Rings which is based on a critically acclaimed and beloved book, any movie maker that dare set foot on even similar ground does so at his own risk.If you are a fan of the game, you will of course no doubt appreciate the movie on a completely different level as I hear there are Easter eggs galore for those who know where to look. So after all this does it wipe the slate clean? Based on the movie itself, no but given the passion behind the camera I would say at least the director of this movie cared about the source material, and tried his best and for that yes it does. Let's just hope therefore that if the studio green lights any subsequent instalments, the story is on par with the visuals. Personally though, I would say that if you are a fan of the game check it out, but if you are new to this world such as I, then just stay at home and watch The Lord of The Rings - the real thing.</fullReview>

At one point the Humans built some sort of Clay Man that came alive and started attacking them??Did not remember anyone's name by the endOn a positive note, The Orcs looked amazing, I rooted for them the entire way, because the humans where so disappointing and confusing.Also Disappointed in the lack of comedy, could of been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why can't I skip this cutscene!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three stars is being generous, mostly for the nice special effects and keeping to the game aesthetics. I can appreciate the good even in a dismal disaster of a movie like this.First of all, every single actor brought their B-game and failed miserably. When you're trying to act, and a CGI orc is expressing more emotion than you, you are a failure. Travis Fimmel as Lothar came across more as a twitchy junkie with a lot of sass, rather than a stern and battle-hardened warrior. No matter what line he was delivering, he would get crazy eyes and start weaving his head around, kind of like a ghetto chick ready to throw down with another ghetto chick. Ben Schnetzer as Khadgar looks like he just got hazed at his local fraternity, and needs to shave that pathetic pedo-stache immediately. Ben Foster, who is usually pretty awesome in movies, must have been on buckets of xanax to sleepwalk through this movie and get his check. Even Paula Patton had nothing to do, trying to act confident and independent, only to be dressed up in rags and chains and saved by big strong white men every few seconds. Yikes, could they have made the racial undertones any more obvious?Now that we've gotten most of the awful, unmemorable characters out of the way, let's move onto the plot. The bad guys' motivations come down to, "Felfire made me do it." Magical evil makes normal people evil, because the plot needs evil people. How typical. Meanwhile, the good guys are only good because everyone around them acts like morons in comparison. Durotar is the savior of the orcs and sides with the humans, because apparently he's the only dude who thinks a life- sucking warlock with glowing green eyes and bone-spikes growing from his back might not be such a nice guy after all.You will expect every single plot beat before it happens. Oh, the main character's son is a soldier and wants to make his father proud? Yeah we know how that's gonna end up, no spoilers required. Big showdown between the hero and his nemesis? Forget imaginative choreography, let's just repeat the fight between Johnny Cage and Goro, because people loved that movie right? I think there were actually two brief moments that surprised me, a total of about 2 minutes in the 2 hour run time. For the rest of the 118 minutes, it was tedious and predictable.Speaking of choreography, while the fight scenes look impressive, there is nothing happening in them. There is no ingenuity, no creativity, nothing. When it comes time for a powerful warlock to fight an orc chieftain, they just thrown down fists. I understand it's tradition, but the warlock never shows off any other skills besides "Drain Life." Gul'dan is the casul player who spams a single attack because they're braindead. What happened to Shadowbolt, DoTs, or summons? Mages are either shooting blue balls, surrounding themselves in blue balls, or teleporting in a blue ball. What happened to Blink, Fire and Ice spells? The magic is the most unimaginative part of this entire movie, which is an absolute shame since it could have been a real strong point.The only good thing this movie has going for it is looks. It looks good, the motion capture is great, and it doesn't have a washed out monochrome color scheme like most blockbusters these days. I appreciate the aesthetics of the armor and locations, geography, and creatures, but without any emotion or soul behind all the pretty stuff, it just feels empty. This movie is like an empty suit of decorative armor on a pedestal, it serves no purpose but to look nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect for a fan, but not "a Good Movie" at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film excels in money making cause it is suitable as a franchise to satisfy fans. Great green-screen scenery, imaginative static frames and camera work (1 star). Cast was also fine: none expected any kind of acting in game-based movies. Ben Foster and Travis Fimmel overacted but it worked out fine after all. I liked CGI and the make-up job at some point (not elven tho, they were horribly designed). For instance, discolorations on faces in various scenes were on point (2 stars). All of this do make a good wrapper to sell stuff.Positive signs had been destroyed by some "A-movie criteria" which are almost non-existent here. There are tons of questions about villains motivation. Of course you can guess about "moving factors" of global events. But no character motivation actually is explained, scene just happened and you are obviously left to wait for another part to figure all the reasons. That's not how you make a good movie, even franchised one. See "Lord of the Rings" on how this problem can be solved in fantasy genre. Director also abandoned character development for some reason and chose to focus on visuals. And sometimes you feel an overdose on visuals: long shots in action scenes are failed to impress. Particular shots and close-ups of main orks like Durotan are sexy, beautifully made. But all those theatrical props are no use since we have no character development. Cuz nothing can distract a viewer from cheap-looking requisite but a true Warcraft-fan excitement (look at their Ornate Plate and weapon: "Life is plastic, It's fantastic!"). This excitement also supports the weak screenplay. Not even worth mentioning. It feels like the film has no director! Things are happening, ugly elves are talking, useless dwarfs remain useless, characters are dying, but you could not care less about them cause they were not developed and their motivation is primitive yet confusing sometimes.So here you have it: being a fan you don't need all those pesky "good movie attributes". Fans got what they needed. But does it have a creative value? Surely not. It has a commercial value only. It is entertaining here and there but not worth your money unless you are strongly addicted to "Warcraft" universe. Too much money and effort and time were invested in "Warcraft" to make another meaningless spectacle. And none cares if it's "the best of the worst" game-based film, it is still bad and looks poorly written. Maybe later they'll make something deeper out of it, but not now. Sorry. Next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>comparable to the Shannara Chronicles, this is just plain bad. Acting, script, characterizations... as with many movies in the end it's just a boring CGI show, which makes no sense whatsoever. No humor, bad action sequences, nothing is comprehensible - it just feels like a senseless collection of scenes with slightly the same theme. I think no one even cared about it making sense a little bit or about continuity.The design, while true to the games which I like btw., doesn't fit the big screen in any way. It's just plain ridiculous.To the people, who seem to think, they must defend their beloved franchise by ignoring the failure of this movie: even as a WC fan you don't need to like this to be a true fan, you know? It's not heresy to be critical when something is as obviously bad as this adaption. Just think about, what would have been possible with some film making skills involved</fullReview>

It's a visual opera, that is right, and the story is very original, that is right too. But the jumps in the story, and the torrent of information (too much) that the characters tell you in form of dialogues (that for some reason we should understand), it's what really kills this film. The Orc's story line it's awesome, but the human's story line is lame. They had 2 hours to develop and make the public understand what was going on, but they chose to rush in the critical parts that make the story understandable. They don't explain anything, they just keep moving the story forward and you are supposed to understand everything... The only story line that I got 100% is the orcs, and it's just awesome. The rest... I didn't get a thing. Terrible writing. I can't wait to see the Blue Ray version, though. But this film is not an 8 stars, no F**ING way.It's a 6 but I thing I have to balance the current rating so I'll go for a 2, just to compensate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Duncan Jones is a fabulous film maker. His first two movies, Moon and Source Code were both chock full of flair, style, and panache.......much like his father.This however, is a total product of the studio, but if you look close enough, just past the dead eyes of the Orcs, you can just make out some of Jones' presence surrounding the film.After realising that their home is becoming uninhabitable, a race of orcs travel to the land of Azeroth. There, they encounter the realm's human inhabitants, who fight back against the invaders. In time, an orc warrior forges an alliance with a group of humans in order to overthrow his race's corrupt leader and bring peace to the land........Oh the film looks impressive, the special effects are second to none, but my gosh, the rest of the film is confusing mess of lore and characters that just seem to come out of the book of game to movie cliché.To sum it up, it's like a few extras from The Last Temptation Of Christ have teamed up with the Hulks hippy relatives, and need to overthrow something from Guardians of the Galaxy, but a lot less fun.So it's a case of big money spent on what seems like never ending battles, Cooper saying to Paula Patton, 'kill me and all will be well', Ben Foster doing his obligatory bad guy routine (the best thing about this sorry mess), and of course, the really awkward humour that just about peppers the odd scene every now and again.I don't think that it matters that I've never played WoW, but I can well imagine that two hours on that would be more forfillng than having to sit through this dreck again.Honestly, if it was camp, and didn't take itself as serious as it did, it could have been something.Another expensive bore-fest.Don't hold your breath for the sequel....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A forgettable flick that's everything I don't particularly like about Warcraft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I was expecting much from the movie, but I at least anticipated that the CGI would look even better than the cinematics from the campaigns of Blizzard's popular game series. It did not. Maybe the detail and resolution was higher, but if so, it was heightened at the cost of the lively playfulness in the designs of the games. You can either make a movie look realistic or marvelously unreal - this was neither.The pacing also felt off from the get-go... there was no time to settle with any characters. No time to build a mood. Awkward and predictable dialogue, weird cutting between scenes and unnecessarily many "character - learns - terrible - news - looks - up - to - the - skies - and - goes - "my...God!"-types of shots. It didn't need to have ended up this way, considering how long this project has been underway.Blizzard have always been very keen on borrowing elements of lore and character design from other fantasy leviathans - Warhammer, LOTR, Starship troopers or whatever it might be, but they always do so thoroughly and with both inspiration and cheekiness. This movie didn't have much of either. It tried, and at times achieved the "charming cheesiness"-level of the Star Wars franchise, but I think I prefer to remember the story of the first invasion of Azeroth the way it was told through the original game series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the worst film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that this film currently has a 7.5/10 on IMDb genuinely astonishes me. What we have here is what you get when a film is made by a group with a good budget and absolutely no idea how to make movie.The scenes are short and disjointed, so much so that comprehending the story line is like being on a speeding train, trying to observe the passing landscape through a hole the size of your fist. Blizzard's story telling has always been shoddy, and this film is no exception.The special effects are inconsistent. Yeah, the orcs look pretty cool, but so many other effects look as cheap as the guy next door's LARP costume (the night elves standout in my memory as horrendous.)I'm a long time Warcraft fan (WC2 &#x2192; WC3 &#x2192; WoW,) and the references to the games were so thin that it hurt. This is a film with absolutely no subtly. Yeah, that's the murloc sound. Hilarious.Over the course of two hours, there were very few redeeming qualities. For the most part, it was an absolute affront to the senses and sensibilities. Anyone who appreciates a film for its writing and cinematographic qualities should avoid this film like the plague, or risk being enraged and offended at the butchery Warcraft does to these arts.If I wasn't with friends I would have walked out of the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw an advanced screening last night, and was terribly disappointed. A little background on me: I've played every major Warcraft release, and dedicated years to WoW. I'm not new to the history and lore of the Warcraft universe. That being said, the writing in this film is awful. I don't care about changes from the source material. The issues in the script were dialogue, plot holes, and scenes that existed for no plausible reason. Also, the humans in this film are sub par at best in acting. Sadly, it seems all the talent was used on the orc side, hidden behind mountains of cg. Speaking of, the only two compliments I can give to this film are that it was beautiful to look at, and the soundtrack was impressive. Whether you are an old hand at the universe or completely new to it, avoid this movie. I saw it for free and still regretted wasting the 2 hours I spent watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Warcraft server match is more entertaining than this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected much from this game-based film as gaming friends have been raving about how good WOW's story lines and character arcs are. Top it off with a trailer that excites, I decided to spend 2 hour debunking film's history of disappointing gaming story lines.I have no idea where to begin except to warn non-gamers that if you know nothing of Warcraft, the hit MMORPG game, avoid this film at all cost. So, let just pinpoint the proof that this film deserves its 22% on Rotten Tomatoes.Firstly, the film does its story-boarders at Blizzard Gaming zero justice here. What gamer friends have hailed as one of the best story lines in modern gaming (*now I seriously doubt its validity) prove nothing more than a basic war and politics flicks that confuses.Moreover, the plot seem to consistently be iconic movie sequences pieced together haphazardly. In all fairness, the film's writers tried to create character arcs around several main characters, but many of these were poorly executed to the point that plot holes became unnecessarily obvious.Secondly, casting felt like a huge mismatch. Humans interacting with orcs in the film felt more like ugly overgrown neanderthals speaking to the modern men of evolution. Fight sequences felt dry and predictable largely thanks to lacking realism in the voice acting. This was of course made worse by the fact that I became bored to death that all those droning of "history". For me, it was bizarre since Legendary Pictures is known for casting lesser known stars in lead roles that thrust them into the spotlight. (Don't believe me? Look at Christian Bale in the Dark Knight trilogy, Henry Cavill in Superman's remakes and Chris Pratt in Jurassic World)That said, there is one tiny salvaging moment for this film and that's the CGI war scenes. The zoomed out camera pans reminded me of some of the gaming footage I've watched off global WOW competition and therefore looks awesome on the big screen. Quite honestly, I'd rather watch a proper WOW competition match for the same amount of time and zero cost. Coming from a dude who refuses to play Warcraft, WOW competition has more excitement and unpredictability than this poor execution of game-based movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Warcraft and all the games and a big fan of epic fantasy cinema. But this film misses the mark and seems like it was made without any idea of what actually makes a story engaging. The opening scene is the only time I felt engaged in this movie, bringing shivers to my spine inspiring nostalgia of dueling in front of Orgrimmar. Yet the intertextuality of that experience is one that is exclusive to only those who actually played World of Warcraft. The entire movie must look like a completely incoherent mess to anyone who doesn't share that experience. Every scene after that demolishes any hope I had of this being an enjoyable experience. It's obvious that a ton of hard work went into this film from many talented artists, technicians, and professionals, but the truth is no matter how much lipstick you put on a pig...http://www.pcgamer.com/warcraft-movie-review/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the world of the Orcs Draenor is being destroyed by the evil fel magic that uses life-force, the powerful warlock Gul'dan creates a portal to the world of Azeroth and forms the Horde with members of the Orc clans. He also captures many prisoners to keep the portal. The king of Azeroth Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and his brother-in-law Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) are informed by the apprentice of magician Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) that he has found fel magic in dead bodies and the king decides to summon the Guardian of Tirisfal Medivh (Ben Foster) to protect his kingdom. Lothar and Khadgar head Kharazhan to meet Medivh and a shadow points a book to Khagdar and he takes it and hides. Anduin, Khadgar and Medivh and a group of soldiers are attacked by Orcs and they capture the slave Garona (Paula Patton), who is released by King Llane, and she shows the location of the portal. Garona is contacted by the Orc chief of a clan Durotan that wants to meet King Llane to stop the fel magic. Meanwhile Khadgar learns that the gate was opened with the help of someone in Azeroth. Shall King Lllane trust on Garona and Durotan? Whi might be the traitor? "Warcraft" is a highly entertaining fantasy film with an abrupt beginning without development of the situation and characters. Most of the characters are unpleasant and non-charismatic. Maybe the fans of the video game have a big picture of Draenor and Azeroth. But the special effects are top-notch and the story is not bad. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Warcraft: O Primeiro Encontro de Dois Mundos" ("Warcraft: The First Encounter of Two Worlds")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this story of orcs vs humans, the audiences lose out whether they know it or not. If this is a "passion project" for Duncan Jones, and I can believe that it is, he has some damn nerdy, generic passions. And just because you may immerse yourself in a game doesn't mean you can immerse yourself the same way in a film, and tone matters so much in this kind of instance.I confess that about 75/80 minutes in I was tempted to walked out (I stuck it through but nodded off near the end). It wasn't going to get any better, and it probably wouldn't get much worse, but damn if I was going to let me and my wife's dinner plans wait any longer through this dribble. Suffice to say I feel confident in saying I saw the movie even if I didn't see it until the credits rolled. Once you've seen one dumb-lazy ass sequence you've seen them all. The only saving grace here is Ben Foster, and even he is wasted somewhat.and lastly about that it's unfair to compare this to Battlefield Earth, which a few critics have done. That was really entertaining, as horrible and miserable an experience that was/is/will always be, and Warcraft, for how much money and time and effort was put into it by its special effects and make-up crew, isn't. Maybe closer to Dungeons &amp; Dragons from 2000, with the same obsessive interest in nerdom, but at least that (I can't believe I'm giving that film some credit) had the capacity to EXPLAIN certain things, little things that would make elements like magic make some modicum of sense, and an actor going full-hog for so-bad-it's-funny entertainment like Jeremy Irons. Foster comes close but not enough.A unique specimen in Hollywood blockbuster terrain, though nevertheless a wasted one, and I don't know if the extra 40 minutes (excised from the theatrical version) would do much to salvage the mostly wooden acting and fantasy mumbo-jumbo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Video game based movies have a pretty bad track record and has yet to have an adaptation that is critically acclaimed. Is Duncan James' Warcraft: the Beginning the film to end that bad streak? Sadly not as the film has been panned by critics and doesn't get a particularly good review right here either.The visual effects in this film are OK. The CGI looks very similar to Blizzard's cinematic adverts for the World of Warcraft games. The effects are a focus for this film as the fantasy genre demands lots of practical and visual effects for it to work. Although impressing in some shots, the special effects look really fake in other scenes, taking the wow factor out of the World Of Warcraft.The acting is fairly poor. Travis Fimmel's, Paula Patton's, Domonic Cooper's and Ben Foster's performances bring nothing good to the film and their characters are ultimately uninteresting. The film also brings in some kind of young mage who I think is only there to explain to the other characters and the audience whats going on, both in Technical jargon followed by layman's terms. The lack of care I felt towards the films characters is not solely down to the acting as the script doesn't help them much either, not really giving the actors much to work with to some extent. There were attempts to bring a personal touch to these characters such as Lothar's son and Garona's backstory told at a fire place, but these are a too brief to bring any real impact.The films plot to me felt like you needed to have some knowledge of the realm of Azeroth to which the film is set. Being a noob of the WoW world I only understood the plot at its most basic level. The Orc's ruthless dictator steals the souls of people as a source of energy to open up a portal so the orcs can take over the human world. Then generic heroic man leads humans to stop this threat. This feels like a movie made for the fans of the game which it should be. So for fans of the WOW games this is a must see but for novices like myself, maybe not.Overall, Warcraft is an OK movie but is one that you should go in with some knowledge of the game if you want to understand the film better. This is sadly not the film to break the video game to movie adaptation curse. Hopefully the Assassin's Creed movie fairs better. Fingers crossed because I love me some Assassin's Creed.</fullReview>

If it didn't have the 'Warcraft' label attached to it, no one would be rating this garbage anything above 2 stars, let alone even bother seeing it. This movie completely bombed in the US.

		<fullReview>(SPOILER ALERT)If you have read the books from Warcraft universe and played other WarCraft games (especially I, II and their expansions) and if you are a fan of WarCraft's lore - you MUST say away from this movie or it will completely ruin your week. 0/10If your only contact with Warcraft universe was World of WarCraft - then you MUST go to the cinema and watch this. You will love this movie. 10/10 The writer of this movie completely scratched all the lore from the books and games.There is no Gul'dan, the Warlock of the Inner Circle and Destroyer of Dreams - the leader and mastermind of the Shadow Council and chieftain of StormReaver clan. There is just this choleric green old guy with self-control issues and no friends - yeah, and there is no Shadow Council whatsoever (not even Terron Gorefiend or Cho'gall)... In fact, there are no Warlocks and Necrolytes or at least Shamans - only guy using magic on orc side is in fact Gul'dan himself.Well, on the other side, there are changes too. Kirin Tor is probably happy with Medivh, they do seem to trust him. Khadgar is the bad guy here, he got banished. While in the books, it was Khadgar who was sent by the Kirin Tor to spy on Medivh under the pretense of an apprenticeship. In books, Medivh was considered a hardly controlled result of undesirable event when Aegwynn gave guardian's power to her son instead of a chosen person by the Tirisfal Council.Also, there are no priests fighting for StormWind. There is no Alonsus Faol or at least a mention of him or his Holy order of Northshire. I wonder who will set up the Paladin order then (I guess Uther Lightbringer will have a change of occupation and become a dentist instead).In fact, there isn't a heroic battle for StormWind. King Llane dies like a fool in front of a Dark Portal in a touching "self-sacrifice = Garrona please kill me!" scene. Instead of being murdered with his heart cut-out.Don't even get me started on why there isn't Gul'dan's coma after death of Medivh. Why there is no Orgrim Doomhammer's rebellion ending in killing the Shadow Council members (I wonder who will be the Death Knights if there is not Shadow Council). Or why there is no Medivh versus Arcanagos (blue dragon) confrontation.The last and complete fail is the end of the movie in which Lothar stands in StormWind City and yells "For Azeroth and the Alliance!". WTF? There is no Alliance yet! Alliance of Lordaeron was created by King Terenas Menethil II of Lordaeron and Lord Anduin Lothar several years after the destruction of StormWind city!Whoever wrote the script for this movie REALLY hates WarCraft and its lore. Fans of lore, stay away! (SPOILER ALERT)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems to me that most of the "praise" this movie is getting, comes from fans of the online game "World of Warcraft" (or possibly the old Warcraft RTS games, if they are as old as I am). Well, this is one gamer that is going to give the honest truth about how I felt about this awful film. The CGI (which is the only decent thing about it), seemed to be more impressive than the actual story. For those of you who are unfamiliar with any of the Warcraft games, basically the main plot goes like this: A bunch of stupid ugly shrek-like monsters called Orcs, decided to leave their trashy planet (that they ruined), to enter through a portal and ruin a new one. The humans of this new world end up fighting the Orc's, some of the Orc's fight each other. The End. The acting was absolutely terrible, especially from Paula Patton. Every line she recites is completely void of any believable emotion. Ben Schnetzer was not much better.The only joy I got from this film, were the brief moments when they showed some of the areas I remembered from the MMO. "Oh cool there's Stormwind, there's Goldshire, there's Ironforge" etc, but that's because I've played the game! If you are not a fan of "World of Warcraft," don't watch this movie, because there is nothing worthwhile for you. It's just another over-hyped poor excuse for a modern adventure movie, filled with a ton of CGI animation which seems to be more important than having any originality or substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft gains zero experience points for a compelling fantasy movie, but something for amazing effects and battle scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One memory that will last from college was simply passing through my dormitory. Why that? Because most of the open doors became ironic statements when most of the students were at their desks with headphones in as they placed themselves in a fantasy world. This adventure they were a part of was the World of Warcraft. While I've seen it and even saw the episode tribute on South Park, I have never played the online sensation that still remains one of the biggest selling computer games of all time. Like anything popular, Hollywood is going to want to take a shot at it at some point.The issue once again is that Hollywood has a terrible track record for video game movies. Hit-man: Agent 47 and Ratchet and Clank have proved that the material is simply incompliant in a cinematic light. Is it the people making the game? Is the people in front of the camera? It's hard to say, so Blizzard, the company behind World of Warcraft, has taken more a production role to try and ensure a proper adaptation. They've even hired Duncan Jones, the creative genius behind Moon and Source Code. With the game company and a good director in tow, does Warcraft finally crack the video game adaptation problem?We begin in the fictional world of the orcs, Dreanor, where the planet is dying. Several orc clans follow the direction Gul'dan (played by Daniel Wu) and his magic through a portal that leads them into Durotan, the world of the humans. One of the orcs that made it, Durotan (played by Toby Kebbell) joins Gul'dan's war band as they raid several villages to take the land in their name. The humans of this world are a part of a medieval kingdom as run by King Llane Wrynn (played by Dominic Cooper).Top knight commander Sir Anduin Lothar (played by Travis Fimmel) does his best to strategize against the bigger orcs which prove to be a bigger problem then anticipated. He starts to work with a mage (magical person) Khadgar (played by Ben Schnetzer) who consult the guardian wizard Medivh (played by Ben Foster). They gain their first clue when they can trace bits of the magic that the orcs have been using. While scouting, they encounter a half-orc woman Ganrona (played by Paula Patton) whose caught in the middle of this invasion. Meanwhile, Khadgar is questioning the intentions of Gul'dan as both sides face each other for the first time.Did you get all of that? I hope so, because Warcraft spews A LOT of fantasy elements that I assume are from the source material. I'll take a wild guess that the movie follows the game very closely, because this made me feel like the guy coming to a comic shop trying to eves drop on a bigger group of fans trying to understand what their talking about. The problem here is definitely the script that has trouble trying to create some history and understanding of the orcs. This seems like the best thing would to have simply made the villains evil.Now what's interesting is that the orcs are the best element in Warcraft. The motion-capture and CGI is some of the best I've seen. They way the skin tones react to the light really make you forget your watching animated characters. The story of orc Durotan was the most intriguing side to hear from, so why couldn't they have done the same for the humans. I could care for any of these people cause all, not some, but all of the human actors were terrible. They only got good when the battle sequences happened, which were also well staged and shot. I'll give this three copies of World of Warcraft out of ten. If the other video game movies made the mistake of hiring a director with little knowledge of the source, then this is the other extreme; hiring someone who can't translate everything into an entertaining fantasy movie. Warcraft had a lot of potential but will be seen as too much work for a mainstream audience. Even if I did know the material, I doubt the movie would still be good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that I had highly anticipated since its first trailer was released; not because I'm a big Warcraft fan (never played the game) but because Duncan Jones has a nasty habit of making great films. Moon was an intriguing watch with plenty of nods to Kubrick and Source Code was an extremely entertaining Sci-Fi/Action tale, so what's the worst that could happen?... Warcraft is the answer you were looking for. Warcraft is an abysmal attempt at storytelling and it seems that the only thing the film sets out to achieve (and does so successfully) is setting up a sequel. The film can be forgiven for the CGI-fest that it is, it's based on a game and the scale that the film is operating on likely lends itself more to the green screen. However what it can't be forgiven for is a script that seems like its right out of some poor sod's fan fiction. There are lines in this film that are hard to believe got past the first draft let alone made it to the big screen, the 'no he's not/yes he is' argument between Lothar and Garona was head-in-hands embarrassing. It's difficult to blame the actors for simply going through the motions when the material they had to work with was p*ss-poor... but not that difficult. The acting was reminiscent of a back-alley stage production and made me want to disassociate with any humans on screen in favour for their Orc counterparts. It's hard to believe that there was more life to be found in the motion-captured Orcs than in any human equivalent but beggars can't be choosers. The one major positive that comes from this film is that Duncan Jones proves that it is possible to translate games to the big screen. There is a tangible sense that you are watching a game, from the camera angles that are evocative of cut-scenes during game play to the shallow dialogue and convenient plot points, it's unsurprising that many hardcore Warcraft fans enjoy this film. The problem is that where this should have been a film about a game and it became a film of a game. It's all too similar to sitting down at a friend's house and watching him play a game for two hours, the fun's going to dry up after about 30 minutes and this is exactly what happened here. I would only recommend this to those that are fans of the source material... and perhaps not a fan of film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fantasy fan, I was disappointed. As a Warcraft fan, even more so.This should have been a miniseries. There is WAY TOO MUCH lore left untouched, characters left undeveloped, and questions left unanswered. If you know Warcraft, you'll have fun. It won't be great, but it'll be fun. I've been a fan since Warcraft 2, and all the things they assume you know (like the orc homeworld, the races, the backstory of characters), was incredibly distracting and kept me from being immersed in an otherwise beautiful film.This movie tries to cram so much in such a short time, it leaves too much left unsaid, and not enough room to make you feel anything. I hate to say it, but I'd rent this one when it's out of theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking - if you never played the game you will find this unbearable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a former player of WoW, Reign of Chaos + Frozen throne I definitely recognised before any official announcements of the movie that there was potential for a great set of films from the universe mostly from the story I saw in the old real time strategy game of the early 2000s, therefore I see it as a wasted opportunity but Im not a fan to the point were I care, what does annoy me is reading positive reviews from something which is clearly bad as water is wet. I'm not worked up about any kind of plot changes or unfaithfulness, I wouldn't have noticed, I didn't recognise the story so i just went in with the eyes of someone who was somewhat familiar with the universe from having played those games some years ago.The visuals were good enough and I was impressed by some of it in a weird way, however I think they obsessed over trying to make the orcs and cities look EXACTLY like the art-style in the game and it really does suffer for this in my opinion and surely for anyone who isn't into the games at all because it looks very plastic. I am not a LOTR fan particularly but that even though its like 15 years older on a lesser budget looks way better.The unforgivable with this film is that it fails at inducing any kind of emotion or excitement, I did not care about anyone and felt no type of way at any of the plot revelations, my emotions were flat throughout, I laughed a couple of times at just how bad some of the dialogue was, the film although not a comedy tries and fails at being funny a couple of times I rolled my eyes at how unsubtle, embarrassing and box-tickingly redundant it was. The plot is not that complicated to follow, the film does a poor job of explaining who anyone is, you are just left with your basic; wizard dude, evil traitor wizard dude,rogue type love interest, gnarly orc wizard dude and so on that is the extent of the development, why we should care about 2d characters with zero personality failing to generate any intrigue in there backstory, motives,who these people are, I will forgive a shallow or clichéd plot if there is interesting chemistry and characters but this film has literally no saving graces.Really they could have summed up the entire plot of the movie in a 5-10min narrated introduction and cut out the majority of it moved on to something more interesting, it just abruptly ends and I was honestly thankful but this isn't a complete story and it doesn't warrant 2 hours the dialogue was excruciating very cringe inducing, The acting was horrible, a few par/workman performances, nobody stole the show or stood out particularly, Patton was probably the best of a bad bunch, possibly because she is a babe even as an orc, I did not buy the love story and I really didn't care either but I think she did OK with such terrible writing and direction. Some of these actors where abysmal though, god damn this faux Shakespeare olde English clichéd, witless garbage.We have seen it before, we have seen it done better, boring waste of time, I would recommend this for people who like loud noises, people who I wanted to trick into wasting there time for my own amusement (nobody) and 12 year old players of the games. This is action packed so if you like computer generated fantasy action with no weight behind it then I am simultaneously jealous of your low threshold for entertainment and concerned for your well being.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of of spoilers, please be warned.I don't usually write movie reviews, if I like it I'll watch it again, if I hate it then I'll forget it. But I write it anyway because I think Warcraft: The Beginning is not terrible as most critics rated.Unlike most fantasy movies, Warcraft offers something different in plot: there is no good side or bad side, they are just people who need to survive, but evil always finds its way to corrupt them. I think it's a fresh idea to start with. The story is kinda fast- paced, but we can still follow it. It's not exactly the same as the lore, there are some crucial event are alternated in this movie, but still acceptable - unless for some lore-nerd who like to boast their knowledge by complaining every little difference. The ending is very promising for sequels. I'm pretty sure most players want to see how little Go'el become a great Warchief.I really love the CGI. As the director said, it's like a prop and they used it the right way. Perhaps non-Warcraft-gamers would feel weird to see the orc design (since the orcs in LoTR version are like zombies), but this is how Warcraft's Orc look like. The score is great, it's so Warcraft, and actually I want to hear more like it. The actor are doing their job the best they can, even though I personally have a little issue with Garona (not her appearance or acting, but I expected her to be stronger and cunning, like how Draka killed the orc who after her). Since my heart lies with The Horde, I had hard time to see Durotan killed (Toby Kebbell is really a good actor, he was too underrated). But hey, this movie made me unable to hate The Alliance because anyone who become the prison guard made me laugh! My suggestion for players, do watch this movie as Duncan Jonas' Warcraft. And for non-players, do a little research before judging this movie blindly. In my opinion, Warcraft offers better story line than Avatar and better races design than LoTR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really love on how they deliver the movie base on the game Warcraft human vs orcs. The CGI is one of the best I've seen, the Orcs looks so real and the acting are great, we've waited for this film in years and now it's come in our theaters, it feels like it awaken me from a very long sleep.The Cast on this film is perfect and Warcraft Fan or not, this movie is a must to watch on cinemas and in home theaters, i can't wait for the sequel and i was hoping there is cause Warcraft Universe is Large and you can't just make 2 or 3 movies from it but you can make side stories from other Main characters of the Game.Again this is a great movie, this is the movie that you will regret for the rest of your life if you didn't watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I have never played the game, I can only judge this movie for being a good movie or not. And for me it's a resounding yes.Great story, portrayed by a crop of good actors. Visual effects that are the right blend of real and CGI.This title was changed to 'The Beginning' well it's simple there has to be a part two and I for one can't wait to see it.Gamer or not, go see this film if fantasy, action and entertainment are your thing. If not then there is always TellyTubbies....It's a shame that movies franchises like Lord of the Rings had set the bar at such a high height. This movie is another of those ancient land films with kings and queens, warriors employing the wizardry of their wizards to protect their land and population from a marauding enemy. But with a reduced budget what they've produced is a magical film that for me was entertaining, enchanting and captivating.But like I said, I've never played the game and so maybe there are gamers that may see this differently, who knows. But give it a chances at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never played the game, so i didn't know what to expect from this movie. Good things: The story was really cool, the characters originals, design and locations:wow. I loved the special effects and the music. The twists were pretty cool and unexpected and some character's deaths were really disappointing like Durotan, the human king and Draka. The magic in this movie is amazing, the effects ( that guy turned into a sheep was very funny ) and everything, wow. Very cool, i expected a brainless action movie like The 7th son or Clash of the Titans but the story was complex and well done. Bad things:The movie is too fast (really disappointing ) , too short. Looks like they deleted many scenes or missed something because almost every scene is too short and fast. The final battle: i expected something more.7/10, not 8 because it was so fast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie made for people who love Warcraft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The stunning visuals and amazing effects invite you to the fantastic and beautiful world you know from the games.First of all I have to say that I am a big fan of the Warcraft franchise, but I am not that fond of the lore, especially the lore of the beginnings which is pictured in this movie. So I don't know if there is a lot of discrepancy to the original lore, but frankly that also doesn't really matter to me.In terms of story the movie is not outstanding, but it is good and the characters are written and played well for the most part. It is not told out of only one perspective, which makes you see the motives of both sides and both are not plain good or plain evil, even though there is a main antagonist to the story. Coming to the characters as such, most of the actors fit their characters, had logical motives and made me empathize for them. The only flaw for me was Ben Foster as Medivh. He didn't do a really bad job and the role also wasn't badly written, but i think he doesn't really fit the role. But again I don't know the original lore. He just seemed unfitting for me. Especially because the rest fit their roles very well, most notably the Orcs, who looked and were played amazing, both motion captured or live acted.Which leads me to my third and for this movie most important and best part: The visuals Warcraft manages to dazzle you almost every second during the entire movie with it's incredible beauty and visual effects. The places you visit all seem real and you feel like you're coming home to the world you know from the games, because it looks just the same, but more beautiful and real. Everything is so detailed and gorgeous, you can really feel the love and fandom, that went into this movie. The battles and there are quite a few of them are very well choreographed and you never feel like it's just another movie fight.To sum it up, you should definitely watch this movie, especially, if you're a fan of the Warcraft franchise, because it takes the Warcraft universe and puts it into a mainly visually stunning film with good lore behind it. And of course the movie is full of fan service for the people who know this franchise for a long time. I don't know how people who aren't in familiar with the Warcraft lore in any way will take this movie but for fans it is most definitely a must see in my opinion and I can not wait for another one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AMAZING spectacle but seriously flawed storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Warcraft fan since 1995 who has closely followed the development of this movie over the last year. POSITIVES The CGI is SUPERB. The action is GREAT. Some of the best I've ever seen. The cinematography is GREAT, many individual shots are very effective. The props are fine. The acting is mostly fine. NEGATIVESLousy writing Lousy editingVERDICT: Storytelling: 3/10 Spectacle: 10/10 Overall: 6/10 CRITIQUE: There are plenty of sequences that are compelling but other sequences have some of the most ham-fisted dialog I have ever seen. Like a soap opera, like a 12 year old wrote it, really cringeworthy Star Wars prequel level stuff. There's a lot of it and it's frankly embarrassing to watch. It's told/edited in a very clumsy and confusing way. Some parts make very little sense. There is nothing wrong with the story per se. Sure it's simple but simple stories can be good if they are properly focused and well presented. Warcraft isn't. It fails to explain/introduce some things that are important while at other times it repeats obvious and irrelevant points several times over that could have been conveyed in more subtle ways. "Yeah, I get it" scenes.But here's the strange thing: the spectacle is so good that it's worth seeing. It's so good I actually want to go see it again, in 2D this time, maybe even more than once. I think something like X-Men Apocalypse is a better "film", but it isn't spectacular in the way Warcraft is. Same with The Jungle Book, which I'd rate 9/10 but I feel no need or desire to see it again, but I do with Warcraft. I'll just have to cringe through a lot of it. If they make a sequel, which I hope, I hope they will have confidence in the movie and give it a longer running time so they can tell a fully developed story. But they really, really need to improve the crappy writing and editing. If they had done a competent job with that this would have been a truly great movie because everything else about it is good.I do think a director's cut could significantly improve the film. This isn't just speculation, I know they have cut good scenes because there was footage that leaked a year ago from San Diego Comic Con and there were several sequences just in that 4 minute clip that are not in the movie: These are the kind of "slow" establishing scenes the movie desperately needed more of, because these characters are hardly introduced. We haven't gotten to really know the characters before they start doing stuff so we don't care. A director's cut with those and other scenes restored would be a significantly better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Great Video Game Movie, But Only A Good Movie Overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft, from sci-fi mastermind Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code) brings us his fanboy-driven adaptation of World of Warcraft in what is easily one of the biggest movies of the year. When Azeroth is on the brink of collapse from invading orc forces, two warriors from both sides must stand and fight for their families, their people and their worlds.Duncan Jones has said repeatedly he was a fan of WoW and that this is a love letter to the game, and while I'm no fan of the games, I can definitely see it. This movie is what many fantasy fans have been waiting for after the Tolkien adaptations, because we hardly ever get true high fantasy epics of such scale and scope. Jones' direction was there, and was outstanding. The writing was good, but was where the movie also suffered; it needed to be twenty-thirty minutes longer to get through so much story that they jam-packed into two hours. I think the critical reception would have been better if the movie was longer, but, it wasn't, not to mention some cheesy dialogue, which I personally found refreshing. The CG was dazzling in every way, especially after a couple questionable trailers. The production values and combination of make-up, costumes and CG was incredible. Even the musical score from Ramin Djawadi (known for his work on Iron Man and Game of Thrones) delivers a pulse-pounding fantasy soundtrack. The acting was what surprised me most with Warcraft, with Travis Fimmel being brilliant in the human lead and Toby Kebbel as the emotionally gripping Durotan, and the supporting cast (including the orcs) being very solid. Jones made sure to have those quick tidbits of humor to help balance the dread and warfare, similar to what you'd see in Lord of the Rings or other films where quick, dry wit is used to offer breathing room among intensity (Inception, Interstellar, even Jones' own movies Moon and Source Code).Overall, Warcraft is what it should be, but not what it could have been. It's still one hell of an epic fantasy, but I can only put it on par with The Hobbit, because it doesn't reach the same level of story-telling and character development Lord of the Rings achieves. Hopefully, Warcraft succeeds at the box office and Legendary Pictures green-lights the sequel, of which needs to be at least two and a half hours. But, please, see this when it comes out if you're into high fantasy or the video game. If you aren't, go on a $5 Tuesday to give it a chance.7.5/10 Stars*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a non-gamer, I was surprised how much I liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually like games turned into movies, however, Warcraft was a pleasant surprise. The movie was moderately violent, but I would be happy for my young teens to see it. What surprised me was the absence of "girl power" lines in the movie, which is a rare treat in itself when you aren't bombarded with sexism. It also showed fairly realistic female portrayals, which is almost unheard of in Hollywood in the last few decades. If you like over-the-top female ninja warriors who are smarter and stronger than any man in the movie, this is not your movie. The story is simple enough to follow. Different races and classes are well defined. Magic was fairly straight forward. There are two armies fighting for land for survival. Fight scenes were surprisingly easy to follow, despite large armies at play. The camera work made a huge difference as did clean special effects and solid story boarding. What I found hard to take was the slow pace of the movie and wooden acting of some of the main human characters. The 2 human sorcerers and human warrior were mediocre actors. However, the Orcs (excluding their wizard) were mostly excellent. I especially liked that orcs had genuine and rounded personalities (eg. Friendly laughs and comradery). It stayed true to their warrior nature, but gave them depth beyond the usual villain. With tighter pacing and better directing for the humans, I could see great things for this series. I would definitely see a sequel if it was released.</fullReview>

While it is certainly a good movie, it is not an unmissable one. That i a creepy situation, because it sets me apart from both the critics and the fans. While i would go to cinema to watch a sequel then this movie is not as good as most people say. But i nonetheless still enjoyed it and had a pretty good time watching it. I am happy to see a new great fantasy franchise come out. It is also a good movie which is interesting because it is based on a video game. For a verdict i would say that this movie is a good one that will fill your time with a good memory and a good feeling, too. I liked this movie and it is great. I am definitely on board for sequels. Besides the fight between the orcs and the humans is really interesting. The characters are great and everything is sorted out great.

		<fullReview>I've never played a Warcraft game, but I do like the Sword and Scorcerer/Fantasy genre, so I watched this not knowing what to expect.I was entertained, a surprisingly well done film, not so much for its story and arch, which in my opinion gets too long - particularly the battle scenes - but for the great universe that is created. The orcs are really well done and honestly much more interesting and better looking than the orcs of Lord of The Rings and the Hobit, this is what orcs are supposed to be like unlike the animalistic beasts in LOTR.I'm sure that many critics will find the movie primitive and even childish, but for the movie that it is then it fully delivers a believable (within genre) new take on the fantasy universe.As stated, I found it too long and too much time spent on battle scenes, not enough on the excellent story telling in the first part.If the director fixes a few of the flaws and adds more lore, then it could be a really good series in years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft: The Beginning is a worthy attempt at being the first (of hopefully many) engaging big budget film based on a video game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get a couple of things out of the way first. I have not played any Warcraft games and do not have a deep understanding of the mythology of this world. I was also very underwhelmed by the trailers for this movie and went in with very low expectations. See for yourself:I have to say, I was pretty well entertained by the film. The performances were really good for the most part; and we now have the heir apparent to Andy Serkis for all motion capture roles in Toby Kebbell. After his masterful performance as Koba in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, his portrayal of Durotan is the stand out performance in my opinion. I was actually surprised by the Orcs as a whole. We have now reached the level of technology that allows for warmth in the eyes?which make the orcs believable.I also liked the story that was told and how it was told. Duncan Jones (the director) did something that is very admirable; he made me believe that I was on Azeroth within the first 10 minutes of the film. As someone who hasn't played the games before, I was never confused about where the film was headed and the motivation behind the decisions of most of the characters.One of my biggest problem was the performance of Ben Schnetzer who played Khadgar the young wizard. I don't really understand the purpose of this role as a whole. Why does he have to be a young wizard? Couldn't he have been a more fleshed out wizard who has been through some experiences. He looked like he was in a different film.Another issue I had was with CGI in certain parts of the film. At times it looked too glossy. It needed to be a little more gruff for me. I also wanted some more character development for a lot of the characters. There were parts of the film that seemed to be dragging as a result of lack of character development; I just didn't care at times.Overall, I was really impressed by what Duncan Jones was able to do with this. This is by far the best video game film we have had. But as a fantasy movie, it is no Lord of the Rings. It was a good film but not a great one. I still enjoyed it for what it is and what the potential could be for possible sequels and other potential video game adaptations.My rating: 6/10?which is a recommendation in my book.Review from: www.pratikrambles.wordpress.com</fullReview>

Dammit this is Warcraft! Fricking Dubstep for a fantasy film!Some parts of the film blew my mind as a fan of the franchise. It was just unbelievable how the story actually went. It's like a re-telling of the same story but with a different perspective and that different perspective add so much more depth into the original story.I implore you to go watch it with your family and friends.

If there is one thing to complain about this movie it's the clique plot which is way too predictable but I can look past that because Warcraft was a fun and entertaining experience.

However, being a lover of anything Warcraft and Travis Fimmel (Anduin) I couldn't resist missing it.Story = Good, most reviews say that it has no/little story which I find strange since there is a clear plot from the get go and perfectly sets up for another film.FX/Animation = Great! Although some parts do look less good than others , to say it was a game company cooperating with other film companies the FX are awesome.I would happily see it again before it leaves the cinema. If you love Warcraft and/or Vikings you're guaranteed to love this film. Anduin is basically a high fantasy Ragnar :-)</fullReview>

Is this worth to watch?If you are a WarCraft or Fantasy Fan! YES YES ABSOLUTELY YES! Even tho the movie has some flaws here and there, it's an absolute roller- coaster and fun movie. It doesn't get you bored.As said before, some lines are cringy or cheesy but it delivers the job. Especially on the Humans side. However on the Orc side it blows you away and you actually start caring about the chars. The movie has a sickton of references to the games, so if you are a warcraft nerd. You will enjoy it.Imho, ignore the critics just sit-down relax and engulf yourself in the World of Warcraft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best video-game movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched it last night, it was exactly like I expected, if not slightly better.Pros:- CGI, especially the motion capture, was the best I've ever seen in any movie. Some scenes didn't look good in the trailers but I can assure you they cleaned them up, everything was perfect on the big screen (I watched the movie in 3D on a very good cinema). - As a Warcraft fan, I was happy to see that everything from armors to spells was created with care to look as similar to the game as possible. - Gul'Dan was a badass villain and probably one of the best characters. - From the trailers I thought that Khadgar and Garona were going to be the worst characters, but actually they weren't. I think the actors portrayed them really well. - There's no true love story between Lothar and Garona, it's just hinted that they kinda like each other. Something like Black Widow and Hulk in Age of Ultron.So-so:- The Italian dubbing was OK, actually better than I expected, but still inferior to the original. - The acting was also OK. From the comments I expected worse, but actually I think that everyone did their job well. Nothing exceptional of course, but most of the characters were fine just like in any other movie. - Easter eggs were cool but I expected more of them. - It has nothing to do with the movie itself, but the audience reaction wasn't the best. The cinema was almost full (about 300 out of 350 seats), but everyone stayed silent the whole time. When the Murloc appeared, only a handful of people recognized it an laughed. The only time where everyone laughed was when the Polymorph spell was used. Some non Warcraft fans were like "WTF?".Cons:- As most people have said, the first part of the movie is too fast and they jump from a place to another too quickly. The movie starts with the duel scene between the human and the orc which is a brief flashforward, then we move to Draenor for like 3 minutes, then to Ironforge for 1 minute, then to Stormwind for 2, then to Goldshire, and so on. Basically, every couple of minutes characters say "ok, let's go there". I understand that they wanted to show as many locations as possible but that's almost ridiculous. - A lot of scenes from the trailers, featurettes and TV spots weren't included in the final cut. Some examples would be the Orcs in the snow, the Dalaran aerial view, the "They are all beasts, they should be destroyed", etc. I hope we get to see them in the Director's Cut DVD. - I was disappointed by Orgrim Doomhammer. He's one of the most useless characters, has as much screen time as Lady Taria (which isn't much), and he basically does nothing the whole time.Overall I would give the movie 8,5/10. I watched it with 4 other people (none of them played WoW but two of them plays Hearthstone without knowing anything about the lore) and they all liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's great, I love it. But I will give around 7.5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'm sorry for my grammar.I'm not a Warcraft/DOTA gamer, but I love the movie. But I will give the score 7.5, The graphic(animation) is good. Really good. the story it's okay, but the ending especially when the battle between Lothar and Blackhand.. It's too fast, and I don't get the feeling about their battle. I only get the feeling in the beginning and the moment before their fight. And the ending is okay but I got the same reaction like last time.. Like "Okay.. So, that's it?". Even I have a feeling there will be a sequel (well maybe).But overall, the movie is good. I like it. If there is a sequel, I will wait for it then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I thought it would be by far, thanks to the critics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a way I wasn't surprised that this movie got bad reviews from various critics , you have to somewhat invest or be invested in the story to fully understand what this movie is about. I've played Warcraft II and Warcraft III and World of Warcraft before but I've read plot and lore about Warcraft I just to understand all that is happening in the gamesequels which took me roughly 10 minutes btw. So Im no newcomer to this franchise. First of all, I was abit hyped about this movie until I read the bad reviews. It lowered my expectations a lot but as a fan of the games it was a "must see" for me. And boy do I wanna thank the critics, I had a very good time watching this movie with no or low expectations. Its no masterpiece, got some flaws and overacting but not half as bad as the reviews say. I think they were expecting a new LoTR which is totally moronic, even as a reference. Its like giving a Star Trek movie a bad review because it is not like Star Wars. Another issue with using LoTR as reference is because its lore is more well known than Warcraft, I guessed most critics have stumbled across Tolkien's work before they saw the movie adaption so when they say Warcraft is for the fans wasn't LoTR the same but with a much larger fanbase? Enough about that, not even gonna comment about GoT as reference, that is just crazy talk. This movie sets out to do the following as it is hopefully the beginning of the whole story: Introduce us to Azeroth, it does that fairly well but guess runtime slimmed that down abit. Get us to know the factions in this war, well Warcraft I is about the starting conflict between humans and orcs and I think it delivers, its mostly about survival in this movie but there are deeper motives which hopefully will be explained in sequels as in the game trilogy later on. The characters, here is the biggest flaw because of the runtime. The orcside is portrayed best but have less main characters to focus on and are more interesting while there are too many humans introduced and too little time to get attached (alliance hopefully buffed in director's cut patch if any). Lastly the story, it is as true as it can get in a 2 hour movie, hoping for director's cut to dive deeper in lore.Its not a perfect movie, it got flaws but it doesn't make it as bad as the critics say, if not into warcraft lore but want to watch this, read up a little about the first warcraft game before you see it and you will get a better experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unabasahed, unadulterated and earnest High Fantasy in its purest form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might be presumptuous of me, but I just couldn't possibly understand how a fan of high fantasy would dislike this movie. It has just everything one might want: wizards, orcs, knights, royalty, grand-scale battles, earnest heroics, despicable villainy, tragedy, fun, you name it.I loved every cheerful second of it. Every moment landed, the story was easy to follow, the world was properly established, I got invested in the characters and got to know the ones that remained and also some that left. In general I could see the love and care that the crew and cast had while making this movie.Its main asset is, of course, the visuals. Everything in this movie looks gorgeous; I was specially fond of the spellcasting. I loved everything about how magic was portrayed in this movie. The sound was not far behind and I fell in love with the soundtrack, particularly Medivh's theme, which I still listen on repeat now and again.The direction was adept, as to be expected from Jones (whose Source Code is just as awesome and I'll check Moon out as soon as I can) and I never got lost nor missed anything that felt important.The acting was good both for the live-action and motion-capture actors. I thought Fimmel did a pretty good job carrying the movie and he was able to make me believe everything Anduin was feeling. Schnetzer was also deceptively good, and one of the reasons Khadgar ended up being my favorite character. Kebbell did an appropriate work as Durotan and everyone else did ably with what they were given. I'd have wished for more female characters, but for now I think Patton did a decent job, hopefully we get to see more of Taria and more women in possible sequels.The writing was serviceable and that's enough for me. Except for Khadgar, whose writing I felt was quite good, in part because I think he's the character who was developed the most, and that seeming preference of the writers was another reason he ended up becoming my favorite too (the third reason was because, as a young nerd, he was the most relatable to me). Anyway, like I said, every moment landed (albeit some better than others).If there's a flaw (and the reason this is 8 and not more) I can accept in this film, it's the editing: the pace was breakneck and some scenes and story lines weren't allowed to flow properly. I'm certain, though, that a Director's (or at least extended) cut will fix this issue, which could also improve the moments I felt didn't land as smoothly. Crossing my fingers.In general, this was a very satisfying movie, I've watched it more than once and I've enjoyed the hell out of it each time.Oh, a minor disclaimer: I've never played any of the warcraft games properly (the closest I've come was playing DotA when I was 16) and, thus, the very limited knowledge I had of the lore was from the third game onward; I found out after watching that this movie was mostly an adaptation of the first game, of which I knew nothing. In other words: This review is from a casual viewer, not a prior fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wasn't expecting much as I heard this film get poor reviews from the critics.The story is simple but it's told in a rich and well thought out style. The acting is convincing enough, the character development well tuned and the story snowballs to a satisfying ending - for now. I came to the film having never played the games although did have affection for many of the cast members' previous roles. I've just experienced one of the best films I've ever seen. Thanks critics, you led me to believe I was going to get a potato, but instead I got served lobster... can't wait to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the times when the special effects simply were a man throwing buckets of water into the frame and onto the Hero that so valiant sailed a full rigged ship, to a stop in the land of barbarians, thieves and warlocks where Arnold surprised the majority of movie goers by his mighty size alone, today Warcraft certainly makes this epic adventure come to life. Disappointments are always present when it comes to films in this category and specially when you change media format ...............AAARRRGGGHHHHH !!! when you with a fools determination insists to find flaws. Instead of letting all your imagination run wild, just as you could before adulthood claimed your beautiful imagination and set fixed parameters onto, into and around that ability to make a spacecraft out of a cardboard box or a flowing river out of your grandparents hallway carpet. Do some martial arts breathing, empty your mind, see to that you have your drink, popcorn or whatever no longer then a arm length away and let your all your senses be tricked for 2 hours, just as the makers of the film intended........then we'll talk. Maybe this is a crappy review, but try this and i promise you that all films from now on will have that little extra that others will kill for.In the dark: ease up, relax, be in the moment, let your senses lead you and you and your lover will thank me later for this tip....... works fine when you go to the movies too......Love, // Apocs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 10 rating because it has it all, great characters, awesome scenery and CGI that is absolutely stellar! If you've always enjoyed game intros in the older games but soon learned the game graphics didn't measure up to the intro, hold on to your seats because the dream has finally come true! You are going to love it! So ignore the so called critics and their less than great ratings because well, they can't be pleased. I'm tough to win over but this movie had me from the first scene to the last. One of the other key points that I enjoy in movies is that they leave the story line open for a sequel. Trust me, this is one world you will never get enough of. So grab some friends and the popcorn and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above-Average But Derivative Sword &amp; Sorcery Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, I've never played the video game World of Warcraft, but I've seen the $161-million dollar, PG-13 rated, Universal Pictures' extravaganza. What "Source Code" director Duncan Jones, "Seventh Son" scenarist Charles Leavitt, and "Warcraft II &amp; III" video game scribe Chris Metzen have wrought is a larger-than-life, adventure fantasy inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's classic "Lord of the Rings" and C.S. Lewis' "Narnia" novels. This sprawling sword &amp; sorcery saga pits terrestrial humans against marauding extraterrestrial Orcs in a cornucopia of striking computer generated images. If you've seen either the trailers or publicity photos for "Warcraft," you know those intimidating Orcs resemble Goliath-like humanoids, possess massive limbs, and have a Frank Frazetta look. Tusks bulge improbably from their grim mouths as if they were colossal warthogs. Indeed, these belligerent invaders emerge as mighty gruesome. They wield humongous hammers that would make Thor crap in his drawers, and they abide by a staunch code of honor. Namely, Orcs don't fib. Once they promise something, they adhere to their word. Of course, the Orcs are avatars that unseen but seasoned thespians such as Toby Kebbell, Rob Kazinsky, and Clancy Brown portray in motion capture outfits. Meantime, the humans resemble Arthurian knights adorned in elaborate suits of armor with massive glittering swords. Whereas the Orcs gallivant around on gigantic wolves, the humans cruise the skies astraddle giant Griffins when they aren't riding horses. Aside from Travis Fimmel's sympathetic protagonist Anduin Lothar and Dominic Cooper's noble King Llane Wrynn, "Warcraft" relies largely on hundreds of CGI characters. What these characters lack in depth, Jones and his special effects wizards compensate for with ghoulish countenances. The filmmakers are not interested in diplomacy as much as they are fascinated with the pugnacious warriors and warlords as they engage in a battle to the death for a little over two hours. This above-average, cinematic adaptation isn't as abhorrent as many critics have claimed, and the narrative ambiguities in "Warcraft" actually provide it with some surprising depth. Neither Orcs nor humans are entirely either evil or heroic."Warcraft" chronicles a merciless clash between two vastly different races of warriors. First, director Duncan Jones and his scribes introduce us to the mighty Orcs. Hailing from a dying planet named Draenor, they set out to conquer the planet Azeroth where King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper of "Need for Speed") of Stormwind presides over a human population living in comparative peace. Those rugged, mesomorphic Orcs march to the orders of a wicked warlock, Gul'dan (voiced by Daniel Wu of "Europa Report"), who resembles the spawn of Satan with an elaborate thicket of antlers bristling from his back. Gul'dan mobilizes the Orc tribes into an army called the Horde, and he conjures up a colossal trans-dimensional portal. The Orc shaman practices a noxious form of Black magic called the Fel. He deploys the Fel to make the portal operational. The portal derives its power from the life force of captives that the Orcs have imprisoned and transported to Azeroth. This mysterious Fel depletes life energy of those prisoners and their life energy maintains the portal. This portal is reminiscent of the gateways in the vintage sci-fi film "Stargate" and the television series it spun off that transported individuals from one world to another. The murky green Fel is so toxic that it corrupts anybody and anything, and this malignant force has warped Gul'dan so dreadfully that some of his own kind have come to abhor it. The Orc warrior Durotan (voice of Toby Kebbell of "Fantastic Four") rules the Frostwolf Clan. As one of the many Draenor tribes, the Frostwolf Clan has joined Gul'dan's Horde. Durotan wants his people, particularly his pregnant wife Draka (voice of Anna Galvin), to thrive as prosperously as they once did before their planet began to deteriorate. Durotan's clan takes its name from the enormous wolves that they ride. Meantime, Durotan doesn't completely trust Gul'dan or the terrible green Fel magic that destroys everything it touches. This generates considerable friction between Durotan and war chieftain Blackhand (voiced by Clancy Brown of "Highlander"), especially after the latter discovers that the former is plotting treason behind his back. Durotan calls a truce and has words with King Wynn, but Blackhand surprises the two and attacks them. During this wild melee, Stormwind's sorcerer Medivh, (Ben Foster of "The Mechanic") the legendary Guardian of Tirisfal, saves King Wynn's life by deploying a shield to thwart Blackhand's warriors from slaying him. Unfortunately, King Wynn's army commander Sir Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel of "Vikings") loses his son, when the young warrior is caught on the wrong side. Not only does Lothar suspect that the Fel has corrupted Medivh, but he also believes that Medivh and Gul'dan may have been conspiring with each other. Anybody who isn't thoroughly acquainted with the mythology of Warcraft may find themselves bewildered by the byzantine stratums of the story. Painstaking research enabled me to clear up who was who in the complex line-up of characters. Indeed, I talked with a seasoned "Warcraft" gamer who has been playing the Blizzard Entertainment game for over a decade. I watched "Warcraft" twice before I gained a clear understanding of the hierarchies for both the Horde and Stormwind Alliance. If you've never played Warcraft, the best way to enjoy "Warcraft" the movie is to savor it simply for both its breathtaking computer generated imagery and interesting combatants. The grotesque Orcs are extremely ugly, while the Stormwind warriors reminded me of King Arthur's knights from the classic movie "Excalibur." "Blood Diamond" scenarist Charles Leavitt and "Warcraft" game author Chris Metzen gloss over some salient points in the Warcraft universe. Miraculously, director Duncan Jones doesn't let the plethora of exposition take the edge off the savage, testosterone-laden action. He plunges audiences into the stunning CGI imagery with its adrenaline-laced action sequences without drenching us in gallons of blood and gore to compensate for the plot. "Warcraft" lives up to its title without wearing out its welcome at 123 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Full disclosure: I am not a gamer, and never have played this Warcraft game before, and I am indifferent to the original story or this game itself, etc. I evaluate and review this movie as a standalone movie itself, not based on how well or badly it follows the original game. You have a slow and boring weekend, and say to self what I can do to make it a little bit better? Let's go and watch a movie! And you choose this movie based on the beautiful visuals and CGI scenes that you have seen in the trailer. And 30 minutes into the movie and you realize you could have more fun if you had staid at home and watch your favorite TV series from Netflix again! This is pretty much what happened to me!I have to admit that CGI work was great. The Orcs were designed and created very beautifully. It was fascinating to watch them. I won't be surprised if this movie wins awards for its visual effects. But the weak story line and character development let you down and ruins this beautiful visual effects for you. Again, I am not a gamer and do not care what the original story line in the game was. What I can tell is that the story line was weak, and this story line was implemented even weaker! Spoiler alert:===== It seems that there was supposed to be a chemistry created between Anduin Lothar and Garona. But the chemistry felt so forced. It never felt real or organic, we, the viewers, were just supposed to accept that yes, these two are now in some sort of love. I am not sure it was because of bad acting, bad directing, or bad story line and character development that the chemistry and love between them never felt real.Garona was a captive, a prisoner. But all of sudden she became a right hand of king, who everyone trust and she started to ride along the king and roam around freely. when the guardian was weak and left on his bed to rest, the king had asked Garona to stay by his bed and keep an eye on him. I mean come on, the Guardian is arguably the most important figure in the kingdom to stand against the enemy and then you ask an alien who you captured awhile ago to take care of him? There is no one else in the kingdom to be with the Guardian and to keep an eye on him? Ben schnetzer played khadgar. But I never could accept him as a wizard, he struck me as stable boy in the kings castle, not a person who possesses special powers. I would blame this on 1- bad casting, 2- questionable acting,and 3- unsuitable makeup and hairstyle. He looked like a clueless chubby boy, not an intelligent, smart wizard!Despite the fact that the special effects were great, but the production design for some locations were were armature and questionable. There was a scene that the king and his solders are leaving the capital o go for war, and they are marching through the city. It looked like that the city location and buildings were designed and created by cardboard. Of course very few movies go to the extend of physically building real building and locations. However, the scene and houses shouldn't be this much obviously cheap! I was laughable.The movie looked good when you are watching the Orcs and the CGI parts. But when it switches to humans, it falls flat. You could feel more connected with Orcs than with the humans. End of spoiler ===========Don't get me wrong. I do not expect a complex story line from a movie such as Warcraft. I just need a simple, consistent, believe (based on the rules of the movie itself) story line. Warcraft had the budget and potentials to be a nice popcorn movie. But there were multiple story line, acting and casting problems there were distracting you from relaxing and enjoying this summer action flick. The movie was a disappointment, and When the movie ended, the few people that were in the theater rushed to the exit doors to get the hell of there ASAP. People, you can spend your time and money much much better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic delight for fantasy lovers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft is an amazing fantasy spectacle. The movie delivers on what it promises - orcs are lifelike and truly become relatable characters, magic is plentiful and portrayed in an interesting way and the world looks beautiful with stunning sceneries. Movie's director Duncan Jones has managed to perfectly captured the essence of Warcraft, taking all that makes the renowned video game so great and adapting it to a format suitable for big screen. Even humor is there and it's not over the top.In its core Warcraft is a character driven movie. While on the bigger scale the movie is about conflict between forces of good and evil each character has their own motivations and personal struggles. During the movie it becomes evident that lines are not as clear cut as it seems at first glance. It's a great story of conflict and tragedy. The plot is made easier to understand for those unfamiliar with source material. The movie tells you most of the things you need to know while subtly hinting there's more to that and old fans can pick up those familiar clues. Attention to detail is just uncanny - there are probably hundreds of Easter eggs woven into the movie but none of them are distractive for the uninitiated.The story is amongst some of the most faithful ones to source material ever seen on the big screen. There are changes but none are so major as to change the overall story, some are purely cosmetic and none are really out of character. Most of them really do work to make the story more fluid.With all that said the movie is not perfect though. The movie's final cut is a bit too short for a fantasy epic of this scale. It shows in some places where the pacing suddenly seems off and it feels that too much was left out. Hopefully they will release an extended version later on Blu-ray.Overall it's a great movie that does a good job with setting up the Warcraft universe on big screen and leaves you wanting for more. A delight for any true fantasy lover.</fullReview>

When I saw the first trailer I thought this looked like a good fantasy movie and I was right.It has amazing visuals and enough exposition for people like me who don't know anything about the series to understand the storyMost characters are one dimensional or a little boring (like the king) but hey, this is a fantasy, not a Oscar-bait drama so it works fine for meOf course I didn't get the references or the differences in story lines with the games and maybe that's why die hard fans and critics are not liking it but for me it is a solid fantasy movie.

		<fullReview>As a critic i would rate this film a well deserved 8-8.5/10.But i had to rate this 10 because stereotypical drama loving art critics rate it way under what it deserves.Just because its a fantasy based movie with lots of CGI, its still not that accepted in modern day film art. I'm sure anyone who grew up with fantasy stories would absolutely love this film, Even if you are not familiar with the Warcraft story line. U absolutely have to give this a shot and rate it yourself imo! If u don't like fantasy and you are more in for drama/thriller/epic-plot movies. Don't watch it, It's nothing you'll like. Also don't come and rate it bad if you don't like fantasy. this movie deserves it's credit.as a wow fan: I have to rate it 11/10. Really if you played warcraft games or have a wow history, this movie gives u the feeling of your first minutes in Azeroth, pure nostalgia. I don't think it could be done any better. Only few flaws are on the human front. Imo I think the king should be done by a different actor. the lore does not 100% fit the wow story line but its really not far off. TL;DR for non-warcraft fans: Awesome movie, think about LoTR. Might not have the best intro into the story, but if u pay your attention u will not have a hard time getting along with it.TL;DR for wow fans: If u don't see this within a few months shame on you its epic, u could see it 2 times in a row and still feel the nostalgia. Easter eggs are present, but not too much, as it should be. Also you might have the feeling you want to re-sub afterwards + u won't regret if you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic fantasy movie as it should be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say I'm sorry if anything I'll write may be a spoiler to those that haven't yet seen the movie.Being a WoW gamer/fan myself I was expecting this movie since Blizzard announced the making of it back in 2009, if I remember well. So being patient for that long, I had mixed feeling when I sat at the theater's sit... Too much for a gamer to expect, too much for a fan to wait!!! Will it be a come-to-life imagination? Will it be just a give-us-more-money blockbuster from Blizzard's side?The movie begun... For those of us that have played a bit of WoW or even back in the ages Warcraft the strategy games, the music was stunning!!! Oh my, I'm I playing now at the comfort of my room or is it a movie? Just epic!There are too many CGI I must say, but who cares? They are just perfect! I had a bad feeling about CGI before watching the movie, but by god they must be some of the best CGI I've ever saw in a movie!I must say now that or us fans of Warcraft, the plot, the characters and of course the ending wasn't a mystery. We knew what we were about to see. We knew what to expect. But this, this is what made the movies plot a real challenge I suppose for the makers. Excellent direction, really smooth going of the movies plot. Yes, there were some changes from what we gamers knew, as the death of Durotan. But isn't a fight to the death better than an ambush? I say yes. Not that many things were changed from the main lore of warcraft for those still thinking "My god the twisted the storyline". Slight changes brought a better result at the end and didn't change the story in general. Don't forget that this is a theatrical version anyway.For those that haven't any relation to Warcraft or WoW the movie is just a must-see epic fantasy movie. Yes there should have been like ten or twenty more minutes to get you guys around but there isn't something you are missing. How many of us had read J.R.R. Martin's Lord of the rings before we saw the movie? Too many I guess, but it didn't make us see a movie that we couldn't follow the plot. I'm saying that because too many fellow writers will say "We missed this or that" "I could follow the plot cause I'm not a WoW player" or more.The actors. A great selection of persons. They really made us anxious some times, worried some other times. Excellent performances that would make even the most skeptic of us say it was a good movie. Some of the actors' performance such as Travis Fimmel, Sir Lothar, were to be expected as flawless for those of us who have seen him in Vikings the series. But the real revelation were the actors that were incarnating CGI characters. The details, the expression even the voice were outstanding!Its surely is one of the best, if not the best, movies of 2016. A must see for everyone gamer or not, fan of Warcraft or not! So as a summary: The music was epic, the direction was one of the best we have seen, the actors were doing more of a good job, the CGI were of the best quality, the plot was perfect. A must see!!!I gave it only 8 out of ten stars, because a 9 out of ten should be the sequel and a 10 out of 10 the Lich king's storyline.Come on Blizzard make us wait for the next movie to come (but not soooo long this time)!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's like your mate put the magic back into fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Azeroth stands on the brink of war, the leader of the humans and the leader of the orcs are then sent on a collision course that will decide the fate of their people.There is a honesty and truthfulness that comes with a Duncan Jones film, from having a famous father (a true legend) Jones broke convention not becoming one of those superficial celebs making a living in the shadow of a parent. I know very little if any thing about Warcraft, I know it's big and I know it's a fantasy role playing game so I'm not going to pretend I know more than that.Warcraft with all the whizz bang jiggery pokery, beneath the sweeping shots and special effects there is a heart felt tale about parenting and loss. What Jones' offering has is that Moon, Source Code humanity which Jones effortlessly brings to the table, that roundness and grounded feel that he stamps on his films. The script has an honesty that it's not just some money making studio movie but an indie-spirited film finely crafted on a large scale. You feel your mate made this great spectacle, there's an underlying apprehensive innocence in contrast to a sense of wonder and adventure. Warcraft seemingly feels that he isn't in it for the money, but for the story telling and artistic craft of it all.Unusually the subtitle 'The Beginning' was absent on the title screen in the cinema version, it simply says 'Warcraft' possibly linked to the rating. While available for all to see with an adult, the battles are intense, stabbings etc. it not just the scary demon and skeletal faces that will scare the young kids but the emotional impact of orc Durotan (CGI capture Tony Kebbell) wife and child storyline. As Orc clan honour is tested, there are duelling wizards, a giant golem and griffin. Jones also briefly throws in a few elves, dwarfs and huge wolves for good measure. There's betrayal, double-crossing and retribution, the powerful magical Orc, Gul'dan (the excellent Daniel Wu) literary sucks the life of humans akin to The Dark Crystal.The casting is not mainstream, Ben Foster's wizard Medivh avoids stereotype and is a young incarnation of a wizard, as is Llane (Dominic Cooper) a younger than expected King. Battle hard human Lothar Travis Fimmel (of Amazon's Vikings) as well as some grand action scenes, emotional set ups (one echoing the Phantom Menace, Obi-Wan showdown) he also gets comedic moments, many alongside wizard/mage apprentice Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) who again is not what you'd expect for someone so powerful. This casting works in Warcraft's favour, if you had a thing for blue women Smurfette, Neytiri and Mystique, Stark Trek olive and She-Hulk green is the new in colour with Garona Halforcen. Fittingly cast is memorable underrated Clancy Brown (of Highlander fame) as the principled conflicted Blackhand, Gul'dan's right-hand orc.The daytime colour is bright and vivid in contrast to the pin sharp night time and darker scenes, Warcraft has a unique look and feel. The execution is near on perfect in the confines of the budget and today's capabilities with brutal sword play and battles. The director is wise to keep the focus on the interesting characters and themes of conflict, family and loyalty with Ramin Djawadi ominous score adding to the proceedings. Warriors, Kings, magicians and creatures, the human cast and the CGI performers melt together and you invest in the characters and their secret meetings and campsite confessions. The computer imagery, textured layers of animation and 3D modeling fuse with the mix of practical stunts and sets. Fimmel and Kebbell are notable but Paula Patton as hardened Garona steals the show as a go between peace keeper and will no doubt set geek hearts aflame. Writers Jones, Charles Leavitt and Chris Metzen juggle the many major characters successfully and the cast deliver the fantasy dialogue with ease.Jones and crew give us the Matrix of fantasy, lots of things will be familiar not just reminiscent because of Lord of the Rings, Dungeon and Dragons, Fire and Ice, Planet of the Apes, John Carter to name a few. But because of an inherent subconscious of the genre that's in the ether and part of our pop culture. But like the stylised Matrix did for sci-fi (as much as I hate to admit it) after the dust settled it stood on its own feet and was a milestone in film. As a 70'd kid Warcraft for me puts magic back in the mix instead of it languishing in low budget TV shows, a soulless blockbusters or sub-par cash-ins, here Jones takes it to a fitting level where it should be and cleverly sets up a follow up.There's unavoidable rooted fantasy tropes littered throughout and Jones injects a little nuance or twist wherever possible. As a sci-fi fantasy, medieval-ish action saga Warcraft is highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Movie! Ignore the haters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haters gonna hate. Ignore the reviews from the people who claim they couldn't understand the movie. If you couldn't understand this, then you should probably stick to watching Disney Jr. or Teletoon or something. The movie was an epic and enthralling fantasy masterpiece. I was captivated by the story and the extremely well done graphic design from beginning to end. At no point in the movie did I feel like I was watching computer characters. Everything felt very "real." Or as real as a fantasy adventure could possibly be. It is as good or better than the Lord of the Rings movies. Ignore the reviews from the plebs. The movie rocks and the current rating is a kick in the face to how amazing this thing is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, it was alright. I'd go so far as to call it very decent.Good special effects, decent performances and a serviceable story. The script was pretty weak and does let down the film overall, but if you're into this kind of fantasy flick then you'll probably have a good time.It's campy as hell and should have some humour but doesn't, which is disappointing. If you've played any of the old RTS games or WoW then you'll understand it a lot more clearly than complete virgins to the franchise, and there are some nice touches for fans.Overall, very watchable. Don't believe the pro critics, they're just bitter old hacks with no sense of fun. Duncan Jones has obviously put a great deal of effort into making a coherent narrative for something that could easily have been blazed over 4hrs. I'd actually have preferred that (double feature?) but clearly that was too risky for the studio. I hope this does well as there are some truly cracking stories that could be used for future films but only time will tell. Plenty of other terrible films have had multiple sequels (Fast &amp; Furious anyone?) so it's not too much of a stretch to imagine it could happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Either too long or too short, and still almost perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have given this 10 out of 10, mostly to balance the extremely negative reviews, maybe it only deserved 8/10. In my opinion, this movie is either too short, as we don't get into the characters of the movie in depth - or it is too long as we could have skipped a few sub-stories along the way, such as the romantic tension between Lothar and Gerona. The CGI was almost perfect and remained so during the entire movie. I have seen great CGI in movie and series at the beginning until the funds run out and the lower the quality of the CGI (the dragon of Game of Thrones comes to mind). The quality is consistent, and that alone earns a rating of 10/10. The CGI doesn't skip on expressions either. It remains strong and coherent. The story-line runs it course. It is neither strong or weak. It mostly carried by the weight of necessity, which is how out world works most of the time - mixed with the intricacies of deception and self deception, and the constant lure of power shortcuts and delusions of grandeur. We also get a sense of entrapment in traditions and customs, such as the orc way of tribal warfare and trials of battle and leadership, but also a human king caught in his own sense of honor and obligations to his people and his world ... with his eyes wide open although he seemed a bit dense in the beginning. The love stories were a bit forced and it is this film's greatest weakness, and it either spent too much time on it or to little. We don't get to feel anything ourselves, neither for Durotan and his mate, or Lothar and the half- orc Gerona. We don't feel the tension or the outrage or the scandal. The peaks become anti-climactic. The character gallery is huge, but that is alright. It is actually partly realistic and partly upheld by their actions, even if they do die during the course of the movie. I have been a soldier, and while I remember quite a few faces, I remember no name - but I remember all their deeds. Same goes for school, high school, university and in my line of job. A lot of faces, a lot of forgotten names, but also a huge memory for their deeds and misdeeds. It is a great movie. Go see it. It is even good in 3D. No forced objects fly out into face, but the movie give a sense of depth and shadow and light better than I have seen in other movies, maybe even including Star Wars, The Force Awakens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all i will tell you that i took my Girlfriend to this movie with me. she didn't really want to. She never playing any of blizzards game (or any RPG game) before and thought its probably a nerd movie and she would be the single woman in the theater. But being one of the only women in the theater was the only thing she got right. SHE LOVED IT! she actually wanted to watch it again the second it was over (as did I). The Warcraft movie took its time and its been many years since Blizzard started speaking of it, but after watching it I understand why they had waited for so long and took their time in making it. I played WoW and therefore I'm a fan and I loved it!!! This movie exceeded all my expectation. The CGI was the best I've seen, The characters felt alive and The actors were amazing. Everything was amazing and nothing beats the amazing story line of Warcraft. Can't Wait for the sequel!!!!I watched it in the best quality offered in the theaters today: LG IMAX 3D - I truly Recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting a CGI and action overloaded movie without any depths or natural and lovable characters. God was i wrong. I am for the first time seriously ashamed, that I did not make it to the cinema for this movie, because I really crave to see the rest of the planned trilogy, which is of course depending on the financial success. Fimmel and Patton did an amazing job in this flick. I really felt for them and want to know how their story is going to continue. Whereas i thought, that Fimmel's character would be overpowered and simply a brutal warrior, he showed the same range of emotions as he did in Vikings. Good job!Seriously, I have no idea what to say more. Normally I would give it a rating of 8/10 but this surprised me a lot. So 10/10.I want to see more</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all let me say that I never played Warcraft but I played other blizzard Games like Starcraft, Diablo and Overwatch. I enjoyed a lot this movie and want more, much more. I have to say that the movie is actually very good (not great, but very good). The CGI is awesome, they should as example to the next Hulk. The movie could be better? Yes, but honestly, this is probably the best adaptation of a video game. I had no problem to follow the story, the plot is simple (could be better). The names are very complicated to remember (lol). The orcs are the core of the movie, they are much more interesting them the humans in my opinion. I believe the director was so focused in have the CGI right that maybe he forgot the human actors. I don't understand why the "professional" critics were so harsh with this movie.</fullReview>

The backgrounds, the cgi the character generation were all superb. The story itself was excellent. It was well told and kept me guessing in terms of the plot. The acting was really great. Despite this being a larger than life fantasy story the characterisation was excellent with each character having a rounded and interesting take on things. The way the actors were able to play off each other was really good too.It was a gem of a film. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Warcraft today. I was hoping for a decent fantasy movie, not being someone who has played the games, and I was surprised by what I saw but felt it could have been better, as well. The character development was great, but the story was a little off. Not bad, just...off. I'll go into a breakdown of my score.Grade: 9.1/1091/100A-Plot: 9/10 The overall plot for Warcraft was good. I guess it's a prequel to the video games, but as I said, I haven't played the games, but it seemed to be, and that was good. It's a basic story of good versus evil. The only problem with the plot was I felt that the script could have done with another round of editing to smooth out a few of the rough edges. One scene in particular would have been amazing had they handled it better, but I saw it coming from a mile away so it did not have the impact it should have had.Character Development: 9/10 Good characterization all around. A lot of things I thought they were going for in the movie turned out differently than I expected, and sometimes that pleased me and other times it did not. Nothing horribly bad, just...not what I would have gone for. Again, not bad, just I would have given the characters a different ending. But, again, I haven't played the games, so maybe they did get a different ending.Direction: 9/10 The story was told well, but again, another edit might have given the director more to work with-- which is sad because the director co-wrote the screenplay. Casting: 9/10 Casting was almost perfect. A few minor changes I might have made had I been there, but all-in- all, very little I would have changed.Acting: 9/10 Acting was good given the script, and no one felt like they did not want to be there taking part in this world. All the actors really gave their best and did bring their characters to life.Cinematography: 9/10 The visual look of the movie was amazing, but it also felt very much like I was watching a video game cut scene from start to finish. The orcs were well-done, as was Garona, so very little to fault other than the fact you could tell the CGI was CGI.Music: 10/10 Musical score was perfect for the movie. Good job there.Pacing: 9/10 Movie flowed well, though there was a point in the final battle where I just wished they would wrap things up. I know it's a war movie, but sometimes the battles just went on too long.Sets and Costumes: 10/10 Loved the costumes in the movie.Re-watchability: 8/10 One of the most important factors to me in a movie is how many times I want to watch it again. Warcraft was good but I'm not rushing back to the theater to see it again. In fact, I'll buy it on digital download, but if I never see it in theater again, I don't think I'll be missing out. Watch it once in the theater but then decide for yourself if you want to go back or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, exciting journey. Not too shabby for a "bad" movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft is bolstered by fantastic art direction, excellently executed CGI, and a deep world to explore. The lore is sometimes difficult to grasp for the uninitiated, but serves to give the movie a feeling of depth. It was wonderful to see that the characters I ended up connecting with the most were the performance captured Orcs--a true credit to the acting and technical skill on display. The film is infused with so much adventure, visual splendor, and fun that I can easily forgive its small number of short comings. It's not Shakespeare, nor does it need to be. There may be one or two miscast characters as well, but those that fill the rolls cannot be at fault because everyone gives an earnest effort in this slightly flawed, but otherwise wonderful journey. For what a number of critics have deemed a "bad" movie it sure is enjoyable. A sequel would be perfectly welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun for fans. Not absolutely terrible for everyone else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a fan of Warcraft in general, then you probably won't get all the hate that's flowing around the internet. It's pretty much the worst thing ever according to a fair number of critics. Fans of the games, however, do get what they wished for (which is a whole lot).If you've never heard about this war and whatever craft they're talking about, then yes, you'll probably be overwhelmed by all of the names and locations thrown around. Sure, they could have slowed down its pace to make certain that everyone gets what's happening and why. Actually, they probably should have done a bit more in that regard.On the other hand, I'm also very glad that they realized that a fair portion of their audience is already quite familiar with the lore, so they decided to advance some of the story points rather quickly. That means you get to the meat of the movie, the battles, early on. As a Warcraft fan, I can appreciate that and vastly prefer the somewhat rushed plot advancement to, say, a Spiderman situation where you get the same origin every damn time in excruciating detail.The visuals look great, the orcs especially. In fact, I thought the orcs looked a great deal better than the humans did. The latter's armor had a distinctly plastic look to them, especially the king's shoulder guard and helmet. The magic also looked suitably impressive. So yeah, the CGI here works very well for the most part (the clay construct being the exception, that thing was awful).To sum it up: Visually impressive movie that does a great deal to please Warcraft fans. If you've ever watched a video game adaption before and were left disappointed because it was some watered-down mishmash that had little to do with the actual game, then you will appreciate what they did with this movie. To anyone else, yeah it may simply not be for you, which certainly isn't your fault. Just try to accept that this movie isn't terrible at what it tries to do, which is to meet the expectations of an already established fan base first and foremost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who doesn't love Blizzard? It always seemed, everything they touched turned to pure gold. With huge success of Diablo, Warcraft and Starcraft franchises, it always seemed they could not do no wrong. In this case, despite the movie being very decent in its genre, comparing to the current golden age of "comic book\fantasy\sci-fi" cinematography, it certainly does not stand out, as per usual Blizzard standards. The good. The world of Azeroth finally came to life outside of computer screen. The orcs are gorgeous and deep. Despite the excellent game-like action sequences, the movie focuses a bit on a back story (especially the orcs) which I enjoyed very much, as it feels a bit different than usual, all-action choreographed sequence "Avengers" style. It felt like computer game came to life, and that's what we like anyhow. Especially from the Orc side of battles. On top of that the motives of few noble ors, are explained and shown to the perfection. I am a series fan, so it was easy for me to connect the dots in the story. Simply Incredible CGI.The bad. As could be expected, the human acting would fail vs the green screen. First of all, young is not always better! The actors look way too young for their parts. Nearly all of them. Their choreographed fighting scenes doesn't hold a candle to orcs', and the feeling is that The story seems bleak , but as I said in the title, they had to start somewhere. I must mention the apprentice. Clearly wrong casting choice. The studios figured out the potential in "geek" theme movies, so they are cashing in. The true hope that it'll continue, and we'll see real epic movies from that universe in the future. 7/10.</fullReview>

The attention to detail was spectacular. The plot split from the lore a bit, but the essential was there and very well adapted to film. Many nods were made to the fans, the games, the characters, the settings, the armour pieces, the spells, etc. It was familiar, but different in a pleasant way. I felt like I was rediscovering a home. I would see the film again as I feel there is still more to be seen. If you're a fan, don't listen to the **** critics and their **** reviews. Do yourself a big favour and see the movie for yourself. You'll love it.I look forward to Warcraft 2. Onward and upward; FOR THE HORDE!(9/10 as a fan; 7 or 8/10 as the average movie goer that can appreciate fantasy)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an excellent adaptation of the original video game Warcraft (released some 20 years ago).I went in with mediocre expectations but I was blown away by the Story telling / VFX Special Effects and 3D effects. It seems that in this day and age, either critics are paid by Marvel or they just want Marvel Movies to succeed. In my opinion this movie is tons better than Captain America Civil War and in terms of Special Effects its better than X-Men.I would encourage everyone Fans or non-fans to give it a shot as its very rare to find a great Adventurous flick in the age of Automatons and Super Heroes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited to see this movie--and also afraid of having my hopes dashed. There have been so many poorly made fantasy movies made in the past (I'm looking at you The Seventh Son) and I was afraid this one would be no different. But Warcraft is everything I hoped it would be: huge, epic, magical, wondrous... This isn't Lord of the Rings, in many ways it's better. LOTR was so focused on being epic that it felt overly long winded. Granted, I suppose that's due to the source material too, but Warcraft manages to cram a lot into it's under two hour run time. Yes, it has lots of magic; yes, it has lots of action; yes, it is a total escape into a world very different from our own. But somehow, even while the film is packed to the gills with the fantastic, it still manages to stay grounded in characters we care about. I was totally riveted for the entire duration of this fantastic film, and I can't wait for the sequel. I'll admit that I was nervous about seeing this film after hearing all the negative press it's receiving, so I'm happy to report that while some critics may not like this movie, I sure did and I highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warcraft stayed true to its roots and delivered an exciting and well-crafted story. Contrary to many critic reviews, Warcraft was an accessible movie to viewers who may not be immersed in the deep and rich lore of the Warcraft Universe. I do believe that Warcraft could have done a better developing the main characters, and could have done a better job with some of the dialogue. However, all-in-all, Warcraft delivered a compelling, exciting, and sometimes touching experience. In addition, the special effects and graphics presented in Warcraft were among the best in the current state of the art. Warcraft presented magnificent scenery, beautiful architecture, and invigorating battle scenes. Furthermore, Warcraft set a solid stage for developing sequels, which I am sure the fans will appreciate. Here's to Blizzard keeping the story alive and thriving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It misses some marks, but when it hits them, this is a gigantic hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, first of all, I'm a hardcore fan, but I'm also a filmmaker so I'm hoping the two opposite points of view have balanced each other out so I can state my opinion without being too bias. It is rushed... It is. I don't get the point of having a talented director and an Oscar winning editor if the studio execs are gonna make dumb editing decisions. The Director's Cut could have made this a consensual success. Let's hope that the extended version gets released... So there goes the first and biggest problem of this film. Rushed editing. I mean... Really rushed! Performances are just fine. Some even amazing, and some better than others, but luckily no one dropped the ball in a big way. Ben Foster is an amazing actor, and he pulled it off, but he does have such a modern look to him that it might have been a miscast. Same goes with Paula. But Paula also did good. Not great, but good. Charlize Theron killed it with Furiosa. Paula did not. But again... Still OK, maybe she can do better on the next one. In their defense, and they do deserve it cause they overcame the challenges... everything was rushed. I'm pretty sure they would have done better with a slower editing and material with more depth. Which takes us to the Script. It's not amazing. Yep, lots of info to present, not enuf screen time for so many important characters, developments, arcs and emotional moments. Although, thank God, it's not terrible. Neither are some of the action sequences. And the film does feel a little claustrophobic when it comes to locations. Some parts are cheesy, they did not have to be... The emotional parts also suffer from a fast pace... The Soundtrack is not amazing, at all! And it punctuates too much!!! But it is competent enough. So... a LOT of problems. BUT: Here comes the good stuff: - Is has an Orcs's heart. A big beating heart. The movie fights for it's life with such fierce will, that when it connects, when it works, it works big time! - The CGI alone is a big victory. And by that I don't just mean the looks! I mean the performances. It is Movie Magic again! It is something never seen before, again! - It does set a path for bigger and better! This was the hard one. Everything is much easier to do from now on. Warcraft II and III won't have half the challenges this one had, Storytelling-wise and introduction to the Mythology-wise. So big hit in that sense. Duncan was at the same time respectful and disciplined enough on to balance everything out. - The action sequences are at times boring and at times spectacular. When the camera-work and editing work... man, this is just plain awesome. It could have been more tho, hope Duncan evolves in that sense. - The point of view works, surprisingly. Jumping around from the Orcs to the Humans. But it barely does, so that's something to look into in the next one. It works for this one, but it might be hard to manage in sequels... I give it a 10 because I was crying of joy when the film started, which has to mean something of value to it, and it has to do with the story, not the game, and I did not leave the Cinema disappointed. I was relieved and I just wanted to see it again, and I will later on tonight, in IMAX! That says something about the grandiosity of this project! This is HUGE! With all it's problems, Warcraft leaves this battle injured, but also victorious! This can become even bigger then LOTR. But in order to do so, it need to evolve, it needs better pacing and more time for the characters to develop and for us to fall in love with them. It needs to be a 3 hour film. Not 2 hours. Thrall is coming in the next one. And he's a powerhouse of a character. Actually my favorite in the Warcraft lore. I give it a 10 because when it works, it works on the Warcraft level. HUGE!!! When it does not, it's because of the pacing, which I think is solved in the extended version. Fans will love it, big time. Fantasy fans will enjoy it, big time. A whole lot of people new to it will fall in love with it. Others will just have a good time. Lots of people will hate it. Just like lots of people hate other films that other people love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie brought me to tears multiple times, was nearly perfect and is everything I could of hoped for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: Great acting Amazing AMAZING Cgi, Durotans face was so spectacular I wanted to pause the movie and just soak it all in. Guldan is an absolutely terrifying villain ,he might be the scariest villain I have ever encountered in cinema. Tons of fan service and easter eggs. Plenty of emotional tear jerk moments. Cons: The entire plot of this movie could be expanded into a 4 season TV show, a lot was rushed through and plenty of things were missed. I really wish there were a lot more speaking scenes, every time Durotan was on screen talking I felt sucked into the world.Overall if you're a warcraft fan this movie is everything you could ever want, seeing these places you've spent so much time in rendered on the big screen is an incredible experience very few will get to experience. Even if you are not a warcraft fan this movie has plenty for you as well. I'm going to see this at least 3 times while its in theaters , hopefully more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a Warcraft fan, A DEFINITE MUST WATCH! As a non Warcraft gamer, you will still enjoy it nonetheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person who played vanilla World of Warcraft (WoW), I have to say this movie has definitely a lot of fan service! I loved it very much! Duncan Jones is an excellent director, and I am so glad he's the one chosen to direct it. The acting was great!!! Special attention to Toby Kebbell, who plays as Durotan! The CG and motion capture were marvellous! The fight scenes &amp; sound effects were awesome!!!!!! My only concern about this movie was the pacing... :( I sincerely feel that it would have been a BETTER movie if it were stretched to at least 2.5hours or 3 hours.Many scenes were done very swiftly and zoom, onto the next scene. The audience doesn't really get the chance to digest and fully appreciate each scene properly. Due to each scene being shot so quickly, I felt there wasn't enough character development for the characters in the movie.The emotions weren't captured too well due to the pacing, which is surprising, given how good Duncan Jones is at playing the emotional card in his movies, Moon &amp; Source Code.I cry easily whenever I watch movies with any angst/tragedy. However, I did not shed a single tear even at moments, which are supposedly moving/touching in this movie. :( This also means... I wasn't engaged emotionally or felt connected with the characters. Not Duncan Jones' fault, but I guess it is hard to squeeze such awesome content into 2hours worth of movie (again, it should be a 3hr movie!) Next, as a non-Warcraft gamer, you may not understand certain terms or the backstory of certain characters. To WoW gamers, we already know the significance of Durotan &amp; Frostwolf clan, Medivh, Khadgar &amp; Lothar etc. However, even if you're a non-Warcraft gamer, perhaps you would still be able to appreciate the cool CG and stuff. But, as for the story plot, you may not be able to follow at times due to your lack of knowledge of Warcraft lore.I also feel that there isn't a need for the "romance" theme between Lothar &amp; Garona. It felt pretty forced. Orgrim Doomhammer is from Blackrocks while Durotan is from Frostwolf. Again, no time to show origins of Orgrim, so the non-gamers would probably assume that Orgrim is from Frostwolf (based on this movie). Also, the ending of Durotan was different from the lore =x However, due to being a Warcraft fan since its early days, this movie will gain a 10/10 from me on IMDb. But personally to me, it's about a 7 or 8.The movie did show Grommash Hellscream, but then again, the focus isn't on him this movie. No mention of Sargeras in this movie either. Therefore, I look forward to a sequel~ if any~ =D Why? Because it's w-a-r-c-r-a-f-t! THRALL! FOR THE HORDE! Our favourite game on the big screen!!! and it is not a flop! It's good, not very good, but good enough.Warcraft lore, there's SO MUCH to tap upon... so much potential!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent job Duncan. We can feel your passion through the filmThis film perhaps has the most awesome visual this year. Story set is great also. I know there'll be fans lore who doesn't agree with this. But remember this is A FILM which doesn't have to follow the books or game. I for one would like to see some new and better story out of warcraft. Only flaw to this film sadly is the human acting. Hopefully next installment will have actor/actress with more charisma powerI know critics are rating it bad. But hey, they almost always give bad rating to any game based film. Don't believe everything they say, especially about fantasy film. Just go see it yourself whether you're a gamer or not. I promise You'll enjoy the film. I for one will go to see it again with my friends.I can't wait for the sequel. Yeah, there'll be a sequel. The curse on game based film will finally broke. I see this film will reap at least $500 million dollars. Possibly will break $1 billion at box officeGreat movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it. Brought so many memories back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning Spoilers!!!! Saw it this past weekend. Really loved it to bits. Sure it's not going to fulfil your plot expectations if you're expecting "Tinker, Tailor,Soldier Spy" but it checks all the boxes of a half decent narrative and fantastic art and lore. There's so much fan expectations to be met so I'm really surprised they pulled it off this well. It also sets the stage well for future films which I'll be eager to see at the Cinema. This is really something to experience on the big screen (although I prefer 2D to see more detail).It's really a great experience all way through and at no point was I getting bored or annoyed with any character- if fact when the film was done I was like "What? Already? I want More!" which to me is a sign of success.That said and the reason I'm not giving it 10 stars outright is that for me personally I would have preferred if the plot around Medivh's turning to the Fell was better conceived. How was he corrupted and why did he hide it so well? Was it a split-personality thing? We get no answer but to "avoid isolation" as his dying words. That together with a smidgen of more humour would do well in a next iteration. There is a lot of good humour in the Warcraft universe and I think they can capitalise on that a bit more.All in all a great film - I want more!</fullReview>

Anyhow, I hope people will see the movie and just enjoy it for what it is... a war movie.My wife and I loved it and in fact we watched it twice. I am coming in the movie as a Warcraft fan-boy... having played the RTS, WoW (quit already) and consumed the books (lore)... my wife was a WoW player but she wasn't in the lore as much as I was. Lore-wise, they changed things... BUT I am OK with the changes.I had friends who are not gamers and did not know anything about Warcraft and they came out loving the movie and not is intrigued by it... and are now wanting to read the books. There were a couple of guys I knew who because of the film downloaded WoW and started playing it.I believe this is the best adaptation of a video game IP and I do hope that there will be a sequel. Awesome work Duncan Jones!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat in my seat with a big smile on my face from the very beginning to the very end, that is why my subjective score for this movie is 9/10, but it does have it's faults. I personally knew that the events of the movie took place over a long period of time, but because there is so much story to tell, it feels like the time line is just a couple of weeks. The story jumps from Horde to Alliance to much, and some of the scenes might be considered "cringey". BUT, with all that said, this movie portrays the Warcraft universe in a great way, some might be annoyed that they changed the story, but I personally feel it was necessary considering the length of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was among those who played Warcraft and WOW at its first launch, so I did hold a lot of feelings for this movie. Maybe to those audience who don't understand the story line it is not as exciting as Lord of the Rings, but all in all this movie has followed and presented the story very well, indeed much better than those game-based movies made in the past. Before watch the actual movie I was a little disappointed with the movie trailer but when sat in the cinema and the story unfolds I was amazed and exited from the beginning to the end.Blizzard is the company truly delivers quality and that should be the thing most appreciated by us nowadays.

		<fullReview>Lets starts with the positives! 1. The visuals were beautiful, something which blew me away. The Orcs looked amazing as did the magic and backgrounds. Was amazing to see locations from the game on the big screen. All looked stunning. Nothing ever seriously felt out of place CGI wise to me. Fight scenes between the races were great. 2. The acting was well done and the characters were interesting, even if they all had little screen time to themselves. Personally my favourite was Khadgar. I wasn't sure what to expect from Ben from the trailers, but I feel he brought the character to life perfectly well! Gul'Dan made a great and chilling villain also. A villain that I just loved to hate!3. Great and unique story filled with plenty of drama and action. The ending was very open, a little dulled down after all the action but it did it's job and makes me want to see more!My issues with the film were:1. Needed to be longer. By at least an hour. So much is trying to be told in one go that at times it did feel the story and characters weren't as developed as they could potentially have been. While the characters were interesting and fun to watch I felt that, as I said before, they needed a lot more screen time to get to know them and their issues even better. 2 hours just wasn't enough time. I could definitely see this being a problem to newcomers. It's almost like you're finally getting into the story and really starting to empathise and then woosh! New story to follow with new characters! I was never that confused since I am a fan of the games, but again, it may be hard for newcomers.2. King Llane... To an extent. Dominic's performance wasn't bad, but but I feel that he could have been a little more assertive as a King. It sometimes felt as though he was holding back a little but hey, perhaps this was just due to the lack of screen time and an inability to get to know his character well.3. A character that was blatantly put there as a plot device. Those who have seen the film all know who I'm talking about.Overall: Damn, I want a sequel! A wonderful start to introducing Warcraft! Just make sure the next one is longer, please ;)</fullReview>

They make it blended so perfectlyAfter watching this, I'm so exciting to touch the PC and play that game again. I don't know why, maybe the movie touched me so much. :)one advice, if you a "cannot wait" person, don't watch it now. because you would feel so teribble to know that you have to wait 1-2 year for the next sequel.so Watch it now, but don't blame me if you feel good and regret later :)</fullReview>

It made rules for its own "universe" and didn't troll you by breaking them to plug a plot hole.

Granted, it is no ground-braking work like the "Lord of the Rings" but it is a very solid piece of entertainment which looks visually stunning at times. Not a single minute was boring, the story (though a departure from World of Warcraft lore as a die-hard fan of the game who watched it with me mentioned) never got cheesy and the acting was up to par. Maybe critics were looking for a work of art and simply got entertainment and that made them so hostile. As an average Joe of a movie goer I got my money's worth here and that is a lot more than can be said about other recent big studio productions.</fullReview>

Only cons I see here is that there were a plenty of references that guys what are not related with Warcraft don't get, and some lore changes made me angry too but those were actually details and if I am not looking at these cons, this movie was one of the best movies I've ever seen.

		<fullReview>This is not a perfect movie for the normal viewer, but it's perfect for the players. Technically is far away to be perfect (CGI is good, but not excellent, the plot could create confusion in not-gamer viewers, etc.), but for a Warcraft and fantasy fan those are minor flaws. I was scared by the chance to see the original story completely destroyed but, besides some differences, at the end of the movie I was completely satisfied since the key points of the story was respected. One of the my favorite feature of the film is magic: powerful, spectacular but has its cost, so the magic-users in the film are exhausted after using their spells (I haven't checked but I think that they have respected even the casting time of single spell). The movie is structured to be the first of a saga, I really hope that the box office success will be enough to ensure us new chapters.GLORY TO THE ALLIANCE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this with no prior knowledge, no reviews and only by my previous experience of playing the games I went in with cautious optimism and what I got was a solid action fantasy, with well defined characters and admittedly simple story, but kept the film grounded, so when I eventually checked out the reviews I was really taken aback by how negative they were and after carefully looking through them, I hate to say it, but there is clear biases, they wanted to hate this movie, I even saw one review compare it to Battlefield Earth, BATTLEFIELD EARTH!?! Really? I concede Warcraft is no masterpiece but its no where near the ineptitude of Battlefield Earth and there are unfair comparisons to Lord of the Rings, this isn't that kind of movie, it actually reminds me a lot of Conan the Barbarian(original). Now like I said, it is flawed, I found some of the scene transitions didn't flow as smoothly as it should, so there are obvious cuts they made to keep the movie confined in its run time, but I can't help but think it could've really done with them scenes in so i expect a directors cut in the near future, also and this is a double edge sword mind, the movie does rely on the audience being familiar with the lore and world, but I think the casual moviegoer would get a kick out of this without prior knowledge. The CGI was impressive and the action scenes were top notch, I even felt like I was in the games and even took a lot of risks and went into surprisingly different directions. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big Warcraft nerd, and I absolutely adored this movie. So first, let's talk about the pros of this movie. The visuals were spot on, the orcs were phenomenal, especially CLancy Brown as Durotan and Daniel Wu as Guldan. The action was gritty and brutal, if it weren't for the PG-13 rating, they would have gone all out. The story was, IMO, well-adapted considering how vast the lore is.Now for the cons, other than Khadgar and Anduin, I felt very little for the humans. They were bland, or too good, we didn't see their prejudice against orcs, we don't even see any doubt Garona, they just accept her immediately. Hopefully, in the next movie, we see a lot more grey or black morality human characters, especially after Garona's "betrayal". Also, Blackmoore is definitely going to show up sometime, so the scumbag human part is all accounted for.All in all, it's a good start for the WoW universe, and a great push towards better video game movies. I'd say watch it if you have the time.</fullReview>

When the Orcs enter Azeroth, the movie gets really good.If there will be any more Warcraft movies, Duncan MUST put more work on the acting and dialogue of the other races...humans for example. And one more thing, in taverns and other places, it was to "clean". Almost did feel like a cheap TV series in some places.All the CGI scenes was really excellent!

		<shortDescription>This is for the fans, non-players of the game, best of luck.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I've literally just got back from seeing the movie. Maybe a bad idea as the hype is still on my mind, but regardless.First of all, ignore the critics who are saying "Disaster" and "tragedy". They are wrong. If you were ever anticipating this film and then were put off by all the horrendous reviews, go see it. Make your own opinion of it.THE GOOD:- The CGI, holy Christ was it good, especially on the Orcs. The magic used in the film is super pretty as well. - Combat scenes. Admittedly there are a few interactions between the Mo-cap Orcs and Humans that look a bit clumsy. But that aside, and the fighting is everything you'd hope for in a Warcraft movie.- The Story. There are a fair few deviations from the lore that I wasn't particularly on-board with, but in the grander scale it doesn't really affect the outcome of the story. But there is one pretty significant change that was an "interesting" decision. You'll know what I mean when you see it.- Characters. Now this is kind of a double edged sword. Whereas Lothar's son feels like an incredibly un-needed character. Ben Schnetzer's Khadgar was great, probably the most evolved of the characters at the films end. - Fanservice. There is a tonne of Easter eggs in this film. And I mean, a tonne. I won't give any away, but I'm sure I missed a decent handful. Most of them are nice and subtle, but a few characters that you'd recognise are placed in the background and did briefly draw me out of the scene at hand.- The Horde. This isn't even down to me being a Horde player, but as the film fairly depicts both sides of the events of "The First War", I personally found much more interest in the Horde. I was fangirling pretty hard seeing Durotan and Orgrim converse, seeing baby Thrall, watching Gul'Dan be a dick, it was great. The brutality of the original horde is communicated extremely well through their sheer barbarism. Not to say that the Alliance side of things was boring, there was just definitely some very two-dimensional characters within the Alliance that made their side much less intriguing.THE BAD:- The Pacing. Now this, was the worst trait of the film by far. It is made incredibly unclear in the film how much time has passed and you are jumping between several narratives and just as one starts to come clear, you jump to another. In what was a 2 hour film, it probably should've been given another hour to calm its pace and give time to expose more of the lore to the non-gamers of Warcraft.- Script. Now, as a screen writing student, this is the thing I look to please me most in films. And although I put it under "The Bad", that's not to say it was awful. It just definitely wasn't good. The overall tone of the film is surprisingly dark and that is perceived relatively well. But there are some debatable one-liners in the film and just moments where you're like "Yeah, he wouldn't have said that".- Continuity. This wasn't a major issue as it was small things. One moment, an Orc is speaking common, but in the next scene struggles to understand the human language and speaks Orcish again.- Duration. Too short. Way too short. Trying to force feed the audience with all the Lore pre and during Warcraft: Orcs and Humans was never gonna work in a 2 hour movie. Had it been like an hour longer they could've slowed the pacing which would've probably made this the perfect video-game movie. VERDICT:The inevitable happened with this film. This film is made for the players. Although the intention was to open the story up to everyone, for me, it worked, as a long-time player, I immediately picked it up and fell in love, yet my friends who are non-players came out like, well it was pretty, but who was this, why did this happen, etc.I can understand where SOME reviewers were coming from with their confusion in the film and its jumbled attempt to convey a hugely dense amount of lore into a 2 hour movie. I'm glad some people were impressed enough to give it 8's and 9's. To me, this film definitely had its flaws. But, this is certainly not a bad film. Although non-players will most likely not attract to the story and it may seem hugely confusing as you are overwhelmed with lore, it's certainly a beautiful film in its visuals. Alas, if you are a fan of Warcraft no matter how big or small, you should see this film, watching the characters and universe you've known for the past two decades finally come to life in stunningly beautiful aesthetics is something that no fan of this franchise could hate. I liked it enough that I will be going to see it again, hopefully to find more of the Easter eggs I missed in the first run. Also, who doesn't want to see a Lich King movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, Warcraft is a solid movie that will appeal to both fans of the games as well as others. The acting is good, the plot is not overly simplified and the effects are nothing short of amazing. However, one major shortcoming haunts the movie, which is a lack of proper character building and story arc. Everything seems a little rushed to get the plot going, which is a shame when there is so much lore and character background from the games. Its OK that the storyline diverts from the games a little here and there, but its less forgivable that the story is rushed so much. Its clear that more movies will follow, so there was no need to throw so much into one movie instead of letting the story flow a little slower and allow a more complex narrative to unfold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ill keep this short and to the point, i really wanted to love this movie but im sad to say im now downgrading after consideration.As a fan of the Warcraft universe i would of liked a few more goosebumps. No Sagearas, no dragons and no starting summary to the movie; Therefore failing to set the scale and epicness of the story which should of been done at the very start.The positives are that this movie looks spectacular on screen, making the characters and locations look truly amazing. Should of been spectacular, it was just okay. Disappointed. Generous 6/10All in all though decent watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent fantasy visual spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a decent fantasy movie (among the best actually). If you go in not expecting much or you are a Warcraft fan (the original RTS titles) you will be pleasantly surprised.Pros: The story was decent (since it is based 100% of the original WC1 story). The visuals and sound effects were brutally good. The main villain was terrifying enough. The actors were good overall.Cons: The plastic armors of the footman looked terrible (especially comparing it to the bad-ass CGI orcs). Some dialogues were so cheesy most of the audience cannot help, but laugh. Lothar was Ragnar Lothbrok 100%, and as much as I like the character it was a bit off here, feels like the actor can play only one role. The story was not well paced at all and it felt very rushed in the first half.Overall: I wholeheartedly recommend the film to fans and fantasy lovers alike. It is a visual spectacle with decent story and decent characters. Well done! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be better but no where near as bad as the "critics" say it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I've been waiting for this movie to come out ever since the rumors in 2007. I've played WoW and some WC3 in the past so I knew some of the lore. I went to see the movie on the first day, on the 26th. I read some of the early reviews before I went to see it, so I didn't really have high expectations. I think acting for the most part wasn't really great but it was OK. I think Gul'dan and Khadgar were good, Ben Foster played Mediv very well. Lothar and King Llane lacked emotion and Gorona was just bad... CGI was great, I've never seen anything like it. The only thing I really didn't like was the shortness of the movie. Most people here are saying that the story develops too fast and that's true. For people with no knowledge of WC's lore, it's a little hard to understand. I think if the movie was 30min longer, all that wouldn't be a problem. I enjoyed it but it didn't really meet my expectations. I was hoping for 3+ hours of epicness. But I'm sure if they make a sequel, it's going to be much better.I'd rate it around 7.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and entertaining - with a few significant flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a gamer - and I've played all the Warcraft games. I never particularly cared for the stories in those games, though, so I didn't go into this with much in the way of preconceived notions.Based on the trailer, I was expecting an underwhelming popcorn B-movie with bad CGI.I was pleasantly surprised.First of all, I have to say the CGI is absolutely gorgeous. I've seen a lot of movies, believe me, and this has to be one of the most convincing fantasy films in terms of visuals alone. The Orcs in particular - are amazing.Anyway, in terms of the heart of the film - the story, characters and the acting - it's sort of a mixture of good and bad. The story itself is simple but effective - and it makes enough sense to give you a reason to care. That said, it's very high-fantasy stuff - and I'm sure some people will be turned off by the emphasis on extravagant magic and such.As for the acting, well, it's a mixed bag. Ironically, the human characters face the most trouble here. Ben Foster as Medivh, for instance, doesn't seem to connect with his role. He looks and sounds as if he's struggling with the material - and as if he regrets being there. Travis Fimmel as Lothar is better, but he also seems to have a hard time just standing still and looking normal. It's as if he's constantly trying to emote something, which makes him over-act on more than one occasion. Paula Patton as Garona goes back and forth between powerful, genuine expression and cringe-worthy melodrama. Surprisingly, I found Ben Schnetzer the best and most convincing actor, playing Khadgar. He was fun and not at all the comic relief I expected him to be.On the opposite side of the coin, we have the Orcs - and to put it simply, they're ALL great. They look incredible and the actors behind them give them real weight and pathos. Durotan, Gul'dan and Blackhand are particularly convincing and masterfully executed. The whole movie might well be better if it was all about these guys.Now, for the action. It's amazingly well done. I saw the movie in 3D - and the live actors meshed convincingly with the animated models - and the action sequences were more or less perfect. I didn't detect a single "bad 3D" moment - which is extremely rare. Very exciting stuff, for sure.Speaking of 3D - something I generally don't care much for, this was an exception. Everything jumped out of the screen at you - and it didn't seem tacked on at all. The spectacle felt appropriately close to you - and the striking background images were just fabulous on a grand scale.Sadly, it's not all roses from there. The ending was rushed - and everything wrapped up too quickly - and it didn't quite convince as a plausible series of events towards the end.There's a pretty serious lack of character development in the beginning of the film. The Orcs invade - and the humans seem strangely laid-back and almost casual in their initial response. Things happen without enough build-up. It's 20 or 30 minutes too short for the scale of what's going on, in my opinion.Unfortunately, there's also a somewhat unnecessary subplot involving the son of Lothar - and there's a problem with his acting and the age difference seems off. Lothar simply doesn't look or feel like a father to me. To make it worse, events related to father and son are too cliché and needed more impact.Things like these mean the movie isn't all it could have been.However, the critics are flat-out unfair - and if you're into fantasy movies and a touching spectacle, you need to go see this in the theater, and for once, you should go with 3D.I truly hope it will do enough business to warrant a sequel. Duncan Jones did well here, but he can do even better - and I'd love to see full justice done to the material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bucket list.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't express how long I have been waiting for this movie. it's been over 10 years now, was it what I expected? TBH not really but that does not mean that the movie was bad, on the contrary the movie was great for what it is which is a fantasy video game implemented movie.Pros:1- The acting was incredible, I must say Duncan seems like a great guy because he managed to reach the actors on how to approach a scene because of a specific incident that occurred during the movie. There were some flaws with the acting especially during a drunk scene (ill leave it at that for spoilers sake).2- It's a video game movie, so that's what i meant by "its great for what it is" keeping in mind that the most successful video game movies were (Tomb raider &amp; Prince of Persia) any other video game movie wasn't a hit or anticipated as much, could argue mortal Kombat the first movie was OK cause you know Nostalgia.3- Easter eggs, every Easter egg I've encountered was incredible A HUGE SMILE just happened naturally cause I am indeed a fan boy. Was expecting more Easter eggs but then it would've been official that they were trying to appeal their community more than anyone else. So in other words a median of Easter eggs were there, not too much or little.4- LORE, as many of you know the lore/story is massive. As a fan or a WoW player I knew what was coming, and I loved what I've seen in a way. The approach was OK as a player but I will come back to this point in the cons.5- 3D and special effects, AMAZING there is no other word, the effects used in the movie were AMAZING (cutting edge technology). They spent every dime they could to achieve it. CGI was great, I'm sure if I get a chance to see it again there would be flaws there, CGI was used a lot which makes room for error/flaws.--------------------------------------------------------------------Cons:1- Lore Pace (LORE continued), some argued it was fast some said it was slow, I think it took its time to build up, maybe because I knew all the information (lore). On the other hand for viewers new to the Warcraft world it could've been fast paced so it was sort of IMHO an attempt that wasn't met perfectly to appeal toward viewers who have no idea what Warcraft is.2- Sound effects, I don't know if I have hearing problems (not that I am aware of) but some of the action sequences were not in sync with sound effects (spear thrusting, swords slashing, etc....).3- Special effects + Lore/story, the combination of these two aspects don't compliment each other in the theaters, I mean its either this or that, which is in any Sci-fi movie really. lets take avatar as an example, it was so pretty when it came out I enjoyed the 3D which kind of distracted my concentration towards the movie's story/plot, but when I got the chance to watch again it on a small screen, I appreciated the story more.4- Video game attachment to characters VS. movie attachment to characters, this is an important point because the first game came out in 1994 so that was 22 years of character attachment and development. The movie was 120 mins, to meet or acquire the same level of attachment is impossible since time is a huge factor which we've seen in many fan based movies. So when it comes to having a certain character go through a dramatic incident in the movie, viewers won't really care, but I remember all these incidents in the comics/game and how affected I was by it because time was invested in the games. Memorable game quotes:Terenas Menethil "WHAT ARE YOU DOING MY SON?" Arthas Menethil "SUCCEEDING YOU FATHER!"Grom: "Thrall... the blood haze has lifted... the demon's fire has burnt out in my veins....I...have...freed...myself..." Thrall: "No, old friend...you've freed us all"I remember these plots in the game, hell most of us shed a tear for it and were extremely excited for what's to come. these quotes were only an example and have nothing to do with the current movie.5- ORCS baaaad, due to the implementation of many orcs in lots of movies, its just fact orcs are bad, and it doesn't seem to show that orcs can be good in the movie as much as I hoped for, altho they focused more on orcs than humans because having good orcs is a new concept for most, they had to do that.6- movie title, Warcraft the beginning? really? I blame blizzard on that part, you've had loads of titles for comics &amp; expansions but you went with "the beginning" ?? you came up with the name Blizzard from a dictionary, where's your passion BLIZZARD that was disappointing.Rating verdict ----------------&gt; 8/10The movie will build in the coming sequels, all I can do right now is hope. For better or for worse I will stand by the movies and will love them no matter what. For the Horde!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie with flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the movie today and here's my non-spoiler review: Disregard anything the critics say about this movie and go watch it, it's a great film that has its flaws, but they don't take much from the overall experience. First off the CGI is simply the best I've ever seen, and I think everyone who has seen the movie will agree with this claim, everything from the orcs to magic, to the environments look great on screen and mash well together. Acting ranges from serviceable to great, honorable mentions are Durotan, Lothar, Khadgar and Medivh. Garona which I had the most worry for turned out okay in the end, but her makeup doesn't really hold that well against the normal humans or the fully CGI'ed characters, especially in close ups where her tusks look a bit cheap and can get off putting in some shots. Some of the characters felt like extras, one of them was from my top 3 most anticipated characters, they don't really get to shine as much as you'd like them to. The soundtrack is good but not as epic or as melodic as in the games, the orc music was better in my opinion than the alliance ones, it was more memorable at least for me. The movie mainly suffers from its pacing, its a 2 hour film that should've been at the very least 2.5 to 3 hours. Everything happens so fast that I'm sure non fans will have a hard time relating to some of the characters, the plot is well explained but some characters get very little screen time that you don't feel attached enough to them when they're involved in dramatic scenes.The movie also suffers from a forced romantic relation between Garona and Lothar which we've seen in the trailers, it wasn't necessary to the plot and felt out of place in one particular scene. And lastly there's one fight that was a bit underwhelming probably cause it was spoiled in the trailers / TV spots, it feels quite rushed when it could've at least lasted a minute or two. That's mostly it for the negative parts. Everything else is simply outstanding, from the scenery to the cinematography to the Easter eggs. The fight scenes are quite epic as you might imagine as well as the world building, you get to see a glimpse of could be included if they ever make a sequel which I really hope they will. Final verdict: Warcraft is a fantastic movie that is held by back by some shortcomings, above all it is an entertaining movie that never gets boring or dull at any moment, it's what we fans have been waiting for, considering that of all the things that could've gone wrong I can gladly say Warcraft hit the mark. My score is 8/10. Should there ever be an extended edition, with more scenes to flesh out some characters and slow the pace a bit, this can easily get a 9/10. Go watch this movie, because let me tell you one thing, if this movie gets a sequel we're gonna witness something really special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like many people I know spend at least ten hours a day streaming movies on services like Netflix or Amazon. I like to believe that due to my extensive experience watching and critiquing films as well as studying all aspects of the film making process, my opinion carries some weight. Having said that I would like to also say that Warcraft was the best video game to film adaptation I have ever seen. It had everything a geek could want and more. Not only did it stay more true to the source material than any other adaptation, it also paid a glorious amount of attention to detail. This film transported me into Azeroth. Every single scene was filled with recognizable content. Ranging from the characters to the background it was familiar and accurate. The film painted an exact replica of my imagination. Taking my experiences while playing any warcraft title and making them real. It was literally heart poundingly real, thanks to amazing work from the special effects team. I could not give this movie a higher rating. I saw this movie on Friday and promised I would never write a shotgun review. Luckily, my opinion has not changed within that time. In fact, it has actually grown on me and is calling me back to the theater. THATS RIGHT! I am going to see Warcraft again tomorrow evening. I promise you it is worth it.Pros - Visuals, attention to detail, action, some of the characters (Gul'dan, Durotan, Orgrim=Fantastic performances), comedy, story, unique. Cons - only one! I could not get behind the acting of Khadgar. His accent would change a couple times throughout the film which as a result pulled me from the illusion.BOTTOM LINE - Must watch. At the very least 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft: At long last, re-energizing high fantasy on the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So needless to say, Blizzard have spent a large part of their time in gaming business as the largest game developer around even though consoles finally caught up with Call of Duty and GTA series. However there is little doubt that Blizzard has, at least historically, been THE developer for quality and story in their games. Warcraft, and in particular the hugely successful MMO World of Warcraft, might be considered a pinnacle of gaming. So there was hardly a surprise that eventually Blizz was going to turn at least one of their franchises into a movie. And it was announced. And we waited. And we waited. And waited... Needless to say that after 10 years in development expectations have come and gone, just as World of Warcraft made its incredible legacy along the way. I went from being curious, to being very excited, to losing interest, and finally to being quite ambivalent about the project. But enough of this framework.'Warcraft' as a movie adaption is a beautiful work of art. You find a good mix of Easter eggs around but it does not come out as a fan-service movie - comparing with 'The force awakens', Warcraft stands on its own a whole lot better. A great cast, enticing music, clever perspectives, epic battles, amazingly well in-blended CGI, magic, swords, mythical creatures and orcs. Yes, fantasy has made a return with a vengeance to the big screen and 'Warcraft' brings it back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is good, however it feels a little disjointed.My Background: I have played some WC3 and WoW so i recognize the names but I have no idea how close the movie follows the source material.Overall: The movie has some good moments that feel epic and fantastic, however the movie is very forgettable, partly due to how fast it moves between goals and characters. I am not a fan of The lord of the Rings movies but they did manage to have more buildup to the battles and made the encounters feel epic. Warcraft suffers from that a lot of the battles and fights feel like a series of skirmishes with various amount of importanceCostumes, makeup &amp; CG: The Costumes and CG were great, I loved the Orcs and the armored humans. It all felt just like the video game and lent the movie a fantastic feeling that a lot of fantasy movies lack by feeling like just medieval history movies with a few fantastical elements.World: The movie is beautiful, the 3D is good but probably unnecessary. The dark portal and the few scenes we see of the orc camps are fantastic with a lot of recognize-ability for fans. However it feels under-utilized, for people who are not familiar with the world (read: those who don't squee at the Murloc cameo) it is generic and doesn't give you a clear idea of where things are happening on the map.Final: In all honesty the movie feels like scenes from the RTS game with the game-play bits in between cut out. The story was better told and more engaging in the WC3 manual and the world was more exciting in WoW. It's hard to tell if the movie would have been better as a TV series or a trilogy to allow the world to grow but as a stand alone movie it fails to live up to it's potential. In a few years the movie will probably be forgotten and will only be viewed if it leads to better sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another film that did not please the "bazingueiros". Reason? "Nothing is explained." The MCU has created a film pattern in which everything needs to be explained in detail, but the individual who judges 'nerd' can not understand. That bothers me a lot. It is a dynamic film, and even original, which EITHER blend the aesthetics of cinema as the aesthetics of video games. For Warcraft fan then, it is a full plate. All represented here: the scenery, the names, the fall of some places, the creation of the Alliance. And put like film is fun. It's just complicated to guys geek who is watching the film and moving the "smart" phone, updating status Instagram and Snapchat. Read straight and follow is not lost. I saw people saying they did not understand what happens to characters and saying he did not know where the world was going on. Seriously guys, we will learn to READ more subtitles, shall we? Big Movie, and hope that come the next THE SAME WAY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit that the story may be confusing for viewers who are not familiar with the Warcraft universe, this is by far the best movie based on video game source material. Unlike most movies that turn out far worse than the trailer, Warcraft is surprisingly better than the trailers and promotional material.The story is much more complex and actions of the characters have significant consequences, unlike most other video game and fantasy movies where the "good guys" always win. Unfortunately, the story does begin abruptly, so for people not familiar with Warcraft, keep an open mind and let yourself get into the world of Azeroth.I hope Blizzard will continue to make more movies in the Warcraft universe, as the story has only just begun. Oh, and please make an Overwatch movie as well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expected less, got more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>tl;dr- Good mix of action and story, sometimes got lost on what is happening.The character growth felt like it was meant to be the strongest part of the movie because it touches on so many characters. In the end only two characters are actually strong, Lothar and Durotan. All the other characters acted predictably, almost comically. This made the movie pretty boring, and was exciting when there was fighting or a scene with Durotan or Lothar story plot. These two characters made the movie worth seeing. The two were not unworldly strong but showed growth, pain, and strength from experience. Just because they are the main characters does not mean they should be the only characters with depth.The CGI was very good, especially the Orcs. The designs of the Orc clothing, weapons and general culture (skulls as helmets or mantels, war paint, etc) is exactly how most people would imagine an orc. Humans were a little different. Duncan tried to capture the Humans as they are in the game, but this made them feel unrealistic and unrelatable. It worked with the Orcs because it is what is expected while capturing individualism and proportional to their body. The Humans looked like a comic book character that wasn't trying to be a comic book character by mixing realism with cartoon features.The fight scenes weren't bad, but aren't memorable either. Typical hack-and-slash fights, some awkward stumbling and stabbing if paying attention, but the general fights are what the viewer comes to see. Large battles, people being thrown around, and overcoming the odds of the fight through skill vs numbers.I would see this movie again, but isn't a great movie. When Blizzard spoke about the development of this movie as "A mix of 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Avatar'", it can be imaged in some areas how it was attempted to do both, but accomplished nothing great, but failed at nothing either.7/10 for above average and well above my expectations for this movie, let alone a video game movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was an amazing movie! So much fan service, yet anyone who has never played the Blizzard games or read the lore(s) will still be able to understand and follow along as the story progressed. DO NOT expect this movie to be gritty. Blizzard's IPS are known for their own twists on genres. What I mean by that is there will be a lot of humor in them. But also a butt ton of high grade action violence. You will love all the characters. When someone important dies, it makes sense. You hate seeing it happen, but you accept it and move along with the movie's story line. Where they end the movie sets up the sequel and leaves you wanting move of the story. DO NOT go in comparing it to other fantasy movies or you will just knit pick through it all and not enjoy the story. So go watch it and enjoy it. I surely did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it an amazing movie? Nah. It's definitely flawed, but so is every other film. But is it good, fun, and entertaining? Absolutely. I went to see this film with two of my friends, one a girl and one a guy, neither of whom have even so much as touched the Warcraft series. Both of them really enjoyed this movie. They not only plan to buy it, but say they enjoyed it more than Civil War. I can't say anything there as I haven't seen Civil War, but I still really enjoyed it. It's very true to the lore, with only a handful of minor changes and maybe one moment where I went "waaaaiiit a second, I don't think that's accurate". The CGI was AMAZING, the soundtrack was fantastic, and the acting was good all-around. The magic was also REALLY cool and felt very accurate to the Warcraft universe. Some of my favorite parts were just the interactions between Durtan and Drakka and Durotan and Ogrim. For CGI orcs, they had fantastic chemistry and were very believable. My only real complaints:Lothar makes a few too many quips. He was obviously meant to be a joking and sarcastic character, but there was a point where it got to be a little too much, IMO.The first 20 minutes is a big info-dump. For newcomers, this might be a little much to take in. It's a lot like watching the first episode of Game of Thrones where it's attempting to introduce you to every character and land and explain their motivations and who they are.Some characters didn't get a chance to be fleshed out and developed. King Llane was kind of just there for the most part, he never really got any story or development for himself. But I can sort of forgive this because the main focus characters like Khadgar, Medivh, the various Orcs, etc. were all the most entertaining and got a fair bit of development.So, if you enjoy the Warcraft series, you'll probably enjoy this. If you enjoy fantasy in general, you'll also probably enjoy this. Honestly, I'd say to go see this movie if just to support more high- budget game films. Don't listen to the critics who went into this with a negative bias. Worse than the Mario Bros. movie? Don't make me laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MUCH Better than "Critic" Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like the Warcraft franchise or just the genre of fantasy, you will enjoy this movie. For Warcraft fans, this film does deviate some from official lore, but Blizzard did confirm this months ago, and it wasn't really anything major that distracted me from enjoying the movie. The movie looks amazing; they truly did a job that is worthy of a special effects Oscar nomination, if not a win, in that category. The acting was decent for a cast in which the biggest name is Paula Patton, but don't expect the wizards to remind you of Gandalf, Saruman, or Dumbledore, or anything else of that nature. I'm not going to get into the ins and outs of the movie, but I will say that my biggest complaint was the dwarfs; that was the only visual I was not impressed with. Ironforge looked amazing, the the dwarfs as a race did not. Folks, don't listen to movie critics you probably rarely agree with anyway. This is a fun movie! It's not going to contend for movie of the year, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Against all bad reviews ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a lot of bad reviews and bad ratings from Rotten and Metacritic and other subjective biases critics. Don't follow them. The movies is very well done with a good Warcraft screenplay, good acting and fantastic CGI. Indeed i was a little skeptical at the beginning as most of the games based movies are pretty bad but this is not the case. I really hope there will be sequels as the possibilities are quite limitless in this huge universe. In short terms i was not disappointed but thrilled. Duncan Jones and the cast crew really did justice to the franchise. Not everyone can grasp what Warcraft is really about. I enjoyed it very much and most of the Warcraft fans will be left speechless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not have much to say other then that the critics are so wrong ! Don't listen to them they have absolutely horrible taste. Just to add i am not even a "Warcraft" or "WoW" fan but i loved the movie. It was so awesome and Visually astonishing that i will go and watch it again and support it. I pray that they will make sequels cause there is so much story to bring in to the cinemas around the world. I do recommend this movie for everyone even those that haven't played the game i am included in that group and also others due to the awesomeness of this movie. It might be a bit confusing at moments but you will get the hang of it for sure cause i did. There is so much to bring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to the theatre with high expectations but worried by the reviews of it not being so good. I left the theatre with a massive smile on my face and felt like a kid again who'd just watched his favourite superhero movie! Walking back to my car quoting the film with my partner in our best orc voices. Absolutely dying to see this movie again!There are a few off law things in the film however the changes made it viewer friendly to people who aren't fans of the fantasy game series. Watching the film has also given me the urge to return playing to World of Warcraft, even though the film was based on the original game, Warcraft. 10/10 MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie and it met my expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the movie i thought was very good and had a good story. I've played World of Warcraft since WotLK and i'm the biggest lore nerd when it comes to Warcraft. And i wasn't expecting it to be this good especially sense games translated into movies are not so successful but this i think did it. It had the core story with a few changes and i can see why they would change a few things. Mainly because it wouldn't translate so good to screen and i absolutely agree with their decisions. This movie is a 9.9 for me, the only thing that made that 0.1 go away is a certain fight in the movie which was very disappointing but i could see why it happened that way. A whole game (Warcraft 1) being put into a 2 hour movie can be rather difficult so i understand a few of their decisions to change stuff and i respect it and they dealt with them better than i expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The critics are out of touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has its faults, mostly with pacing and introducing viewers to the story but overall I found the experience to be enjoyable. I honestly cannot believe the hate that this movie has gotten from reviewers. A lot of backlash has been fired at heavy use of CG however I found it to be above the level of Avatar. The story is enjoyable and comparing it to Lord of The Rings, which all modern fantasy (even Game of Thrones) is derived from is unfair. Jones put a lot of work into this film and it shows. It is a shame that professional reviewers have been this harsh. I wonder if the critics are out of touch and do not know a good movie when they see it. Watching this film after seeing the negative views and complaints has cemented that concern to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The world of Warcraft is destined to be explored. Show us more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan, I walked out from the movie theater with satisfaction. I would definitely watch a sequel in the near future, but there are certain points that need to be improved. Duncan Jones undoubtedly stayed faithful to the roots and his commitment, passion towards this universe can be felt in every scene.Although I have spent thousands of hours in this world, I know very less about Warcraft's history. So, it's a good thing that despite my lack of knowledge, I could easily catch up with the events and even keeping each name in mind wasn't a big deal either. The basic storyline serves as a perfect beginning for the Warcraft universe, and this movie might be the very first milestone, from which sequels can grow out and find their own places in this fantasy world.Motion capture technology proved once again that it is able to produce REAL characters. Each orc was incredibly detailed from head to toe. Face, eyes, hair, even the smallest hair follicles on their shoulders looked beyond belief. Gears on each side were unique and creatively devised as well, I liked the appearance of Blackhand in particular, who was wearing spines with skulls attached to his shoulder. Characters and relationships among them need some improvement. The undeveloped romance between Lothar and Garona was clearly one of the weakest point of this movie. It was built up poorly and the 180 degree turn came from nowhere. It was like: "We don't trust each other. BOOM. We love each other". Where is transition? It didn't have an arch at all, and the chemistry between them stands on shaky ground too. Warcraft obviously has a lot more unexploited resources that (with a good care) could be used to build up a complex and diversified fantasy world. Despite some flaws and unnecessary moments Warcraft lived up to my expectations and it could be the movie that makes us forget those committed crimes against gaming industry, which were delivered by Uwe Boll. I really root for this movie and hopefully - if the box office income will satisfy producers - it will get the chance to swing higher and reveal an universe that was destined to be explored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A set up movie, but a damn good one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've gotta say this movie surprised me. despite me being a fan of the Warcraft series I had mixed feelings about this movie especially when the first reviews started to spring up but thankfully I really enjoyed the film for what it was. It does have a few flaws mainly in the form of pacing issues but this doesn't mean it automatically becomes terrible which some people keep jumping to despite it also having a lot of redeeming factors. It seems that a lot of people want to bash and criticise the movie simply for what it is, an extremely nerdy and often joked about source material trying to be brought into the world of franchises, yet people seem to forget that this is exactly what happened to comic books. Now I'm not saying Warcraft is as good as the first X-men or Iron Man but as a franchise starter it managed to be well contained story in its own right while still introducing us to the world of Azeroth and the later stories that can (and possibly will) be told in that world. Due to sheer size of the world and lore of the source material it's understandable why Warcraft didn't achieve the absolute perfect balance that things like X-men did, but I personally believe Duncan Jones did the best he could while still staying as true to the original as possible. So yes it can be argued that the film is just to set up other movies but there are plenty of films that were essentially that to begin with and have had extremely successful franchises, Hunger Games and the Divergent series all started off this way and I believe that Warcraft is a much stronger starting movie than the movies that kick started those franchises. Even this year Batman vs Superman was essentially a set up for the larger DC Universe but was mishandled greatly, whereas Warcraft feels more like it's trying to be a stand alone film and while it doesn't entirely achieve this it still holds up.As I said the film does suffer from pacing issues and this it's most glaring problem, I would be lying if I said it didn't take some enjoyment away from the film (one scene in particular comes completely out of nowhere and I still can't really understand it even now) but this is really the only huge flaw. Something to mention is the world of Azeroth is drenched in Fantasy and unlike much more grounded versions of fantasy worlds such as Game of Thrones the sheer detachment from reality will turn some people off. This is by no means a bad thing about the movie and anyone who believes this to be a flaw (which some people do) should not be allowed to write movie reviews. It is simply a matter of personal opinion, if you enjoy that kind of thing then you will enjoy the film but if you're not really a fan of that sort of thing then Warcraft isn't for you.Now moving on to the good parts of the film, of which there are many. By far the strongest point of the movie is the acting, every character was 100% believable and when the characters are as outlandish as these ones this is not an easy thing to achieve. The good guys all felt as though they truly had something worth fighting for and everyone of them felt innately human (even the orcs) They had personalities, they had struggles and worries and things that made them happy, they had people they cared about, people they hated and all felt very natural to watch on screen, Toby Kebbell particularly stands out as Durotan. Villains were scary and ruthless and you just couldn't help but hate them for what they were but still love it when the come on screen just because they are so evil. Speaking of the orcs, the CGI is damn near perfect as well, in fact I would go as far to say it was Jurrassic Park level of good, possibly better. The orcs all look like they are actually the hulking great beasts that they are and the level of detail put into them is incredible, so good you can see the hair follicles on the orcs arms. Everything just feels real which again is no easy task considering the source material.The story is simple enough that everyone can follow it but not so simple it becomes boring or tedious. Action scenes are stunning, dialogue is interesting and overall the pacing issues don't hinder the story too much, it just makes some scenes either pointless or rushed, but as said before it does not ruin the film by any means.In the end Warcraft: The Beginning isn't a perfect movie but it sure is a good one and is extremely enjoyable one at that, think along the lines of Pacific Rim but with a fantasy story and better acting. If you're a fan of the Warcraft series you'll definitely enjoy it and even if you're not I recommend you check it out, you'll be pleasantly surprised. This franchise has lot of potential so don't let a good movie or a possibly good franchise go to waste because of what it is or because it's not the masterpiece critics expect it to be. Grab some friends, enjoy a fantasy a movie and just have fun with it, it's truly a world brought to life.</fullReview>

My best friend and I are life-long fans and players of Warcraft and World of Warcraft and this film has been extraordinarily well made.Despite having some tweaks to the story basically because of time restrictions, I cannot wait for the extended version on BluRay. It's incredible the way the film is made with such care for detail for the fans while also being told to the newcomers with such simplicity.Now, it may be a big bite to chew for somebody who is new to the universe, but what a wonderful bite it is. VERY relatable and charismatic characters on both sides and great stories on both sides as well.Albeit not perfect, I dare any real fan explain to me how could this film possibly get less than an 8/10.

Biggest movie problem, at least for me, is how brutal cutted it looks, some scenes are obviously missing those pieces. Technically film looks pretty good, and style looks rly fresh (comics movie era made all blockbusters look the same type). Plot is simple, but the motivation of characters mostly understandable and logic in movie is fine. Overall - that's pretty good movie to watch, even if u are not WC fan or even heard about this universe. Just don't expect too much, its just a first part of a big story.</fullReview>

The casting played off very well and for the most part the characters felt relatable, but there is one character that does not feel... right.CG is F****** amazing, and keeps to the theme of the games. stunning and visually pleasing, I feel like watching this movie in 2D would take away from the grand scale of the world so I highly advise you see the 3D.Watch this movie, and take your friends.

		<fullReview>As a fan, I admit, I very much looked forward to this movie. And even though I know the lore well enough to know everything that was going to happen story wise, I enjoyed this more than I thought I would! Duncan Jones did an awesome job bringing the lore to the big screen in my opinion. The only problem is that too much was left on the cutting room floor in order to make this a two hour movie. The beginning and ending of the film suffers a little bit because of this, mostly for those who do not know the backstory or what happens next. So I am eagerly awaiting the extended edition where Duncan Jones can give us more of that backdrop and character development. Other than that, the visual effects are some of the best I have ever seen. The acting is good for the most part. (Only two scenes felt a little bit awkward). But generally, I totally recommend seeing this movie (at least once!) for any fan of high fantasy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never played the game, i don't even know what it is about. I got tickets for the premier in The Netherlands. I went to see this film in IMAX 3D and it was awesome! The story is thrilling. The film lasts 2 hours witch is a great length. The directer says the choice between the Horde and the Alliance is up to you but i think the film is more at the side of the Alliance. I see the good in the Horde but the guy with the green stuff is the bad guy in the film and that is what makes me choose the side of the Alliance. You should totally watch this in IMAX, make sure you are somewhere in the middle. I was front, right and i walked out with a headache, so make sure you are not in that position ;). The CGI is great, the Orks are amazing! They look very realistic and the acting is good. Conclusion: just go and watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to this movie with 6 friends. 4 of us have played wow, some from vanilla to now. Everyone just loved the film. The 2 guys who didn't have a clue about the lore didn't think it was hard to follow. To the it was a great movie with really really good effects. We work with 3D for games and movies and we were all absolutely blown away by the orc's Durotan and Drakka.They were amazingly done. The effects that they used for Medivhs and Khadgars magic was really cool as well. Felt very close to the game itself. After watching the trailers I was a bit worried how this would turn out with the music, actors etc but the film itself took all doubt, smashed it and we sat with grins on our face's throughout the film. Hat off for the whole crew and thank's for a fantastic movie that makes us just want more!I don't want to spoil anything but I just want to recommend this movie to you all.

		<fullReview>Firstly I want to say that I AM a warcraft fan so it might turn out that I've missed "bad" parts in the film.I wasn't really expecting a great film when I first entered the cinema to watch Warcraft: The Beginning. To my surprise the movie wasn't bad at all. I LOVED the CGI since it worked really well together with the environment and other actors. Action scenes were stunning, but could've been longer. Acting wasn't on LOTR or GoT level, but worked fine. One of my few complaints is that the movie went way too fast forward at the start! Some of my friends haven't played any warcraft related games at all and were therefor a bit confused about what was going on. I, as a Warcraft fan, would rate this movie 9-10/10 since it had great CGI, some easter eggs for the fans and a decent story. Almost every friend of mine (both warcraft fans and non-fans) enjoyed this movie. The non-fans only complained about the fast pace at the start and some lesser flaws. So in a non-fans perspective I'd probably rate this film ~7/10.So in conclusion I really think you should give this movie a shot! Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't, but either way you'll still (probably) have a great experience with the awesome CGI!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Blizzard HC fan and player of all games (literally all), plus a big fan of their books and lore across all universes, I found this movie EXCELLENT! A more than enough earned 9/10 and this 1 point lower score is because there are multiple story deviations that I personally didn't enjoy because I like the original more.This is super cool positive attitude is expected from a HC fan, but with me there were two novices (know some points in the story trough the game) and three people that had no idea what it was about. And they LOVED the movie, and the most disturbing fact it they LOVED IT a bit more than I did, as I was rewinding the movie and drawing a parallel with the original story. The CGI was superb and the fight scenes where top notch. Story is a bit more shallow than I expected but after the movie, as I explained the general story line to non Blizzard guys they felt so confused. I guess this was the best they could fit into 2h (which is very low for this movie) and I can't wait to see the 40mins extended version.If you are looking for a good fantasy movie please give this one a shot and let us Blizzard fans pray they'll do more :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film, the CGI was brilliant, the locations and set were extraordinary, the acting was amazing, the costumes and make up were absolutely astonishing. Duncan Jones seriously kept true to the lore, truer than ALL game to film movies out there. People who have never seen the film before are noting this film as the new Lord of the Rings, and you know what, I believe them. There's so many negative critiques on this and coincidentally they're by people who have never played any of the games or read any of the novels. Which is why I made an account specifically to say this; Warcraft does not deserve the negativity and the low ratings (especially on Rotten Tomatoes), it's absolutely breathe-taking and I loved every minute of it. The reason for 9 out of 10 is because I agree with the statement that characters should have been developed more for people who have never heard of them prior to the movie. But for a girl who's been in love with World of Warcraft since she was 10, this movie was something I'm very, very proud to witness.</fullReview>

This should have been longer though it just feels like it should be longer.It portrays a story about the world through the eyes of various characters and it was great at that. It NEEDS to be longer though a good 30-60 more minutes please.The world is vast and immersive they should have let the characters roam around the cities more. I wish they did because the details looked amazing.I actually re watched it and the humans (in my opinion not as relatable as the orcs) even grew on me. After re watching it again I really wanted it to be longer.It's good and fun. NEEDS TO BE LONGER THOUGH. The world is vast the characters interesting.

		<shortDescription>A very enjoyable but flawed movie, deserving of a sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just emerged from the midnight release of Warcraft in the UK and I felt that this movie needs a review from an honest WoW player.I will be blunt and simple. This movie is great for any WoW players or general Blizzard fans out there; the aesthetic and corresponding CGI are excellent and on-par if not better than expansion cinematics. The main soundtrack theme for this film is different to what you expect but fits well, I hope to download it when possible. What surprised me the most was that I actually enjoyed Ben Schnetzer's Khadgar, and if I'm brutally honest, I think he was the best part of the film.So now, the dreaded flaws... - Pacing: This film is all over the place, scenes are either too short or too long and not enough time is spent in each location (the world created was beautiful beyond belief) - Unnecessary plot points: Without going into too much detail, the film presents many "emotional" moments which are both unexpected to viewers and also failing completely to be pulled off by the director. I think that the film could have been without them and it would have flowed much smoother as well. - Changes to Warcraft lore: In short, there's a few SMALL changes to the lore in regard to how certain moments play out, but the result is still the same. I can't say that I personally like the changes at all.Smaller issues: - Young Varian looks like a girl - Much of the "humour" added in to humanise the characters (both Orc and Human) feels very cringe-worthy - Travis Fimmel wasn't good as Anduin Lothar and honestly I don't think he's a good actor in my opinion. - Ryan Robbins' character "Karos" was underused and his trailer scenes weren't in the movie - Romance: Anduin and Garona's romance is incredibly unnecessary and awkward. (This was in the trailer so don't call me out for spoilers)To summarise, "Warcraft" is a very enjoyable film but with a great number of flaws which, to be frank, distracted me at multiple times. I will say that it is not a bad video game movie, and deserves a sequel so to improve upon the mistakes it made. Go see this film, it's worth the money.</fullReview>

At that point I started to doubt the movie but decided to watch it anyway... and the doubt is no more!It's tense, good-looking and more grim than I expected! Sure, at times it's kinda cringy because of the high fantasy-style it's made in. The humans armor and so on. But considering it's based on a game, its understandable.It's not Lords of the Ring-good. But still a great movie! I really hope for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally ! A good movie based on a video game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to share you my feelings about this movie without spoilers. Why ? Because i saw the notes from Metacritics and RT. To be honest, I must bring justice for this movie, because I can assure you this : Warcraft movie deserves a chance and a shot from you guys. If you like the warcraft universe, please, go watch this movie, give it a chance, it deserves it ! If you are not a fan, go take a shot ! You will understand without problems.At the moment, it's the best movie based on video games (by far) and it didn't suck !! The trailers were really bad. If you like the warcraft universe and you are not reluctant about some changes in the lore (some are better), well you will enjoy the movie. Let's talk about the movie. It's been since Warcraft 3 I wait a Warcraft movie. Since Warcraft 3, I'm a fan of this universe, the lore and the ambiance. The movie respect very well those 3 aspects. You are feeling you are in Azeroth ! In general, I liked the movie. Even if it's far from perfect and they made some changes from the lore (some are better, some are worst). But it's really feel like a true movie and not like a cinematic, or a movie with only fan service (like mortal kombat...) The movie respects well the main story and the universe of warcraft. The CGI is really great and make you enter in the movie ! I generally don't like the CGI, but this one is great, even if it has some weird and bad CGI rarely. The armor and weapons feel less plastic than in the trailers, but still a little bit. About the actors and the characters : - Lothar (Travis) is for me, the only character who doesn't feel like « feudal ». All the characters are, except him. He is a great actor, and unique don't get me wrong. But I didn't feel like a true commander of a human army in a feudal universe. He acts more like his character Ragnar in Viking, like an actual person on our world (with funny jokes). - Khadgar is good. It is really the young apprentice who is a geek tand who is in search of the knowledge and want to learn the truth of Medivh. Pretty good (even with his pedo mustache). Probably my third favourite character of the movie (its between him and Durotan for the third place). - Medhiv was my favorite character. He is very good Powerful and mysterious at the same time, such as should being Medivh! The only disappointment was that the movie did not enough develop his "twist" (if you are a fan of the lore, you know about what I speak). - King Llane was .... OK. Nothing transcendent. However, I loved his decision at the end of the movie. A good change from the original lore. Great job Duncan Jones for this change ! - Garona...Believe me or not, she was for me the biggest surprise in term of actor's game and character development. Yeah you heard this ! My mind was blown apart ! It is a really well realized character and Paula Patton really put a lot in this character ! Her final twist is really great, even better than the original lore. My second favorite character of the movie! - For orcs, they are great in general except Orgrimm who was a little bit disappointing, and BlackHand at the end. For me the main issue I have with this movie was its duration. Too SHORT, way too short ! It's feeled a little rushed sometimes. It was really lacking one half an hour to develop certain moments and certain scenes. For example, we do not show enough that Draenor is a dying world. Other scenes were less good also. The changes on the lore are sometimes good (especially why Garona makes "this" to king), others were less good. In term of fan service (the BAD ONE), the movie only bring one fan service, which make it feel like a real movie. It was not only a movie made for fans and for the wrong reasons ! Overall, I like this movie ! Far from perfect, but still better than some Marvel movies which are endless....It's a fresh, new and unique movie. If you are a fan of Warcraft, don't listen RT and Metacritics, go see and judge yourself !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orc warlock Gul'dan drains life out of prisoners for the fel magic to open a portal to Azeroth for an orc horde to cross. He aims to reopen the portal to bring an entire army to the new world. Durotan is the chief of the Frostwolf Clan. Blackhand is a rival and the military commander. Meanwhile, human commander Anduin Lothar has renegade mage Khadgar prisoner who suspects a malicious magical force. King Llane Wrynn rules Stormwind Kingdom and Medivh is the Guardian of the realm. Garona is a captured half-orc.One of the most important hurdles for this movie is if the CGI is believable. It is able to clear that hurdle. The orcs are major characters and their believability is essential for this to work. It is the bare minimum. In fact, the orcs are some of the more compelling characters in the movie. The CGI is flashy but the story itself is a messy cauldron of old fantasy conflicts. The story should be simplified and concentrated down to one idea. Most of it drags along in a grinding exposition. Much of it is slow. One has to stay alert to understand this world especially for people like me who have never played the game. Some of the motivations are questionable. The action is great but I'm often not thrilled by it. Durotan's fight with Gul'dan is probably the most compelling. I really get to care about Durotan. There are probably too many characters going off every which way. This movie would work much better as a simple quest or road movie with Durotan as the lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know anything about World of Warcraft but what i do know is that I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! Im even considering playing the game because I cant get enough of the story and the different creatures. I hope everyone goes and sees this movie because Im dying for a part 2. The graphics are superb absolutely flawless! And its not a super predictable plot which i personally appreciate. The only change i would like is the Garona characters makeup. I personally believe her coloring was too green for her to have been a half breed, her chief-ton wasn't even as green as her and her teeth could have at least been yellowed they were perfectly straight and white which didn't seem realistic seeing as shes been living with and as an Ork and none of them had pristine teeth. But otherwise a PERFECT MOVIE and cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the reason that I made an IMDb account. I know, it's not like in the books, it's not the same story that we know from the Game and Books, but to see Stormwind , Gul'dan and least but not last, the Murloc, that was stunning. Beautiful CGI, good plot and action in every minute of the movie. There were people that never played Warcraft but after the ending they were all excited to see Warcraft movie 2. It has been a long time since we saw orcs, dwarfs, elfs, and humans all together, somehow it reminded of LOTR. If Blizzard can keep this up, and also bring Dragons to the set, I'm sure the audience will love it. All being said, see the movie, judge yourself and have fun. LOK'TAR OGAR!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun but not for everyone (especially Critics)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mini-Review: Fantasy action CGI computer game world building movie that focuses more on settings then characters. A Dungeons and Dragons type movie with a bigger budget.Conclusion: Critics and Americans seem to mainly complain that its not a Lord of the Rings style fantasy that slowly explores the bigger world. International movie viewers praise it for creating an interesting world whilst moving quickly from one action sequence to the next.This movie is for the viewer that is looking for a fun action packed experience that does not have long talking head sequences explaining character motivations and histories. It is not for someone who wants to deeply relate to the characters as they move through a fully realized setting. Suitable for all ages but likely to appeal slightly more to male then female minds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You're Willing to Give This Movie a Chance, There's a Good Fantasy Adventure Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Duncan Jones at the helm (Moon, Source Code) I was shocked at the critical thrashing this movie got when it was released. There were some less popular actors at the forefront (Travis Fimmel, Toby Kemmel, Paula Patton) but even with the theory that video game movies are cursed, this had to be the one that would break the mould. The fan reaction was conversely positive but you could just dismiss that as fans being pleased by anything. I've never really had the urge to play the game, I like fantasy stories/movies (the Lord of The Rings might be the greatest trilogy of movies ever made) so I went in open and not expecting it to go one way or another. No one will mistake this for being LOTR but there's a cool story, lots of great visual effects and some interesting action.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The orc homeland of Draenor is doomed. The land is dying and the orcs need to find a new home for their Orc Horde. Our orc protagonist is Durotan (Toby Kemmel), a leader of a small orc clan who is respected by his followers. His wife Draka is pregnant and he wants a better home for both his family and his clan. The orcs are reliant on Gul'dan (Daniel Wu) to find them a new home. He's an orc mage and he uses the poisonous magic "The Fell." The orcs build a gateway and fuelled by the essence of many prisoners, Gul'dan is able to use his magic to open a doorway to the kingdom of Azaroth. They only take their best warriors, they expect resistance from the inhabitants and only when they have the ability to, they will bring the rest of the Horde through.In the kingdom of Azaroth, the commander of the military forces Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) is called upon by his king Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) to summon the Guardian (Ben Foster) after discovering one of their barracks have been raided in the kingdom of Azaroth. When he has checked out the barracks, he meets Khadgar (Ben Schetzer) who was apprehended trying to examine the dead bodies of the inhabitants. Khadgar is a failed mage who quit but recognizes the mark of The Fell on the bodies. It is because of this evidence, Anduin is sent to gather Medivh aka The Guardian to give advice to the king. Anduin and The Guardian are old friends and with raids happening continually, they are in need of his guidance more than ever.I don't have any attachment to World of Warcraft. I'm not familiar with the mythology at all and I think the most experience I have with it was the South Park episode that parodied it. I say this because the buzz around this movie is that if you're a fan of the property, that's the only way you can get some enjoyment out of it. I'm writing this to dispute that claim. I'll grant you that you have to be willing to enter with an open mind because you have to wait for the movie to setup the story. You're brought into many exotic locations with exotic names. There's also many characters to be introduced to so you also have to pay attention. But if you can be patient, there's an interesting story (you also have to be into this genre of movies, if you think things like orcs fighting humans is stupid, this movie won't change your mind).While I'm mainly going to praise this film, the acting here is a mixed bag. Certain members of the cast come across as more convincing then others. Toby Kemmel did a great job in performance capture as Durotan and Antonidas, he's becoming an authority in that area. I thought Travis Fimmel was fine and despite Ben Foster being oddly cast in his role, he pulls it off. I think Ben Schnetzer was miscast but by the end of the movie, he's more convincing. I'm a fan of Paula Patton and I was hoping this was going to be her breakout. I think she's probably got the most difficult role, her dialogue is really abrupt and I feel like a lot of the subplot between her character Garona and Fimmel's character Lothar got cut down. Anyway I wouldn't describer her performance as weak but she's not a standout either, she comes across as a little wooden at times. Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga are fine, neither of them are particularly energetic but they do their job.Sometimes people complain about CGI overload and too much emphasis on the visual effects. Warcraft is a movie that is elevated by the quality of its effects. The environments look great, the orcs are very impressive looking and the cinematography is always impressive. Unlike another movie I saw lately (Gods of Egypt) Warcraft also carried a big budget but this one actually spent it well and looks the part of a big fantasy blockbuster.I've read that like Batman v Superman, the original cut that was submitted was much longer than the version showed in theatres. I think that shows, in the middle of the movie, characters change their attitudes too quickly and things develop without explanation sometimes. But I went in with low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised with Warcraft. The movie sets itself up for a sequel that I'd like to see. I don't think this will be one of my favourite movies I see this year but it's a good entry to the fantasy genre. It's not nearly as bad as it has been made out to be and I encourage you to check it out if you might be interested in it. My actual score would be 7.5/10 but I'll round up and give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, too harsh reviews by some</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm 41 and played through Warcraft3 RoC and FT and then WoW. Stopped playing for a few years now.Went to see the movie with my wife. She absolutely hated the fact that I played WoW when we started dating so, "forced" as she was to see the movie :) , you can imagine she was expecting a dire spectacle. But she liked it, she was actually entertained with the movie and left wanting to see the follow up... and so did I.The overall feeling of Warcraft was there, the tragedy of both sides of the tale was there as we end up sympathizing to both sides of the tale one way or another. The film could do with a few more minutes at beginning with a bit of character build up, but for me that's basically the only caveat.Visually is nothing short than stunning, story wise it conveys the tragedy of both sides of the tale, has a lot of action. Its a real shame people aren't going to the movies and watch it.</fullReview>

One of my friends knew nothing of the lore and she had no problem following the plot. SHE LOVED IT!!! and plans to go see it again. I can not wait for the next one.

		<fullReview>I was really surprised by the movie because of the bad reviews it got from critics, it was actually great and all eight of my friends who watched the movie loved it, it was clearly a fan service movie and the reason why it got low reviews might be because the critics were not familiar with the lore and history of Warcraft or they wanted to continue the whole "video-game movies are bad" thing, still it getting such low scores might benefit the movie if people watch it with low expectations.The characters were great and you would instantly know their history and roles if you played the games or read the books but for people who didn't it might be a bit confusing at the start, Visually the movie was great with familiar landscape from the game made fans excited however its not THAT great, but still its better than BvS CGI.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I must thank all these retard critics for preparing me for the worst when it comes to Warcraft - The Beginning. Actually I just came back from seeing it, and it really rocks, it's def a 7/10 movie, but I'm a WoW player so I must be subjective and give the movie a 10/10. Garona understands what the captured drainei is saying, and that's a possible hint that she is half-orc half-drainei. Khadgar kills Medith in a different way then it was told in the book "The last Guardian". Also Khadgar doesn't gets soulharvested by Medith so he can look like an old man with gray hair. This movie has a lot of layers that will be discovered more and more in the next parts, so just enjoy this great experience and stop hating for no reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello IMDb, today i want to share my opinion about Warcraft. Announcement of this film surprised me greatly, because i am a big fan of Warcraft video games. The movie looks earnestly comparing to games, all the university looks familiar! Moreover, Russian voices in translation were same as in Warcraft3, it's a positive sign. The plot was really intriguing, but in some places i had a question why the person acting like this? Furthermore, the actors suits and play greatly! Graphics and picture amazed me. All costumes and surroundings are reliable and very close to game stuff. In addition This film will be interesting as for the fans and for person who hears about "warcraft" first time. The story was adapted for wide range of people. To conclude, i believe that this film is worth to watch in cinema. I recommend you to go! P.S i am waiting for sequel!

		<shortDescription>"it's actually really good"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a weird one for me. I expected it to be crap (earlier video game movies have thought me a thing or two), but the surprise was very pleasant indeed. The pacing was a bit flawed. The early parts of the movie were too fast and the middle to slow. It also lacked some character depth on the side of the Alliance. Those alongside some more nit-picky things takes a few points away for me. Oh and also a particular scene resembling a biblical event triggered me to the nth degree. But enough about why it's not a 10/10 movie (I did give it an 8/10 after all), cause it was truly a fantastic surprise how good this movie actually was. First of all, the Horde were fantastic, both visually and their characters really made the movie for me. Also the main villain is as evil as one can get, something I miss in this day of everyone being good deep inside. All the animations are superb, even the magic looks good (something that usually looks exceedingly awful in movies). The fights are brutal, the scope impressive. Even the soundtrack is pretty good, tho it sometimes overdoes the BOOM BOOM effects. I laughed a ton as well, always nice. There really is a lot more to say about this movie, but no time to do so. I leave you with "it's actually really good". Go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpected Surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a fan of the Warcraft games and was not expecting much when my mates suggested going to see Warcraft. I have been a fan of Duncan Jones' other sci-fi films and was slightly disappointed when I heard he was venturing into fantasy. I had seen the trailers and thought it looked too CGI heavy and serious. Coupled with the initial poor reviews and my aversion to 3D I was not looking forward to spending ?12 on two hours of Orc-y, Orc-y, talky, talky, Smashy, Smashey.However I surprisingly enjoyed Warcraft. It was a bit silly in places and characters sometimes made daft choices, like stopping i n the middle of a battle to chat and further exposition, but it wasn't too serious and, as a newcomer, I really enjoyed the level they pitched the back story, it didn't spoon feed us and expected the audience to keep up. The CGI actually looked great on the big screen and I found myself actually caring for the great, big green and brown characters as much as the human characters. All the actors were decent choices, with Ben Foster and Toby Kebbell standing out. The film could have done with some breathing space for the actors to emote as certain scenes felt rushed or were cut strangely, in contrast to this the final battle seemed to be over quite quickly for a change! You can tell that they are setting up for future films by leaving story strands unresolved, which is becoming an annoying trend in block- buster movies. In this case though I really hope that the Warcraft movie is a big enough success so that we can revisit this world and found out what happens to these characters next.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly immersive movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my fairly short review of Warcraft: The Beginning.First of all I really think this movie should be seen in an IMAX theater for the best image and audio quality possible. Why? Because this movie has got some of the best CGI I've seen in recent days.Everything is such a bliss to look at, the orcs, the props, the spells and the world of Warcraft. All of this comes with a great soundtrack that adds to the magical feeling.The only drawback is that there's almost too much plot squeezed into 2 hours. At times this made it hard to follow what was going on as the pacing is really fast. I feel like the movie needed at least 30 more minutes of character development and to make the pacing a bit slower.Do I recommend this movie? Yes! I'm actually going to see it a second time in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The video-game-movie adaptation curse has been lifted!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I went to see Warcraft last night, although with tentative expectations. I had read some reviews beforehand and they weren't exactly glowing. As someone who had never played the game before, I didn't really know what to expect, but I liked the trailers so thought I'd give it a try. I was really surprised at how engrossed I was in the movie and at the all round balanced storyline. Starting off briefly introducing the characters and with an explanation of the magic force known as Fel. The Orcs although created using CGI were really believable characters and I especially felt invested in Durotan's character. These mammoth beings make for really stunning fight scenes, which were made exceptionally well, keeping me excited throughout them. Paula Patton's character Garona, a half- Orc was really enjoyable to watch, seeing her integrate with both the humans and the Orcs unsure of where she stands amongst all of the chaos. Her emotions really carried the movie along with Toby Kebbel as Durotan and his wife played by Anna Van Hooft. On the human side of things I was a little disappointed, I thought the main actor Travis Fimmel was a bit flat as Anduin Lothar and Ben Schnetzer as Khadgar was OK, but nothing spectacular. Although Dominic Cooper's character I really enjoyed watching, I think he's a phenomenal actor and with his recent TV series Preacher, he's definitely going places. The movie had a somewhat Lord of the Rings/ Avatar kind of feel to it and from someone who really enjoyed LOT, I felt that Warcraft didn't lose itself trying to be something it's not. It took the game's main concepts and turned it into a movie deserved of the big screen. This probably has to be the best game- turned-movie to date, and only Michael Fassbender's Assassin's Creed coming later this year could possibly top it. It's a 7/10 from me with a bit of work on the acting side of things, but an overall enjoyable, fun and interesting film.</fullReview>

Special effects were beyond outstanding, scenery was magical, music atmospheric, acting....well I got caught up in the adventure so didn't ever notice the acting which I suppose is great, lastly the story...cant say much cos it had already been written and played through online so they couldn't really change too much. don't pay too much attention to these reviews, if the trailers seemed interesting then chill out, leave your reality at the door, enter Azaroth and just enjoy...which is what I did, cant wait for next one !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Scene one I was immediately convinced that, "This is how real life Orc's would look like"The CGI and the depths brought to life by the actors behind the "masks" is absolutely astonishing. The story of the Orc'ish invasion/escape is told with great respect to the in-game lore, granted there are minute adaptations to make it work in a 2h storytelling.All of the actors have captured the essence of each character into their portrayal of them. And with little effort your transported into the world of Azeroth, experiencing firsthand how the story unfolded itself. Hidden in the movie are subtle references that we gamers have been throw the last decade, adding to the feeling that this is a movie made by people who love Warcraft and who love the games.We were a group of friends who went and saw this movie, half of us have played the games and Some still do, but the other half had never touched base with the Warcraft games. Yet we all agreed that it was a great fantasy movie and we left the movies wanting more.Critics have had a field day with this movie, it seems they are in competition to write the crappiest Review, just to try and out-do each other?.F-them go see the movie and decide yourself.</fullReview>

ITs a revolution in gaming movies.the most amazing cgi i have ever seen and fantastic action!The cities looks amazing.A short explanation for the bad reviews so far is the reviewers expecting a bad movie, just because its based on a video game. When you go watch something that you expect and want to be bad you usually only focus on the bad stuff. Which still can be hard to understand given that there is not that much bad stuff in the movie :/ Weird. The reason i give it 8/10 is because there is a slight problem with making a bond to some of the characters.

Any lore nerd will notice them but honestly they weren't that bad.They squeezed a decent story out of a game not known for being story heavy so I'm eager to see how the Warcraft sequels are treated if they get made.Non-fans may have trouble picking up the name drops and references but fans will smile during the night ride through Elwyyn and a familiar little terror makes a cameo :P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its is good and beautiful, not legendary, but near epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I played WoW, Warcraft, Diablo and Starcraft. I am a Blizzard fan on those games. And I've been waiting for a long time for this movie. And I've heard, but not read, the bad reviews they mentioned in the internet. So my hopes were a bit dampened when I went and watch the movie, in 2D. And now I'm really curious what those reviewers said, because the movie was great, given not Lord of the Rings great but it was great. And it is beautiful, the cgi were amazing, its like the game world come to life. I was pulled into Azeroth, and watched my game characters come to life in this realistically real and amazingly beautiful world.The story was great, given the story used in the movie is not canon but the story line was parallel to the game lore. And this movie very well sets it up for a series of sequels. It is far and way better from any other game movie I've ever seen, and I've seen many of them. I was blown away, I am grinning and smiling during the entirety of the movie. Don't believe the bad reviews, watch the movie and decide for yourself. It is a great fantasy movie and it didn't disappoint the fan and adoration of Blizzard in me. This is my first and maybe the only review in IMDb, because I just want to dispel the bad reviews and support Blizzard for making this movie and they really should make the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good fantasy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of this is not a movie about World of Warcraft. The story is set around the first Warcraft game Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans from 1994, and the Warcraft novels The Last Guardian, and Rise of the Horde.Having played Warcraft 3 and the first World of Warcraft game myself I really got nostalgic about seeing the world of Azeroth and the dying world of Draenor. Was amazing to see Stormwind and looking at all the detail they had put into the world. And of course seeing The Dark Portal being built.But I feel Blizzard have had a hard time managing to make a movie of the games. I am not surprised that it has been taking over 10 years before we finally have one. That is why it is good that Duncan Jones is the director. He is both a fan of the games, but also a good filmmaker with only the movies Moon and Source Code before Warcraft. Both are movies that I really liked.What makes this movie more for me than just an average fantasy film that you have seen before is the orcs. Especially Durotan which for me was the best character in the movie. You feel that he has a soul and are not just a mindless monster. It goes away from the cliché in which I feel most fantasy stories orcs are portrayed.The movie is also not Black and White. Both the Alliance and The Horde characters are not truly good or not truly evil. You get the motivation from both sides why they must fight each other. (I must say by the way the battles in this movie are quit epic!) The Alliance wants to protect their homeland from the orcs and the orcs fights for survival. The only character that I really see as truly evil is Gul'dan who I thought was a great villain.And the visual effects are mind blowing! ILM has done a fantastic job of making the CGI Orcs realistic. The best CGI I have seen since Avatars Na'vi.And the movie might be more relevant than people would have thought. I am thinking especially about the refugee crises in Europe and the migration to the US from Mexico. People are desperate about a better life than what they had before. Warcraft shows in some ways why some people suddenly decides to flee their homeland and travel to an unknown world.But I have to put out some things I did not like about this movie. The actors are OK but no one really stood out as great. I liked Ben Foster as Medivh, Toby Kebbell as Durotan and Daniel Wu as Gul'dan. I thought they were the best actors. The rest was OK. A little disappointed about Travis Fimmel which I think acts better in Vikings than he did in this movie. The problem is probably because many have mostly starred in television series. And the editing is bad in some parts of the film. It jumps sometimes too quickly between characters so that you easily get lost in what is happening with one character when they cut to another one. I was hoping for the same type of epic music like Lord of the Rings. That is type of music you could listen to and you do not need to watch to movie also. But here none of the music is really memorable. Ramin Djawadi, the guy that made the music for Game of Thrones (which has a lot of great music) disappoints here. I thought the only good part of the music was the theme for the orcs.I would have also liked if the movie showed a map of Azeroth and Draenor at the start of the movie so you get to know from the start how the worlds looks like. I am thinking mostly about people that do not know anything about Warcraft. They show a map of Azeroth one time in Stormwind but I would have liked to see one from the start also. In a similar way like the prologue in Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring where you get to see a map of Middle Earth to introduce the world.I think some people would also find the magic silly, but I actually liked how they did it in the movie. It is a fantasy film after all.If people feel that they did not get to know the orcs in this movie I would recommend reading the book Warcraft: Durotan: The Official Movie Prequel. The book is a prequel to the movie and you get to know Durotan, Draka, Orgrim and the rest of the Frostwolf clan a lot better. The book ends right before the movie starts. I felt if you have not read the book the movie does a poor job of introducing who they are and showing their way of life. And the book also ends right before the movie starts. The movie is not as good as Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, but it stand on its own as a good fantasy film. And there are a lot of Easter eggs for the fans of the games. I think mostly people that are fans of the games will like it, but I thought Duncan Jones managed to make it so people that knows nothing of the Warcraft games and world would enjoy it too. Looking forward to a sequel to this movie if this one is a success and hopefully the next one can improve the mistakes of this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. The people who made the trailers for "Warcraft: The Beginning" need to be fired because those don't do this movie justice at all, which comes from the utterly out of context cutting in them.I was so scared ... how bad will this be? And then it turns out to be kinda awesome. Yes that's the fangirl speaking. And squeeing about Murloc sightings and "sheeping" of the weak minded. I also agree with another reviewer, that as a Warcraft player/fan you just can't stop grinning from ear to ear the whole thing through.I also loved the magic visualization. The acting was much better then anticipated. Khadgar gives the nerd/LARPer vibes on purpose and it works. Medivh is really tragic. Gul'dan is his badass evil Warlock self.I was afraid the Lothar/Garona thing would be too distracting but it was handled okay IMHO. The only thing I found a bit too cheesy (and a little heavy on the slow-mo) was the ending (King Lane sacrificing himself) but then again: FOR AZEROTH AND THE ALLIANCE!! Critics giving it less then 4/10 puzzle me, which is what I would still give it if I were a very grumpy non-fan. And combined with my 10/10 fanish squee rating that translates to a 7/10. So there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**(sorry for my writing mistakes)** I must admit I really enjoyed this movie! I had no idea about the lore behind the movie, only what I knew from the trailers and by reading some comments. My friends convinced me to watch it and I must say that I'm thankful for it. I'm not going to give you any spoilers. I just want to say that it's one of the best fantasy/sci-fi movies released lately and I'll be more than interested in reading the books. The action in the movie caught my attention and the CGI was well done. For the whole 2 hours I really felt part of the story which only a few other movies achieved this. Thank you and I hope there will be more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched it and this is my personal rating, The movie is 10/10!!disclaimer: I'm a bit biased because I'm a fan of the Warcraft games in general especially the RTS. Warcraft 1 was one of my first RTS that I played along with C&amp;C and that's way back in 1995. Anyway I'll just list the it's pros and cons of the movie.Pros: + They nailed the look of the movie, especially the ORCs. It just looks and feels like Warcraft. + CGI is amazing, definitely one of the best by ILM. The facial expressions of the Orcs are just awesome to look at, it might rival Avatar in that department. + The in game locations, stormwind, dalaran. Seeing it in the big screen is a joy to us Warcraft fans. (Although some locations are not accurate like Dalaran is not supposed to float not until Archimonde sieged it during the events of WC3) + Dialogue is good enough, don't expect some LotR narrative. + Lothar is just awesome, hopefully we will see more of Travis Fimmel in the big screen.Overall most of the actors did well even the CGI orcs Durotan, Ogrim, Guldan etc. + It's action packed no dull moments for me. + Magics are represented well in this movie, there's incantations and magic circle. If you are a mage in World of Warcraft you prolly had orgasmed after seeing it lol. + There are some shots later on when the cameras are overhead and it looked like a warcraft RTS game. + This movie gave me feels than that specific BvS scene.Cons - Some plot points might be confusing because the movie is just only 2HRs, the movie pacing is quite fast. - Not adding some familiar game music is a missed opportunity. - Dwarfs are CGI - Battles are quite short I expected more :DThe movie ending is open for a sequel, there's a few surprises don't expect that this movie will have a fairy tale ending.I think the movie will hold itself well to those who are not familiar with the source material. I just hope that the movie will do good enough in the box office, it needs its returns for future sequel/s. The Warcraft lore is just vast and it will be a shame if this first movie will be the last. Just go ahead have an open mind and watch it, Ignore the critics. Your opinion is what matter most. The movie entertained me than most recent superhero movie releases. Hopefully the Assassins creed movie will do well, we need more good video game movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am reading all that 10/10 stars, but this movie don't deserve even 6. I am a fan of Warcraft game but i'm not 1 of that players who play this game 27 of 24 hours per day and i am little disappointed. The story is good, maybe little to fast in switching the story points, which is hard to follow for person who did not familiarized with the concept of Warcraft. It will not be amazed with this movie like the Warcraft fan but still, story is the best part of the movie, same goes to environment, very similar to the game and very realistic. Special effects and animations are also very good, every part of the movie which not including the "human" actors is good, the acting in this movie sucks big time, like in low budget movies. There is no real emotions in acting, no life, no real feeling for the moment when u need to be amazed with acting like in the Brave heart for example, the human actors are so mellow, like i am watching lovely summer Mamma Mia. Only 1 who is worth to mention is Toby Kebbell. But all in all. This is the first one, i hope it will be more Warcraft movies but if they are smart, and i know they are. They will change the human part of acting crew. Because that was disaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft is surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the reviews Warcraft: The Beginning has received and the general consensus of thinking that video game based movie aren't very good, I was fully expecting to see some what of a cinematic pan cake. Surprisingly enough, Warcraft works pretty well. It's no LOTR mind you, but it is relatively entertaining, at places a bit cheesy, fantasy flick with pretty good special effects.Warcraft is at its best when it revolves around the orcs. The humans are really the weak link of the whole thing, as very few of the actors chosen feel that they don't fit in a fantasy setting like this. A Finnish director Markku Pölönen said once, that some people have epoch faces and some do not. By that he meant, that certain people suit better on a movie set in the past (or in a fantasy world), where as some just look too modern. Most of the human actors here feel a bit too modern for the setting. Also the writing on the humans side feels more rushed.But the orcs. Now they're fantastic. They're gigantic beast, with tusks and huge weapons in their hands, riding on over sized wolves (or wargs, I'm not really sure, as I'm not huge Warcraft guy). The orcs themselves aren't really evil at all, they're just misguided by the fell magic using Gul'Dan. In any case, the movie just seems to work better every time there's orcs on scree, be it Durotan, Garona or Gul'dan.The pacing of the story is also a one big issue. It's easy to see, that there's a lot of story material been cut out from the movie and that really feels like it's hurting the overall experience. Some additional material might even make the humans feel more compelling as well, but now there's no real connection to them here, as the story keeps jumping quite a bit.Anyhow, Warcraft really isn't even half as bad some sources have touted it as. It's relatively easy to follow for even a person like me, who played the original RTS game years ago and has only skimmed WOW briefly before getting bored with it. At times it did feel like it expected me to be more familiar with the franchise than I am, but in all it still is fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Warcraft and i must say that it is suitable for all. No matter if you have played its game or not. It is suitable to you as well.I was looking forward to it when I saw the first trailer... it was amazing. I can say that Orcs were looking real and the movie will literally take you into its fantasy world it definitely strikes chord with audience. I can say that CGI work is commendable. And that was the main reason I liked it. It was not boring movie at all. The Orcs scenes were fantastic and the last battle sequence was a perfect fantasy battle. I heard that Director Duncan Jones was a warcraft fan and while watching the movie I was feeling that he has done true justice to game. Even If i had watched its game trailers only. Overall I can say whether you are fan or not go watch this movie don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Waaaay better than I expected and vastly greater than rotten tomatoes 22% and critics reviews! I saw this thinking being on the edge and so glad and wasn't bummed for losing $10. Breakdown for people on the edge: Definitely a good time! Even if you have no Warcraft experience. Who would like this movie: Lord of rings fans, Harry Potter maybe, any action science fiction movie or fight movie will like this too. The effects and are amazing. The main Orc monsters are 'beautifully' ugly and the villain is pretty cool and terrible. The action sequences are awesome and I'm no fan of imax 3D but some sequences felt like I was sitting on the battlefield. I was really impressed. It looked way worst in previews. Did I get the characters backgrounds, towns or fanfare? Nope but that doesn't distract from enjoying the film. What distracts from the film is the actual production. They obviously clipped this down and left out linking scenes that are very apparent as things just literally jump from scene and place to place with no transition. It's pretty horrendous and apparent but doesn't make it any less fun when things get intense. OK now for the negatives that in no way should hinder you from seeing it just make it from a film and movie piece itself have some glaring issues. The transitions from scene to scene are so sporadic, so quick and non-smooth it is literally like watching an animated jr high PowerPoint presentation with the "slide" transition used in overboard during scene changes. Then the next scene will have no intro or background just through you into a non set up convo or action sequence. Also the human support cast (other than main people) aren't in the same league and feel like children movie actors. They have potential but yeah. However those things don't make this movie unseeable just make this a bad movie from a movie critic standpoint, not a fan which is why I think movie industry buffs concerned with the movie production and flow cons give this a failing score and everyone else can give it a solid B for a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Troubled and flawed, but surprisingly full of heart and unexpected depth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critical response to this movie basically confirmed to me the old adage that those who can't create criticise. Let's be clear right away that this movie isn't some artistic breakthrough that will shatter the industry's foundations and set a precedent for all movies to come. It's not even the best of its kind. But that doesn't justify the abysmal reviews it has been getting, especially in view of meaningless flicks like Captain America and its sort getting such high ratings.I'm a fan of Warcraft lore in that I've followed it from very early on and appreciated some parts of it, though I freely acknowledge that it is a derivative mashup that usually falls short of anything substantial. Subsequently I did not approach this movie with high expectations. In fact, I was pretty much certain that it would be a disaster, which made it all the more satisfying when I was proved to the contrary.The production values on some of the human set-pieces seemed fairly low. The writer who wrote the dialogue would do good to read Game of Thrones and educate himself a little. The actors that played the humans could have taken their characters further, though it was probably very hard with the given script. All in all, the movie felt very rushed with scenes cutting abruptly, leaving huge holes in terms of exposition. While game fans can easily fill in for themselves, others might find that more difficult, which probably explains some of the reviewers' chagrin. Many plot devices used by the script were incredibly predictable and cheap as well.You might wonder why I've given the movie such a high rating despite all these many failings. Yes, it has many, many flaws, but there is something to it, it has a heart of kinds that redeems it, that touches on something much deeper than you might expect it to, especially in the way it treats the plight of the Orcish people, representing "monsters", which they supposedly are, as "human". The orcs are acted exceedingly well, their characters and dialogue are fleshed out, perhaps because the writers simply let themselves go of expectations since there could be none in this situation. Situations in which their concept of honour is explored are incredibly touching and thought- provoking. Their situation in many ways actually mirrors the situation of the Syrian immigrants, who though they are of a different culture that in many ways clashes with ours, nonetheless find themselves without a home and in search of one, only to meet ours pushing them back.The reason I give the movie a high rating is that at its core, it is very strong. It falters in too many ways, but given an extra hour and some rewriting, it is so close to perfection that I feel it is a great shame that the snobs are dragging its name through the mud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Critics are WRONG</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really getting the vibe that the stuffy critics are really just ignorant as to what Warcraft even is. I mean, sure, it felt fast- paced, but it's Warcraft lore - you can't tell one story in a two-hour sitting without pacing it as such. I mean seriously - Warcraft has at least 10 movies worth of stories to tell.As someone who knows the lore, this is exactly what I expected. I wanted to see something come to life and visualize the stuff that I have read in the past. The story felt true, and there were even a few moments where I was like, "Hm. I didn't know that about XYZ."My boyfriend isn't into the lore or the game either, and he came to see it with me, and loved it, as well. Honestly, just read some of the reviews from real people and not these critics. It was well made, well animated, had a great story to it (thought predictable if you know the lore, but that's because hey - they didn't go destroying a bunch of lore to be 'fresh' and 'unique') - Take it from someone who knows the genre, not these people who probably had to google a bunch of stuff just to make their review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can critics please stop comparing this movie to Lord of the Rings! Simply because they both have orcs and war, doesn't mean they are the god damn same! Or that this movie tries to imitate it!In my opinion this movie is gorgeous to look at. A technical delight, especially in the animations of the orcs. Set pieces are creative and colorful, and the visual presentation of the characters are also very creative. Sure the story can be a bit inconsistent, and the acting leaves some to be desired. But i still feel like this movie has a beautiful presentation, a serious take on the lore of Warcraft with a well-rounded story and cool scenes and characters. In addition, I find the topic of duality within the orcish society and within themselves to be both interesting and dare I say original for this genre.</fullReview>

I think they enjoyed the movie even more then I did, while I played all the games.Don't believe the critics. Go watch yourself before judging. In general I tend to agree with critics, but this time they are completely wrong. With three people with me who don't know anything about the Warcraft Universe, I was in a good position to compare some of the issues from the critics with your neutral viewer. Hardly anything held up.The pace and it being ''all over the place'' wasn't experienced in the slightest by my friends. They wanted more and more. The special effects didn't bother me at all. Of course certain background information wasn't explained (you can only do so much with a movie), but it didn't bother my group at all. Apart from me being able to fill in the blanks after the movie, they just didn't think about it. They loved the story, characters and the world as a whole. We can only hope for another one of the these. Critics be damned!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterclass in adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've got bored with the Warcraft strategy games a long time ago and developed a hate for World of Warcraft the MMO years ago (due to the multiplayer experience, not the game), even when I was playing I found zero appeal in the horde. This movie made me forget all about that.They took the essence of what I knew and loved about the games and fused them into an almost uninterrupted sequence of consecutive scenes overwhelming me with nostalgia. 10 minutes in I highly doubt I was blinking even once until the end of the movie. While the story could've been a tiny bit more multifaceted, and certain characters could've been more involved in it, I can't say for sure I could have enjoyed the movie with a different story more than I already have. I admit I am completely incapable to look at this movie from the perspective of someone who has never played any Warcraft title, but only because this is the best movie adaptation of anything I've seen in my 3 decades of being on this Earth, and with the late surge of DC and Marvel movies, that's saying something.If you like fantasy movies in general that's not an assurance in itself that you will definitely like Warcraft the movie, but if you are curious what the Warcraft universe is all about, you most assuredly will get the genuine Warcraft experience with this movie. I judge it for what it is, an adaptation, and on that front it delivered 100%!I'm looking forward to seeing more of the same in the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My movie of the year, **Sequel needed right away** You don't have to be a Warcraft fan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to say that I am a WoW fan. Its been a huge part of my childhood, but this doesn't blur my opinion about this movie. It's good. Really good i would say. Why even listen to Rotten Tomatoes anymore, those critics are just some bored people who are afraid to have their own opinions, because they don't want to lose their reputation. They have a tendency to just jump on the hate-train for no particular reason. So don't listen to the critics, that is my number one tip for you guys!A couple of days ago, i watched a video on IGN, with to guys who haven't even seen the movie, sitting their roasting it, that's actually scary to some extinct. A small pinpoint of what reviewing has succumbed to these days.On with the review though! I watched this with my dad, my sister and my friend. My dad and my sister have never delved into the warcraft universe (I highly recommend it though) but they enjoyed it quite a lot! I would compare this to the Lord of the rings to an extinct. I watched it in a IMAX theater which was a great choice! It was a stunning thrill-ride. Warcraft misses a little bit of buildup, which The Lord of The Rings had, The story gets a little bit fast paced. The Warcraft universe is big, no doubt about that. So it was some hard choices that Blizzard and Legendary had to make. It was either, to please the fan community more, and add more references to other parts of the backstory that would make the movie confusing. Or on the other hand, make it suitable for more audiences, so more people could it enjoy it. That is why a little bit of stuff seems a bit to shallow at times.Its important to know that this Movie is build upon one of the first Warcraft games (Orcs &amp; Humans), Not World of Warcraft, which many people think. That is why is mostly centered around Orcs &amp; Humans, because not many of the events which include other races has occurred yet. But they will come, trust me! So good news for you if you are a die-hard elf fan!Personally i had thought this movie was gonna be a huge flop. I had even prepared my own puns like "Borecraft", "Snorecraft" and "A film i wish i had not payed forcraft". But i simply couldn't find anything to hate about it, except the fast paced story. It looks FANTASTIC! You need to see this for yourselves! The CGI worked very well with the humans, and you didn't at any point feel like they were just running around in front of a greenscreen. The dialogue was generic, and it didn't feel too forced like in the prequels of Star Wars for example, there was only a few flaws, nothing big. The choice of Actors was great! Simply loved Toby Kebbel(Durotan) and Travis Fimmel(Anduin Lothar), they did a terrific job with portraying their characters! Especially Durotan seemed to steal everyone's attention when he was present during the movie!Sometimes i think the armor that basically all the humans are wearing, can get a little bit too shiny and clean. Like they are wearing a new one every 10 minutes. The orcs and their fierce armors of all kinds look fantastic! Applause to the costume guy!Its not only for fanboys, and i think Duncan Jones really wants to create something with this franchise, that I'm totally on board with! All hail the son of Bowie. If they manage to pull of a sequel that is just close to as good as this one, i think Warcraft could actually get to the point where it will be remembered as one of the big ones, like LOTR and GOT. Definitely a lot to see here, and if you are fan of fantasy or just a movie with a thick plot and script, Warcraft is for you! With "The beginning" in its title, there must be a sequel in the works i hope!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>high fantasy movie, well executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie having very low expectations as a lot of professional reviewers seem to be in competition to write how bad the movie is. It was a pleasant and positive surprise to see this movie. Excellent special effects. Has everything you would expect from a fantasy movie Very enjoyable and highly recommended specially if you are fortunate enough to have access to IMAX theaters close to you. It does a very good job of telling the early the story of warcraft and introducing you to the warcraft universe. Hopefully this will be the start of this franchise as the story really gets off in the next episodes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly I want to admit that I have little to no knowledge on the game so I went to the theater with an open mind and I wasn't disappointed, Duncan Jones delivers a movie that is rich in story and visuals, but what stood out for me, Was Anduin Lothar who plays a commander and is a key element in the outcome of the war. What makes this movie unique and separates it from other video game adaptations is; It doesn't bother with origin stories, instead, It hits the ground running, Showing us who we are up against, the Witch Doctor, (If memory serves that is what he is called). Who uses humans to fuel the gate, opens a door(the lack of a better term) to our world and this is where we our journey begins. This movie deserves to be seen on the big screen, The visual effects are breathtaking. As Duncun Jones treats your eyes to a visual feast and an engrossing story. I would recommend this to all science fiction fans. The ending leaves you craving for more...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly entertaining with real depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never played the game, I don't 'do' fantasy movies (never seen LOTR, and couldn't get past the first 30 minutes of Avatar, and almost slept through The Dark Knight), but I loved "Moon" and "Source Code". So it was a no-brainer to see Warcraft. And I am so glad I did. There's a lot more depth to the film than I expected.The story is simple enough on the surface, but with layers to keep you interested. And it retains Jones' underlying theme of shifting perspectives that was so central to his earlier movies. This lack of a 'can't-miss pinned-down focal point' may be what floored the critics (simple souls that they are). The plot develops and shifts, and the obvious linearity of (for example) so many super-hero movies is transmuted into something much more circumspect, much more challenging and less certain. The plot ripples, and has real sensitivity among the wonderfully presented bash and blast.Yes, it's a film that takes a bit of work and concentration to 'get', but it amply repays the effort and in any event this is mediated by amazing CGI and imaging. Visually it's an absolute treat, with some wonderful battle sequences and great magical duels. And the Orcs are fab! You won't get bored, and you will be thoroughly entertained. As for the gaming aspects, even as a non-gamer I could get a number of the jokes (I'm sure there are many I missed), and Warcraft does need to stay true to its roots. It's not Superman, it's not LOTR or Harry Potter. It's Warcraft... The Beginning, and I for one want more. Well worth seeing. Engaging and entertaining from start to finish. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute spectacle !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it Lord of the Rings? No, not enough Anglo Saxon inspired names. Is it Game of Thrones? No, not enough boobs and incest. Is it a Fantasy film that will excite and entertain? Absolutely! From the very opening scene you are blown away by the visuals. As soon as you clap your eyes upon an orc face you are met with what I can only describe as a photo-realistic cartoon. You know you are looking at a fantasy creature but the detail of the skin, hair and movement tell you otherwise. The scenery is breathtaking, trees greener than any you've seen before, towers taller than you can imagine. I have read many reviews that have stated its not real enough, the orcs don't look like real orcs, the magic doesn't look like real magic and the cities don't look like real cities. I'm sorry but isn't a fantasy film meant to be about a fantasy place, involving fantasy characters? speaking of characters, there are plenty which leads me to my only gripe with this film ... expositions. The reality of bringing a world this big and complicated to a new audience is that you only have few hours to introduce, explain and build on each character. this lead to, at times, heavy clunky moments of exposition. My name is x, this is my personal history aaaaand moving on. But and this is a big 'but', the performances given by the actors were incredible, they had so little time to get you invested in them but they really managed to do it. the fight scenes are great despite being mostly computerized. You feel the impacts, you squirm at blows, it all seems to connect in a very real and visceral way. Hats of to all who created this film, this could have been a major flop. I mean it really could have been crap, they could have skimped on effects, got the wrong actors for the roles, it could have been a quick cash grab and advert for the game. Instead however we get a film that is clearly full of passion and heart and absolutely entertaining.Ps: ignore the critics reviews they are just people who get paid to tell you their opinion, they don't know a good movie more than you or I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I never loved LOTR, nor did I play Warcraft, but I love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the cinema without expecting much, although I really enjoyed the trailers. I love fantasy flicks with a good storyline, strong performances and with some action in it. This movie has it all. As stated in my title, I never played the game, so I can't judge whether they did justice to the game, but on its own it is very entertaining. Can't wait to watch the sequel. I watched it in IMAX 3D and it was worth it, although I don't always enjoy wearing 3D glasses ;) I assume I belong to the minority, but I never enjoyed the Lord of The Rings trilogy, and since I read a few times that Warcraft shares some similarities to that trilogy, I wanted to clarify my opinion to this. For me Warcraft isn't that boring and protracted ;). It has more action sequences and I really liked the CGI in that.What I should also mention is that the choice of casting Travis Fimmel was a fabulous idea, because for me without him this movie would be only average. I admire directors who don't cast the wannabe A-list actors who look good, but can't act... Duncan Jones doesn't seem like that, as the actors he chose for Moon (2009) and Source Code (2011) were really good. Hope to see more indie films directed by him in future.</fullReview>

I have read so many user based reviews, and they don't share your opinion, AND THANK GOD FOR THAT:). Maybe the users, and the people actually paying to see films, should have a chance to give reviews on the critics in the future.....just so all can see how much bullshit you can spit out, on something you haven't a clue about. Enough said, go watch this movie, and tell the critics that the fans are not disappointed AT ALL:). If you like Lord of The Rings, you will also like this movie, and hopefully there will come many sequels in this franchise, for the fanbase and everyone who will not listen to the stupid critic reviews, obviously they don't know anything about the game.</fullReview>

The special effects are great, there's humor, drama, tension and mystery and whats more exciting: this is only the prelude to a really complex story that follows. Thus, its only downside is that it lets you wanting for more.</fullReview>

The orcs and humans look seriously good and story is also well written. I hope that there will be more Warcraft films coming in future because the lore of Warcraft universe is huge. I'd love to see development of story and appearance of Illidan and Arthas on TV screen because I think it would be even more cool. So my conclusion is that I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is truly amazing.

		<shortDescription>Great design, however a little too much information missing for a dedicated follower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wouldn't say its the worst film I've seen, but for any of the people who have actually read the books or played the game it goes off tangent a bit too much. I was expecting it to go off a little bit but I believe they pushed it a little too much. It was very well designed however. I do also believe that they missed out the best part of the rise of the horde, which is gul'dans rise to power and the discovery of the draenei, instead we get these blue pig looking creatures in their cages having their souls harvested. There isn't a single mention of mannaroth of kil'jaeden, which baffles me, because in the books gul'dan speaks to kil'jaeden quite a lot of the time and is displayed as a puppet, just as ner'zhul was prior to him. Could of really hit the nail on the head but missed out a little bit too much for a dedicated player/reader of the books. I do understand there needs to be a balance to attract the basic movie watcher, but they compromised too much and didn't give what us wow players have waited 8 years for in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. Right that's the basic review. The movie was a brilliant way to introduce the beginning of the struggle for Azeroth. However I believe it may be a bit confusing for those who never played the game. We all know each back story and Lore for the characters so we don't need it spelling out but I think next time a bit more filler for those who are new to the franchise, as film-goers only, would be a great idea. The movie is fast paced and fun. The races are portrayed with respect. The Orcs are huge behemoths and the humans weak but brave. Gul'Dan is menacing and larger than life. I would have liked to have seen more races in the movie but that's only my desire as a fan not a film-goer. I am waiting expectantly for news of a follow up. I hope the film grosses well all over and Duncan is invited back. All-in-all well worth the entrance fee.</fullReview>

The CGI is very well done, the orcs just look great, massive frightening, ugly and battle scarred. When they run into battle you feel every blow (felt sorry for the humans) and as for the every location just incredible, again fans are going to just love the look of all the familiar locations. The battle scenes are just bone breaking and very epic, everything is so well polished a joy to watch. All round a great film that will please fans and is very enjoyable for none fans of the game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fist off, I'm a long time player of World of Warcaft and so yes, I'm invested in the franchise, the characters and the world so this movie doesn't have to stand alone for me as an introduction to the subject.That being said I'm a grown man and this is a movie, not the game and I'm really very fussy about what I like and what I don't, so I must admit some of the reviews and the initial trailers had made me concerned I might be disappointed in a lightweight take on the hugely developed Warcraft universe.I should not have worried however as nothing could have been further from the truth. From the moment the film started till the very last credit scrolled off the screen, I and the rest of the mostly full (it was past midnight when it ended) cinema couldn't move from our seats or wipe the smiles off our faces.I can honestly say, go see this movie and take your long suffering Warcraft widows!! The only thing I would honestly have changed would have been for there to have been even more of it. Could have quite happily stayed another hour immersed in the world so lovingly reproduced on screen.Well done, can't wait for more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was excellent. Some of the acting may seem slightly out but the time reference the film has to play to is the issue. The CGI is the best there's ever been and Ben Schnetzer, along with Toby Kebbell, stand out although everyone does a stand up job. The story has some gaps from a watchers perception that isn't already engrossed with the lore, but the movie flows really well. Duncan Jones does a great job with, what i consider, his first big project. I loved Source code but i can see its faults, i am a huge 'Groundhog Day' type movie fan though. I am yet to see Moon. Overall though i will give this a huge rating due to the technical difficulty in bringing this to a cinematic format. Its brilliantly done. There's the possibility that you wont get the movie at all, i know, if you are not as invested in it, which i am as a player. But i think you should be able to get over these things if you have never been a WoW or Warcraft player, so long as you watch it with the attitude of wanting to be engrossed. Dive in, let it wash over you, and enjoy the experience.</fullReview>

It was great to recognize many thing of the different games Blizzard has released. Like the winks to the players.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film, Can't Wait For More!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have waited near enough 10 years for this film, and having finally seen it, it did not disappoint. I will cover my non-spoiler thoughts first, then give a spoiler warning before covering my thoughts containing spoilers.The visuals and CGI is all wonderfully done. All pre-existing characters are portrayed keeping faithfully to the existing lore in terms of who they are and what they fight for. There are a few easter eggs for Warcraft fans instantly noticeable, and I'm sure there are probably more I didn't notice.The film was a lot more gritty than I expected it to be, with quite a few depressing points. Some of the CGI work is more grisly than I would have expected.There are a number of changes, which I will cover in the spoiler section of this review. While the part of me that hates change would prefer to keep things as they were, I honestly don't mind too much that they changed these details. The outcome is still more or less the same. I recognise that some things had to be changed to make the film work as a film, and I appreciate that.In terms of criticism, I feel that the film should have focused more on individual characters. Other characters did appear, but weren't named. There wasn't really any time given at all to tell the audience who the individual characters were. This caused no problem for me, as I already know the characters, but I worry that someone who isn't already a Warcraft fan might feel lost. Of course as I am already a Warcraft fan, I don't know. I certainly hope non-fans enjoyed it as much as fans did.There was also a sense that there was too much story packed into a single film, condensing it, losing details and opportunities to explain who characters were to the audience.In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I am eager for the official release, and I can't wait for further sequels! I would definitely recommend this film to anyone.********SPOILER WARNING*********************SPOILER WARNING*************At the same time as packing too much story into a short space of time, it also felt that not enough time was shown. The entire First War seemingly happens within the space of a couple of weeks. No time is indicated, but it seems that not much time occurred.In terms of characters, I have a couple of complaints. Although starting off with a strong focus on Durotan, nothing else is shown from his point of view after the film moves to the human point of view. Blackhand is present throughout the film, but I just felt the film should have focused on him a bit more.Several changes were made from established lore. Now I will detail a few key examples. For a start, Grommash Hellscream is shown fighting against the Humans on Azeroth, despite the story establishing that he and the Warsong Clan remained behind on Draenor, and did not encounter the Humans until after the Second War. In established lore, Orgrim Doomhammer was an Orc of the Blackrock Clan. In the film, Doomhammer is an Orc of the Frostwolf Clan. However I approve of this change, as it gets Durotan's and Orgrim's friendship across much quicker and easier.In established lore, Gul'dan immediately exiled the Frostwolf Clan on arrival on Azeroth, and go to live in the region of Alterac. In the film, the Frostwolf Clan are a part of the Horde.Draka and Durotan are killed separately in different ways, at a different point in time. In the established story, Durotan and Draka were assassinated by Shadow Council spies after a meeting with Orgrim Doomhammer, after Orgrim became Warchief of the Horde, during the Second War. In the film, Draka dies fighting a unnamed Orc after sending baby Thrall down a river in a basket to save him. Durotan has the life drained out of him in Mak'Gora against Gul'dan.In established canon, Orgrim Doomhammer killed Blackhand to replace him as Warchief of the Horde. In the film, Lothar kills Blackhand in a Mak'Gora.The biggest change I approve of is the manner of Garona's assassination of King Llane. Rather than being forced by the Shadow Council to kill King Llane, King Llane urges Garona to kill him, to save herself after being surrounded by Orcs, with Blackhand making his way to personally kill King Llane. With this ending, it makes a lot more sense as to why Garona killed King Llane. With this act, she is able to survive into a position of respect from the Orcs, where she can help to create peace.The film ends on a bittersweet high point, with the formation of the Alliance, rather than the expected ending of the sacking of Stormwind. I expect this event will be covered in the second film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review from a devoted and enthusiastic WoW gamer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About me: Hardcore gamer during Vanilla and TBC spent a combined /played time of 900+ days.Movie vs lore: The movie is like many others not entirely correlated with the lore, but fairly close. To avoid any spoilers I will not mention them here, but there are some deviations that could potentially compromise great lore in the following movies assuming more will be produced.Actors: Travis Fimmel: Does an amazing job and is very likable just as he is in Vikings. Toby Kebbel (Durotan) also does an amazing and convincing job. The only actor i didn't particularly like is Paula Patton, she doesn't fit the lore character and her acting is just not convincing making her the reason i gave 9 instead of 10. Just to mention 1 scene, she gently drinks a cup of water during imprisonment after wiping her mouth. &lt;-- not the typical behavior you would expect by a wild half orc. there are plenty of other scenes were she just doesn't act according to her character. Its sad that a pretty face with little talent are allowed in such epic movies, i would rather have a talented ugly orc that could play her part instead of an emotional, good looking, unconvincing actor.The effects and CGI: Simply fantastic and it should definitely be watched in Cinema with good sound system, because the sound effects are also a major factor in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you have enjoyed any of the games past or presently, you will like Warcraft.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from the midday screening of Warcraft here in the UK and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The soundtrack is awesome, and even though there is a fair amount of lore (which might be a bit confusing for those not familiar with any of the history), the story is still very good and surprisingly complex. It does a great job of portraying both sides as having both good and evil,and in particular actually spends time with the Orcs in exploring their cultural and political processes, so they feel like real beings and not just mindless monsters. This means that despite its rather straight laced high fantasy appearance, the more complex narrative gives the movie quite a modern feel.The action itself is great, the Orcs in particular are awesome, and there's a bunch of cool Easter eggs. The CGI can be a bit jarring at first, but I think that's because you're used to CG trying to be photo-realistic (and it is very good, very detailed), but once you realise it's trying to be more stylised, closer to the animation style of the game, you kind of "get it" and it's not really an issue anymore.I'm not a hardcore fan either. The last time I logged into the game was about 4 years ago, and even when I did actively play I wasn't in a clan, I didn't go on raids. My highest level character was about 70 from over several years. Just a casual gamer. So I would advise any fans of the games, past or present, to go and see this movie and make up your own minds. I was skeptical myself having seen some critical reviews, but I actually really liked it.For the Horde.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent action flick, but felt too rushed for its own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film today. As a former WoW player, and someone who has read up on some lore about various characters, here are my thoughts on the film:Pros: 1. Visual details are very faithful to the WoW games. If you're a WoW player, you would feel like watching the leveling zones come to life. 2. It is a balanced movie; not too dark not too light. It has the even formula of a good action movie. 3. Visual effects - one of the things that I had reservations with initially. This applies mostly to the Orcs, and I think they pulled it off. They don't look too CGI, which is good. 4. Storyline is good. The lore is pretty good, so I don't expect less from the movie.Cons: All the cons I have found in this movie is because of the fact that the movie is too short. I cannot believe it is only 2 hours long.1. Too rushed - this lore is very extensive, with a lot of key players shaping up this era and also the future era. 2. Characters lacking soul - the movie serves cohesion for both casual and knowledgeable audiences, making it very easy to understand for the latter while not doing a disservice to the former. However, I just personally feel that the characters sacrificed a lot of their background in order to fit the main plot into a 2h movie. 3. Lack of build up - the war, the key characters, the resolution, they all lack build up because of time constraints. The plot just moved way too fast for its own good. 4. Action scenes could've been better - there is no drama, no anticipation, just pure action. This is mostly because of #3.In conclusion: It is a very typical summer action flick. It is not a bad movie, but it is also not the best. I am a bit disappointed because I expected something to a more of a LotR format where they build the characters and the plot to a point where the audience would gain empathy and understand where they are coming from.This could've been epic but really got affected because it was rushed. There is no apparent character development, if they die, you really don't feel anything. If someone dies, as a new audience, you won't even realize how much impact that would be.There is no soul between characters, the action scenes are generic. The lack of orchestration on the final confrontation was sub-par. There is no excitement, no fire, just something you'd say "ok, that was cool" and then you move on with your life.But for me, the movie was decent. But I'm not sure if it's going to entice new audiences towards reading up on the lore as it is not as detailed as LotR. It just felt like a flash in the pan movie that people will just say "it's a movie I saw last summer." You cannot underestimate people that reads up on interesting lore like LotR, Harry Potter, etc., this would've massively boosted WoW in terms of mainstream success, but for me, it was just there really.The whole thing could've been an intricate saga, but they really went the other way. It's like, instead of going for TDK, it went for BvS (but with a better faith to lore). Instead of going for The Avengers, they went for X-Men: Apocalypse. Take it however you want.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was great i gave it 9/10 it should have giving 30 min more to go deeper with the characters for those who have no clue whats the Warcraft lore is about so they stop f*cking complaining And / Or those unfamiliar with the franchise it self.. plus i was hoping for more soundtracks to be deployed in almost every seen! like in-game when we enter every instance And areas ! ( actually that IS one of the beautiful things in wow ) don't want to compare wow to Warcraft but HEY! Warcraft story IS in fact wow too :) And the fact that they put much of wow locations and seen's so anyway moving on.. to the LAST FIGHT clip.. I DO NOT LIKE THAT FIGHT AT ALL note : see how Durotan vs Gul'dan seen how amazingly executed that was! YES that's how it should be done in the end .. why simply because it was just FULL cooldown don't want to spoil but you will get what i mean:S like wtf why ? whats wrong in giving this seen 1 more min!! preforming an action based on a Skill in game HUH ?? HUH ?? that would be interesting yeah ? .. give me the job of Jones and i make a greater one .. not kidding now back to the actors , they were Okey. no sorry Average! .. i do not want to see average for WARCRAFT movie .. i want to see Above Good at least .. actor with experience.Khadgar And Llane Wrynn Were MEEEEEH! for actingnow that's honest review with perfect ideas .&#xfeff;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Warcraft fan... I loved it! It had everything, from the way lore plays out, despite changes to the original, it kept the important key moments of it, all the way to Easter eggs. I couldn't be more satisfied and wanting a extended edition or even a sequel soon. It deserves 8-9/10.As a non-Warcraft fan... I can see where the problems were, but even that didn't deserve 1-3/10 rating it's getting on Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes, that's just bias opinion from upper-class snobs, bribed assholes or even people who are determined to have the mindset of "game movies are inherently bad" forever. The problems come from one regrettable fact: Movie was cut down way too much! It should've been at least 30min longer, or be the original 3 hours length, like LotR was; because you notice that there's some very abrupt cuts happening and there are missing scenes we've seen in the trailers or even SDCC leaks. That's why certain characters feel the certain lack of depth and/or character development and that's where the movie suffers greatly.So I'm a bit split on this matter; on one hand you see almost all the chieftain/warlords in the movie together (apart from Ner'zhul for obvious reasons), yet they have no speaking lines, but on the other hand, it avoided the cluster-problem the Hobbit had, where 13 dwarfs only had 4 dwarfs that really mattered, while others where there for comic relief or for just being there because the adaptation demanded.All in all it was still enjoyable to watch, so it deserves a 6/10 at least, and I would go watch it again simply because it looks amazing.I just hope that Duncan is able to release the Directors cut so we can finally see the movie in FULL SPLENDOR!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a longtime fan of the Warcraft series, upon hearing about the film, I feared that it would be horrible. Up until the moment I reached the theater, I was concerned that the movie might be as bad as critics have been claiming. I was so wrong. The movie as a whole was filled with stunning special effects, the actors portrayed their characters perfectly, and the story was very well put together.I watched the film alongside a friend of mine who was not familiar with the original story of the Warcraft games, and outside of a few questions, she was able to completely understand and enjoy the entire movie.If you are a fan of the Warcraft franchise or are simply looking for an entertaining fantasy film, I would highly recommend this film to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved this movie.I've never liked the whole Orc Fantasy scenario. It always felt off putting so I never touched any of the games this movie was based on either.However for this movie what really made it for me were the Orcs. They look strong, fearsome, violent yet they were able to convey emotions such as sadness, love and compassion too. You normally don't expect that from such scary looking things.The cast is great as well, Travis Fimmel was a great choice as the main Character, and the rest too, I think.Anyways I honestly cant wait for a sequel and hope it gets here soon, preferably from the same director as he did a really great job here.I hope this review helped you, excuse me now, this movie has made me want to buy n play the Warcraft games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of times and worst of times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any time a popular video game is made into a movie you can expect epic cheese to ensue. Did this happen with Warcraft? Yes and No. The good: The Orcs. Not only was the CGI top rate, the characterization of the Orcs will have you cheering for them and not the humans. The not so good: The Humans. In contrast to the awe inspiring Orcs, the humans were straight out of a renaissance festival. The characters were stiff, uninspired and always costume clean. The very cool: Landscapes. If you are a Warcraft fan the movie brings the game environments to life. We have beautiful renditions of Stormwind, Ironforge, Elwynn Forest, Deadwind Pass and the Dark Portal.How about the story? Not too much to see here. The Orc story is OK. They need to find a new place to live and pick Azeroth. There is more to the Orc story, but I will let you see that for yourself. The Human story dealing with the Orc invasion is lackluster. The Warcraft universe can be every bit as rich and deep as The Lord of the Rings. However, you don't get that kind of story here. But, what you do get is not bad, from the Orc side. The battle sequences have a reason for being in the movie and are not mindless fighting like many recent superhero movies. The sequencing of scenes was a little odd though, making the movie often look more like flash cards of cut scenes. I'm a big fan of the games so this was OK, but if you are not the story is hard to follow. I would not consider this to be a stand-alone movie, as it does not explain anything going on.Bottom Line: If you are fan of the games it is visually impressive and the story is passable. If you know nothing of the games you will probably be lost and bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every one that comments it was a bad movie, I bet they never even seen it before. This movie got more out of me plot-wise and action-wise than any other movie I've seen.The actors where AMAZING! I thought Khadgar and Garona was going to be a major fail, Guess not. Their performance was amazing... Though Warcraft changed some things from original game, I see why they'd do it. I wouldn't want to make a movie about a single pickle getting eaten by a crab, I'd make a single pickle getting eaten by a crab with a MG16. If that makes since.Top 5 favorite actors, 1 is best: 5.Medivh 4.Garona 3.Orgrim 2.Durotan 1.Gul'DanNow with the magic effects, Honestly it's a 10 at best. The magic was great and visuals.Now I am going to say this again, My favorite actor was Gul'dan because he was just such of a devilish evil character, And I got so invested in to him, Who ever played Gul'dan did a fine damn job.I didn't put Lothar on the charts because I don't like the human race, Not that the movie was a "bad" movie, I am a horde player and I will always be with the Horde, But if I was alliance he'd be 4th replacing garona.The plot they did for the movie was amazing, I like how they changed it so it can be more interesting. But though they didn't change a lot of it, nothing too big of a deal.The script was amazing as well, along with the music. SPOILER: In the beginning of the movie it shows Gul'Dan about to charge the portal with the life of the draenei, And how Gul'Dan replies to garona saying "But I need them, I need them all..." Gave me chills.Overall, 10/10 movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first IMDb review. I am writing one for Warcraft because the critics have been anything but fair in their reviews for the movie. Let me say this: Whether or not you are a fan of the game, you will like the movie! It's a wonderful piece of work on fantasy and the visuals as well the sound effects are simply impeccable! The story is very interesting and you don't really need to be familiar with the Warcraft lore to be able to follow the plot. Not to mention, if you have read the lore, it's just that much better! It is, however, an adaptation of the original lore -- a great one at that too! Please go see it. If you are a fan of fantasies, you will not be disappointed. I personally loved Warcraft more than the Lord of the Rings. And boy, I love the Lord of the Rings!!</fullReview>

After one or two critic reviews i was almost put off going to see it as some of them were very mixed in score. However after listening to my WoW friends who had said it was really good, am glad we went to see it. :-) It was a lot better than we thought it would be.

		<fullReview>I will keep it short with no Spoilers!SPECIAL EFFECTS &amp; CGI: 10/10 - This movie just has outstanding visual effects and I don't remember ever seeing such wonderful details in other movies. The Orcs are phenomenal and if you look at the detail of all the weapons and armor on both sides they have an amazing job. SCORE: 10/10 - The original score underlines the whole movie and is doing it in a wonderful way. When those drums are rolling and the horns are being blasted it just completely takes over. ACTING: 7/10 - Some actors could do better, I was a bit disappointed with Llane Wrynn and with Cullen, the son of Lothar. But Travis Fimmel (Lothar) did a very good job, as well as the actors playing Khadgar and Garona. The orcs are of course just fantastic. The level of detail in their faces and eyes showing us all kind of emotions are stunning. PLOT: 8/10 - How can people say it is too long? The movie is way to short... Unfortunately you can really feel that the director had to cut over 30 minutes because the studio wanted only a 2 hour movie. A lot of things are not really explained so people not knowing Warcraft will have a hard time a few times. OVERALL: 9/10 - I hope that a lot of people will go and see this movie in the US. Unfortunately it seems like they are not that interested in Warcraft which I don't really understand. They should not trust those awful official reviews... Warcraft is an upper class fantasy movie that all fans of fantasy should see at least once on the big screen because those visuals are without a doubt "breathtaking".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit disappointed that the action followed the first WoW novel. But the production was better than my imagination! Details were amazing - including the scenery (Stormwind, Iron Forge, Elwin Forest, Kharazan etc). Mage spells were awesome. So were the orcs, the griffons and the wolves. I was sad that I didn't see paladins, rogues or hunters. They also left out Medivh's mother story. In the movie it's not quite clear that Medivh was a good guy and that he brought the Horde to Azeroth to join Allies against the Legion for the greater good, despite the short term loses from first contact. Anyway - amazing movie, even for those who had no contact with WoW lore. IMHO better than latest Star Wars or Hobbit series. Must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft has created a solid cinematic base for its universe in this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been playing WarCraft games since 2002 and I know the quality Blizzard put in their cinematics, so my expectations were actually high. Boy, I was not disappointed! In one of the first scenes, Gul'dan is opening the Dark Portal in an explosion of fel energy sucking souls of the Draenei! The Orcs, enhanced by CGI, look fearsome, brutal and believable! Poor humans after years of peace have no idea what to do.The plot of WarCraft 1 is understandably shaped to fit in a movie, and even though I consider myself a lore-fanatic, it was interesting to see what Dunkan Jones wanted to tell. There are two sides. The free races of Azeroth are getting attacked but are too hesitant to form an alliance. Whereas the Horde, while mighty, is being torn apart by internal disagreements because Gul'dan practices magic that corrupts land itself. Fel energies have destroyed their homeland and are the reason they're seeking a new one in the first place, so that's why the "good" Orcs oppose Gul'dan. Too bad the old warlock can wreck faces in melee combat. Ouch!Humans are depicted quite clueless, seeking the help of the Guardian (of Tirisfal), Medivh. Ben Foster beautifully mastered his role of the mage possessed by a demon lord. The plot basically rotates around him. The whole story leading to Khadgar getting to know Medivh's secrets is retold in such a way, I didn't know what to expect next second. And the Guardian's death is epic in itself, regaining control over himself and helping the humans in his final moments!Garona is a strong, honest half-Orc trying to survive in the war. Unlike in lore, she doesn't seem to be magically enslaved by Gul'dan here. But it has made her betrayal of humans even more tragic and heart-breaking!The visuals are completely out of the world. Arcane magic is blue and powerful, fel is toxic and overwhelming, souls are sucked right from the shrinking bodies! I won't even touch on the architecture of Stormwind, or Kharazan, or Oricsh tents and towers!The only critique I have is the screen time for the initial stage of the war when humans lost legions of their warriors is quite short (it would be nigh-impossible to include everything though). Also, such places as Ironforge and the flying city of Dalaran (yes, in the First War) are only shown for brief moments. I hope, they'll return in the future films!Overall, it's a solid base for the Warcraft universe in the movie format. Dunkan Jones doesn't spare the characters from the harshness of their original stories. Sorry, Durotan, Draka, Medivh, Anduin Lothar and others, you will be missed!P.S. Khadgar doesn't magically age after his fight with Medivh in this movie. Anduin's sword doesn't break beneath his body either. Lucky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun to watch, hideously misunderstood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft is a movie that has an 'ok' story and fairly good visual effects, but is incredibly fun to watch for fans of the fantasy Genre.The first problem with the movie is some of the casting choices, although the orcs were perfect and Travis did a fantastic job as Lothar, some other characters like Dominic Cooper as the king and Ben Foster as Medivh feel misplaced. In my opinion, all video game movies should only be made up of good actors who enjoy the actual video game, so they'll put more soul into their performance. -The other problem is some of the special effects. Don't get me wrong, most of it was absolutely mind blowing and we have never seen a film on the big screen with so much magic and spells, not even LotR. However there were some moments that the CGI looked a bit naff, such as the clay golem and the wall of lightning, but that might just be me. I also felt like Gul'Dan at points looked very video-gamey with his CGI. -The combat was a mixed bag. The large action scenes were epic and I absolutely loved the final battle, but there were points in some of the smaller scenes where humans were fighting orcs and it looked a bit clumsy and awkward, and even slightly cartoonish. -The story was easy to understand, but I feel it wasn't developed well, though it's understandable because of time constraints, but Lothar's son was hard to sympathize with, and the romance between Garona and Lothar felt forced as hell. - There were also some pointless scenes in there, such as the visit to Goldshire and Dalaran, those just feel like they were in there simply to show off the Lion's Pride Inn, and Dalaran. Also I don't know why Alodi was a woman but whatever. There was also Draka giving birth which was a bit weird, in my opinion. However, there's much good in the movie which leads me to think this is the best video game movie to date. The first point is some of the performances were incredible, specifically the orcs Durotan and Ogrim, as well as Garona and Lothar. All were played extremely well. -The story follows WARCRAFT 1 not WORLD OF WARCRAFT, for all those people out there that say things like "The Warcraft movie isn't good because you can't make a good story out of World of Warcraft as it's a world not a story." No, it follows the game from 1996, not 2004, and that game has an extremely easy to follow story, and they portrayed it damned well on the big screen. Though the friends I saw it with had trouble understanding where the orcs came from, they knew what was happening and they know nothing about the Warcraft universe. Was the story original and unique amongst fantasy? Well amongst mainstream fantasy on T.V or the big screen it is, but sure, almost every fantasy story line has been done a thousand times. People compare this story to LotR, which is actually dumb because the only similarities it shares with those films is humans and orcs, and even the orcs are vastly different. The Warcraft movie story is how the orcs and humans meet, and it's easy to understand. - The soundtrack to the film was incredible, from the moment it opened I was blown away by that score done by Ramin Djawadi, the guy who has done many of the Game of Thrones scores as well. - The visuals were also incredible. As mentioned earlier there were problems with some of the CGI at times, but overall it was fantastic, on the levels of something like Avatar which had a far bigger budget than this. The world looked immense, the orcs looked incredible and the armour on the humans was the perfect blend between OTT Warcraft armour, and realistic plate armour. The set designers also did an incredible job with the Stormwind streets and throne room, although we didn't see enough of the former. - There were only two real 'villains' in the movie: Gul'Dan and Medivh. Both were very good. Medivh is discovered by Khadgar and Lothar to be corrupted by the fel, but he does a good job hiding it up until that point, and at first you do believe he is a good guy, which just adds to how well he was played. Gul'Dan is more of a stereotypical villain, but he certainly brought some incredibly dark scenes into the movie which was actually refreshing to see in a big- screen fantasy, and his fight with Durotan was epic. In all, both are great antagonists. - The ending was alright, although it was an obvious cliffhanger which kind of took away from it (I was expecting the fall of Stormwind), but the 'For the Alliance' moment gave me chills as an alliance player. But the final battle itself was great, and although it was a lot different to the Warcraft 1 story, it worked well and they did a good job with it. In all, it isn't LotR or GoT, it is its own stand-out story. It's also based off Warcraft 1, which had a clear and easy-to-follow story. I haven't played Warcraft 1 or 2 and I only have basic knowledge of the lore around those games, but I still found it easy to understand and thoroughly enjoyable. Objectively it'd be a 6 or 7/10, but because I had such fun watching it and it is arguably the best video game movie to date, I'd say my experience was an 8/10 watching this in the cinema, and I enjoyed it as much as some much bigger films that are objectively better.</fullReview>

After seeing the first frame, I immediately realized that it will be very cool. Seriously, I'm all covered with goose bumps when I saw how much it is great. I was just literally shaking when I saw the gorgeous magic. However, better than in this movie magic effects have not been implemented in any fantasy films, it seems to me.

		<fullReview>I loved this film! Going in I thought you would have had to be a die hard fan of the old Warcraft games but it really wasn't the case. The story was surprisingly easy to follow so I hope people aren't put off as I almost was.The feature certainly didn't disappoint in terms of battles either. I only found out it was a 12 just before it started and from then expected a bounty of boring play-fights, but you honestly would never guess. Seriously, some seriously brutal action in there.The visuals are absurdly good. It all felt so real and does such a terrific job of sucking you into the world. They painted such a beautiful and terrifying world that looked truly wondrous on the big screen.I'd say the downsides are that it does throw a lot of stuff at you which can be off putting. And it does slow down a little at the beginning, lumbering you down with introductions that seem to drag on. That said, I think that it was a necessary evil as the film definitely picks up afterwards, using all these characters to indulge you in an absorbing and in-depth story.The story itself wasn't all that revolutionary in my opinion, but I still thought it was solid. Overall, it felt like a gripping amalgamation of Lord of the Rings and Avatar.Would certainly recommend to both fans and non-fans alike.</fullReview>

Magic is a big part of the movie and they done it right! the visual effects are impressive. the fight scenes / duels are unforgettable, dramatic and satisfying. the story has some twist not just black and white or good vs evil. the Alliance actors did well in portraying their roles especially Lothar, Medivh and Khadgar. I also love Garona.The Orcs..WOW! very convincing, they looked so real. everyone of the Orcs stole the show. From Durotan to Gul'dan. they were Awesome, fascinating to look at. they were intriguing and they draw you in with their performance and their side of the story. Go watch the movie and bring your friends too. it doesn't matter if they have not played the game. this movie is for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made and true to both lore and style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read some bad reviews, made by some danish newspapers. Some of them included comments like "Why Orcs - how unrealistic". While others commented on plot and dialogue. After having watched the film, I feel I must bring another message to the crowd - go watch it, better today than tomorrow!I could go on for miles about how wonderfully made the effects, settings, atmosphere and music was - but I think it would rather help to make a small comment regarding plot and dialogue. Yes, the plot seems to introduce concepts here and there, but while this might seem highly confusing or poorly made, then, at least i felt, it is intended. The first installment of Warcraft does not introduce the audience to every part of Demon-lore - so of course we are going to lack a great deal of explanation. This is a different way of building tension than the film-genre often tend to, but I personally think it works really well. And don't worry - regarding they make another film continuing the plot, then all questions will be answered!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warcraft + Legendary Pictures + Duncan Jones + Industrial Light&amp;Magic = Epicness Sooo STFU Haters? Warcraft is astonishing. The visuals are WOW very well done. The familiar zones from Warcraft universe are all and are built exactly how they are suppose to be built, every Warcraft fan will feel like home and on the brink of shedding tears. I will watch this movie again in 10 June and gather all my friends that were not lucky enough to see it yet and go again, maybe twice. I need more, there has to be more Warcraft movies. Dunca Jones working alongside with Blizzard was a genius move and it shows throughout the movie. Almost 2 hours of pure awesomeness. 9/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am quite surprised at the rate of bad reviews for this movie (on Metacritic). Is it perfect? No, not at all. Is it a satisfying movie experience with a couple of weak spots? Yes, absolutely.I admit, people who've played the games (both WoW and the strategy series) will enjoy this movie far more than a person that had no experience with the franchise. Let's start with a couple of scenes I think fell short. Garona's assassination of Llane had a weird vibe to it. Why not do it like it was done in the lore? It would have made the experience far richer and I think Garona still wouldn't have been an antagonist, but her character would have definitely become more appealing. I think that was a missed opportunity.The romantic stuff was... well, to me it was a little cringe-worthy, but not TOO bad. Nothing tops the overly awkward chemistry between Natalie Portman and Hayden Hayden Christensen in Attack of the Clones, so perhaps that has given me a higher tolerance of cringe-worthy romance. It did not fill too much time, so I don't hold that against the movie. The dialogue however could have been written far better than what we were given.Why not destroy Stormwind City like it happened in the games? That would have been fantastic and actually been a far more dramatic finish! People who did not know the franchise before would have been surprised at the outcome of the movie. The ending just felt a little TOO Hollywood I'm afraid. The pacing: Jesus Christ, everything happened so FAST! I really think some people who haven't played the games were/will have trouble to grasp what's actually happening. It feels like there is no quiet moment, no second to breath and while some may like that (hell, I understand the appeal) I belong to the people who prefer it when there are a couple of scenes that let settle things for a moment. However, I admit that that is just my personal preference.More positively, because I feel like I bashed the movie, while not trying to do that: The little winks now and then to fans of the franchise. I couldn't help myself to smile and thought they were entertaining and thankfully not overdone. The cast seemed perfect, although I imagined Lothar to be slightly older than in the movie (but I love the actor, so f**k it). For the most part I think they stayed as true to the lore as they could, and I believe that the ending was done the way it was, due to intervention by the studio. The action sequences were enjoyable and the movie gave me everything I expected of it. No more, no less... and considering many horrible video game adaptations in the past that is not meant as an insult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great portrait of orcs. And solid launchpad for future films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this by saying that I am probably in the 0.1% when it comes to the lore of Warcraft. I have read at least 6 of the books, played all the strategy games and quite a bit of the world of Warcraft content. Contrary to what I've mostly been hearing, this is NOT a World of Warcraft movie. The story line of Warcraft progresses linearly, Warcraft&#xf0e8;Warcraft 2&#xf0e8;Warcraft 3&#xf0e8; The frozen throne&#xf0e8;World of Warcraft&#xf0e8;Expansions. This movie ONLY includes story line content from the first Warcraft, indeed none of the characters should be recognizable to a WOW fan (except the baby, if you know who that is). Warcraft has always been a very character centered story, indeed nothing happens without a character leading the action, there is no such thing as X race doing Y. Instead it is character Z leading a portion of race X to do Y. As such the movie should be judged on how well it developed its characters. On the positive side I thought the orcs were very well developed, not only do we empathize with Durotan but we also get a sense of the cultural attitudes that the orcs have, with many chieftains and constant fighting between the clans. As such the orcs are successfully portrayed as an honor culture instead of just purely barbaric, to me this is a great success and something that has never been done on screen before. Warcraft to me has established a universe that has much more potential than the Lord of the Rings if only because of the empathy one feels for both sides. On the negative side I thought the humans were a little rushed. Khadgar, the young apprentice mage had rather unnatural dialogue and the actor playing him felt a bit off at times. Lothar was also slightly underdeveloped, perhaps a little more on his relationships should have been done, especially with his son. Visual effects wise I thought the movie was amazing, the spells are truly epic and there is a real sense of scale to be felt. This is not the fantastic movie I was hoping for but it has no large overarching faults, and within the time limit it probably achieves as much as it could have, it is only a shame that it wasn't longer so that it can properly hit all on the tonal cords. However with the universe established, there is much less world building to be done for the sequels and I am craving for the legendary characters to emerge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible movie! An absolute must watch for fans og the Warcraft universe, if you have ever played especially World of Warcraft then you will instantly recognize every place in the movie. It is incredibly beautiful capturing the essence of the game, the scenery is stunning and truthfully better than I had ever imagined it could be in a movie fitting the game. The movie is true to all the characters and the lore. The awesome story from WOW is immortalized finally on the big screen and in a big way. The breathtakingly beautiful soundtrack accompanies every scene, it's a movie that really bring the feelings out in your if you have ever played the game. Flawless movie bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got home from the cinemas where I watched Warcraft: The Beginning. I just have to say that it was a great movie! When the movie started and the first scenes came up on the screen, it just shivered down my spine of excitement! I could recall allot of things from Warcraft and some from World of Warcraft.It followed the lore enough, Great Animation and War scenes, Action, Fantasy and a little bit Drama but not much enough to annoy you. Many Critics say that it is not relatable to The Game World of Warcraft but they don't know anything. This movie is recreated from Warcraft 2 lore. I really do hope they will continue this and I am hoping to be watching another Warcraft movie in a couple of Year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I been playing WOW since the Warcraft games, before it became world of Warcraft, and I got to say, I have missed the history part of the game and seeing this, gives me so much joy. It is a WOW experience in more ways than one.Movie is awesome!! Characters are awesome!!! Given that "we" knew parts of the story line like Thrall being raised by humans etc and the horde roaming all over Azeroth, but this begins the story of HOW it all started and connects the dots to Karazan and Mediev.? can't wait for the sequel, it is going to be so rewarding for a WOW player to see the story become life, and it was 2 hours of pure joy for the gamer, nerd, hard core raider and all parts.It was well... nerd heaven....Thank you!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Fantasy Flick With Some Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read the first few reviews of Warcraft I wondered if it consisted of only fan boys who were promoting the movie just because of nostalgia and fandom. I was aware that some of the critics had given quite bad reviews and therefor I went to see the video with quite low expectations... I was positively surprised.Personally I've played all the Warcraft games and followed the series since the 90's. I know the general story line, but I would not consider myself as a "big fan". I'm just a normal gamer.This movie seem to be the first movie in a series of future Warcraft movies. Therefor it is trying to introduce the universe for the viewer, while at the same time presenting an interesting story. This makes the movie a bit confusing and it definitely feels like they tried to push a bit too much into too short amount of time.The movie has a love story which definitely feels rushed and comes out of nowhere. The movie jumps between locations and scenes very quickly multiple times which leaves the viewer a bit confused what just happened, and while it does this it also tries to stick with the main story line of the Orc invasion of Azeroth, while also trying to introduce this giant universe to the viewer, and explain a clash of different magic types between Warlock and Mages.Even me who has played all the games got confused and I wondered how other people in the theater must have felt.The CGI is top notch and it's not a single time where I feel that the CGI, Magic spells or other effects disturbed in any way. It felt very natural and the Orc's definitely felt natural together with the human actors. The CGI in Warcraft is way better than other fantasy movies such as The Hobbit trilogy.Even though the movie has some problems with its story line, where it tries to push a bit too much information in a very short amount of time, I still consider this movie a success and I consider it one of the better Fantasy movie that I've seen in a long time.The main story line was good. The bad guy was amazing, the art and CGI looked great and I look forward to see the coming movies in the Warcraft franchise.My wife who joined me for the movie, without knowing anything about the Warcraft universe enjoyed the movie even more than I did. She was confused about some parts but it did not prevent her from enjoying the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for the fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first review: Apologies for formatting. First of all: I'm a devout Warcraft fan. Now the important part: Should you see this film?If you are a fan of Warcraft (be it the first games or WoW), this movie is absolutely worth the watch. If you are a casual viewer with an interest in seeing something new, you might want to read a bit about the franchise beforehand. If you have no experience with the games and no intentions of immersing yourself in the universe that is Warcraft, I strongly suggest you do not watch the film, unless you will be able to walk out of there afterwards and admit that you are in no position of fairly judging it. Now comes the actual review: The early, split plot that allows us to follow the orcs and humans separately makes perfect sense to the knowledgeable viewer. The scenes are quickly set, and all of the characters that we should engage ourselves in quickly introduced. The humor is very much in line with the games and with no prior experience, you might miss it and wonder why all the other people laugh so wholeheartedly. The CGI (especially the orcs and magical sequences) is stunning and lives up to Blizzard's good name. The cast gives solid performances, especially Ben Foster and Travis Fimmel, who knows how to carry as the main character. The romance between Garona and Lothar being so "sweet" (my best description) is the only thing that feels slightly out of place. All in all, 9/10 and a definite must watch for anyone with an interest in a story that will hopefully get many sequels, or for anyone who just wishes to feel that universe and its quirks in a new way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best video game movie ever, but that isn't saying much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that i am long time fan of warcraft, i used to play warcraft I back in first grade, and i still play WoW to this day, i read almost every book, i know almost every single story element, so it's safe to say i was very invested in the film's successSo when the final product finally came i was a bit disappointed, and i also wasn't, the film could be a lot better and i mean A LOT, but it also tried to do the best it could honestly. Warcraft's story is so dense, with so many characters that it's hard to showcase everything in it in just 2 hours, so the movie feels like a very long game of thrones episode, which is good, but it also feels like we've started off in the middle of season 3 which isn't. If you're not familiar with the universe you might get lost.The film frantically tries to introduce the myriad of characters with mixed success, sometimes we get a very organic dialogue between durotan and draka(our orc protagonists) where we get their motivations and their characters, and then sometimes we get awkwardly shoehorned in backstories from khadgar, garona and lothar( our human side protagonists) where it feels like history homework instead of actual character building. We keep jumping from place to place so fast that we don't even have time to read the town signs, because it's a huge world and apparently all corners of it have to be introduced right away, it's so obsessed with building a world that sometimes it forgets to make a movie.Characters don't always get enough breathing room due to how many of them there are and many of them suffer from it, like Ben Foster's Medivh who's painfully underused for such a major role in the story, or Lothar's son who's basically there only to get emotional scenes from Travis Fimmel.The performances are decent, but none of them are really outstanding, ironically though the orcs managed to get more emotion out of me than the humans despite being entirely CGI, they seemed to fit much more into this world than the humans, and the director and screenwriter seemed to be more interested in them as well, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, we're more familiar with humans than with orcs, because these orcs aren't like any we've seen before, they aren't the mindless evil bad guys of LotR, they're honorable and proud beings who are looking for a new home.The film does a perfect job depicting the motivations of both sides, and even the different motivations inside the sides, it's not a good vs evil film, it's much more intricate and deep than that, referring back to my Game of Thrones point, it's much more similar to that, no side is wrong and no side is right and the film balances it very well and manages to make us feel bad for losses on both sides, which is something i've never seen a fantasy film do before.I find it hard to believe though, knowing Duncan Jones, that there isn't an extended version of this where the major flaw of the film (not enough time spent developing the characters) is not "fixed" it feels like a classic case of over editing to meet a certain length cutoff, and so the movie cant really breathe.But despite all it's flaws it's fun, beautiful(probably the best use of CGI I've ever seen), uses a great mix of comedy and drama, knows when to be serious and when to be light hearted, just like the games. If you're a fan of warcraft you'll probably love it, there's tons of little details and nods to fans in the movie that will just make you squeal with joy when you see them, and if you're not a fan of warcraft you still get a decent fantasy flick, but admittedly you might get lost in the ocean of names and places the movie throws at you. I think it's worth the price of the ticket for sure, even if it is not the saviour of video game movies i hoped it would be, it's a good start.</fullReview>

For god's sake can you interpret the Harry Potter movie without reading the book? Ppl are just being unfair! This movie, is clearly targeted for fans first, diligent ppl second, ppl. who know about the fantasy element third. This movie, is not for arrogant and lazy ppl who refuse to accept anything that is even only half way out of their comfort zone! 'nough of those so-called "critic reviewers" who think they are superior and vote Batman vs Superman down, who vote "Beyond two souls" down, and who vote every single games or movies down just because they didn't do their homework, or because they are different from regular way of shooting a movie that type. We have to stand up, stand up against this trend, otherwise there will be absolutely ZERO innovation in game or movie industry, but just a repetition of same old stories with improved graphics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A faithful adaptation for Warcraft fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just before i go out to see the Warcraft movie this morning. I accidentally read the review from kotaku.com. The title is "The Warcraft movie is not good". To avoid spoilers, i quickly read the first lines. They wrote,"The fundamental flaw in Warcraft is the same flaw we find in most video game movies: It takes itself too seriously."But, from what i have seen, there is nothing"too serious" about this movie. It is a true gift for fans of the franchise. I am not sure if the reviewer and me have seen the same movie or not.The story is simple and straight forward, as it should be. If you already know the lore, you could predict 90% of the plot. Which is good, because nobody want them to change too many stuffs of a story that we have been already familiar with for years.As for the visual part, the CGI is really great. One of the best in the industry. They didn't even try to make it looks like scientifically possible or so, the magics are like what you have seen in the games, in the same styles, i mean.The Warcraft movie is by far the best vg movie. It shows what a good vg movie should be. Like what i said before, a true gift for fans. --------------------- I played a lot of the Warcraft RTS games. I really think the stories of the trilogy are the best. What they did in WOW is too much for me. I am glad that they stick with the original games. I am looking forward to see the future movies, please make more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent movie but there's a few things people need to understand regarding the lore and history of Warcraft.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading a lot of the reviews and just finished up a few reviews in the chronological order. Some of the best reviews are some of the most recent ones. The googly eyed "Oh this is the best movie ever" 9-10 stars and even some of the 8 stars are pretty much pure crap and fan boy nonsense! As well as the ones that purely hate the game and immediately voted 1-2 and most of the 3-4 star votes because most of them know nothing about the story, they'll be eating their words by movie 3.The movie was actually capturing only bits and pieces of the information and ended up rushing it all. I imagine they weren't sure if they were going to disappoint the fans by not getting all the parts in the story and they were also worried about not making the non game fans upset with too little story so they crammed it all in and it didn't work out so wellBut I'm a fan I like running through Azeroth once in awhile but I'm an old guy and I actually enjoy reading about the fiction of it all in paperback mostly. I saw a few of the reviewers saying this is how it happened in the games and another few reviewers saying this is how it happened in the books. The fact is I played Warcraft nearly since it came out back in later end of 1994 on my old Packard bell MD-DOS computer. My old computer had windows 3.1 on it and it ran at 66 megahertz and that was amazing at the time. The point I'm trying to make is both reviewers angles are correct. The lore of Warcraft evolved over time though, Blizzard simply didn't know when they first made Warcraft Orcs vs. Humans back in 1994 that it was going to become the most successful game franchise in video game history. The story lines changed and evolved into bigger story lines over time. But rest assured there is a consensus, a solid story line now, a cannon per se of how things are now officially supposed to have happened. Although if you remember the original games they didn't happen exactly how they are now but none the less I read a lot. You'll understand as you get older, but the Blizzard's stamp of approval on the official story lines is widely available on the web.us.battle.net/wow/en/game/the-story-of-warcraft/chapter1For those interested in more lore and Warcraft history check out this page as well:blizzardwatch.com/warcraft-lore-books-guide/Overall I had to rate the movie down to 5, the story was not portrayed well at all. Truthfully, they needed to focus on only one or two key point issues and keep the audience invested in those issues as the main story line. Because the story has so many points of view and perspectives as well as situations that are occurring all at the same time, I think the best thing they could have done was to have focused on the story behind Medivh and his purpose in keeping Azeroth safe. As well as the fact that he was possessed before he was born by Sargeras' essence, or life force. It would have been epic if they started the story at the final battle between Medivh's mother (Aegwynn) and the demon lord, or titan Sargeras, also hinting that Sargeras essence or life force survived and secretly possessed her womb. Then provided a lengthy explanation on who she was and what Guardians of Tirisfal were all about. Then they could have cut to Medivh's birth and explained that he was her successor. Then you would have the set up for a great story, as the audience would understand Medivh's great purpose and how he had his own huge struggle of overcoming Sargeras' possession of his mind/soul and how he eventually killed off his understudy's and eventually lost the battle to Sargeras and ended up contacting Gul'dan and providing him the means to enter Azeroth. Unfortunately, how it was done was simply sloppy and left the viewer trying to follow way too much story all at once with little to no explanation as to the purpose of what it was all about other than some strange monster like creatures were invading a previously somewhat peaceful world.The CG was expected, but I felt it was nicely done and followed the World of Warcraft online game's locale very well. I still enjoyed it knowing the lore very well helped me to overlook much of the poor scripting and plot point choices.</fullReview>

The voices, musical pieces, and CGI are all well done. There were no awkward moments in the film which is something many of us have come to expect from fantasy films,this is great because it leaves much room for jovial dialogue to appear sporadically throughout the scenes.Warcraft is colorful and a very accurate representation of the Warcraft franchise that fans and newcomers alike will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great start for a movie that will turn into a masterpiece of a series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start by saying this movie is beautiful, it is visually stunning. The first thing that struck me with this movie was how lifelike the orcs were. The details were absolutely amazing, and you forget that these are CGI, as they are just so lifelike. On top of that the movie truly shows of Azeroth in the most visually striking way. The combat, the magic, and not to mention the costumes are nothing but perfect. Now for the story and the execution of the movie. I have played the RTS games, WoW, and even read some of the lore, however it is several years ago, and I can't remember much. To me the story was a little thin, and I would have liked more backstories, to get a deeper connection with the characters. This is the only movie ever I wish was another hour long. I can understand that to some this movie is difficult to follow. But if you pay close attention, and remember faces you will never feel lost. The movie is executed very well in the time it uses, the action scenes were glorious. The movie found a good balance between battles and character interactions in order to best introduce the Warcraft world to the viewer. I believe the movies needs more work in the future, but now after the first movie, it will be much easier tweaking the next to become the perfect game to movie adaptation. The reason for the vote 10 is because the movie left me wanting more, and truly entertained me. It is packed with action, drama, comedy and of course the greatly appreciated fan service.I want more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget what the critics say about this movie, it's a well-made, fun and entertaining movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no fan of the Warcraft video games or the lore (Didn't even know the movie is based on those the first I went to see it), but I've seen it 3 times now, partly maybe I'm a fan of fantasy movies, but most definitely the movie is fun, entertaining and easily transported me to that Azeroth universe.The last time I watched a movie 3 times in cinemas was The Guardians of the Galaxy, which is also a sprawling, high fantasy movie, albeit a space opera one.There's surely flaws with Warcraft, but when the movie has that magical quality of making you instantly feel you are right in that universe, all those flaws fade away. All the characters in the movie are likable, and they are very nuanced, not one character is black or white. The humour are sprinkled here and there delicately. And the magic! They depict the magic in such grand, and majestic way. I think what almost everyone say about the pacing is probably correct, It seems 2 hours was not enough to tell the background stories of many of the important characters (I wanted more stories of Khadgar, Medivh and Garona), and for a non-fan it can be confusing to tell apart one Orc from another, although on my second viewing, they become all clear.2 hours flew by (and that's a sign that a movie is very enjoyable) and I actually wanted more. I felt it should have been longer, which is very rare to say these days. One thing for sure: I will definitely watch the sequels and I am hoping Legendary and Blizzard give free reign to Duncan Jones in making the sequels the way New Line Cinema and Warner Bros gave free reign to Peter Jackson when making LOTR. Legendary should also stay away from editing the future sequels! Let Duncan Jones work his magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hate is ridiculous. It is not near as bad as they claim.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may not be the best fantasy film out there and won't topple Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit, but it is absurdly hated by the press just as much as they absurdly fawned over Peter Jackson's dredge.Sure, the plot is muddled and there is a lot of information conveyed that flies past most of the audience, but it is still a decent movie skillfully crafted. It won't win any awards but does not deserve the hate.The dislike about this movie is irrational and coming from a very bad place.It may not make your end of the year "best of" list, but go see it if you like fantasy and/or Warcraft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was better than most of us expected it . few days ago we had a huge argument with a friend over X-men : Apocalypse . i hated that movie and he loved it . But to realize how slow , boring and bad Apocalypse was you should watch this movie . incredible CGI , good acting , unexpected ending , touching moments and awesome fights . Travis fimmel was outstanding however he lacked originality , he had the same character exactly as ragner in vikings . also the plot lacked originality when used Star wars reference for the fight between light and dark forces , though it can be due to the plot of the game which i haven't played.One thing that caught my eyes , was the way it looked like avatar with awesome screenplay and CGI . Warcraft has everything that made Avatar famous and if you ask me its even better .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than 'Hobbit' and 'Avatar'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great movie for anyone open to the fantasy genre. Expect to see the best visual effects of all-time on any medium. Full CGI, and yet a streamlined and awesome experience throughout.Furthermore, the music score is incredible. Make sure to see it in cinemas with proper audio setups (had a specific Dolby cinema room at my viewing). The action and fighting scenes are horrifyingly awesome, add-in that no character is 'safe' (which is typically a flaw for 'hero-type' movies). Warcraft the Beginning transcends most fantasy films in almost every way. While the whole movie was great, it gets overshadowed by a bad last twenty minutes. This part seemed incoherent, poorly edited and had an awkward 'surround'/talkative scene.Other rightly bad remarks: There is only one obvious bad guy. The theme and 'message of the film' is all over the place: "light from darkness, darkness from light"? "Zero hope gives great courage"? Add in some dragged scenes where the point was already made, whereas some scenes ended too quickly. Perhaps it was difficult to change scenes as it is CG heavy, and too costly and time-intensive. Finally, this gets enlightened by bad dialogue with typical fantasy lines &amp; clichés - get creative you lazy Hollywood fantasy screenwriters!Despite all the above, this is fantastic, awesome, fast-paced, epic cinematic experience. Definitely for fans, and for anyone open to fantasy.9/10In response to the critics: If it was released during the 'Christmas Period' perhaps they would be more open to fantasy films. Clearly this is better than 'The Hobbit' or 'Avatar', but of course not 'Lord of the Rings'. So, knowing it is not a all-star movie, what do critics do? They ridicule it to make a story and get a lot of views.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Experience Do Not Listen to Critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the trailers and posters I wasn't expecting the movie to be so good. It was visual and musical experience. If you are interested in fantasy at all, this will be one of the best movies you experience. I really liked it wasn't focusing on one character but giving glimpses on many stories and even though it was a bit too much for the small time the movie had, it made me feel the rich universe of the movie. This movie is not about one hero this movie is about every single character you come across while watching, and their world. Thanks to the characters, the hard work of the animation team and the powerful music, I didn't watch a movie today, I experienced it. As I write right now, I am still smiling and feeling the buzz of the movie.I found it extremely sad that there are many critics that has complained about the movie when it is obvious some of them are not even interested in fantasy genre. I would recommend you to give it a shot, if you are a little bit interested in the fantasy genre you will love the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did wonder if anyone other than a player could appreciate this film or fathom out what on earth was going on... while this was partly true, it was a superb piece of entertainment, with fantastic visuals, stunning effects and some great characters - World of Warcraft regardless! Obviously, every player should see this film and it's sucking me back into the game again after a long break. For non- players, it's worth seeing for the visuals alone - has to be the best fantasy setting I've ever seen rendered on screen. The Orcs are stunningly realised and there are thousands of them - each with unique features and details. I only hope this franchise has legs - if this is the level of quality they can achieve then there is a massive potential for more and better. Good luck to them - I'll be back for more :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It feels almost obligatory to give a disclaimer before starting this review: I have never ever had remotely anything to do with the Warcraft lore and games, I had literally no idea what the story would be. Yet, I am a very, very big fan of fantasy and Duncan Jones, and that is why I was excited to see this film, despite the negative backlash it had in its first week of reviews and let me tell you that I've rarely seen such unmotivated negativity. Despite not living up to its potential Jones and Legendary Pictures have put out a very worthy fantasy film that actually was very close to being great...up until its last ten minutes.Giving any kind of vote to this film based on its first watch is really hard and I reserve my right to change it in the future, that is because I am still conflicted in how much I liked it, which is indicative of the chaos it induces with that ending.For a solid hour and forty five minutes Duncan Jones crafts a really strong fantasy picture. The only problems it bears for that duration are minor world building problems, they don't stop the story from flowing but sporadically the film is a little too ahead of itself and gives the viewer some confusion on how the world is organized, the opening scene should have been cut full-stop, it makes no sense at all, and it also happens to be slightly mechanical, in the sense that the flow of the scenes happens to be a little repetitive after sometime: emotional scene, character development scene, action scene, repeat. It isn't really that bothering, but it was something that did occasionally take me out of the film.Yet for the rest we are presented to an interesting world with characters we feel for on both sides. The pace is very tight and I was never bored for half a second, everything that was going on I wanted to see more of. There are some moments that really sting emotionally and some others that are story turns you don't expect and with which the filmmakers have the balls to stick to which makes them even more resonant. The actors involved I did not have much faith in, but they all managed to surprise me, in particular Travis Fimmel who is channeling his inner Aragorn and excelling at it. The social dynamics explored might be a little underdeveloped, but the when you are presented with such a rich vision to sink your teeth into it doesn't really matter, the world-building overall was enchanting, I was transported to this world and that is something that is really rare in filmaking.Moreover, the effects here are game changing. The 20 months spent in post production pay off from the first frame. Starting off the success of the effects is the fact that the CGI is used correctly as a tool and not a gimmick and integrated seamlessly in what is one of the best looking and designed movies in recent years. Then on top of that you add state-of-the-art looking imagery, you are left with a film that dazzles visually without ever taking you out of it. No matter how the film will be received critically, there is no question these effects will change the game for films, but more importantly they are an example of how to use computer imagery correctly.A killer score and breath-taking, goose-bump-inducing action sequences with storytelling momentum add to the list of great stuff I was enjoying from this film. Until the last ten minutes came and I realized I wasn't going to get a pay off. Look I am fine if you want to do a trilogy of films, "Fellowship of the Ring" is the best film ever made (alongside its two successors) and it doesn't have an ending to the plot, but it has an ending to the story, you get emotional pay off from the characters, you get closure for the time being. Here you are promised for the first two and a half acts of tight pacing a kind of resolution but it never comes, this film is lacking a finale, there is zero payoff, none of dynamics at play are resolved. It leaves you empty, I was catching my breath in the climax and then it was all rushed to the end. It could have done with 10-15 more minutes to give us something to grasp on.Despite one of the most frustrating endings I have ever experienced, which I don't know if fault lies in the studio or the director, I was thrilled and fascinated for the major part, I still look forward to possible future films if they don't repeat this one's mistakes and I still recommend this adventure ride. As I said my grade is really unindicative at the moment as the balance between good and bad elements I still can't really figure out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could become "this decade's Lord of the Rings"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first: I watched the movie in German, I enjoyed the movie a lot, and I haven't played Warcraft. Before watching the movie, my knowledge of the franchise was very basic and essentially just the premise of the movie: The world of the Orcs is dying. They open a portal to the world of Humans, Azeroth, and try to conquer it for themselves. I'm not going further into story details.The movie plays a bit inside baseball. And the pacing is a fast. If I had to choose, I prefer it to be fast rather than slow, but it could have been a tiny bit slower to drink everything in. It tries to explain a lot of things, so it is a bit "Information Overload" as well. You are also thrown in to new settings and are meant to just accept them. The first few location changes I was constantly thinking "wait, stop, let me look at it, don't jump to another place, I need some time to understand where we are". But after a while, you just accept that Azeroth is a vast, diverse and big place. I loved the characters of Dorutan, Draka, Orgrim, Guldan, Medivh, Garona and Lothar. Khadgar grew on me, mainly because I wasn't too fond of the cast actor, but he did a fine job. Regarding casting, I had some issues there: I had a hard time believing the Queen and Lothar are actual siblings. I'm all for diverse casting, but at least give siblings the make ethnicity, okay? Also Lothar must have been 10 when he became a father. Other than that, the cast was okay with me.The names of the characters themselves are a mouthful, and I'm not sure I wrote them correctly. My most favorite character arcs are the ones from Dorutan &amp; Draka, Medivh and surprisingly Khadgar.The conflict between Orcs and Humans, and Orcs and Orcs is explained well, as is the introduction of the orc race itself. In actuality, the movie tries to give humans and orcs the same amount of screen time and importance and gravitas, but I think everyone will root for the orcs (well, Durotan to be precise). They are just so well made and far more interesting than mere humans.It takes itself very serious, with a few jokes here and there. The jokes don't feel out of place, so no cheese-fests like other Video Game adaptations. I actually liked that a lot, just simply because the setting *hint hint* is an actual war. The visuals are good, but the CGI regarding the background is obvious. I hope on the small screen the CGI won't be as obvious. The Orcs look great, though. Dwarfs are hilarious and I wish we had seen more of them. Elves looked weird, as if they had a cartoon-y glow around them, but they only appear for like 2 scenes. With more screen time I probably would get around it. Battle scenes are rough and brutal, something you would expect in an actual war, so don't expect choreographed battles like in most comic book adaptations. A big plus is the active use of spectacular magic in battles. Which is extremely stunning: Look forward to Medhiv, he will become one of your favorites. Comparing it to the other big two high fantasy franchises, magic is basically only hinted at and at most very downplayed in the Middle Earth films, and kind of non-existent in Game of Thrones. I would say Warcraft falls right in between both of those high fantasy franchises. Where 'Lord of the Rings' is a high fantasy story with downplayed magic and a 'let's save the world' 'good-vs- evil' style story, and 'Game of Thrones' is downplaying fantasy in general with no clear 'good or evil' characters in which anything can happen, Warcraft has definitely no set 'good vs bad' theme and anything can happen and it embraces fantasy and magic. The movie is an obvious setup for a franchise, and after watching "the beginning" I want to see the sequel. The world is set up and now that everything is introduced, Warcraft has the chance to create really good and sophisticated stories.If you are a fan of the high fantasy genre, you should definitely check it out. I enjoyed it a lot. I loved the character development of the main cast and the orcs in general. Neither me and my friends played Warcraft and we went in for this decade's new "Lord of the Rings" and none of us were disappointed. I personally ranked it 8/10. Main issues were pacing and inside baseball. I watched it in German. Orcs were speaking in a very bass heavy tone. Might be difficult to understand. The German dub is very well done. Of course as it always is with dubs, characters/actors loose their accents, which might or might not be a good thing. I can't comment on international voices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie - not just for fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start saying this is not your typical review. Whenever I read reviews, I look for semi-objective pros and cons to the film and not eloquently written opinions, so if you are like me, read on! Otherwise, I recommend you turn back. The way I write is also pretty boring, so there's that.I saw this movie with my girlfriend in Germany (in English, though) last night. I should probably state that I have long been a fan of the Warcraft games, and as such familiar with the general story-line, but I'm not enough of a fan to have read any of the books or comics. My girlfriend, on the other hand, knew absolutely nothing about the story, apart from a rough idea which races exist in the Warcraft universe because she had seen me play. With that being said, both of us absolutely loved the movie! It was one of those movies I didn't want to end, and it was exiting throughout. After it was over, I was left craving for more and I simply can't get the story out of my head now. It's been a long time since I've felt so invested in a movie. The feeling this film left me with is almost more impressive than the movie itself. To give you a more helpful review than just some empty statements though, let me list the pros and cons of the movie from both my and my girlfriend's point of view, so maybe you can make up your own mind whether Warcraft is for you or not:Pros:- The CGI was fantastic. 10 minutes into the movie we felt fully immersed and forgot how much of the movie was CGI.- Most of the characters seemed genuine, had clear motives and did not feel cookie-cutter at all. - The music felt pretty epic.- We obviously really liked the story. - The fact that it did not shy away from being "dark" and at some points depressing made it feel more believable. My girlfriend was close to crying at least two times. - There was some humor, but the movie still felt serious (not as silly as a Marvel movie, more like DC)- While there was some romance that my girlfriend felt added something the movie, it definitely did not feel forced (looking at you Hobbit) and was very much a side-note. More sexual tension than romance really. Cons:- The first half of the movie was quite fast-paced. It jumped from one scene to another rather abruptly. Surprisingly, this seemed to bug me more than my girlfriend. The second half made up for it though.- Some characters could have used some more introduction or characters development. The movie could easily have been an hour longer. Still, the main characters felt fleshed-out.- My girlfriend noted that she felt very unsatisfied with how the story ended. So for people who want to see a story with a happy ending or if you hate cliffhangers, this is NOT for you. - This again seemed to bug me more, but since SO much of the movie was CGI, it felt, for lack of a better word, "damp" at times (I got a similar feeling watching Avatar and 300, for reference).- I felt the armor the humans wear is a bit ridiculous. Yeah, it's like that in the games, but it could've been toned down a little. Neutral:- 3D seemed good, I'm not a 3D fan in general though. - Some nice bonuses for Warcraft fans if you pay attention, but since this does not affect newcomers I won't add this to pros.- The original story was changed a little, but not in ways that would offend fans.- Being a Warcraft fan, I know how much more the story has to offer. I REALLY want this movie to succeed so one day they will make a sequel or spin-offs. So is this movie worth your time? Yes, if the following is true for you:- You don't go in expecting it to be bad. Lots of "professional" reviewers from the US are giving this movie lots of hate I honestly feel is not justified. I could understand a 6/10 for the cons stated above, but some of them are ripping this movie apart so much that it feels like they were going to do it no matter how the movie was. I'm usually a pretty harsh critic myself, but this I just don't understand.- You don't expect a happy movie and ending.- You don't give up on the movie after the first few minutes. - You actually enjoy a darker movie with a few lighthearted moments.- You don't mind the film having A LOT of CGI.- You generally enjoy fantasy movies.Summed up, I would place this movie far above the Hobbit, and probably SLIGHTLY below Lord of the Rings. While LotR had better character development and pacing, I highly prefer Warcraft's general story and feel. Overall, a 9 from me and an 8 from my girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film although it's not lotr but i wish they had the feeling of elevating into a new realm as lotr did, but it's okay since this movie covers the basic story, i hope we see a sequel,the story gets more into the lore as it proceed. The lotr used to take us to that place where we live the moment in middle earth the music the story the feeling, i hope they make the same essence because feelings are universal, any how i consider this film a substitute to the hobbit that failed a bit comparing to lotr but this film brings a promise that the journey begins not ends. My last comment is that warcraft really reflects many things happening in the real world, you could easily compare orcs to Muslims and demon orcs the ISIS who fell under the magic of gull'Dan and the good orcs tries to make amends, i know it seems silly to thinks that way but I'm being honest and that's what i felt and that's why i loved the movie more yet so many things other than the example i gave reflects real things happening in our time. Anyhow this movie sure could use a bit a good setting some things straight specially if're a warcraft fan such is myself, this had became my new lotr series, good job for Jones and the cast</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unwarranted Criticism of a Cinematic Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the build-up to the release of Warcraft, there have been a few embargo-dodging reviews popping up on the internet. All of them have been overly critical of the film simply because it's based on a video game. Duncan Jones has mastered the source material and succinctly transferred it to the silver screen. In order to cover all the back story and lore contained in the Warcraft Universe would take over 4 hours of screen time, however, Jones picks the most crucial elements of the plot from 1994's 'Warcraft: Orcs and Humans'. The most striking thing about the film is the meticulous attention to detail that Jones shows. It enables him to provide very sly moments of fan-service without detracting too much from the narrative. If you've played World of Warcraft, you'll be sure to catch a glimpse of something you recognise from your in-game adventures; but equally, Jones makes sure the story isn't too contrived so as to keep the general public engaged in the story. Aside from the lore detail, the CGI is simply breathtaking. This is the first noteworthy film where the magic looks and feels believable. Not only that but the specifics of the CGI Orcs made them even more eye-catching than the faithful recreations of Azeroth's fabled landscape. The one criticism of the film I can muster is that the dialogue at times seemed a bit forced. Understandable for a project of this size and scale, it seems the interactions between characters focused more on reminding you of everyone's name at times rather than focusing the plot. It doesn't detract too much from the film, however it is noticeable. Overall, the critics will say the film is a dud simply because of the origin of the source material. But as the early indicators from the international box office have shown, there is a demand for more from Jones' Azeroth. And with both the U.S. and China being massively underestimated - the film could yet prove the naysayers wrong. It certainly is on it's way to doing so. A diamond in the rough, but it could yet turn out to be a 'Millennium Star'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this today (31/05/2016) after only finding out about it a mere 3 weeks ago I am so pleased that i didn't eagerly await it like a lot of fans. I was introduced to World of Warcraft by Southpark! After a friend of mine begged me for weeks to play the game i wish i had listened to him but no, i listened to Cartman instead.Loved playing the game especially the stories in the game without speeding along to complete quests after quests etc. So its been a while since i played (I'm 50 years old now, its tough finding time).It was a pleasure to sit back and visit places of Azeroth I'd not seen in over 3 years, I have been forgetful about character names and early lore but no matter, the visual effects and CGI were as outstanding as i found the quality in the game play when i began to play it.I was enjoying the views of Stormwind and Ironforge etc and its only a matter of days before i crank up the engine, update and do some add ons and begin playing it again. It's got to be done, I hope it inspires new players and i've missed the place so much it was like watching a holiday show, its sold the trip!The acting was good, believable characters for those unaware of the game/story. Quality footage, it had it all, i understood the concept of the film but i'd have welcomed more scenes with other heroes e.g elves for example. I'm ever hopeful that's to come in the future. N.B I did wonder why 2 dear ladies much older than me 15 ish years older? Sat beside me, i actually looked for the grandchild but there was none. They thoroughly enjoyed it too! I remained seated as they passed by and i told them i was stopping until the end and one said "its not a marvel!" I just laughed and said i was going home to play it after. I can only see myself in the cinema at their age enjoying all this fantasy stuff, it gave me great hope for the future of fantasy films. I gave it 8/10 as i wondered if non players would struggle to follow it. In hindsight, i'm probably wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Warcraft fan ever since I was about 14 years old and old habits die hard to the game until now. Ever since I heard about Warcraft that it would be made into a movie, I was very excited to see it.When I heard that it would be delayed for a couple of years, it made me sad. So I have to wait and wait until such time that I am very excited from the announcement of Blizzard that they finalized the release date.And then when I saw the movie, I was amazed that the release date delays were paid off. I like the visual effects that they delivered from the characters down to the places that I could recall the places that they mentioned from the game. Glad that I can relate to the story from the game itself, which is by far hints the story plots from the game. Still I'm pretty stoked on the visual effects and I could not get enough of it.It did surpassed my expectations and I am not disappointed at all. And as a gamer, I would rather see this movie all over again. Kudos to Blizzard and Universal Pictures YOU'RE THE BEST!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a player of the game, I've been waiting a long time for this movie! It had a massive task of bringing people who now nothing about it into a vast world - and also keeping people like me happy! I can say with pride... what an epic film! Good to see Ragnar (Vikings) at the helm of this new film series! I cannot wait for the next! I feel as though they now have a platform to build on and bring out more and more from the Warcraft universe which would have made this initial film a little too much to start with. Good luck to all the cast and I really hope people take to this series well. I would love to see this movie get all the appreciation it deserves, after all, it has been a long time coming. The people at Blizzard entertainment really have built the most amazing world for players to explore in the World of Warcraft game, and I've no doubt they can bring the best of that universe to the masses through these films... Hopefully people will finally start to understand why people can easily get lost and enthralled in such an extensive and epic world... of warcraft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was shown here in the Philippines on May 25 and I must say that this movie is really amazing. I like what Duncan Jones and Blizzard did and I hope that there will be more sequels to this movie. Hoping that more Warcraft characters will be added in the future. The Computer Graphic effects are amazing. I should say that they CG has almost the same quality with Avatar. All actors are good. One downside of this movie would be for the audience who doesn't have any idea about the Warcraft Lore. It would be hard for them to understand as the movie has a very fast pacing of story.

		<shortDescription>One of the most fun fantasy films I've seen in quite some time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to first say that I've only been slightly familiar with the setting, as in I've only seen what ''Warcraft'' is about, i.e, sorcery, massive orcs, dragons, hell you name it, the highest of high fantasy. Never actually been a part of it as a franchise, but was indeed interested in it due to the ''lull'' in this type of genre recently. And boy, was it surprising to me how much I enjoyed this film, from the incredible visual spectacle that it delivers on, to the tones of family and loyalty, it truly was a 2 hour and 4 minute ride that I would gladly be part of again. The film's tone is completely off the hook in terms of realism, if you are going into this film looking for grounded fantasy in the vein of Game of Thrones, you are going to be disappointed, this is a world in which magic is the centerpiece and the world colliding conflict is brought upon by an alien race of Orcs. If you are looking to get immersed in this over the top and unapologetic world, with a few solid and sometimes tragic characters you will have a good time.Some of the cons that the film had from my point of view, fall mainly in the hands of a pacing, due to the grand number of characters is introducing, though not entirely surprising, but unfortunate, the film could use at least another 20 minutes at the start to slowly introduce some of the secondary characters, specially those associated with Orc lead Durotan and Human lead Lothar, which by the end of the film the conflict in which they have both taken part of will leave you asking for more. And I truly think this film deserves a more. With the time it had, it did manage to scratch my interest in high fantasy, something that not even ''The Hobbit'' films could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good, lots of potential but wastes too much to be amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having lots of experience with warcraft previously makes me obviously biased but i'll be as unbiased as possible. The movie is fun too watch and rarely skips a beat and that's really its downfall in my opinion. Even if i know the overarching lore from before i would want to see many parts of it explained and visualized in the movie as many things comes of as pretty unmotivated.There are definitely character development there but it gets rushed too fast not letting it sink in before the next plot device already begins. Some subplots also feels unnecessary and kinda detracts from the movie by making it a bit too cliché even though most of it is refreshing and kinda daring for a Hollywood production.The visuals are great but i lack brutality while they are pushing the pg13 limit to its absolute max i would have preferred heads rolling over discrete sword through stomach deaths.Final verdict is an above average film with great visuals and effects but not only relying on it as characters are fleshed out and and mostly not one dimensional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - good introduction to Warcraft newcomers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never played Warcraft, but I may well after this movie! It never quite succeeds in being a fresh submission to the fantasy genre, adding nothing we haven't seen before, but as a video game adaptation it worked surprisingly well!Firstly, it's clear Duncan Jones wanted to make an unbiased story (rather than making the humans the good guys, as standard). They achieved it pretty well too - in fact the most sympathetic character in the whole movie was the main orc Durotan (Toby Kebbell), whose honesty and integrity was superior to the humans, and one of his later scenes provided one of the few truly emotional moments of the film. The other significant character was the incredibly terrifying villain Gel'dan, whose magic power was very well animated, despite being slightly vague and unexplained.The other animation, however, wasn't quite so impressive. The orcs and animals look pretty decent but when they move, it doesn't quite work (especially the mouths). The action is mostly well enacted, though the masses of CGI sometimes pushed it to the edge of believability. The magic effects were outstanding though, some of the coolest visuals I've seen in a long time! The sound management was more impressive, from the crunching fight sequences to Djawadi's immersive score.It's clear the creators are Warcraft fans. They know and love the world they've generated, which means despite the great attention to detail, some elements of the narrative are left slightly under-explained for newcomers like me. The other issue is that the story was disappointingly inconclusive, as if they tried to set up a series rather than making a solid movie. That said, it was certainly enjoyable and a must watch for Warcraft fans!4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My look and review of the movie.. non spoiler as much as I can.. 1st of all.. I loved the movie.. I knew I Would even before entering the cinema.. I am a big fan and that's not surprise.. 2nd and more important.. I took my wife, brother, aunt and cousin with me to the cinema. They r not fans and know nothing about Warcraft universe(apart only what I showed them as trailers.. TV spots etc..) They LOVED the movie as well! Wanna see it again and questioned me after movie what will happen later.. after movie finished. That is very important and encouraging. That means that the general audience will like the movie too. Not only the fans. Now about THE movie. :)For me movie starts a bit rushed.. a lot stuff is happening and you r trying to comprehend all this information. They are jumping from orcs.. to humans very often trying to kick off the story. It's a bit confusing at start.. but OK.. there is lot of characters and they must introduce them all.. I get that.. to much to tell.. to little time.. Now after 20-30 minutes in the movie things get somewhat fluid and easier to follow.. you have Durotan and Orgrim+ Draka.. Guldan and Blackhand.. Lothar, Kadghar, Medivh, King Llane and Garona.Things starts to happen and take you right in. In one point of the movie.. you are hooked and will start enjoying the movie at fullest. If you had any worries before that it will be over.Like new Mad Max movie, this one is game- changing. Fast.. action packed.. sad.. funny.. dramatic.. brutal.. all round package. Cant compare this to Lotr in any cases. Its totally different. In a good new way. Its future of fantasy genre. Movie is 2h long and that's a bit short.. 20-30 min more would be perfect, but its not a big problem.If you think you know what will happen.. you don't... there is one thing that happen that will take you off guard. Main characters in the movie are Lothar, Garona, Durotan and Kadhgar. Than comes Medivh, Guldan and King Llane. Orgrim and Blackhand are good but doesn't have that much screen time. There is also Lothar's son Callan.. Queen Taria and Draka, they did a great job too. There is no CGI orcs in the movie.. I think they hired real orcs.. it's that good guys! Graphics are amazing.. truly cutting edge.. 11/10 hands down. Music is good.. fits the universe great.. but I must watch movie one more time.. was to busy with another stuff :)Movie is just a beginning.. story is set and movie does great achieving that. Ending clearly hints sequel.. and I must say.. I loved the ending.Final words:I enjoyed it fully. Great great movie. Cant wait for extended version on Blu Ray. (I hope Duncan and studio will make it) Cant wait for sequels. Give the movie a chance.. go watch it without prejudice and don't believe the critics.. take your friends and family with you.. they will have great time too!My score: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dare to say that Blizzard broke the "Video-Game-Movie Curse". The movie was astonishing great, one does not need to be aware of the game or the lore of the game at all, you would just enjoy it as much as the gamer that waited for the movie for so, so long!The movie was full of action and philosophy, for many scenes were criticising our actually society and the way humanity lives.Warcraft: The Beginning was easy to understand and hard to not enjoy, as the movie had a great development and storytelling, and I did not felt any dropping of excitement while watching.The character development was the only thing that prevent the movie from a 10/10, as it was perfectly fine, but could have been better. Character from a different world are moving to Azeroth and are not seen to handle with any culture-shock, or intense interest in the new world. It did not felt like the movie was rushing or sluggish ANY bit, but there could have been a little more of this kind of content. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you like the Sword and Sorcery setting</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most critics say's that this movie sucks. But it surely doesn't. I saw it today 27 May here in Sweden. It was great! If you like Warcraft you will definitely like this movie as well. Some scenes weren't that great. Like the acting sometimes and some talking scenes. But that's about it. The story was great, even tho i already knew the most of it. So if you're not into wow you might get a little lost, but i'm pretty sure you will enjoy it anyway. Great effects, great CGI especially the orcs! They surely look awesome. Don't listen to the "critics" go and watch it! It's not even close to being "very bad". I'am definitely looking forward to a sequel, or maybe a trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the mass media, this is actually pretty damn good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came here to rate this movie simply because I want to go against the mass media hype of "this movie didn't live up to the standards it should have."I am a Warcraft player since I was 14. I took my fiancé to see the movie with me. She has never even heard of the game franchise, let alone the movie.We both loved it. Of course, I loved it more. But that's natural.I felt everything was in place. the CGI effects were used awesomely. The costumes were perfect, right down to the minute details. The acting wasn't crazy special, but it was good enough for the movie.The only thing that could have used a bit more work were the fight scenes. I'm not saying they're bad. They were great. But I felt a "fight of the film" was missing.Still, I thoroughly enjoyed every single minute of this film. Further, it is a great start to what I hope to be a distinct movie chain.So a word of warning, do not follow the comments of mass media. It is my own (personal) perception that most of these movie critics do not know what Warcraft is about. Furthermore, they try to compare it to Lord of the Rings. There are literally about three to four reviews comparing it to the Lord of the Rings movies. I don't get this, sure it's the same genre, but I find it insane that Lord of the Rings is the benchmark. It's a whole different playing field.Then there are reviews saying it was too "serious." It was based on the damn story line. Of course it was serious, that's kind of the point.Anyway, long story short, go watch this movie, and bring whoever you want (Warcraft fan or not). They will enjoy it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I learnt a lesson today: For a video game based movie don't ever trust reviews of critics who have never played the game which causes them to write bluffing reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft is a legacy and those who have played the games made by blizzard would understand.I was very excited to watch the film since the trailer released and was waiting for June 10 .Got demoralized after reading the reviews of a group of crictics ( who apparently seem jealous of this game's fans) and thought it would turn out to be a shitty film. Since I had already booked tickets for a dozen of kids and family members and neighbours I had to go to watch it with them. I though if the film turn out crap i would apologize to my family and neighbours for wasting their time. But guess what this turn out to be epic for a warcraft fan , lovable for the kids and amazing animations for my family and neighbours.All seemed so happy after they came out of the screen .Kids are waiting for the sequel after watching the ending scene.Story has been kept on the lines of warcraft 1 game and i admit that non fan viewers will find it a bit difficult to digest the names and utility of the characters .But if they do not wish to indulge deep into the characters but watch it like a war building movie theyll love it. for eg my 70 year old grandpa.So today I learnt that a normal movie critic who has no idea of the video game will bluff while reviewing the movie made. blizzard game fans are very huge and they will not be bogged down by such bluffs. The results can be seen in China 90 million in first 2 days , the place to find true Mmorpg fans. Till then m waiting for the sequel#moreWarcraft</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only movie that made me truly forget the time in the theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Warcraft for the first time on IMAX 3D and I truly enjoyed it. Actually, I'm planning to see it again while I can still see it on IMAX.I am familiar with the Warcraft games including Warcraft 3 and World of Warcraft, so I knew most of the characters, the world and the core of the story, the reason I went to the cinema to see it is to get immersed in the world that I like adventuring and witness the events that I have been playing/reading about for years now.I will not say Warcraft is a perfect movie or it is the best it could have been (which is why it gets an 8 from me), however it is a movie that is immersive, fast-moving, full of action; that has a soul, beautiful soundtrack, beautiful scenery and many things that will make you smile if you are a Warcraft/WoW player.I have watched dozens if not hundreds of movies in the cinema and I can honestly say that Warcraft is the only movie that made me forget the time. Like how playing WoW usually does, hehe.I was in a large/crowded room (IMAX) and I was worried that popcorn eaters and smartphone checkers would annoy me. Except for one instance which did not repeat, I was hooked by the movie from start to end and watched it without remembering any distraction from my surroundings. I believe most viewers watched it fully focused like me. When the first half ended, I didn't believe that 1 hour had already passed. The second half passed quicker because when it ended, I was thinking to myself "this never happened to me before with any other movie" even though some of which I enjoyed more such as Lord of the Rings, Avatar or Interstellar. After the movie ended, I stayed till the credits finished rolling because it was the first time I was listening to WoW theme in an IMAX theater, which took about 5 minutes. About 1/5th of the room (30- 40) also stayed till the credits ended and I was hearing mostly nice feedback from the audience.To me, Warcraft movie, also as its name implies, is the beginning of a long story and it felt more like a short and fully packed prelude that tries to show a lot of things within a short time. It succeeds in a sense but at some scenes I felt the transitions were very quick and some other scenes could have used more build-up. Some characters could have had more screen time and also a bit more emotional backgrounds would have amplified the tone of the story. I would think that if it was about 150-160 minutes, it might have been better. That's my opinion for sure. Either way, I think it was a great intro and I am definitely looking forward to seeing many more in the series. After LoTR and Hobbit, hopefully this will be my third favorite fantasy movie series.If you are not familiar with Warcraft universe, or never played any Warcraft games, Warcraft movie is a beautiful and enjoyable fantasy movie that I can highly recommend. If you are a Warcraft, or especially a WoW player, Warcraft movie is a movie you shouldn't miss. I'm not sure if the 3D aspect added much to the movie but if you have the option, definitely see it on IMAX.For the Alliance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thinking outside the bubble!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think most reviews hold a lot of prejudice against the video game industry and people need to stop expecting another Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. Duncan Jones makes a new approach into the fantasy universe and doesn't have fear to use color and action. All the action scenes make sense and fit well into the universe, working with the story. The story is just like the game, and if someone go to the movie expecting something different than Warcraft, obviously will be displeased. It is a movie about WAR, MAGIC AND ORCS! It meets all that was stated from the beginning. When you go to see Warcraft, you can't expect a new Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. Neither a new Marvel movie or DC. Warcraft is another kind of history, and Duncan Jones insists in this. He brings another aesthetic and another kind of history pace. And let's face it, today we are living a boom of superheroes (and "geek") movies, just like there was a Western boom years ago, for example. Movies that try to go against the river are ignored or vilified. And most movies are classified into two types: intelligent movies or blockbusters. The ones which will try an Oscar and the ones which make a good money. Warcraft, being born from a game, is the focus of much prejudice. "Who dares to try to make a movie about a video game?!" For most critics video games are childish, but for our luck, game designers think different and are ahead, making games like Heavy Rain and The Last of Us. The Game Industry already uses cinematography strategies to achieve an unique experience. And it is stupidity that the Movie Industry keeps ignoring this new universe of media, and lives inside of a bubble of constructed rules. But hey! Let's think outside the bubble!</fullReview>

It follows the source material faithfully and honestly it's a good film because of it, it gave us as fans of the series of the game a film that was just as good as the game we have played for years, not to mention the CG work that went into this film is just amazing, a visual masterpiece and the writing is so well done giving you an incite into certain characters that we never really knew much about. A must watch. I must say that this is one of the best films this year. A must watch for the fans of all of the Warcraft games, and for those film lovers out there. Great for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a film lover. I have also played a considerable amount of Warcraft in the past. This is to say I wasn't sure if I could write an honest review of the film, not because I feel biased towards the Warcraft universe, but simply because I might subconsciously understand a lot more of what is going when compared to someone who hasn't been in contact with the games.With that said, Warcraft is a good film.Starting with the good: Characterisation. A lot of fantasy films fail because we can't relate to the characters. Warcraft pulls it off. You immediately sympathize with the characters in both factions.Balance. You don't really get to pick a side here, there is no such thing as "these are the good guys, those are the bad guys". Both sides bring strong characters to the table, characters you can relate to. The Alliance is lead by men who put the well of their people first. The Horde is lead by a villain, but the Orcs show they value honor the most, and it becomes clear throughout the film that change is coming to the Horde.The art and cgi. It's loyal to the games and fans. Anyone that has played the games will find plenty to relate to here. From full blown environments and scenery, the cities, the spell effects, the Orcs, the human armor, the weaponry, the little details here and there... It's clear this was made out of the love and respect for the franchise.The excellent: Durotan. What a character, you completely forget about the CGI here. A 5* star performance from Toby Kebbell and the art team.The bad:It's fast paced. Maybe it's hard to get around this, there is only so much you are allowed to fit in. I guess that if you're a fan, it's easier to follow and you already "know" a lot of what is going on... I can imagine this will be a bit harder for the rest of the audience. It might just feel a bit too much at times.Travis Fimmel. Don't get me wrong, I think he is a great actor - I just have a problem understanding him at times! I've been a fan of him since Vikings, but the man needs to step up his voice, speech lessons, whatever. It's hard to understand the man.All in all, Warcraft pulls it off extremely well. I do hope it performs well enough so we can see future sequels, fans know the best is yet to come: There are amazing stories and characters the "rest" of the world needs to see.</fullReview>

The story is great, should be very appealing to fans and non fans of Warcraft universe. I went with my girlfriend and she is not aware of Warcraft and she absolutely loved it. Many funny moments as well, great acting and epic soundtrack. For me it was just as epic as Lotr.Great premise for a trilogy or even more.P.s.

		<fullReview>Honestly I really enjoyed watching the movie Warcraft. I was surprised when others have said the movie was horrible with bad CGI. I really don't care the opinions of the other movie critics. As a Warcraft fan, I am quite satisfied with this movie. Although I really loved the plot of the story, I am quite disappointed on how they implement it. I noticed the scene were quite disorganized. It isn't like the LOTR or Hobbit, where the scenes are more organized and the pace was consistent. However, the graphics such as the magic power, the background, the design of both orcs and humans, I love it. I highly recommend you watching this on IMAX or 3D. I am a huge fan of medieval fantasy story plot such as LOTR, Hobbit, GOT, and this movie is included. I really hope it will be successful and I cant wait for a sequel.</fullReview>

Second this is not based on World Of Warcraft GAME( just forget about this), its based on Warcraft: Orcs Vs Humans aka Warcraft 1. Personally i adore the movie and i already entered it twice so far and i don't mind to enter it again actually it feels that you are playing it. And those who don't know about Warcraft Games don't worry you will understand it because it easy story line because its the beginning.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie because some friends ask me to join them and I thought this is gonna be a boring boys' film. But it turns out otherwise. The film is awesome. The world's environment is breathtaking. I don't know much about the game, my ex was a Warcraft fan and sometimes he talked about the game. Maybe it's better if you watch with someone who actually play the game because it's confusing at some part. The plot is really unexpected, in a good way, which I believe there is more and deeper story than what it's already shown. The orcs are cool, but I need some times to get used to their big palms. Human sides is humorous too, well I don't want to give spoilers, but this war film is not just about battle scenes. Girls, if your boyfriends spend too many hours on Warcraft games, then watch this film with them. You'll finally have something same to talk about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Verdict of a lore fanatic: Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So.. before seeing this movie I was praying "Please don't screw up the lore!", but even tho some major details that we get from the movie are different from the books &amp; RPG, the main story line was respected in a great proportion. The screening was amazing the character build up was not bad, actually great for Garona and Lothar. You can see their evolution and their struggling, you can even feel their emotions and their pain which is great.***************** Spoiler alert ********************* But if a guy who had never had contact with the books &amp; games would seen this movie, I can clearly say that he would be a little confused about certain events. I am more talking here about Medivh. Ben Foster indeed made a good job playing him, but the character illustrated in the movie is very mysterious. He suffers a major change in the movie,and at one point we actually see him as being a totally different person/entity without getting a clue why and what determined him to become like that. Those who know the lore actually know the background of what happened, but thinking a bit more I am also expecting to get an explanation in possible the third movie as players got the first clues in the Warcraft 3 RPG.***************** End of spoiler ********************* As a conclusion I believe the movie was actually quite good and I would really recommend it to anyone. It is not the best movie you have ever seen, but it is a nice illustrated story which is worth your time &amp; cinema ticket money. I hope the next one will be great as well :)</fullReview>

The lower down the list the harder it is to make the transition upwards.Gaming is still to this day considered 'for children' by so called peers of the realm which makes it very difficult for a feature film of even one of gaming's most recognisable adult based, story/lore rich brands to receive credibility..In my opinion, the movie industry for some reason is truly terrified of the gaming industry most of all.. and if a 'game' were to ever achieve success in the movie industry the world as we know it may (end) change and gamer's perhaps would be somewhat forgiven/understood for spending (wasting) their free time within these worlds.. As for this movie, I had my doubts to begin with but when I learned just exactly how much influence Blizzard were going to have, I relaxed.. Basing the movie on the original game was a risky but genius move.. Unquestionably there are much more entertaining stories and events within the 'Warcraft' universe but starting from the beginning just feels so right and that is what I feel this movie has achieved, something which Blizzard are known for.. Fantastic storytelling..I personally feel the pace of the movie is acceptable because there was so much to get through and even if your not a fantasy fan you can easily understand the premises of this movie and because of this frantic pace I can hand on heart confirm that there are precisely zero dull scenes within this because they simply didn't have time to include some..The actors and Travis Fimmel in particular were completely suitable and portrayed Lothar exactly how I would imagine him to be which is pretty special for an actor who has very little knowledge of the universe.. The cast as a whole were perfect for this as none of them are considered 'huge household names' which could have taken away some of the focus from 'WARCRAFT' itself.. As for the CGI environments and the Orcs I am not going to waste my time reviewing because this is blizzard, they know their product well..Yes the movie could have been improved but without A New Hope you would never have had Empire.. This is a solid and impressive 'beginning'.. Please go and judge it for yourself, because I am unsure what movie critics have against gamers but I feel they believe we are second class citizens.. Show your true passion!Thanks for listening... :) Love</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the Critics, This Film is Utterly Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Warcraft with my girlfriend; we had totally different perspectives on the source material when watching this film. She could not be less into computer games, especially World of Warcraft, which I have tried and failed to get her addicted to as I was. I however am a complete nerd and knew all of the lore, and I mean all of it, before even going into the cinema. We both loved it. The style of the cgi, the story, the fights, the actors, everything! We both say totally engrossed for two hours, me nerding out massively, her jumping and laughing and experiencing the sadness as the story played out. Duncan Jones has done a fantastic job at adapting the source material, which is especially good when you consider that said source consisted of a computer game with let's say not quite the deepest of plot lines! I would say it is the best 3D film and computer game adaptation I have seen to date, and both my girlfriend and I cant wait until the next one comes out! Oh and just as a side point, at the time of writing this review the film had a poor review rating on rotten tomatoes. In response I would say look at who has given the poor reviews and look who's given it what it is rightfully due in my opinion. This kind of film needs and open mind in order for you to enjoy it, and it's definitely safe to say that the people who have reviewed it poorly have not given the time and thoughtful approach that this film deserves, much to their own loss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the 'critical review' sites will not have played Warcraft or World of Warcraft and so cannot appreciate the depth of story that this film attempts to fill in the length of a single movie.This is a must see for everyone, and supporting it will hopefully lead to more films being made covering even better stories from the Warcraft series.For those who are not familiar with the games or the associated books and enjoyed the movie, any interest sparked by watching this can lead you to discover a rich lore with over a decade's worth of work making it far more vast than others such as Lord of the Rings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the movie 2 times in the cinema and I have no regrets, it is by far the best movie I have ever seen. I literally cried because of epicnes, 2 times at the same point. This movie is an absolute must-see for people who are familiar with the lore. For myself, I know every single letter and number of everything of every character in the Warcraft universe so for me I knew exactly what was going on. But you don't have to know the lore to see this movie, in fact this movie can definitely get you into the lore if not it can turn you on for playing the game. Just so you know: GARONA IS NOT HALF HUMAN, SHE IS HALF DRAENEI!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blizzard fans, unite!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, the first point I want to make before going in depth is that in no way am I a professional reviewer and I am simply writing this review because I feel A LOT of the reviews written for this movie, have been based off of subjective opinion rather than us looking at it for what it is, a movie franchise with what might be the greatest potential in the 21st century. Now, for all of you still reading, let's start off with some facts. Blizzard Entertainment first introduced Warcraft, to consoles in Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans in 1994, the following year they then released Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness and the expansion Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal 1995, then it took them another 7 years before the sequel Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (RoC) came out in 2002 followed closely by Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (TFT) in 2003. The year after that is when World of Warcraft was released, which in its opening year had 1.5 million people subscribing, now to World of Warcraft alone there currently are 5 expansions and a 6th on the way. The movie Warcraft: The Beginning is about the very first game that dates all the way back to Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans.With all this in mind, let's explore what has been done to bring the world of Warcraft to life on the cinematized screen of a movie theatre. To start off, I'd like to say, I have been anticipating the release of this movie for almost going on 3 years now, and back in 2014 when I noticed it on IMDb for pre-production it said it wouldn't be out until in 2017, so being here in 2016 having watched it on the premiere date too, I'd say I'm more than ecstastic. Now, what I as both a player of the game, and a fan of the lore experienced is, keeping in mind that it is a work to be critical about, am very pleased with the result. What I think we all noticed during the first release of the trailer is that the production team kept the animated look to the pauldrons and armor of the humans, because they wanted to illustrate how this is a fictional world, where magic roams, where creatures you'd never dream of in your wildest nightmares also walk freely. A lot of people are also criticizing the use of CGI in this movie, but, the fact that all CGI-characters were based on motion capture, where the actions were performed by actual actors in suits, made it not only exceed the expectations but create an entire new plateau for what people in the future will expect from CGI. And as a moviebuff I am personally really invested in that concept and idea, and I think we all should be.With all this being said, and not much of the actual movie having been revealed, I'd like to extend an invitation to anyone who hasn't seen this marvel with their own eyes, to go see it, because not only do I believe, but I know for a fact that if people see this movie and dislike it, it's not because of what's been shown on the screen, it's more likely they're perplexed by the fact that their expectations to the movie were wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft: The Beginning is very good entertaining fantasy movie with awesome special effects that anyone in your family can actually see and feel connected to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Warcraft fan, I was very pleased with the final product and I really think this is a good movie. I won't get into details about the movie, as I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, but I can say a few things:Story -Although the story of the movie is not 100% faithful to the original lore, the changes made are plausible and were laid out in a consistent and credible way; -This movie is about a fantasy world, and as a fantasy story, I am of the opinion that this is a very good story, very entertaining and immersive; -There were loads of funny moments, with fairly-cliché jokes and lots of easter eggs for the fanbase; -I think that Duncan Jones did an overall very good work with the script and directing the movie, he made choices and some people might like them, others won't, but solid story and acting nonetheless;Acting -The main characters in the film were very personable and while some people might relate more with Durotan, Orgrim or Draka, and others will relate more with Lothar or Garona, all the audience can relate to some character because they have the same sort problems real people have on a daily basis ? as I said, they're personable; -On the other end of the spectrum, the "bad guys" (Blackhand, Gul'dan) are typical bad guys but Ben Foster was quite good at fleshing out Medivh's fight between his good and bad (corrupt) sides; -I'm not going to pretend I'm a huge expert in acting and have the ability to say what is and isn't good acting, but I can say if I felt actor A or actress B performed in a way that I felt was convincing or portrayed the character in a way it made me like that character. With that said, my personal opinion is that Paula Patton surprised me with Garona and I loved every scene of Rob Kazinsky's Orgrim. The character I liked the most was Khadgar, closely followed by Gul'dan and Durotan. So kudos to Ben Schnetzer, Daniel Wu and Toby Kebbel, you made credible and strong performances. A word of appreciation to Tom Clancy, Ruth Negga and Anna Galvin, I would've liked to have seen more of Blackhand, Lady Taria and Draka, respectively; -In parallel, I felt Dominic Cooper and Travis Fimmel to be a bit disconnected as I couldn't really feel much connection to King Llane and Lothar, respectively;Pace -The pace of the movie is quite fast, which can lead to some people who aren't familiar with the lore to feel a bit lost here and there. However, one has to understand that the movie is based on a story that was written over many books and whenever you make any movie based on a book, there is no other way than stripping out a lot of detail from the book(s), else you'd have a 10h-long movie. The same thing happened with Lord of the Rings trilogy, where a lot of fans criticized the movie for only showing a very small amount of what was in the book; -For the same reason, there are several points in the movie where scenes were laid out to support sequels and those are obvious for those who know the lore, and left the feeling that this will lead somewhere for those who don't. I think this was a good move, this movie literally screams for sequels. Yes, I used plural, one sequel is not enough;Graphics -I deliberately left this aspect to the end because I think it is a cornerstone of this movie. There's only one way I can define the CG used in the movie and that is: AMAZING! No, seriously, I always thought to myself and said it many times ? if the guys doing the movie get the Orcs right, they already won. And that's EXACTLY what happened in this movie. The orcs are simply AWESOME! They look real, credible, even in scenes with hundreds/thousands of orcs, and surprisingly personable! You can easily relate with these huge beasts who are very aggressive and all, but happen to have feelings; -The magic in the movie is absolutely amazing and credible, I wish we had magic effects like this in-game! This was extremely surprising, it's so much better than any other magic effects I've seen in any other movie, ever!; - The landscapes are breathtaking, to say the least. Even if you don't know the locations, they're still very eye-candy; -I would go as far as saying that ILM did such a good job on the CGI that Warcraft: The Beginning's graphics are probably the best I've ever seen in any movie, definitely better than the ones we saw on movies like Avatar or Planet of the Apes;Sound -All the music and sound effects are top notch, especially the tone of the Orcs' voice, really thundering strong voices!For all of the reasons stated above, I'd say this is quite a good movie to see and I will definitely see it more than once. If I would advise anyone to do anything, was to go see the movie and form your own opinion. You might agree or disagree entirely or partially with me, this is just my personal opinion. But please don't dispute anything said above if you haven't seen the movie yourself. Criticizing something lacking knowledge, just based on someone else's opinion is just plain stupid.Yes, it wasn't the most enlightening movie of all time that changed my life entirely from a philosophical standpoint, it's not an Oscar/Grammy/whatever awards you prefer contender, but it's definitely a very good entertaining fantasy movie with awesome special effects that anyone in your family can actually see and feel connected to. For that, I'd give it a solid 7/10 rating and advise everyone to go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not perfect but a really good first movie of Warcraft for the fans and who don't know the Warcraft lore. The director Duncan Jones made a really impressive looking fantasy movie based on the popular video game Warcraft (Orcs and Humans, Tide of Darkness). Tha movie has a high level CGI, unique and amazing spell animations, beautiful landscape, truly amazing and beautiful music by Ramin Djawadi and not least iconic places and creatures what a Warcraft fan is gonna love! BUT! There is something with the movie what could be very frustrating. The story.. Yes 123 minutes is not enough for this movie which caused some deficiencies like storytelling and characters. In my opinion ( As a huge Warcraft fan) this movie is really impressive and a very good beginning of a great series what will show people the real enchanting and wonderful world of Warcrfat!Story: 10/6 Visuals: 10/10 Music: 10/10 The movie itself: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>visually stunning summer blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of I would like to note how mad I am at all those "official" reviews from critics who think they know how to really rate a movie. It is absolutely preposterous what some of them write. WARCRAFT is visually one of the best films I've seen in recent years. The animations and special effects are absolutely gorgeous and it is one of the very first movies that shows magical effects and spell-weaving in this glorious fashion.WARCRAFT is first and foremost a movie for the fans of the Warcraft-universe but it is also a very nice fantasy/action flick for people how don't really know this rich universe. The fans of this rich lore will have an even bigger blast seeing it, that's how good and genuine to the source material it is made! Those 2 hours and 3 minutes just fly by the viewer and when it's over you don't want to believe you already have to exit the movie theater. One valid point in a lot of reviews is, that the movie should be longer (or should contain less plot) and a more detailed explaining of certain things would have been nice. It is a good possibility that people with no prior knowledge of this universe will have a hard time connecting a few dots. That's because WARCRAFT pushes the story nearly too much and Ducan Jones maybe put too much plot into those 2 hours.But as mentioned before, this movie is a glorious summer blockbuster with breathtaking visual effects and I highly recommend it to all fantasy/action/science fiction fans out there!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been playing Wow since it come out. I have read all the books and know all the lore. My biggest fear watching this was being bored, and only entertained by some amazing visual effects. I was wrong to fear that. I understood from the beginning that this movie was not a movie based on books, but a movie about Warcraft and the first horde invasion. The overall story line remained intact, which i see as a must. But i was constantly surprised in a positive way by the way they changed things, i was actually up in my seat of excitement. When Dorutan challenges Gul'Dan and is winning, i was like "is he gonna do it?" knowing that would actually ruin the whole story. It has some flaws in my opinion. I would have liked to see more of the different Orc Clans, hear Grommash Hellscream talk and be a bad ass, but i feel like that will happen in another movie (if they make one.... PLease do). The acting was great, and i had lots of feel moments during the film. The way they made the whole of Storwmeind look so like in the game is just amazing. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie unlike anything you've seen before!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went it to Warcraft with somewhat mixed expectations - partially low due to 'the video game curse', the heavy lore behind Warcraft (very, very little of it which I know) and also partially high because Blizzard (the company behind the franchise) makes amazing games with incredible stories and attention to detail and due to Duncan Jones', albeit small, prior efforts at directing movies. This movie is truly unlike you've ever seen before! Seeing a grand adventure world like this come sprawling to life being made mostly with CGI and motion capture is utterly amazing. I know, I know.. Too much CGI is never a good thing, and I'm usually in that camp too, but put these orcs in Lord of the Rings costumes and makeup then Duncan Jones would never have been able to capture the essence of their 'humanity', the feelings wouldn't show and alas they would be nothing but unrelatable scary monsters. The point of this film is to do exactly the opposite. Duncan and the actors behind the motion capture manage to hit the nail on this one! The story is great, grand and adventures. It feels like a proper fantasy through and through, epic in scale and enormous in stakes. One can't help but end up rooting for both sides of this conflict. Magic is everything in a fantasy, and finally getting to see what a true wielder of the arcane arts is capable of is like a nerd wet dream come true. Gosh how I love the magic and the sheer scale of it in this movie is incredible. It is finally so good to see it done on a large and forceful scale in a movie! I didn't stop smiling once during this movie, Utterly entertaining and amazing eye candy.The movie isn't pure goodness though - Warcraft is filled to the brink with characters, some are properly introduced some aren't, some with motivations which aren't fully explained and the lack thereof can make one a confused. The amount of characters being balanced in this movie are a bit too many, but then again, trying to please an already established and demanding fan base can't be anything but tricky. The specifics of the lore are impossible to learn through the movie, so be ready to do some digging once you've seen it. It is action packed! Both for the better and worse. There are few times where this movie really slows down and lets you wallow in this beautiful and realized world, which is a shame. It can really take your breath away be it by exhaustion or the vistas. I really enjoyed this movie. It's not Lord of the Rings, it's not the Hobbit and it is not trying to be neither of those movies. This is a fantasy movie unlike anything we've ever seen before and I can't wait to see more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched it, i have to say: the orcs look so real. The eyes was something else - really breathtaking! The Easter eggs for fans was so fun to watch. The humor was great as well even though the movie was a bit gritty and dark (i like when it is dark and gritty), it had all the things that i wanted from the Warcraft movie. Gul'dan was just pure evil. Travis did a great job as Lothar. Durotan and Orgrim we're bad ass. Kadghar was really cool as well. I basically loved every minute and it was exciting from start to the end. I want more, i need like 3-4 sequels in my life, i want Taurens, Arthas/Lich King and Illidan at least. I loved how the could balance Alliance and Horde alike. And even if i play on the Horde faction (For the Horde!) i really liked the Alliance side of it all. Go and see it, its worth every minute of it. And to all the negative so called "critics" that says otherwise. Please stop taking bribes from Disney/Marvel - it ain't funny anymore.**Minor Spoiler**The only thing that was weird and negative i have to say was when Garona could speak English in like 48 hours or something - when coming to Azeroth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft Delivers! Sequels Please!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first, this film has had the weight of the world on its shoulders. A literal decade of anticipation and hype with the added pressure of invigorating an entire genre. No film can live up to those expectations under any circumstance. However, Warcraft delivers a truly remarkable cinematic experience. The CGI is the finest to date in any film. The story, while perhaps a bit to take in as a newcomer to the universe is well crafted and true to its source material. It would be silly to say that people unfamiliar with the world cannot understand the film. That is insulting to the audience and simply untrue. The action sequences are pulse pounding and gorgeous feats of cinematography. The acting rings true with some faltering here and there due to some clunky dialogue. Any fan of the fantasy genre must see this film! The magic is a beautiful and is expressed visually in a way we haven't seen on film before. Early negative reviews should be take with a mountain of salt. This film is a fine first entry into a new franchise that deserves sequel upon sequel in order to refine the writing and fully flesh out this world. Fans of Warcraft will be in heaven. New comers will be delighted to see a film that isn't a reboot, sequel, or prequel. Fans of action films will be on the edge of their seat. Fans of fantasy will be orgasmic. Just go see it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a Fan: awesome 9/10 (me); as a Normal Movie:good 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So i see all these posts on 10 stars and then 1 star and i hate that movie and i need to counteract this hype, I'm just gonna talk freely because i hate this nonsense to counteract reviews cause you liked or disliked a movie.First point is the CGI, it looks fantastic and visual are stunning if you let the movie in. Second the music damn its good. Its theirs when it needs to be theirs and it never gives u the feel of overpowering the scene. Side Info:Its written by the Game of Thrones dude. Third the Narrative and that's the point where i can understand why people think the movie loses points. For a fan its fine, we are used to the kind of dialogue which might seem off. But in my opinion is actually really fitting to this kind of a fantasy world. The movie starts way to fast for a movie watcher. For a fan its just fan service in the beginning for a "starter" its irritating. But the movie saves this with the time its going. The only real problem now is, because of the rushed pace THE "starter" isn't connected to the characters and when the first plot points hit, they don't. Except your over emphatic like me. For fans its way easier, because they are connected to the characters already. But from that first emotional hit the movie starts to excel and the characters get so much depth you hadn't even thought about it being possible before. And that stone roles till the end. About the story, its understandable and closed in its own... BUT there's room given on a second movie. And i want that second movie so bad. So if you have the slightest interest in the movie go see it... PLEASE?So if you can life with the early flaws you'll have a good time, if not then this movie is the 3/10 the critics say, but i would love you to see the movie cause its awesome if u get into it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regular People Love it, Critics Hate it (are you surprised?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bad: Cringe worthy cheesy lines, younger actors don't carry their parts well, too short of a movie to adequately develop characters.The Good: Simple fantasy story made interesting with a unique take on the traditional fantasy story of good vs bad, excellent CGI, strong main characters carry the movie very well, believable action scenes, great fantasy world feeling.Summary: The critics hate this movie because it doesn't play to their stereotype of what a fantasy movie should have, that being: a go-to director with a proved history of boring movies, old-fart actors, boring old-fashioned action scenes where the hero kills 50+ bad guys, traditional bad vs. good story with the predictable twist.Truth is this movie did what no other modern fantasy has been able to do: create a suspenseful fantasy movie. True Warcraft's story is overcrowded with characters, but the main characters carry the movie very well. The action scenes are refreshing for a fantasy movie. We are so use to the boring Lord of the Rings war scene where the supposed fearsome Orcs get mowed over by a sissy with a bow. Watching LOTR gives you the sense that a 4 year old could successfully wage war on the armies of orcs with a plastic spoon. Not so in Warcraft. The Orcs are real, they are well developed, they are strong, they are scary and warlike. This new take on fantasy makes critics on over-ripe potatoes very uncomfortable who want to maintain their monopoly on movie thought. It's not going to work; we are the real critics and we have made our minds.</fullReview>

Mexican chain restaurants aren't my usual bag but at the cinema i went to it was either that or Frankie and Benny's and unfortunately they couldn't cater for my vegan wife so we were left with little choice. I mention this just so that you understand that when i started looking forward to the movie being over at around the halfway point it wasn't because i had a table at Claridges booked. All i had to look forward to was a fairly average chilli con carne, not something that normally puts me on the edge of my seat, although i can recommend their habanero chilli sauce.As a fan of World of Warcraft and a lifelong lover of the fantasy genre i feel like i was primed to love this movie. Even so it just didn't do the business. The characters fulfilled functions but had no depth, the human cast didn't really have a lot of script to work with to engender any sort of emotional response and the orc's seemed cartoonish and contradictory in their nature. The movie jumped about a lot, the story line required a lot of leaps of faith and/or knowledge of WOW lore. It kinda put me in mind of that god awful dungeons and dragons movie they made a while back except much prettier (credit where it's due, the CGI is extensive and very well rendered).All in all it was another fail in the video-game-as-a-movie genre. I'm surprised there are so many people raving about it in their reviews on here, maybe they had their Chiquitos before the movie and it seemed better by comparison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the cinema to watch the film today and I have to say that I enjoyed every single part of it. Like one of the watchers said here ''critics go home''! First of all, nostalgia kicked in, and second I felt completely immersed with the film and the whole atmosphere of it and I didn't want it to end! I saw it with my family and all of us were impressed - considering that my father didn't even know a single thing about Warcraft lore!Best of 2016, and I find it better than "The Hobbit". 10/10, will go watch it again.Ignore the critics, go and see it, you will enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything I've been waiting for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, do not trust or listen to the critic reviews. If you like fantasy, you have to see Warcraft! I have no clue why it had such a bad reception from critics, but I can honestly say that it's been everything I have been waiting for.Having played all the Warcraft RTS games and WoW for close to 6 years, the only criticism I have for the movie is that it is not as close to the lore as I would have liked it. Don't get me wrong, the story is great even in this form and I can't wait for the next one. It is by far the best movie made based on a game and I would put it in the same league as Lord of the rings.The CGI fights and spells are some of the best I have ever seen. I would have loved for it to be longer and explain/explore the relationships between the main characters a bit more.Stormwind and the general scenery look amazing and I can't wait to see the other capitals in more detail as well.I registered on IMDb just so I could review Warcraft and tell everyone to go see it! The more of us see it, the higher the chance the next one is even better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: I'm a fan of the franchise. I've read all the publications and played all the games.The movie could've been improved a bit but it remain a good movie overall. (Visuals/Effects) simply amazing. (Acting) I didn't have high expectations, given the cast, but was not disappointed. (Story) the beginning could've been improved by setting the story more properly and in a slower pace. The introduction of characters and landscape/map to the viewer should've been better as well to ensure the viewers are following the plot and places easily. (Game Lore) I'm disappointed with the story changes in the movie. (Editing) the transitioning between places, characters, and time *morning/night/days* is just bad. Scenes tend to jump to others without easing the viewers into the new setting. using a map to transition from one place to another could've improved things a bit. Also, characters could've been introduced and given a personality during transitions instead of taking a scene by themselves. (Music) good score but seemed a bit repetitive at times. It could've been expanded more. (Choreography) well done. (Fandom) good amount of nods to the game's players. Overall, the movie was enjoyable. It seemed as if the production wanted to put as much as possible into 2 hours instead of extending the movie for the seek of better story development. Also, the story could've used more complex emotions like using leverage and concealed self-interest- based-actions/decisions *it seemed a bit childish and naive to me*. I recommend going to the movie. I hope there will be sequels where all the shortfalls I've mentioned are corrected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definition of being sufficient</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched it, liked it!The critics bashing it, understandably, the fans and non-fans like it, also understandably. Who is right? Both?Alright, so let's just put the premise of this whole thing. A film adaptation, for a game, still a very tricky thing to do which could easily go wrong, and did for many tries in the past. It has to be appealing for the fans, non-fans, for movie goers, Avatar movie-like fanatics, snobbish people, adults and children etc. and just then we still didn't get to the fact, that it is a movie, and it has to tell a story from A to B, having a structure, in which a movie should work. We're living in an age where a film adaptation for a game has finally managed to bring exactly the same image which the game itself represents, well, in a way. Some are saying it's not a World of Warcraft movie, I say it is, kinda, mixed with the Warcraft I's simplicity, creating a hybrid which tells a simple but important story for this franchise, introducing elements which may be important for the latter storytelling. It's indeed a beginning for possible sequels, just as it should be after several ones were released in the format of books, and games, summing up massive lore, from which the film makers could choose and put as a sequel next to this really ambitious, and overall well made movie; Warcraft, the Beginning. It couldn't be that easy to bring all the feelings, experiences which we could come by in games, or in the world of literature. That's merely impossible, that's why I think that without Duncan Jones' talent this movie couldn't work, which want to tell many things yet it still don't. It starts to bring up information which should be noted, but in the end, their role and part will only be seen in the future somewhere, so now they only take participation in making the represented world believable and credible, creating the atmosphere the game itself has.It may have been made for the fans, but it also could be appealing for non- fans, however the truth is, each side will take the communications of this movie differently, 'coz no matter what, some pre-knowledge wouldn't hurt to really get the movie's real intention. It may be liked by non-fans, and the uninitiated, the information they collect from this 2 hour story restores whole differently as in a fan, or a viewer, who has played some time with any of the games. So in my opinion, the REAL quality could be experienced if you have some knowledge about the franchise, whether it is from the written format or gaming platform. Because no matter what, the world of Warcraft is a grotesque but still a dangerous place, it's as serious as it is not, it holds as dark moments as light ones, and this is a language that Warcraft held with itself from the beginning of its existence. So when a guy, like Medivh speaks totally seriously about the Fel magic, as the camera holds the position on his face, it is as serious as cringe-worthy, it's someplace in between, and that's the simple reflection of the world of Warcraft's language, when you look at the orcs, they are not just scary, they are also adorable in a way with their huge hands and tusks, with their simple perspective of life, when we see Lothar, a totally cheeky appearance throughout a film showing off how deadly and sullen can he be in the end.However some changes have been made in order to make the movie work, so in some percentage it really doesn't matter what your pre-conceptions are, a partly new story will be shown in front of you, and here is the answer what a film adaptation for a game should be, in my opinion: Be true to the source, but also make purpose to bring it on screen. How could be that possible? Simply with thinking a bit outside the box, understanding how could the elements of a game work on big screen in order to bring new experiences for the audience, making it clear what's the difference between communicating information by the game and the movie. Familiar faces, names, stories, a bit differently, bringing back memories from the past in a form of modern communication, and the language of motion picture. We see what we expect to see, yet get it in a whole lot of different pacing that we got used to watching any cinematics made in this franchise, experiencing a story, that has heart, and soul, an ambitious production which possibly holds many surprises and also nostalgic feelings? So simply put, Warcraft: The Beginning is a fresh and solid experience, giving a good fun to the audience, that may not be a masterpiece, or legendary, far from that, but as a movie adaptation for a game it is a pleasant momentum, and for a start? it is sufficient. Just let us see some effect of elevation or evolution for the sequels.P.S.: They say that 40 minutes footage was cut out from the full length, maybe that's why it is a bit chaotic in several places... so we better get a director's cut. Oh, I cannot wait to see the Lord of the Clans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dismiss the opinion of the critics, see it with your own eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the critical reception of the film on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic I was sad, but maybe this would just be a fun and dumb summer movie to enjoy with some friends and popcorn. Apprehensive, I decided to spend my hard earned cash and take a gander.Oh man am I glad I don't share their view, this film is so much better than I imagined it could be. Sure, the Warcraft world has an appeal when applied to video games, but a movie? I was always skeptical, even before the reviews came in. I think I know why the critics don't like it though. If you're expecting Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones, this is not the movie for you. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones already had a massive and loyal fan base that required no exposition. It's a fantasy world, and as such there's a lot to take in for those not familiar with the Warcraft games and lore. So much to take in, in fact, that cramming it all into only 123 minutes feels like trying to study for a test 20 minutes before it begins. Meanwhile, someone like me has already been studying for a few years. It's just not fair. Not to the movie, or the critics.I'm really glad I got to witness this first installment though, hopefully with many more to come. It's no Avatar in terms of breakthrough visual effects, but for a budget of only 160 million, it's good enough. If you're a fan of the games, this is for you. If not, try to read up on the basic lore before you see the movie. Study before the big test. You will enjoy it so much more.Thank you Duncan Jones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not know anything about the story line or video game cause I have never played. But as someone who doesn't understand the history of it I thought it was pretty good. The special effects were great (a few times you saw some errors) and the movie did not go as I expected. The acting was par however, Paula Patton did great but I felt the others were not on her level. I actually like this more then X-Men Apocalypse to be honest. But the hype of X-Men made it a let down.... anyways i have to fill up ten lines so I'm just going to ramble on about nothing from here on out, I suggest you take a look at the next review, or you can just keep reading but you really won't get much more out of me.

		<shortDescription>It does the games justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making a movie based on a video game is a pretty bold move, because a lot can go wrong. A game's success can trigger movie makers to create half-assed products, that only serve cash grabbing and on the other side games tend to lack enough substance to make good movies. Luckily for Warcraft the latter isn't it's case and given to the right director and writers it can become quite a quality product. Also luckily for the fans, that's exactly what happened. First of all the movie absolutely achieved to immerse me in it's fantasy world. The presentation was beautiful and fitting to it's source material. It also deserves praise for it's great CGI (which happens rarely). When battles happened I genuinely felt excited. Compared to the Hobbit trilogy (as much as I dislike to bash on one of my favourite movie makers) they didn't feel like over the top CGI-dance routines. They had risk and intensity. Though I must admit, that a certain character did have a bit too much plot armor. As far as the story goes; it was overall interesting. I enjoyed the double perspective and world building elements. There were however problems in the plot transitioning. The exposition and early phases of the movie are quite lacking. It's all too fast paced and certain points, that should have been explained more thoroughly earlier only got to me after they kept bringing them up as the plot progressed. The acting was pretty good and you could sense some dedication within the portrayals of the characters. While the story was not too heavily character driven, they did deliver in being somewhat interesting to stick around with. Warcraft may not be the best fantasy film that came out, it however knows what it wants to be and gives it's fans, what they wanted to see. If you're not a Warcraft fan, you will likely have some trouble immersing yourself in this world at the get go, maybe it won't happen at all, but even then I find you could get some fun out of the impressive (while cartoon-y) CGI and the exciting action scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film Warcraft fans deserve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the important question: Am I a fan or not?I am not a die hard Warcraft fan besides some characters from Warcraft 3. I do not know the entire lore. I never read a Warcraft book, I only started playing with Warcraft 3. I played WoW in 2005, dropped it after a month or so and only joined again in 2015.That said: I do not get the critics AT ALL. This movie is by far better than the critics want it to be. This movie has so much love and details, it is breathtaking. You can tell, in every scene, how close the film is to the source material. Especially for the fans who know all the small pieces and were like: "OMG! It is exactly like in the game."The acting was okay, far from being as horrible as described. I actually liked Khadgar's more clumsy appearance which visibly lightened the overall very dark tone of the movie. And Ben Foster as Medivh actually played surprisingly convincing. The orcs all acted flawlessly via motion-capture.The CGI was top notch. The orcs look better than Avatar, so does the overall CGI (for the budget). The CGI environments were a feast for the eyes. Again, the fans will love it because they recognize every single detail of it. Stormwind, the forest, Deadwind Pass, Dalaran. Everything looks so familiar. The set pieces were lovely crafted and there were more than I expected. Every interior was at least partly real. The pacing was no problem for me, as I did pay attention throughout the film. I got myself into the setting and some concepts and then it works.The overall story was okay with some nice twists. Not Oscar-worthy, but compelling. It is a good vs. evil story but with some heavy twists to the standard fantasy formula.About the orcs. Oh boy. The orcs are all outstanding. Very likable ( or not ;) ). Gul'dan and Blackhand are just as bad-ass as Durotan and Orgrim. And fans will see a VERY important character in the background for future films. There are emotional scenes but they could have been a tad more emotional. The death scenes especially were too emotionless.Yes, it can get confusing if you do not know anything about the Warcraft universe. 10 minutes more would have been okay to explain some stuff a bit more. And would have guaranteed higher ratings.I do not trust the US critics anymore. No a single one. They clearly do not know what they are reviewing. They are far from being realistic. Everything that is 'only' okay is panned. This is unrealistic."Unrealistic movie" - It is HIGH FANTASY! "SMB The Movie is better" - Eh what?! "The movie is racist" - There are at least 3 black actors (Soldier, Taria, Garona). "The movie is too serious" - Is LOTR or GoT that humorous? And there is no Trump in the film either, dear The Guardian.The European foreign language reviews (german, french, danish, Swedish) are correct in this case, they are all favorable. They range between 5-9 with some exceptions which is fair for the film. The US reviews are NOT fair.It is a feast for fans and still okay/good for non-fans. The film still works if you take away the huge fan service it has to offer. Of course, it is not the next LOTR. None of the fans expected it. Not a single one! But those critics, which make them unbelievable. They do not even give this movie a chance. Warcraft: The Beginning is far from being perfect and even if you are a fan it still has some flaws. Therefore no perfect score.For fans: 9/10. For non-fans: 7/10.As I am a fan, somehow, I still give the film an 8 because I, personally, had a blast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seen it. Loved it. Two thumbs of two.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, Blizzard/Jones/Universal, basically, when is the next one due?Went to see it in a group of five (oh yes, the jokes just write themselves, eh? Classic setup: Tank, 3x DD, Healer :-) ).Loved every minute of it. Not going to spoil stuff, just a few remarks:* it helps if you already have a general idea of what it's about. The really basic stuff should suffice, things like e.g.: wizards. knights. orcs. dwarfs. a hint of elves and space goats. vaguely medieval. magic that goes crackle. * I didn't perceive the decoration/weapons/armor to be "plastic" or "fake looking". * Liked the CGI. Level of detail: awesome. Occasional weirdness in the background. Noticed it, didn't give a hoot. * damn, some stuff seemed to me pretty dark/gruesome for a PG-12 (German) movie. * hated the 3D. Cinema's fault (bad L/R channel separation, maybe the glasses, the screen or the projector. Need to get this one again on 3D Blu-ray. * German dub is OK. Some snarky dialogue to bring some fun into the overall setting caused the intended response from the audience. Definitely didn't feel overwrought. * that story moves fast. Like, "don't get up to take a leak" fast. * Director's Cut. Director's Cut. Director's Cut. See? Said it three times. Now it's got to happen. Eh? EH? ;-) * I had no problem following the story. The others with me didn't have one either. It probably helped that we're not movie critics who have to take notes during the viewing. * In some places **spoiler** (tavern after botched negotiations) **/spoiler** the change of settings and emotions seems a bit too fast. * Didn't develop too much attachment to any one character, but "got" their motivations quite clearly. So what? Felt extremely entertained anyway. * Uh, one more thing: Two guys with brown hair and knight getup? Yeah, sure, one has a crown, but ? how am I supposed to tell them apart?Ah, that's mostly just me nitpicking. Here's the resumé, speaking for five people ages 12 to 45: LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. WANT MORE. NEED TO STOP GRINNING. WHY AM I WRITING ALL CAPS?Phew. OK. Time to cool down.There. See? Opinion voiced. It's mine. MINE. Want your own? Go see it.Word of advice: You better like fantasy stuff that goes "bang" and "crunch" and "crackle", or WARCRAFT the movie isn't going to do much for you. If you do, if you were e.g. "Bored of the Rings" of people walking ways where eagles could've easily flown ;-) , then this one may be something for you. It's kind of, like ? yeah, "Willow" (but different) on fast forward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can tell, This is a good movie.. whatever what the critics said this movie is a good movie, not great but still fun. with some flaws..lets talk about the good first. THE ORCS story probably the best thing in this movie, Toby Kebell as Durotan is amazing, so does Daniel Wu as Guldan... CGI is sick! best motion capture and CGI since Planet of the Apes... The character motivation from the orcs are relatable, we can understand why they do that. the magic, its work! in fantasy movies, sometimes magic always bit shaky, body language, the spell, effect is good. Overall performances from the mages and the orcs are the good thing about the movie.. there are concerning though, the humans are not so compelling.. Travis Fimmell as lothar is not as good as I though, and Garona i think the name, is not as interesting as I though, but its still my opinion.. there are some things that wasn't really needed to be in the movie, I think Duncan Jones really trying put so many things in the movie. All I can say is, Its still a recommended movie to watch with your family and friends.. an EPIC FANTASY STORY!I really hope, its got a sequel because I want more...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a good movie which is true to the game, I was entertained for the most part through out the film along with my other three friends, there is some slow points as it is in all long movies but overall it was enjoyable. Two of my friends had never experienced the World of Warcaft game before and believed it was a good watch from an unbiased view. I believe people who have never have played the game will have to go in with an open minded because its not in any shape or form Lord of the Rings! People have been slamming the amount of CGI in use but how else could they have done it? The scenery was true to the game and I personally enjoyed the CGI. We all thought the Orcs aesthetics where done brilliantly along with the magic from Medivh. Honestly, I thought there was some dodgy exchanges in some scenes between the characters! at times a little rushed or leaving you wanting more, especially between Lothar &amp; Garona. Warcraft is a good film and a solid introduction to its world, not by any means fantastic, but its left completely open for another film which I believe is a good thing! Hopefully we will see another one with a more open view of the world and its lore!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all don't believe the critics they are way to harsh with this movie. Most of them are from old men with art-house taste they will destroy every cgi movie they might even give -points for color movies.For me the experience was comparable to LotR. I don't see much of a quality difference between this movie and the first LotR. If you're not in to fantasy you might hate it because there is a lot of magic, demons, teleporting etc ... but if you like the genre you will enjoy this movie. If you are an Warcraft fan you will love it. It's by far the best cinematic Blizzard ever made.The story is not bad actually i like it more than SW or LotR which are IMHO simpler and more one sided. You don't have to chose between horde or alliance both are good and bad. Actually the character the audience will like most might be Durotan even if you are alliance. The CGI is mostly great but sometimes when there is a lot of fast movement it gets blurry. Acting is average while Lothar, Garona and the CGI-Orcs are quite good Medhiv and King Lane are not.As a fan i enjoyed it 8/10.</fullReview>

Every fan who knows the lore and the games will notice different small things and winks to the game series. The story is changed in some ways to make it a better cinematic experience but i am OK with that. You actually care about ALL the characters and every single one has enough screen time to understand the motives and their personality. The CGI is glorious, the Orks and other creatures just look astonishing.It is truly what we Gamers have waited for so long and i hope there will be many sequels.

I imagined it will be so predictable and expected to be disappointing one, however I always wished to see a movie based on this game since 12 years ago when I first started playing.I really don't give credit for those with bad reviews or people saying it was bad, that's there problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantasy masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't even begin to say how much I loved this movie! Everything about it is epic, from the story to the characters (Durotan was def my favourite) to the amazing world of Azeroth and the special effects!I read the official reviews before seeing the film and I have to admit I went to the cinema not knowing what to expect and even ready for a let down,but the film is far from this. The story is well explained, it's fun, it's dramatic! It's pure fantasy amazingness and does the game justice!I am honestly gutted the official reviews are so bad because I simply don't understand why! Fantasy lovers, WoW players and people who have not encountered the Warcraft universe before can all enjoy it all the same.It's an amazing piece of work! Really excited about the sequel!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A VERY solid summer blockbuster, critics don't know what they are talking about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I literally came back from the movies like an hour ago (watched Warcraft) and it was a very solid movie. Far better than what the critics said it would be. I am maybe not the most neutral person because I am a fan of Warcraft... but my dad, who knows nothing about Warcraft gave it a 8/10. Very solid film, not a masterpiece but it does not in any way shape or form deserve the hate its getting from critics. Those pretentious assholes can eat a bag of dicks! Go see it for yourself and make your own decision!&#xfeff;Pacing was a bit fast in the beginning, but it isn't nearly as much of an issue as some make it seem (it was expected though since they needed to pack 9+ hours of lore into a 2 hour film). My dad understood nearly 100% of what was going on in this movie (he knew nothing beforehand) so it is absolutely NOT true that you need to have played Warcraft to understand the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was PERFECT, if someone don't understand that's his/her problem, if someone don't like to watch BEST CGI to date then go watch Woody Allen movies (to all respect to the director), really i haven't seen better CGI and if you are so shallow not to see what this movie is about then don't write about it, ask other people to explain it to you. Don't mess with our way of life and the story that's too complicated for someone to understand it. Don't MESS WITH OUR LORE !!! Don't you DARE to say what is good and what is not good when you don't know nothing, remember for someone this is everyday LIFE and you put your finger on it. Just STOP and WANISH. And last ...this is a WARCRAFT movie not World of Warcraft, based on a game from 1994, this is the beginning of the best stories ever told.I love lord of the rings but they come second :) And one more thing , make the next movies longer :) FOR AZEROTH !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft, fantasy in it's purest form.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the critic's epic fail in giving this movie a fair review, Warcraft was an epic win for Blizzard. Warcraft is not the usual crappy video game spin-off movie, it feels and plays like it was meant for the big screen. In general, Blizzard made the movie while keeping the fans in mind giving priority to their needs (as it should be) rather than dumbing down the lore for random moviegoer. Yet, for the non-fans it does not disappoint. Warcraft bring to the table a series of epic battle and dilemmas that will keep you engaged throughout the 2 hour run time. If you have no prior exposure to the Warcraft universe there are 3 major aspects that Warcraft does better in than any other movie of its genre. Dare I say it does better in them than LOTR did.1. Magic.Warcraft does not have your typical wise gray bearded wizard who sits on his ass all day reading, and when the situation becomes dire, he flashes in and save the day. Nor is it Gandalf who can blast enemies away by just swinging his staff. In Warcraft, a huge variety of magic can be witnessed. Incantations are used, mages can use the elements arcane, frost,and fire to fend for themselves in battle. On the other hand, warlocks can use Fel magic that feeds of life itself to cast dangerous yet powerful spells to aid them in battle. Magic and its various types are easily seen in Warcraft. Also, mages are not the old man in the pointy hat, they are young people who sharpen there skills in direct combat on the battle field, whether its with other mages or fully armored warriors. Moreover, mages are not invincible as they can be jumped, captured or incapacitated via conventional means.2. Battles. Another plus for Warcraft are the battles that were fought. The orcs fleeing a dying world try to invade another to survive. They then send a small warband to pave the way, and ensure the rest of the horde can make it to Azeroth. Amazingly (sarcasm) the small warband follows a logical strategy of warfare, as we would expect from creature raised in a culture of war. The orcs acknowledge their small numbers stick to swift raids and ambushes to fight the enemy. The most satisfying part of the battles is that these hulking monsters are not massacred by the humans with relative ease like LOTR. Surprisingly the orcs fight like hulking beasts would do by using brute force to crush the enemy. The humans who never encountered orcs before try to adapt to orcs and slowly start to put up a fight. 3. Orcs.Last but defiantly not least, orcs. Just to make things clear orcs in Warcraft are not the inherently evil orcs and uruks of LOTR. In Warcraft, orcs have there own culture, architecture, language, free will, and the respect for tradition. The tribal orcs of Draenor did not unite and invade Azeroth purely for blood lust. The path they took was out of desperation as their world collapsed, it was necessary to ensure the survival of their race (you would understand this better if you played the game as it was not explained well in the movie). Another thing Warcraft does well is that they show how barbaric these orcs are, but they do not cross the thin line and mix it with being evil, and the viewer can clearly see this distinction between evil and a barbaric way of life. As a result of this, the viewer will adore some orcs while deeply despising others. Other than the stunning CGI, these features distinguished Warcraft from other fantasies, and could be appreciated by all viewers. (Some viewers my find the movie cliché, but remember, the story came out in 1994 as the first Warcraft game was released. Orcs having their own way of life and are not necessarily evil was pretty original back then.)Fans, with prior knowledge of what will happen and where the story is going will be greeted warmly by the movie. As the lore does not explain itself a lot, Blizzard had more time to insert Easter eggs for the fans to spot, while the characters venture through familiar locations were all WOW (World or Warcraft) players have visited. Also, due to the small time invested in explaining the lore we as fans are treated to ambushes, raids, and epic battles unfold similar to the battle of Warcraft III ROC intro. Blizzard has given us a movie that any fantasy lover could enjoy, and fans who already know the lore could relate to as everything unfolds. Regrettably, no movie is perfect and in Warcraft, a lot of the cast members aren't familiar with acting in a fantasy movie (Dominic Cooper). Sometimes emotions are not present were they are needed the most. The lore was not explained well as there was no time (again the movie was for the fans), so some viewers may be lost and not know completely whats happening. A personal dislike I had for the movie is that they changed a small part of the lore for dramatic purposes (it is a movie after all) that as a die hard fan of the lore I didn't appreciate. All-in-all the movie was amazing and its not worth missing, whether you're a fan of not.</fullReview>

I suspect the directors cut will be received better than the critics..So not a fan boy but pleasantly surprised!! Wife loved it.. Sons loved it.. It is half term ..

		<shortDescription>Great movie, definitely worth watching multiple times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who's never heard of the game until this movie came out, i honestly loved the movie. The CGI was beautiful and the relation to each character was real, the world itself felt so real. I could feel strong emotions even from the orcs which was a big plus for me, usually most movies that have "monsters" in them are too focused on how evil they look and don't show emotion. I was actually really attracted to the orc side of the story. Loved duncan jones movie "moon" so i had no doubt he would be able to pull out another great movie. I am going to take my kids to watch this movie again, also my wife hates fantasy movies but i convinced her to go and she actually really liked Warcraft. kudos! I just saw some bad critic reviews on this movie and was a bit confused as to why they would bash this movie so bad. I usually don't write reviews for movies, but after reading those horrendous reviews I had to come here to give this movie some justice of what it really deserves. I really hope there is a squeal because I will definitely watch it. Don't listen to the negative reviews, i believe most of them are just for attraction. Check out the movie yourself and have your own opinion, i was a bit skeptical about this movie but ended up loving every moment of it. 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Video Game Movie Curse FINALLY BROKEN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy light am I in awe. The more I think about the movie as time passes the more I love it. Here are my two cents-First of all what you all heard about the length of the movie is true- it should have been AT LEAST a half an hour longer. Some of the things could have been explained more thoroughly, given more depth. This way it feels like it cuts off too fast from certain events.The MUSIC was bloody marvelous. Accompanies the ongoing action perfectly. Definitely going to get my hands on the full OST.Not even going to talk about the CGI, because everyone already said that it is mind blowing, which I COMPLETELY agree with. (Even though I watched it in regular 3D, not IMAX)Now, as for the story, for fans, there is a lot of things that are changed, aka not canon within the lore. The changes are not absurd and they fit pretty well with the movie. I actually ended up preferring some of the changes to the canon stuff, even though ONE certain deviation kinda left me unsatisfied.The action/fight scenes are done with an amazing level of detail to them.Even with the lack of detailed character introduction, you still easily connect to them. There are many emotional scenes, and there is a particular one that literally left me speechless and a bit teary- eyed. Overall, I rate it a solid 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WarCraft - a good movie but not a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read articles stating that critics disliked this movie. I've read user opinions who liked this movie. I've played WarCraft 1-3 and I very much liked those games, but never played WOW. So I've had minor (?) experience in this universe and I was curious about it.When I watched it I've seen minor issues including too much motion blur in distant shots when the camera was panning (which will probably be fixed by the Blu-Ray release or IMAX), and I didn't like those shots from the ground level. Those are just not good at all.However I liked the story, the characters, dialogues, and the king's final command in a very tough situation. The magic duels and the overall use of magic is pretty good in the movie. Maybe some of the humans' fighting sequences could be better. All in all I'd say this is a good start and I'd like to see how the story continues.</fullReview>

There were a few things what I didn't understand (we only saw warriors, a very few mages and a warlock - we didn't get any information about that black lady in the cube - how did Fel corrupt Medivh - How did Khadgar survive the Felpool - what was that pool in Medivh's tower - Khadgar's quote: ?Light in the dark, dark in the light" maybe he became the first priest?), but I'm very excited to see the next movie. I recommend this movie to all the fans out there. FOR THE HORDE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched it in IMAX 3D today. I was very worried that it would suck after being disappointed by the initial trailers. Everything looked so fake in the trailers that I had seen.Holy crap what a movie. The CGI was awesome. The orcs, dwarfs and high elves looked so lifelike. The actors also did a splendid job and Ragnar/Travis was legendary as usual. The magic spells felt powerful.Do not believe the film critics poor reviews of the movies. They are idiots. This movie is worth it!The only bad thing I can say is that it is a bit fast-paced. It is quite clear they had a hard time putting the entire of Warcraft 1 into a 2 hour movie. I think that a Director's Cut increasing the length of the movie by some 20-30 minutes would make it a marvel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Entertainment. Loyal to the video games.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie came out this morning here in Dubai and I had the chance to watch it at the first show. I went it without reading anything about the film at all to give it a fair chance. Here are my thoughts.The film has a strong start that tries to explain the reason for the Orcs presence in Azaroth. It's a good start. I thought the movie lost a bit of pacing in the first 45 minutes of the film due to (occasional) weak acting and casting. Overall it's not bad enough to put any one off. Just don't expect GoT standards of acting and direction.The 2nd and 3rd halves of the film are full of some very good action sequences and the film doesn't hold any punches when it comes to character deaths, decapitations and skull crushes, which I found good and loyal to the video game lore. There were a lot of locations that took me back to my WoW playing days such as IronForge, StormWind etc. It has some very obvious characters throughout the difference locations that only the true video game players would recognize and remember.Having played the games since the mid 90s, I have to say Blizzard has started the franchise off on a strong footing. It deserves a few sequels that will hopefully do justice to the entire WarCraft lore. Go watch it. And no, I'm not a studio plant.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to watch it on last night as it's on screen in Philippines, thanks goodness, after a long waiting ever since its announcement.The greatest thing that production team does on this movie is to keep every character 100% based on its game appearance, but the story line isn't convincingly good as Duncan Jones did before on his 2 previous movies. It would be better if separate into 2 parts, which offers more time to build up the character and their stories. Everything is happened too soon and explanation is too short. If you're a loyal fans and knows the original story, please forget about it before you watch.Hopefully there'll be an extension version like LOTR did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First chapter of a very promising epic saga. A must see for fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is happening says more about critics then the movie itself. Don't expect them to be able to tell a masterpiece from garbage, they never did. Need to jog your memory? Here's a list of movies that critics bashed upon release, I'll leave the conclusions to you:- CITIZEN KANE - "I thought the photography quite good, but nothing to write to Moscow about, the acting middling, and the whole thing a little dull..."- PSYCHO - "Gimmicky"- METROPOLIS - "It is a technical marvel with feet of clay, a picture as soulless as the manufactured woman of its story. [...] despite the fantastic nature of the story, it is, on the whole, unconvincing"- 2001 A SPACE ODISSEY - "sluggish, pretentious and artsy fartsy- THE SHINING - "the adaptation makes little sense", "massacres the original vision set forth in king's novel" (it even received 2 razzies nomination for worst director and worst actor)- APOCALYPSE NOW - "Apocalypse Now is a dumb movie that could have been made only by an intelligent and talented man."- ALL ABOUT EVE - "Its highly polished, often witty surface hides an unenterprising plot and some preposterous human behavior."- THE WIZARD OF OZ - "I sat cringing before [...] The Wizard of Oz, which displays no trace of imagination, good taste, or ingenuity... [...] I say it's a stinkeroo."- THE GODFATHER II* - "It's a Frankenstein's monster stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own."- THE BIG LEBOWSKI - "meandering, pointless, amounts to nothing"- FIGHT CLUB - "Rebel without a cause"- FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS - "simply unwatchable"other honorable mentions:- Blade Runner- The Rocky Horror Picture ShowAND.... (drum roll)- *STAR WARS* (1977) - "I sincerely hope that science and scientists differ from science fiction and its practitioners. Heaven help us if they don't: We may be headed for a very boring world indeed. Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its high-falutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality, without even a "future" cast to them." [...] "O dull new world! We are treated to a galactic civil war, assorted heroes and villains, a princely maiden in distress, a splendid old man surviving from an extinct order of knights who possessed a mysterious power called "the Force," and it is all as exciting as last year's weather reports.... Why, even the most exciting fight is an old-fashioned duel, for all that the swords have laser beams for blades...."I think this can be enough to get the idea, now go watch the movie and decide for yourself.As a side note, I can see how those who are not familiar with the saga universe could fail in grasping its value, and could feel bewildered, and could scorn it as "random bulls**t", but that's not the case, quite the opposite, Duncan knows what he's doing.For those unfamiliar with it, you need to know that the Warcraft games are a kitsch mishmash of Tolkien, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, everything that's fantasy and sci fi and comics...you name it. All with really exaggerated and over the top aesthetics. Nonetheless it has some "magic" quality that hooked million of us and made us dream. So no point in complaining about the "unrealistic armors" or the "derivative" nature of it and other stuff like that. That's Warcraft, and Duncan nailed it with astonishing skill.I also believe the two really dense hours of running time are not enough to clear the nature of what is being presented (characters and motives) to newbies. What you can see as newcomers is just a glimpse of what's coming, but if you can trust the director, you're gonna enjoy it (I suspect that the 40 mins of footage that were cut out could help making it more accessible to newcomers).Warcraft is not perfect, it has flaws (like many movies we now regard as masterpieces), but it is an impressive piece of work, it's innovative, it has a soul, it's got style, it's hugely fun. It's clearly just a setup for what's coming next, and I can't wait to see the rest.btw... extended edition now!!! ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One big shiny mess. But oh boy, is it shiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I didn't expect much from Warcraft:The Beginning. If it was a shallow fantasy action film, I would be content. But sadly Warcraft tries to be many things it is not.Let's start with the things that were done well, though. The film looks perfect. The designs of the characters, the CG effects on the fantastic beasts, everything looks superb. I myself have only played World of Warcraft for a few hours, and none of the original Warcraft games. but I do play my fair share of Hearthstone, the card game based on the world of Warcraft. And I can say that a lot of the fun comes from recognising the characters. Most of the designs are almost one to one with the original video game designs.Also, the opening scene is gorgeous, but it sets expectations too high, sadly. The rest of the movie doesn't live up to the very first scene.Now comes my biggest gripe with the film. With Warcrafts extensive lore, the makers of Warcraft:The Beginning tried to stuff as many aspects of this lore into the film, which doesn't work out that well. The story feels extremely rushed and left me with a face struck with disbelief. The viewer does not have enough time to develop a bond with the characters, which damages the story, as there are many events that are supposed to have a huge emotional impact on the viewer. And then, during the last quarter, everything goes to sh*t. I will not go into detail since I do not like to spoil anything, but oh man, is it bad.Overall, Warcraft:The Beginning is a pleasure for the eyes, and I'm sure that hardcore Blizzard fans will enjoy it, but if you are a regular movie goer without any knowledge of the world of Warcraft, you will most likely not find this film worth it. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another example that most critics do not know what they are talking about. The CGI was outstanding, the acting was pretty good and there were a lot of awesome nods to fans of the Warcraft series. My only complaint is that the movie was a tad too short, if it had an extra half an hour I think the plot could have developed better. I was very pleasantly surprised over how much I liked the movie after being completely "un-hyped" after the, in my opinion, terrible dubstep trailer and I'm praying for the movie to do great so we can see a sequel with Thrall. I recommend anyone who wants to see a solid movie to watch Warcraft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not going to rant, however, this review will be the first one I have ever written. I am no movie critic, just a fan of Blizzard and have been waiting for this film for over 10 years. It was just about one of the most disappointing films I had ever seen. Very well may have been my hopes were through the roof. Why was it awful for me, Blizzard had the ability to make 3 to 4 amazing lore films or even a harry potter series, but felt like they tried to cram 4 films in one. Graphics were stunning. Acting was rough, the script was poorly written, and the theme of the movie was OK. I rated this so low so Blizzard fans would read. I am a lover of all things Blizzard. There execution on video games has been terrific since I started playing warcraft 1 as a child, through now playing over watch, star craft 2, heroes of the storm, and diablo. I must admit I stopped playing WoW after Cataclysm. Thanks for reading, but was really bummed by this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember in 6th grade and all my classmates were playing WoW, we couldn't wait for the movie that was rumoured soon to be released. 10 years after I get to see it. I haven't played WoW in 2 years but I just had to see this. I owed the inner WoW-nerd that much. And luckily it was fantastic.I have given it 10 out of 10, but I really think you need to like the Warcraft-universe to enjoy this movie. I think it might be too confusing for a person who is unfamiliar with the universe to really like it. To get all the references that are in the movie. Having said that, it's a great story with few weak points.Also a shout out to the disrespectful "critics" that have given this movie such a low rating. Hopefully the box office will prove you wrong, cus this movie was good.I've read that people are not fan of the CGI. That I could not disagree more with. The orcs were done superbly. The magic was cool, although it did not remind of spells from the games. The cities and landscapes were fantastic and reminded a lot of the games. This done without trying too much to copy the game, but show itself as an independent movie.It's also fantastically set up for a second movie. And I really do hope that it will happen, because the Warcraft lore only gets better from here. It is hard to take such a huge story and turn it into a movie, but this must be the first time it's been done with success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed gem of the movie (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start: I have played Warcraft 2 as a kid and Warcraft 3 extensively in my teens. I have also played World of Warcraft for 2 years at release. Therefore I do have some bias, especially since I know most of the heroes and the locations in this movie. I will also not compare this movie to LotR or the Hobbit, because after seeing it, I don't think that these are comparable films. Wow.... This movie has definitely surprising. Whatever I expected to see from Warcraft the movie both the good and bad, my expectations were definitely subverted (both positively and negatively). Let me start with the overall impressions: the movie is solid good. If you've ever played Warcraft you should go and see that movie, just to experience this universe on screen, and, oh boy, is it a marvellous place to see. This movie will NOT review well, however, by the usual critics as it has a number of easy to pile upon issues which cannot justify an all-positive review. However, should we get a sequel this movie is just a few really bad things away from a marvellous experience and I'm sure they can get it right because the highs are very high but the lows are just a tad too low.Let me start with clear positives. Whatever the trailers showed, whatever your initial impressions of CGI and audio, it's all much better than you thought. Even at its most boring point the movie looks awesome the backgrounds are often flat-out gorgeous, the orcs look real, the human armour doesn't stand out from the background as I feared, even the CGI baby does just fine. Visually this movie is a treat and, as I stated previously, if you want to see Stormwind or Dalaran appear on big screen, they are a sight to behold. Costumes are amazing. Orcs are huge and feel real. Warcraft even makes magic look and feel real. What an immersive visuals and sound effects.I count is as a positive but it may be divisive for some: this movie is not for kids. This movie is brutal, serious and has scenes of torture, vicious deaths and just pure evil. I was not expecting this movie to have this level of seriousness and brutality. Apart from two clear comic relief scenes, this movie is making a very grounded and believable world out of magic portals, griffons and flying cities. No "Zug-Zug" orcs in here, only scary brutal (and sometimes honourable) orcs. This movie is tougher than Lord of the Rings by far and these is the most brutal fantasy probably brought to big screen (at least mainstream) so far.The overall plot in its design is also good. This is not a story which falls apart when you think about it. Everything sounds proper and character actions make sense. A lot of care went into this movie, and it's clear that the director Duncan Jones loves this franchise. Did I mention orcs were scary? Gul'Dan is the evilest villain that Marvel ever hoped to get into one of their movies. This shaman is just terrifying and a threat which is both palpable and his heinous acts always hit hard. The twist in the end which obviously sets up for sequels is very clever, the whole design of plot, the dialogue are all very well written.And now straight to what holds this movie back: while the plot is good in design, its execution is not stellar. The plot and dialogue are "too well written" to the point of being unrealistic at times. The movie has clear pacing problems: after a promising intro scene, the first act moves a bit too much between the locations. We go from Ironforge to Stormwind and then to meet the King in Goldshire (why??) within minutes. In the second act everything slows to a crawl and this is the single biggest flaw of this movie. Without anything to break a litany of dialogues I had time to actually notice other issues, the most important of which is that emotional scenes fall between "flat" and "utterly predictable". It speaks loudly when the most interesting and emotionally well-acted character is CGI orc Durotan. His scenes with his wife, his friend and his son are the emotional highlights of the movie. The human actors do very poorly in this regard. Garona and Lothar romance is a mistake and should've been at best a respectful friendship between warriors. I hope after Zootopia studios will understand that there are other forms of interaction between male and female leads other than romantic involvement. During the movie's second slow act it also become apparent that the whole seriousness of the movie may be a bit too much and a comic relief would be nice. Lothar went to Sarcasm 101 class, the skill he shows off often to his mage friend Khadgar. However, it's not nearly enough. Khadgar gets a single truly funny scene in the movie (hint: Polymorph) which begs the questions: why is there only one and why does it come so late in the movie?Music is a hit and miss. I was initially sold when I heard a hint of the Stormwind theme in the beginning of the movie ,but, once again, the more emotional tunes are missing from the orchestra. It tries to highlight the realism by going for "less is more" which definitely works during brutal (you gotta see it just for the fight scenes) combat, but the rest of the movie begs for more.And here it is. In a nutshell, the movie excels at visual design and combat scenes, but it's seriousness and slow pace can wear you down. It's a solid 7 at least, in my book, for non-warcraft fans and 9/10 for me personally because so many Warcraft things were done right. Don't go expecting the moon and you'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great fantasy flick, even for non-fans of the games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the movies I've seen this year, Warcraft sticks out like a sore thumb (and that's coming from someone who doesn't play the games). But like I'm emo and I really want that sore thumb to be there (terrible analogy).Warcraft has an great array of layered, sympathetic characters with deep personalities and motivations however Ben Schnetzer (Khadgar) stole the show for me. I had never heard of this guy before but now I can't wait to see where his career is headed. With that said, there is one actor that didn't sell for me and that's Travis Fimmel (Anduin Lothar). It's particularly frustrating because he is very much the main character and, while his character is very layered, he would have made for an excellent side character. But what really was the big kicker of this movie was the score. Game Of Thrones composer Ramin Djawadi once again delivers a powerful theme that's been stuck in my head ever since. Also, the visuals are great... most of the time. The digitally-created orcs are the most believable cgi creations I've seen since The Jungle Book (2016). However they do look like a digital creation in some scenes, particularly whenever they interact with an object. Overall, Warcraft was a great movie that does not disappoint and I would recommend it to any fantasy movie fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is great, so much action and amazing visuals. Also the story wasn't cliché as I was worried it would be. Acting was great and the story kept me to the last moment not knowing what was going to happen!! Critics need to stop destroying movies before their release, they did that with batman v superman and the movie really wasn't that bad.Please ignore the critics on this one and go see the movie it's completely worth it, specially for Warcraft fans.The movie is doing great all over the world so far and I hope in the US it will too.Seeing this movie I can really tell so much work and effort has been put to it and I really hope it succeeds so they can make more Warcraft movies specially the Arthas Story line!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted Warcraft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see this movie I wanted to experience Warcraft.I wanted to experience Warcraft-game-trailer-like action, spells and magic, Blizzard humor, beautiful scenery of Azeroth and its kingdoms, the old heroes of Warcraft, well-equipped and skilled human warriors vs brutish bloodthirsty orcs, a worthy lore adaption, and much more...And what did I get? I got all of it! If you like and understand fantasy games and movies, well, you're gonna have a blast. I see a lot of poor reviews from "professional" critics and all I can think is; they do not speak for the communities that are passionate about medieval-fantasy and gaming (or Blizzard/Warcraft) at all. They are so far off.To be honest though, I wouldn't actually give the movie 10/10 if it weren't for 2 things; the way it is executed and my passion about Warcraft, gaming and fantasy. There were a few things in the movie that I felt were slightly lacking. I mean, I would still have given it 8 or 9. I raise the score to 10 because of how the movie is executed. The fight scenes and battles were truly amazing, even though they're not as epic as they could have been. To make up for that, the movie provided an epic utilization of magic and spells - I was blown away by this! With everything considered, including that it is a game-to-movie adaptation, I can't help but to feel that it is somewhat revolutionary. To me it was an unique experience, just like when I watched movies/series such as the Matrix, the Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones for the first time. I was entertained on so many levels. I got goose bumps and teary eyes several times throughout the entire movie.I highly recommend it. Go watch it! 10/10 from me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to this movie with friends who play the game and friends who do not play the game. we all left with positive vibes and excitement. The movie is great the acting is very well done. I was surprised at how well they described the scenes for people who do not play the game while still leaving the audience curious to what is coming up in the next sequel. I usually take a smoke break or 2 during a movie, but the chain of events in this movie kept me pinned to my chair and time passed by so quick that i was disappointed when the movie was over. i was so ready to sit for another 2hrs to see what will happen next.Do NOT miss this movie definitely one of the best movies if not the best movie in 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the terrible reviews, and not being a fan of the World of Warcraft games, I went into this movie with very low expectations. Initially, the low expectations seemed to be appropriate. The movie introduces a number of different characters in a rather haphazard way, barely explaining what they do or why we should care.Similarly, there's very little world building in the beginning, and people are just expected to have a basic understanding of how things in the Warcraft universe fit together.Pretty quickly, though, the movie launches into a surprisingly compelling plot. Unlike many other movies in the genre (Lord of the Rings, for example) doesn't just focus on the human (or "good") side, but explains the back story of the Orcs, and gives them personality and motivation. After a lackluster start, the movie manages to give the characters at least some depth, and despite having a pretty large cast, almost everybody has at least some character development.Technically, this movie is flawless. The amount of work that must have gone into creating the Warcraft universe in this movie must have been incredible. The attention to detail is breathtaking. In scenes where dozens and dozens of Orcs are shown, every single one looks unique, and has his (or her) own characteristics and movements. The world in which the movie takes place is beautiful, and the fight choreographs are amazing.The colorful world in which the movie takes place defies the grim-dark trend in recent years, where even Superman movies have to be sad and dark and rainy, and that alone makes Warcraft a refreshing joy to watch.Despite being quite long, the movie always moves ahead at a brisk pace, and manages to convey a ton of plot.In short, this is a really well made, very entertaining movie. It has its flaws, particularly in the beginning, but I truly enjoyed every second of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well this is Awkward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who only tried the game once or twice or thrice, I surprisingly enjoyed this rather clunky yet strangely enjoyable film.It's a pretty straightforward narrative that it doesn't wastes its time introducing much of its world. You gotta accept whatever you see; whether it's warlocks or orcs or whatever, the movie just embraces its world and trusts the audience to follow through. It kind of makes sense why those who were familiar with the game appreciated this more than standard film critics, but again, I'm not a big fan of Warcraft, but I can get immediately invested to this fantasy world (and I like fantasy stuff.)Yeah, some moments feel a little too rushed, I don't want to use the term contrived since the movie does earn some of those moments, allowing itself to establish the arcs of these characters, but it's paced a little too quick that it doesn't spend much time to breathe for a little more gravity on its story choices. This is a big story sustained in a two hour runtime, so it's a tough choice.The aesthetics however, while often being criticized for being too video game looking (yeah, isn't it obvious?) actually looks pretty neat. At times, it looks sort of uncinematic, but the scale it provides just brings an exciting sense of adventure to it. The acting is fine, there are worse ways you can expect from a video game adaptation, but here, you can actually care for these characters.Warcraft is flawed for sure, but to what it is, it remains to be kind of fun. I can see why many aren't impressed for this film, so far, it will perplex to those who cannot dive into this mythology and again, the storytelling feels a little too quick, but the movie is careless to be concerned to those things that it has become both a benefit and a problem for its own good. As a first part of a series (hopefully) it's actually a solid try. There are problems you just can't avoid, but there are still a lot of admirable choices to appreciate, in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie unlike anything you've seen before!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went it to Warcraft with somewhat mixed expectations - partially low due to 'the video game curse', the heavy lore behind Warcraft (very, very little of it which I know) and also partially high because Blizzard (the company behind the franchise) makes amazing games with incredible stories and attention to detail and due to Duncan Jones', albeit small, prior efforts at directing movies. This movie is truly unlike you've ever seen before! Seeing a grand adventure world like this come sprawling to life being made mostly with CGI and motion capture is utterly amazing. I know, I know.. Too much CGI is never a good thing, and I'm usually in that camp too, but put these orcs in Lord of the Rings costumes and makeup then Duncan Jones would never have been able to capture the essence of their 'humanity', the feelings wouldn't show and alas they would be nothing but unrelatable scary monsters. The point of this film is to do exactly the opposite. Duncan and the actors behind the motion capture manage to hit the nail on this one! The story is great, grand and adventures. It feels like a proper fantasy through and through, epic in scale and enormous in stakes. One can't help but end up rooting for both sides of this conflict. Magic is everything in a fantasy, and finally getting to see what a true wielder of the arcane arts is capable of is like a nerd wet dream come true. Gosh how I love the magic and the sheer scale of it in this movie is incredible. It is finally so good to see it done on a large and forceful scale in a movie! I didn't stop smiling once during this movie, Utterly entertaining and amazing eye candy.The movie isn't pure goodness though - Warcraft is filled to the brink with characters, some are properly introduced some aren't, some with motivations which aren't fully explained and the lack thereof can make one a confused. The amount of characters being balanced in this movie are a bit too many, but then again, trying to please an already established and demanding fan base can't be anything but tricky. The specifics of the lore are impossible to learn through the movie, so be ready to do some digging once you've seen it. It is action packed! Both for the better and worse. There are few times where this movie really slows down and lets you wallow in this beautiful and realized world, which is a shame. It can really take your breath away be it by exhaustion or the vistas. I really enjoyed this movie. It's not Lord of the Rings, it's not the Hobbit and it is not trying to be neither of those movies. This is a fantasy movie unlike anything we've ever seen before and I can't wait to see more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Warcraft, but i started late when the Warcraft 3 was released. In this review i will not spoil any story-line in Warcraft, i just wanna show how i like and dislike this movie in my view and my people's view ( i mean my Indonesian brethren )what can i say ? excellent or awesome ? i think it is excellent. the video angle is awesome which can make every single scene of this movie become desktop wallpaper. the act of the actor and actresses are natural, seems like they studied hard every scene. the graphic is so cool, it could make me amazed every single scene, and sometimes i dropped my jaws while put my hands on my cheeks because it was so fantastic.when i stepped out the theater, i overheard some of the viewers said that the story-line was not good. i think because my Indonesian people is not accustomed to the Warcraft lore and folk. i think they are same like me, started to play Warcraft when it was already the third game. which means that they skipped a lot of story behind it. we (Indonesian) maybe expected that we could watch Warcraft 3 or DoTA heroes played in this movie.Overall, Good Job Blizzard and any others that involved in making of this movie. we are so glad that finally Warcraft is being taken into a great and awesome movie. we expect more, we want sequel. tee-he</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprise hit, especially for the unknown!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay so I am a Warcraft fan and as I went in I already knew most of the original story and I had seen a ton of footage from trailers, short clips and whatnot. Now being totally honest, that was my first mistake.But hey I didn't realize that until after the credits started rolling! As a fan I kept thinking and thinking and then thinking ahead of what was coming. I told myself before watching it that I would go in with a clear mind and just enjoy it as a new fantasy movie. Which I tried, but ... yeah.Well anyway. AS A FAN I came out of it with very mixed feelings. I already knew from Duncan that certain things had changed, so that didn't surprise me. But what surprised me was the actual changes. One thing for sure: if you are a lore freak, you will probably dislike these changes A LOT.However. I do think that these changes were needed to make the original story into a movie. Some changes were required to make the viewer feel this and that.Let me move on about all of that now. I got so many things to say, but to keep it short, here is a list of flaws I felt during the movie: The movie is too short. This leads into the next point which is... its length meant that certain characters I would loved more of, didn't get enough screen time. They cut a lot of scenes which we had previously seen in trailers and such. Which means... we NEED a director's cut!Yeah that's about it.My fave characters from the movie was, surprisingly, Garona and Khadgar!Oh yeah, the important thing which is why I wrote this. This movie will be most enjoyable if you are not a fan of Warcraft. Yeah, I am being serious! I watched this movie along with 2 friends. One is a fan, while the other wasn't. And guess what? My non-Warcraft friend loved it so much! And I am so happy for him for that and kinda jealous too! When I asked for scores, he gave it 9/10!To end this review/reaction: we need a sequel. A certain thing in this movie brings the hype for a sequel to the clouds! And it needs to happen ASAP! Duncan get on with it! :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute disaster in acting, script, plot and original spirit of the game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, i still play the Warcraft 2This movie is total waste of time and efforts and viewers monies. Blizzard miserably failed to find a proper director and someone who knows how to write script and find actors. What is even worse is that original spirit of the game is completely destroyed - you have the same setting but nothing else - only few characters and names are present and rest is omitted.You have no scout towers or cannon towers, you have no catapults or inventors, no battleships or flying machines, no 2-headed oggres (!) or axethrowers, no elven archers. All actors (except may be the female orc - and she is also based on famous Zoe Saldana's Avatar character type) are complete miscast as have no charisma whatsoever - king is stupid, Lothar is helpless (great warrior - why on earth!?), only Guldanis evil and picturesque enough - but why he has no horse?!?!?!?! Death Knights MUST HAVE HORSES! All magic is casted in different way and even obvious blizzard at the canyon battle is not used. Durotan looks good but thats little comfort.Plot has huge holes which are not explained in no way. The young pupil of the Mage school who is saving the world few times has supposedly left the school - but where are the rest of the students? Why the Keeper has no supporters at all? The group of 6 mages on tower later on takes no part in Azeroth defence - why? Elves and others also ignoring the request for help - why again? No explanationBiggest problem is the complete ignorance of the physics - with orc twice the size of the humans, their melee combat is completely unrealistic and pointless - foot knights should be thrown aside with one hit and plot provides no explanation why it doesn't happen. I could go on, but enough is said - Blizzard didn't give the movie to Uwe Boll for a good reason not to trash it, but their final choice delivered exactly the same result - its a crap not worth watchingAnd yes - as comparison is inevitable - its WAY WORSE than Lord of the Rings, absolutely no matchSo beware - we didn't quit the cinema only due to the kids, but quite a lot of my friends did leave earlier</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That was just GREAT! 10 years of waiting this movie, and fully satisfied!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first review ever, and it's about my lovely WarCraft. 26 May this long-awaited picture was released in Russia. We booked tickets for 3 days before the premiere, and barely had time, as more than half of it was already sold out.So, what can i say...The movie was just fantastic! I am speaking as a WoW fan, since me and my husband been playing WoW from 2008, and every year we were waiting when the film will be shot, based on this wonderful gaming universe. And finally its done. This great picture absolutely worth it to wait almost 10 years. From the first seconds of the film until the very end, there was no any detail that i would not like. I've been sitting with my mouth opened...and getting excited with everything i see on the screen (that was IMAX 3D btw). I could see every thread in the hood of Gul'dan, that was sooo cool!And I loved every every every character. Each actor has completely coped with his role, IMHO. But most of all i loved Travis Fimmel's character Anduin Lothar. I never saw other films with this actor before, i just know that he played Ragnar in the Vikings. But omg, in this movie he made me fell in love with his character (not with actor himself :)). I think, this is top acting, when someone falls in love with the hero, which he embodied in the movies. Travis breathed life into the Anduin, has made him so gorgeous and charismatic. Very much hope that there will be continued. I will go see WarCraft 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. etc...People of the world, who have long loved WarCraft universe, and the newcomers too, let's make the box office :)), we can do it, and it's worth to be done, because there's soooo much interesting ahead ))And after all, I want to add, that before I knew only two coolest film adaptation of video games, for me it's Resident Evil (2002) and Silent Hill (2004). Now, I hope, the beginning of a great era of the World Of WarCraft!Sorry for bad English. And I wish you all good and enjoyable movie watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, yet spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I just saw the movie in IMAX 3D. The theater was almost entirely full, and it seated about 550 people!First of all, the CGI and visuals were amazing and all the orcs were spectacular. The music and cinematography was great and some scenes were so epic it's hard to describe. Some of the moments in the movie were among the best I've ever seen, and they really drew you in. Blew my mind really, I was hyped.The acting was decent by most, and I enjoyed most of the characters. Gul'dan and Durotan were probably my two favourites. The movie really did have many awesome characters, but it's too bad that they weren't fleshed out more. Garona was probably the most fleshed out, and that is also why you sympathized with her.The story was good, but very disjointed. Parts were messy and the editing was seriously not good. I mean, the scenes themselves were mostly well done, but they felt very unorganised, and different from each other. Besides needing more character development, and background story, the movie needed a significantly more cohesive and streamlined expression. It felt like a lot was left on the cutting room floor and you could tell they have been working on it for a long time. In the latter part it really picked up and the movie seemed more deliberate with longer scenes, and very thrilling action. The griffin was badass!It really did stay true to the Warcraft universe and I loved that. It was very beautiful and yes, heartfelt. The emotions of the characters shined through, even if they did not have a lot of time to build them up.Personally, as a whole, I rate it a 7.5/10. Could have easily been higher if the movie was more conjoined. Easily.As a spectacle It was truly amazing. As I said in the beginning, some scenes are unlike anything I've seen before. I will definitely watch it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining summer blockbuster with some flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this short, because people don't want to read long posts. Here goes: The good: + Visuals, stunning. + Acting was OK. I liked that it was serious in parts. Everything must not be "funny" and Disney all the time. I think it took itself less seriously than The Hobbit though.+ The action -especially when Gul'Dan was involved - was really epic and well choreographed. + If you like magic, you get plenty of mage action in here. + Obviously some fan service here and there. I heard lots of people laughing and clapping hands throughout the movie. + The set- up for the sequel was nice. The bad: - Pacing. The beginning is very fast. The first 20 minutes jump back and forth between locales. I'd rather have an slower pacing in the beginning, and then go all-in later.- Some of the characters have very interesting back stories (especially Khadgar and Garona), but they're skimmed over. - We never really get to see much of the orcish world. - The movie feels a bit short. You could easily add 20 minutes without the audience feeling bored. So, all in all: Are the critics right and the audiences wrong? Well, I do think that some critics should question themselves. This movie CAN NEVER GET 1/5. That is blasphemy. A lot of love and care was put into this movie. My girlfriend, who knows nothing about Warcraft, thought it was a good time. Solid 3,5/5 from me. A movie worth watching in cinemas. You will most likely have a good time. It's no masterpiece, but it's an entertaining summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

Acting is great, special effects too. The plot is just what you expect it would be.I mean the only regret you will have at the end of the movie is that the lore of Warcraft is so huge that you feel that this movie is just an introduction and you want to see more and more...In fact they could do 20 movies easily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like games or fantasy you will love this film. It's not lord of the rings, not Game of thrones. It's something by in and of itself. It's a fantasy film that raises the standard for fantasy films and especially video game ones(not that these standards were very high). The story is coherent and easier to follow than most movies of it's genre. To set expectation a little. It's not a Oscar movie and that is not to be expected from a summer blockbuster based on a indie game from 1994 (no, not the WORLD OF Warcraft, "Warcraft: Orcs and Humans"). The visuals are the most gorgeous in any movie yet. The action is also phenomenal and has some brutal moments. The best part yet is that the movie is a contradiction (some orcs not being bad guys) to most fantasy making it controversial to a fantasy purist, however for most others this will be a breath of fresh air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do yourself a favour and go see it in a cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that although I have of course heard of the World of Warcraft, I've never played it.The film is visually stunning. Just breathtaking. This just simply cannot be stressed enough. I've seen it tonight and am planning on seeing it again tomorrow. The first 3D film I've seen which deserves to be called 3D (as the entire, and I mean entire film feels like it's happening right in front of you and does not feel like you just have one picture on top of the other, masquerading as 3D) - this needs to be seen in a cinema. Cinematography and camera positioning is as good as it gets - basically it wipes the floor with Captain America: Civil War (which I liked) and anything else you can think of. Trailer does not do it justice. At all.The plot is relatively easy to follow but you do need to follow it as it is not a typical blockbuster where you can almost always tell where the film is going (things fall into place after the first 20 minutes which you'll spend mostly drooling at the graphics anyway, bring tissues). There's an actual story, character development, things happen for a reason. No plot holes that I've noticed, no deus ex machina moments, the film flows without ever being predictable (at least for someone who hasn't played the World of Warcraft) which is not an easy thing to achieve.Acting is very good and the ending is satisfying.I have no idea why so many critics didn't like it but don't allow yourself to be mislead by them. Go and see it. I normally see two films a week in my local cinema and this is the first time ever that I've witnessed the audience going into a spontaneous applause at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first epic drop over again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all had hopes, we all prayed for so long. That this would not be a failure. While wow is decaying, how could blizzard step up to make a movie worthy of the warcraft universe. But they did. /clap /dance /cry /lieThey did exactly what they were supposed to be doing. The CGI is just spot on, and gives you the epic feeling you first had with the warcraft/wow cinematics. The spells are amazing, although i'm not going to spoil which ones are used in the film. One key feature to the epicness of the whole show, was the relationship between Durutan and Draka. The orcs where not just a violent race (but violent they were), they were also loving and funny to each other.This filmseries will bring a whole new generation into to warcraft universe. Right now i have the feeling as if I'm was seeing Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings for the first time. Can't wait till the next one, see you in Azeroth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just came back from the WARCRAFT movie premiere with my guild (germany).First of all: It was fantastic! I felt being home every second of the movie. The settings, the scenarios and details couldn't have been better. The CGI was except for 2/3 small scenes the best I've ever seen (Can easily compete with Avatar and Planet of the Apes).The only criticism I have is that Travis Fimmel, who is really great in Vikings, kinda seemed not to fit into Azeroth (He actually stated in a interview that he felt very uncomfortable filming with green screens)My favorite characters of this movie are Durotan, Orgrim and Khadgar. The villains were also very believable. Ghuldan was frickin bad-ass and our other beloved Warlords had there moments too!There were some small lore-adjustments for the sake of better translating the game into the movie. But nothing game-changing or important! As a lore-expert (WoW Veteran, played the RTS series, watched all Nobble-videos and read most of the books) I was totally satisfied since Duncan included all major events in the movie sticking to the original game-lore! I just sat there waiting for the next major plot-point and Duncan delivered perfectly!The movie was loaded with game references and eastereggs from the MMORPG and the audience loved it. Even the non-players were amazed...so don't hesitate bringing your friends that never tried Warcraft before! The movie could have been slightly darker, but the fighting scenes were already borderline for the age-restriction that the movie got. The tone was similar to the Avengers 2 movie (partially humorous partially serious).I rate this movie 9/10 as a Warcraft Fan. If I leave all the references aside that are made for Fanservice it is still a very solid Fantasy-Movie, so I'm going with 7/10 for regular movie-watchers! -&gt; Think the movie will settle at 8/10 overallHave fun everyone. I'm waiting for the BluRay now and pray for a trilogy announcement</fullReview>

The graphics is like nothing you ever seen before. it's taking you to a fantastic journey to the epic world of Warcraft. the movie leave you hungry to know more about the world of Warcraft. And finally i can say , An epic masterpiece &amp; i really hope to watch the sequels soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You think Warcraft is a bad movie? Just like allllll other video- game adaptions? (rly?) You think all these bad critics out there are right? The film is just that ~30/100 critics-score worth.Well, just let me say it as simply as it is: It's not!Me and my friends, all non-WoW-players but with experience in the old Warcraft-series and recently Hearthstone (besides me, hardcore WoW- nerd :D) seen it today at the midnight-premiere and we were completely satisfied. There is no humour in the movie? Eeermmm... what? There are soooo many eastereggs from the game, even Murlocs! Thats right man, MURLOCS! The cast is bad? Sry bro, but your mama is bad ;) The cast is superb. Maybe i'm biased, but i just love Travis Fimmel! And Paula Patton is awesome too. Even Khadgar, who was a little bit 'difficult' for me, when i saw the trailers, was better and better fitting. Don't wanna write a full novel here, but just remind yourself: BOX OFFICE counts! We all wanna see Part 2 and Part 3. Make this happen guys, people around the world, unite for good fantasy stuff. If you rly don't like Warcraft or the trailers, then be it. But else, if you are still thinking, give the movie a shot. Its worth it. Honestly, i would rate the movie in between 7-9, not 10. But i have the feeling, the hyped people have to do something against these abstruse bad-rated critics. Greetings from Germany ;) Sry for bad englando.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I cried twice, oh my... The feels...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Got a vague spoiler ahead, reader discretion is advised.I was mega pumped to see the movie. It was an early morning, the first session in our cinema. As the opening title rose under the war drums, I began to maniacally cry... 12 fu*king years... I was ready for a bad flick, thanks to rotten early critics. The first 20 minutes were real fast paced. As a fan of WC3. I knew some of the early war stories, but not so in details. I never got lost throughout the narrative. It was almost solid, I'd say 89% solid. The rest is mist of self-understanding and "figuring". Which is good, for once I can watch a movie again and see something that I missed or miss understood. Let's talk visuals for a start. I'll be very honest. For the budget of 100 mills, it was overdone. Which is good, means they put an enormous amount of extra effort into this. Orcs were fluid and gave a very hard alien emotional drive throughout entire screen time. I felt a hunger for power from them, love for its own kind except for one individual, no fear, crazy mind-boggling strength. They had sympathetic feelings to viewers. I felt that orcs story was on par with the human, but it's strange to explain... Basically, orcs hit your feelings in the first half and human side catches towards the climax of the picture. Characters were all (except for poor Khadgar) an A+, 10 out of 10, you name it. Here is a thing to all those folks that got no clue about the lore... These humans are not from Earth, they are from Azeroth. So they might age slower. That's why I was keen to accept the casting choice for Medivh and The King. I'll add that horse is not a normal cause, it's a different universe. Deal with it, "critic". I think you'll know why Khadgar didn't make the cut, once you'll see the film. Now let's get to the juicy stuff. Cons. For me, there were only three... Three to five scenes had a motion blur effect on big structures, most of the scenes are still, but at those moments you felt the cracking budget on the CGI. No words, just Khadgar! And here's my nifty spoiler and the main con, the reason why I cried the second time. When a certain main character dies in the midst of battle. And you know this amazing film is going to be over soon. You'll step out from the big dark room into the light of day. Feelings shockering through your skin and bones, knowing that they went all in on this. For you, for the fan, for a casual moviegoer. This piece of art was made with love and care. Which is very rare in this day and age. This is darker than Civil War. This is better written than BvS. This got better-unclichéd action than X-men. This is my contender as the best summer blockbuster of 2016. And it deserves its sequel. Mic dropped...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie adaptation of a great game series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the movie in the cinema here in Manila and I must say I was happily surprised. Unlike the so called 'professional' critics I really enjoyed the plot, characters and visuals of this exciting film.I'm not sure what the critics expected, perhaps another fantasy classic? Maybe they have been too spoiled over the last few years by fantasy masters such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Game of Thrones series and even the enjoyable (but rather underwhelming) Hobbit series.Video game adaptations to the big screen rarely turn out good. This movie is an exception. It's not a cinema classic by any means, but you won't regret paying full price at your local theatre either. I agree that some of the acting could have been better and that some parts of the story could have been fleshed out more. Considering the budget they had to work with, however, I'm still completely convinced that the production team did a sterling job. Enjoy the movie for what it is: a faithful adaptation of Warcraft's early history with decent actors and delightful visuals. Go watch it, you won't regret it.For the Alliance! For the Horde!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Duncan Jones Delivers Once More!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the theater not expecting much, having seen the trailer, I wasn't pretty impressed, but having seen Moon and Source Code, I wanted to give it a chance, despite having low expectations. Having seen it now, I'm glad that this movie proved me wrong. Warcraft isn't without flaws, it has many Characters, and not enough time, I would've loved to see more of each one of them, some characters shine more than other, but they are nonetheless all beautifully written, the story is character driven, initially I thought it'd be generic, but that wasn't the case, many twists and turns happen throughout the film, although some can be predicted, they keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to know more. Duncan Jones with the limited time he had in the movie succeeded in building us a rich world and kept us interested in it. The CGI and visuals are astounding, heck the movie is worth it for them alone, and that's coming from someone who is skeptical of CGI, some shots are too beautiful to describe especially the ones while flying on the gryphon. As for the Orcs, CGI is so well done with astounding attention to detail, As you are watching you forget that the orcs are actually CGI, that's due to both the writing of the orc character and the attention to detail. There are some shots better than others, but that's to be expected in any film that has excessive use of CGI. In short, the movie has the action, the excitement, the story. It is never dull, and will keep you interested, all I wanted more was a longer running time because at parts it felt rushed and has some cliff hangers, but in overall it is a great movie, and I really hope for more sequels, Duncan you did it again!</fullReview>

The movie makes must be from Ford engineers. The way the animation and depth of the story are the best of any movie ever. I compare this film to the Stockyard Cafe's gravy, simply the best in the world. I am serious, this movie is so good and the game is too. I know, because it is the best game in the universe. Waiting for the sequel will be very difficult. I expect to write a review shortly after the title appears on IMDb. Interesting fact, the movie and game are so good the Asian countries have addiction clinics for both. Go watch this film it will be more successful than Batman v Superman.</fullReview>

We're not movie buyers (we generally watch something only once), but we paid full price for this one. I wish we had gone to see it in theaters, but we, unfortunately, listened to the critics. Duncan Jones is an amazing director and the world was absolutely beautiful. I didn't find it lagging at all or lacking content, which I've heard from several other viewers. The pacing was great, and there were no dull moments, but somehow he still managed to fully develop the characters. I would absolutely go see a sequel. I definitely encourage anyone to watch this movie, and if you love it, like we did, then buy it so maybe we can get a sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft is a fantasy film directed by Duncan Jones and stars Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Toby Kebbell, Ben Schnetzer, Robert Kazinsky and Daniel Wu. The film is based on the Warcraft video game series and portrays the encounters between humans and orcs taking place in different locations that have been set by the video game series before. I personally absolutely loved Warcraft from beginning to end, the incredible visuals that are perfectly mixed in with the amazing written story make up for one of the best summer blockbusters in a long while. All the actors do a fantastic job here, with Travis Fimmel as the leading character on the human side, who is really good on the role. I personally bought Dominic Cooper as the king and Ben Foster as the guardian who gave a very intimidating performance. On the orcs side the motion capture performances were absolute perfection, with the amazing Toby Kebbell on the lead as Durotan. Without spoiling anything I was really caught off by surprise by the amount of deaths of the main characters on this film. I have never played any of the video games and I had no idea what I was walking in to but that really raised the stakes up for the finale against the ever so brilliant villain of the film Gul'dan portrayed by Daniel Wu. The soundtrack composed by Ramin Djawadi is also beautiful and epic at times. It fit in with the battles perfectly all throughout. Overall I truly enjoyed this film and my only issues with it is that the beginning is kind of slow but everything else was amazing and just breathtaking to look at. I am a big fan of the film and I hope there will be a sequel in the near future to arrive.</fullReview>

So if it do fits into the Warcraft world I can't say.What I can say is that it was a marvelous flick. I was immediately into the story and characters and it never bored me at all. The effects are really stunning and the world of the humans and the orcs does really work. If you are into fantasy then this is really a must see. It's a bit heavier then the Lord Of The Ring flicks or The Hobbit flicks because here you do have gory shots like heads being axed, or heads being smashed by the orcs.If this really is the beginning then I'm looking forward for what's to come.

		<fullReview>When I went to see Warcraft, I had high hopes for it, and it's an OK film. I think the critics treated it a little too harshly, but it is quite a big disappointment, considering how many people play the game. If you're friend says "It's the new Lord of the Rings, best film ever!", don't trust him/her. LotR was a masterpiece. The Hobbit was quite good. This? This is derivative, mind-numbing, cgi-heavy and at times plain boring. It's got its good moments, but it's not worth watching. If you were expecting grandiose LotR-esque battles, then you're wrong. All you get is a mildly cool orc vs orc showdown, a short fight in a ravine, and a 1 minute long excuse for a climax. And while the effects are good, the orcs just don't match those of Lord of the Rings. Pretty ashamed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good concepts but messy execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of pros and cons to Warcraft. The movie unfortunately struggled to communicate a lot of ideas very quickly and as a result it came across as very rushed and lacking in depth. The characters aren't really given enough time to be established and as a result many of their interactions came across as forced. It was difficult to relate to the characters because their motives aren't given an opportunity to be fleshed out. I think it's a shame because a lot of the ideas were actually good. The use of magic within the story worked quite well and rather than characters simply firing off random spells without explanation, only a few spells are used but they are explained, each one has a distinct purpose and is used in multiple ways. The plot itself wasn't bad but the events themselves seemed disjointed and poorly paced, so as a result it was hard to invest in what was happening. While I have a reasonable understand of the Warcraft story and I have played most of the games I still found it a bit difficult to get familiarized with exactly what was happening. Characters seemed to jump from place to place without a lot explanation as to what they were really doing. There is no sense of scale to the world because everyone seems to get everywhere nearly instantly without any sense of time passing. The human battle strategies are poorly explained and the outcome of many of the battles doesn't seem to make any sense. For a movie that is based off of a series of strategy games it would have been a lot better if battle strategy actually had more relevance to the plot.Many of the relationships between the characters also come across as unnatural and unearned. There are multiple betrayals in the plot but when they happen it doesn't really have a lot of impact because the time wasn't given to establish the initial bonds between the characters. Twists and turns in the characters relationships seem to happen overnight, without a lot of explanation as to how and why their feelings change. Overall, I don't think the movie is as bad as a lot of critics have indicated. Warcraft at least aspires to tell a story that is more than just a straight up action movie. There was a plot here that could have been quite good. The problem was that it was very rushed, the events and characters were poorly established and the ideas aren't really explained in any depth. The rapid pace of events offered very little time to establish its characters and sink into its word and lore. If the movie had better pacing and showed those establishing moments in a more immersive way it would have elevated the quality of the movie substantially. The Blizzard cinematics do an excellent job of doing that, so it really is a shame that the movie failed to provide that same excellent sense of tone and atmosphere. I would give this movie 5.5/10 it is slightly above average. It had a lot going for it in terms of ideas but the execution fell short in many different areas. It's worth watching if you are hungry for a decent fantasy movie, if not I would say the movie probably won't do much for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good: Warcraft certainly has its fair share of good sides. The movie looks really good and has a solid plot with some comedy thrown in for good measure. Many scenes, if taken separately, are very enjoyable to watch, and going by the reactions of people who know the parent franchise better than me there are more than enough nods in their direction to make this movie worth their time.The Bad: Unfortunately, if you are not among those who know the world of Warcraft by heart, you can not help but feel quite left behind by the lackluster storytelling. While the general structure of the plot seems to work well enough for its purpose the movie does little to actually build something compelling with it. The action jumps all over the place and gives you little reason to care about any of its protagonists or antagonists. They are just... there, doing a good job sometimes, mind you, but in the end I felt like I had just watched one of those cutscene collections on YouTube, disconnected from any character development that would have been part of the gameplay between the scenes.The Ugly: I have to give this movie a 5 out of 10 even though a 6 might actually be the more accurate choice. The reason for this are the spades of people who are apparently big fans of the franchise and gave it a 10 out of 10 which it in no way warrants or deserves. It is still enjoyable if you focus on single scenes, but as a complete movie it fails in several regards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In need of a better justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft is badly in need of a director like Peter Jackson. You see what Peter Jackson did to The Lord of the Rings franchise, Duncan Jones doesn't even come close to nailing. The World of Warcraft is brimming up with extraordinary stories that are in need of better helming, and even though Duncan Jones is a good director, he ends up moderating the game.SHORTCOMINGS OF WARCRAFT The movie picks off at an interesting juncture, right amidst a rad depiction from an Orcish vantage with a badass music to kick-start. But then soon its shortcomings come sieving to the banks. The first amongst it was the way the frames were being changed. Artful as Duncan used to be, in awesome movies like the Moon and Source Code, you don't really expect him to hit that low. Right betwixt a good scene he would chop off a frame, changing it without caring to sustain viewer emotions. At one point it seemed fine, but then it kept happening throughout the flick.To top that all not everybody is into Warcraft. So, if you are making a movie about a game that has millions of fans, you really need to start off slow, gradually trying to allure non-fans into this majestic world you are trying to create. Warcraft fails to do that. Half of the time you aren't even aware, what's what and who's who.No doubt there are mesmerizing scenes in the movie that will leave you wanting for more, but the tale somehow gets clouded owing to a persisting disconnect. CGI is really good but the screenplay has nothing to offer. The editing is quite poor as well. Plot is awesome but you just wish it was manifested in a better way.SPOILER PORTAL AHEADTravis Fimmel was a brilliant blend of badass and finesse as he takes the character of Lothar to great heights. Paula Patton as Garona is good too. Ben Foster does a great Guardian Medivh who unfortunately keeps succumbing to weakness.Focusing on the high points of the movie, the clash between Durotan and Gul'dan was a good one. Also, whenever Lothar came into the picture with his sword, you would instantly know that an Orc is going to be ripped apart. The part where he tries to save his son by doing everything he could to get through Guardian's magic was magnificent. At times camera takes a satellite view showing wars across the Warcraft realm which is reminiscent of the game.THE FINAL HUMAN VERDICTDespite all the good stuff it had, you end up overlooking everything owing to the sour taste it leaves you with in your palate. I really wish a good director picks Warcraft up to make its future sequels.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(PM) Nice Popcorn Movie. Don't expect muchMovie Category: Action / Adventure / Fantasy?Warcraft is a high fantasy film is full of heart and emotional sensitivity. The heart that dosen't make it sappy, but the heart that makes it grounded and viscerally meaningful. ?The graphics and motion-capture special effects are beautifully realized, dynamic in it's detail. ?If there is a sequel to this movie, which is suggested in the film, I would see it, but could still be happy without a sequel. WRITING ?Although this movie is based on a video game the overall story is rather pedestrian. The team of writers which included: (Chris Metzen; Duncan Jones; and Charles Leavitt, chose to be more pedestrian and simple, versus imaginatively nuanced and complicated. The dialogue isn't boring or lazy, it was just professionally average.BEST &amp; WORST PARTS ?The best part of this film is the emotional maturity given to the characters. To be able to connect on an emotional level with beings that resemble The Hulk is remarkable.?The worst part of this film is Paula Patton. Her character is suppose to be the magnetic element and nervous system for the movie. Unfortunately due to the limits on her acting abilities, I was stuck watching her and wondering how much better this movie would have been if Paula had more acting range. I give her credit for branching out of her comfort zone of romantic comedies. Trying new genres is good for actors, but what is also good for actors are acting classes and acting coaches. Ms. Patton needs BOTH.Award Season Consideration ?Should be nominated for: &#x25e6;Best MakeupWho should see this movie? ?Warcraft Gamers ?Teenagers ?Fantasy Fans ?Combat / Warrior Fans ?Scorcery / Wizardry FansMOVIE SUPREME COURT ***** Noah Roberson ***** Creator / President / Film CriticYou Tube Channel -- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe08sWD5k1tJjW-bOqJoIZAFacebook Group -- https://www.facebook.com/moviesupremecourt/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will be short. Its a good movie, really enjoyed it and recommend it. I liked the story, effects, crew... I really don't understand why the critics are so harsh with this movie. I mostly decided to post this cause some of the critics were really annoying. It seems like those people really didn't want to let themselves enjoy it at all but just blackmail it. They should be ashamed. My friends and people who watched it were also impressed. The movie isn't perfect and the story progression can seem too fast, but this is just a small thing that I can find as a flaw. I also find very interesting how they added small details for the fans of the game. They will love it. I am really hoping they continue with the next movie. Good job people! You really tried and I am sure that people will reward it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one thing that I expect from a good fantasy movie is to transfer me to that faraway place where magic is possible and fantastic creatures are free to roam the land. And this one only partially succeeded at this. Funny thing is that CGI parts look much better then the live ones. The thing that this movie is chronically missing is shooting at locations (something where LOTR, for example, excelled and became legendary for). Most of the live scenes are shot in front of the green screen and that is painfully apparent. Still I think that it will serve as a good opening for the beginning of the franchise and I hope that they will do a better job in their next attempt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recaptures what made Warcraft Great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film expecting to go home and tell my friend it was as bad as we all though it was going to be. I myself have despised Blizzard the last few years and to come out and say just how great this film is should really speak to anybody reading this how much this film honored the source material. And how all around amazing it really was.This film gives us the story of the first game that we only knew through lore in the games. Only minor changes to make the story work better as a film narrative. The attention to detail is stunning. All scenery is taken right out of the game. Stormwind looks exactly like the Stormwind you have either traversed or raided in WoW.This is the film that fans have wanted. Even if you are not a fan of the games I highly recommend this to fantasy film lovers. As P.S. to all fans watch for some of your old favorite weapons from WoW scattered throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have NO idea why supposed 'professional movie reviewers' gave this movie bad reviews - this was a great movie! This was wonderful for both World of Warcraft fans as well as for fans of the fantasy genre. Really good special effects (I especially liked the magic effects). Casting was true to form as well - very much like what I've seen in the animated shorts from Blizzard but on a grander scale. I would've loved to have seen 'more', so perhaps a longer movie (although I hear the studio made Blizzard cut 40 minutes from the movie so I'm hoping for a good extended edition). Loved the 'extras' for the fans! The orcs, and in particular, Guldan, looked fantastic! Blizzard, I hope you make more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warcraft universe is full of lore. So many characters, stories and connections between them so for someone not familiar to any of the lore you are learning for the first time so many names and characters that already has a history. I played World of Warcraft for many years, about 300 days total played time, but i think like most players i wasn't that much into the lore except for the basics. So for me it was also a lot to take in. Also i think most players like me are more familiar to the lore in the expansions "The burning crusade" and "Wrath of the Lich king". This movie would have been much better if it was a series, because of the amount of lore, but i have to give it to Duncan for not simplified it all to much and letting it be more of a movie for fans of Warcraft.There is so much potential for multiple squeals but i have a feeling the general public wont give this movie and franchise a good review. Also you have to remember that large part of the world of Warcraft player base like to complain. I hope reviewers can look at the movie for what it is worth to its target audience.As for the quality of the movie. I was happy with the style and quality of the graphics in this. You can easily tell that almost everything except non-cgi characters where cgi. But to me that was fine, it was well made environments that kept true to the visuals in the games. Final word.. I hope for sequels because there is so much great lore that can be told, and once you get the ball rolling and you know the characters it will make more scene. Personally i would love to the story of the Lich king.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Legendary Pictures has had some stinkers in the past and made even worse choices when it comes to the tone and set up of a movie. There are moments within this movie that feel stilted. They feel unusual and a little uncomfortable. However, that doesn't mean that it pulls away the positive aspects of the movie making it not worth your time. The action within this movie is fantastic. Visuals are well done. As a former player of WoW I was more than pleasantly surprised by certain levels of proper continuity, and the places that they made sure to include, and their true grandeur. I finished this movie, happy with what was chosen as a story, the characters they chose, the voices for the CGI, and for the most part the actors in charge of the non-CGI roles. What I disliked was the dialogue between characters, and the actors choice in how such words were spoken. This will go into my cult favorites. I only hope that they take the errors made in the fine details of this production and produce a better sequel. I cross my fingers for the future that it can rise above it's predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Warcraft" (2016) is a one OK / nice movie to see it in a movie theater for those who didn't play the games and couldn't spell one of many bizarre names of characters in this movie (i'm one of those). Special effects were good, nothing groundbreaking, but good. The weakest part of this movie for me was Travis Fimmel acting. That has to be one of the most uninspiring performances (which should have been inspiring) in big budget movies ever - he just went trough all movie with one face expression - even when something very dramatic happened - he was just staring at the screen, with no emotions visible. They need to re- cast the main actor in a sequels, if there will be any. And sorry Paula Patton, almost every time you went on screen with that ultra-bizarre looking haircut and make-up, i started to smile. The story was quite OK - like i said i only played one of the very first games, so all the characters for me were unknown, and many of them remained unknown after the movie. As not a fan i can say, this movie won't be as much impressive to see it at home, so if you want to spend 2 hours and see some OK flick on Friday evening, "Warcraft" is for you, but don't expect to be blown away. Overall, "Warcraft" is nicely paced movie, which at running time 2 hours made me to watch at my watch only once - and it was in a scene were some mags were fighting. Performances were between low and OK - better cast highly recommended for sequels (altough there was one very short cameo - i won't spoil anything, but this great actor / actress should have been more on screen - it's the biggest star of this movie for sure). "Warcraft" is a one nice flick to see it once on a big screen, and for home media - extended version is recommended (if there will be one), because the strange thing but this movie wasn't predictable overall, and there even were some glimpses for a great, epic movie, but on it's running time 2 hours the story didn't had enough room i guess. So - it's a OK flick for those who haven't play the games, and it wasn't as bad as critics said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft fans will love it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'm going to address the reasons why people hate this movie. Simply put, it throws you in the deep end of a complicated and involved mythos and expects you to either go with it, or gtfo. There is precious little in the way of explanation of who the characters are, why they have the motivations they do, or how they all interact with one another.In short, if you know something of the lore around the Warcraft game, you'll be a lot happier than someone who knows nothing. Most of the negative reviews seem to come from the latter camp of people, and for that, I can, for once, hardly blame them. After all, plenty of people who had never read the Lord of the Rings enjoyed the movies of that franchise without any prior knowledge of Tolkien's world.So in essence, what I am saying is that Warcraft does a poor job of explaining its world an people.That said, I think this was always going to be a film that would be appreciated more by the fans of the games. I include myself in this group and I can honestly say I found it enjoyable. The bright colours and larger than life characters may not be for everyone, but for game fans, there is little to complain about.Characterisation is a bit thin. Again, the movie expects you to know a little about the players in its universe before going into it. It is effectively hoping the game has done all that pesky familiarisation for you, allowing you to just enjoy the plot.As for the plot... well, it details the arrival of the orcs into Azeroth and the ensuing conflict that arises with the existing races. The orcs are somewhat huge in comparison to the humans and the action does a good job of getting that strength across visually.Effects-wise it is something of a hit-and-miss affair, with some of the facial CGI being amazing and some of the mass battle effects looking weak. Likewise, the sorcery and magic effects are very well done. Overall, however, there is nothing too bad to complain about, and the balance is definitely on the positive side.Dialogue is at times decent, occasionally laughable and sometimes dire. No one will win any awards for this but there are enough moments of genuine humour amongst the verbal clangers that it somehow manages to overcome the writing deficiencies and veer into cheesy-goodness as opposed to direness.So what you have is an action-fantasy story with a deep background that most average folks will never understand, coupled to thinly developed characters and a plot of world domination that wouldn't be amiss in a 30's serial.Yet, somehow it manages to work. Maybe it is because I have that background knowledge, or maybe Duncan Jones has managed to make the impossible work, but Warcraft is an entertaining movie to watch. It won't win any awards, as I already said, but it kept me watching to the end, which makes no sense when I consider all of the component parts individually. But as a whole, it is definitely greater than the sum of its parts.Is it worth your time? Well that depends on whether you are a fan of the games or fantasy in general. If yes, then I'd say give it a go, and ignore all the critical reviews that slam it. Make your own mind up. If you are not such a fan, you might find it confusing and simplistic and not very satisfying.SUMMARY: Mostly for Warcraft fans. Lots of weak points, but yet manages to work in spite of this. If they make a sequel, I'll go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sometimes very campy fantasy movie, that manages to deal with questions of identity and different family types in an interesting way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, it is easy to dismiss Warcraft - The Beginning as a campy, convoluted fantasy movie. But if you take a closer look, you can clearly see Duncan Jones' handwriting. The way, this movie deals with topics of identity, relationship and finding your place in the world, lifts it above average.I have very little knowledge about the lore of Warcraft. Actually, all I know about it comes from playing the related Hearthstone card game. Compared to the HUGE behemoth, Warcraft is, I think, it's safe to say, that I know nothing about it. And yes, I often felt completely lost in the packed story line of this movie. You could see the director struggling with at least a dozen major characters, trying to give everyone enough screen time and something meaningful to do. To my surprise, this worked much better, than it could have. But still, I often found myself asking: What on Azeroth is going on here?What kept me in this movie was the way, Jones' managed to give the story arc a greater meaning. There were interesting things about different family types and how to live with them in it. There was the Wechselbalg, raised by people who would be their enemies. There was the average family with parents who cared about their newborn, just trying to live a normal, peaceful life as everyone does (and how great, that we find this type of family amongst the Orc, who are supposed to be the villains). There was the widowed father, trying to be a good dad, despite blaming his son for the mother's death. Jones has dealt with identity, the question, what makes a person a person and stuff like that in his previous movies. So it absolutely makes sense, that he picks up on that in this movie as well. He also manages to have strong female characters and even passes the Bechdel test, who would have thought that!? This movie has flaws aplenty. But there is also a lot of interesting stuff in it and it's definitely one of the better computer game adaptations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, very entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying that I am a fan of the source material. If you fit that description, you really need to see this film, if you haven't already. I saw it with my girlfriend who never played the games and she loved it. Even for a newcomer, this is worth watching and should be at least a 7-8 rating.PROS: 1. Incredible visuals. I think it's worth the price of admission for this reason alone. 2. A credible, CGI race you can empathize with. Remember how critically acclaimed Gollum from Lord of the Rings was and expand that to the entire race of orcs. 3. Great, entertaining soundtrack. For the Game of Thrones fans, it's worth mentioning that this film has the same composer. 4. Fast-paced, epic action. I know plenty of people who complained about the pacing of The Hobbit trilogy; this is pretty much the opposite. Not a minute passes without a battle, an awesome spell being cast, or another key event for the plot.5. Spectacular magic. This ties in to point 1, but I think it deserves its own mention. I have seen plenty of fantasy films, but never anything like this.CONS:1. The pace means you might lose track of the characters without prior knowledge. In my opinion, the movie should be at least 30 minutes longer. I will definitely see an extended cut if it's made available.2. Only for fans: there are some minor lore changes, but they mostly involve the way some characters are killed. The film sticks very well to the core elements of the lore.You should really go see this film; you won't regret either the money or the time investment. Also, the source material becomes more complex, detailed and epic as the time-line advances. This means that sequels can be on par with the Lord of the Rings trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not saying Warcraft's IMDb reviews are fake/paid...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but they very well basically might be. OK, I'm saying that. They're paid reviews. The positive reviews are fake. This movie is not good. Use your judgment. Don't be a fool. There are people who get paid to write fake reviews. Of course everyone knew Warcraft was going to be a trash movie, just like the game has been going totally downhill since 2011 or so. Of course a huge company is going to pay PR companies to write positive reviews and artificially buff the score of the film. Why wouldn't they do that? So, I'm not necessarily upset about that. They made a movie, they want to make money off of it. But the movie shouldn't have been made to begin with. This film just randomly throws in a bunch of superficial aspects of the game (e.g., Oooh, they're flying on Griffins!) with some atrocious writing and acting. The film exemplifies just how bad the game has gotten and how removed it is from the actual culture of WoW and all the things that made the game appealing and good. The movie is downright awful. The scene where the orc chick calls out the insufferably nerdy mage for wanting to go to bed with her, and then refusing, is so completely telling of the targeted demographic of this film. The demographic is the nerdy mage. It's too bad this film was made. I'll admit the game was really great in it's heyday and started to decline with Lich King and overcomplicating and over-noobifying everything. Any true fan of the game will agree with me. Don't watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh at it's genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft works surprisingly well to be a game movie. Even it has a lot of same visual as so many other fantasy movies does, there is still something original too. I was a little surprise that Duncan Jones took this movie to his helm, because earlier he has made much smaller, but great movies like "Moon" and "Source Code". But maybe it is a good thing that they gave this movie to him and not to any worse director. Under all that bombast is some original too. On the other hand it feels more copyright holder kind of movie, than Duncan Jones movie. Maybe the massive budget has tight his hands. Anyhow Warcraft is quite nice and well done fantasy movie, which entertain even audience like me who has never played the game. The Beginning at movie title predicts that more Warcraft movies is on the way. Let just hope that they find someone as good director as Duncan Joness is to helm upcoming movies. Warcraft is fresh wiff at fantasy movie genre in between all those Hobbit and Lord of The Ring movies. For once Orcs has some own character and are something else than just killing machines. The even have feelings and that brings some originality to this movie.After all Warcraft originality won't carry the movie up to end. Maybe the studio bosses haven't enough courage to let director make the movie on his own. The story ends too easily and it underlay too much of upcoming Warcraft movies. Warcraft is fresh movie at it's genre and it could have been even more, if studio bosses had let Duncan Jones bring more originality to his movie. Not bad at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's just because my expectations going in were so low, but honestly I had a pretty good time in Warcraft. Now look, I'm not going to try and convince you that it's a "good" movie, but as a man who's been playing Warcraft since way back in the Orcs &amp; Humans era of the mid-nineties, I did have a pretty good time. It's dumb, it doesn't make a lot of sense, and it feels like there are tonnes of connective tissue cut out from between scenes of "cool stuff". But there is a certain dedication to the format I admire, and the animation was (on occasion) pretty damned impressive. I don't know that this will be one for the movie going audience at large, but for fans of the video game, and for devotees of the Fantasy genre looking for some new blood, I can give Warcraft a soft recommendation as a not-bad-first-step.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft had the potential to be a great movie, and looking at the sheer quality of the visuals/CGI it's clear that the necessary budget was there. But the movie is not great. It's very average.The visuals alone would probably ensure that the project doesn't incur loses. But that is about the only thing this movie has going for itself.The core story itself is good enough but it's missing details, sub-plots, and proper execution in story-telling. So what you see seems very generic. The pace at which events unfold seems very inconsistent and often rushed.There's no character development at all which is always a big deal but even more so these days with Game of Thrones setting the bar so high. Durotan and Gul'dan are the only characters that you may (or may not) find even mildly interesting. Garona feels like a completely unnecessary character with no real importance in the story.The acting is poor. Most of the cast did a lousy job here but Paula Patton as Garona seems like a rank amateur. So not only is her character poor, but she herself seems just as bad.The score is uninspiring. A movie like Warcraft needs a great soundtrack but it just doesn't have it. Think Lord of the Rings, Troy, 300, Game of Thrones.... You can't create epic scenes without epic music. But I suspect there is more to blame for that than just the music - the editing.The visuals and some familiar faces may make this movie feel rich on the surface. But it's very shallow. That's very sad considering how rich the source material is. Its still a watchable movie if you go in without very big expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie got quite negative reviews from Movie Critics, but fans of the game will, no doubt love this movie! The Autistic Reviewers aren't even fans of the game, and we thoroughly enjoyed it! Orcs and humans have had a hatred for each other thousands of years and no one really knows why. They were just different species. But now the Orcs need the humans help to bring down the real evil behind this whole war.The pace of the film was pretty good. It gets a little boring for a minute or two, and then straight back into the movie. The action and fight sequences are really good and intense. The direction was good, no complaints there. The acting was better than we expected. Paula Patton and Ben Foster really steal the show here. Their acting was the best. The writing felt like a PC game, but not a bad thing as it's meant to be one! All in all, it was obvious from the word go that Warcraft was going to be a Franchise. It ends with you wanting more. We're sure the second one will be just as good as the first one. Autistic Reviewers give this 3.5/5 stars/7.5/10.</fullReview>

I can also be biased since I play WoW for the past 2 years, but honesty I really don't know much about the lore so even if you don't play WoW I think you are going to get the plot really easy. If you like 3D is worth watching it in IMAX. I watched the movie in regular 3D and it wasn't that good.

		<fullReview>'WARCRAFT: THE BEGINNING': Four Stars (Out of Five)Fantasy-action flick; based on the immensely popular video game franchise, and novel series (of the same name). This movie tells the origin story, of how an army of orcs invaded the world of Azeroth; to take it for their own. It was directed by Duncan Jones (who also helmed such other popular sci-fi flicks, as 'MOON' and 'SOURCE CODE'); it was also written by Jones and Charles Leavitt (based on a story, and characters, created by Chris Metzen). The film stars Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Toby Kebbell, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Daniel Wu and Ben Schnetzer. It's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, but it's also been a hugely profitable blockbuster overseas (breaking many records, all around the world). I really wanted to like this movie, and I did love it's visuals, but the story and characters are a little disappointing. The film tells the story of a world of orcs, called Draenor, that's quickly dying. They've discovered a portal, using a powerful magic force called the fel, that will lead them to another world (known as Azeroth). The army of orcs, known as the Horde, is lead by a sinister orc, named Gul'dan (Wu); who uses the fel to drain the life force of other species (in order to fuel the portal). One noble orc chieftan, named Durotan (Kebbell), doesn't want to enslave the people of Azeroth (for this purpose). So Durotan, and a half-breed (orc-human) named Garona (Patton), attempt to form an alliance with the humans there. The humans are lead by a king, named Llane (Cooper), and a knight, named Lothar (Fimmel).I've never played the game, or read any of the books (or comics), so I didn't have any real high expectations for this movie. I did love the trailer though, because of it's visuals; and I have to say, the special effects (in this movie) are some of the best I've ever seen. I also love epic sc-fi fantasy flicks, like this. I'm just disappointed that the story, and characters, don't live up to the film's spectacular visuals. Duncan Jones is a very talented director; but his wife did get cancer during the production of this movie (and his father, David Bowie, died of it). Still, I think he delivered. I think the movie's main problems are due to it's script (which Jones did help write though). I think it was probably too faithful to the video game series, and novels. The story might have worked really well in those formats, but translating it to other art forms (like film) doesn't always work. I hope the sequels are much better (I did absolutely love this movie's visuals though). I probably would have liked the film much more, when I was a kid.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc</fullReview>

I recommend to anyone especially who are hardcore Warcraft gamer to watch it. You won't regret it.What makes the movie appealing is the storyline which try to appeal to both Warcraft fan &amp; the people have never heard or even play the games before. The special effect are top notch. It's good thing that the director decided against using normal size actor to play the Orc since it makes more sense to use cgi which nowadays make you convince that It's a real person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel conflicted over this film because I want to like it, I want it to be successful and I believe the world created in the film can obviously be expanded upon and offer some truly great cinematic experiences. Duncan Jones, who gave us the brilliant Moon and exciting Source Code is behind the camera and brings a wonderful visual style, but as is the case with a lot of big budget CGI filled epic flicks, the visual style is not enough.The Orc world is dying and they need to find another to live. Gul'dan unite the Orc clans together to become The Horde. He uses a magical power known as The Fel to create a portal to another world, Azeroth. The portal needs life to be sacrificed in order to work so thousands of people are captured in Azeroth in an attempt to bring even more of The Horde over to conquer the lands. Sir Anduin Lothar, a military commander leads the humans in a fight to protect their land. Along with their King, a magical being known as The Guardian and a mage in training, they need to stop the portal from being built before it's too late.As basic as the premise sounds (evil invading / good defending) the film throws a lot at you in quick successions. I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel overwhelmed by it all. I've never played the games, so I'm sure I missed a lot of winks and nods and of course my enjoyment of it might be on the lesser side of things, but Warcraft is exciting in many sequences. Those exciting sequences astonish the eyes with dazzlingly effects. I doubt we'll see anything that looks better this year, the Orcs feel alive. In particular Durotan, an Orc that believes his leader Gul'dan is doing more damage than good. He is the one Orc that is given something that resembles a backstory. His wife gives birth early in the film and I can only assume that the child goes on to become someone important in the game franchise. On the human side, Lothar is the character that Jones decides to focus on. He's a soldier, that's all he knows. He's even brought his son up to be soldier. His two duties in life are to protect his son and protect the King. With the invading armies of the Horde, his skills and loyalty are put to the test. The King, basically does what a King does, order people to do this, order people to do that. We get little interaction with a more humanistic side to him. Magic is also a big portion of the film, with a man known as The Guardian who holds what seems to be unlimited power and a Mage, who is still learning his spells. They fill their basic fantasy roles, but I can't help but feel that Ben Foster, who plays the Guardian, is miscast. Maybe it's his age, but I simply did not believe him in this film at all. Warcraft is full on fantasy. Giant birds, magical beings, kingdoms and castles. For those not interested in those things, Warcraft will not convert you. In fact it will make you feel more alienated. What it does do, for me at least, is be interested in the possibility of a sequel. The film throws a few surprises at you and does a lot of set-up for those future instalments, which might not even come. As it stands, Warcraft is a film to watch on a big screen, in high definition. I totally understand why the critics hate it, why the fans love it and why I'm somewhere in the middle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've played MMo's however lasted all of 10 minutes in World of Warcraft however after Duncan Jones, David Bowie's son and director of Moon, got handed the reigns I was interested. Then the movie got released and slammed. When I got around to watching it was anticpating something awful. 5 minutes in I was to my girlfriend "god this looks like the video game its pandering". Me and my girlfriend who's not really into this kind of thing then got pleasantly surprised. Thanks largely to a decent cast, the charismatic Fimmel, Patten and underused Cooper who's lines were as bad as his hair, Warcraft manages to reveal a bit of the bones of a decent director at the helm underneath all that Warcraftiness. Its steeped in it's Warcraft clothes but still manages to rise a little bit above the generic fodder it should have been. I doubt Jones's would be back for a sequel but for fantasy fans an enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior game-adaptation.(Spoiler-free)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well,I have to say,the critics are wrong about this movie.I respect their opinion,but this is a nice fantasy movie that even non Warcraft fans can enjoy.But beware,for it will take a true fantasy fan to enjoy this one.I will not say that I am one of them,but I still liked this movie.This movie does not deserve a 28 metascore,or a 27% Tomatometer.This is one of the superior entries in this game-adaptation crowd,and even though that isn't saying much,this movie is still good. The visuals are as strong as expected and provide a visual treat. Cast performances are strongand Imust commend them for their efforts for bringing this adaptation to life.On the downside,some people may find it hard to care about the slightly meandering story and strange characters.This movie calls back frequently to the game,and that will interest some,and annoy others.I am not a huge fantasy fan,but I liked this movie.The audience reaction also matters,and this time the audience has spoken.Go with your family,hell,go alone,but don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Primordial and Clunky but Still Gets the Job Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just put this out there right now: I have never played Warcraft. My experience with Warcraft is limited to one of my friends from school being hospitalized because he survived solely on Dr. Pepper for a week while playing the darn thing. I say this because many within a certain community will see any criticism towards this film suspect; even more so coming from someone from the outside looking in. All that said, Warcraft the movie is not that bad.The story begins with a horde of Orcs invading the realm of Azeroth with chieftain Durotan (Kebbell) and his mate Draka (Galvin) among the first wave. Their leader Gul'dan (Wu) uses a ethereal form of black magic known as the Fel that requires mortal sacrifice, which many of the Orc clans look on with suspicion. Meanwhile Lothar (Fimmel), military commander of the human kingdom, and a mage named Khadgar (Schnetzer) find out about the fel and bring news to King Wrynn and Medivh (Foster) the Guardian of the realm. They investigate further and capture scrappy half-Orc survivor Garona (Patton) who agrees to help the humans and try to incite a rebellion along with Durotan from within.Draenor, Stormwind, Azeroth, Karazhan, Mak'gora, Dalaran; if these words mean something to you then guess what, you can probably pay attention to the plot with relative ease. Those of you who did not do the homework however will have to sit in the corner and feel the acrid pangs of being ostracized; like naively showing up to a party you're not invited to. It's even all the more punishing when characters speak in paragraphs of exposition and explanations. We get all the trappings of a fantasy adventure including palace intrigue, otherworldly artifices, fantastical creatures and sword- to-flesh chest pounding, yet the narrative fails to give us much reason to care. That's a pretty large feat considering the amount of death that surrounds Gul'dan and his horde.So why then do I say Warcraft is not that bad? Well for one, Duncan Jones's visual cleverness and attention to detail is still present, despite the film's need to frustratingly skip any honest-to-goodness emotion or characterization. Jones is not of the MTV generation of action filmmakers who use shaky cam, fast editing and dynamic camera angles to slam their audiences against the wall. Instead Jones litters his action with a fast processional of setups and payoffs broken up by tracking shots of people hurdling towards each other. That along with an affinity for epic wide shots of battlefields prove he may be among the forefront of a new generation of directors who take their inspiration from video-games.There's no value judgment here on whether lifting ideas from video- games is a good idea though it is refreshing to see a director take a different tact. The visual grammar is primordial and a little clunky at times but when it works, it really works. Warcraft could have ended up like the much maligned Dungeons and Dragons (2000). As it stands Warcraft is more of a bargain bin Lord of the Rings (2001- 2003) providing some interesting visual thrills though using bland characters that might as well be made of clay.In summation, Warcraft is kind of like the Dungeons and Dragons starter set. The one where you first create your character class, roll for ability scores, determine statistics and alignment while forming a solid backstory. It's a whole lot of setup and ironically very little actual war-craft but at least it leaves you with a lot to work with. Oh, you have no idea what I'm talking about? Do those last few sentences make little sense? Well then, you know how I feel.www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantasy comes to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that I'm a big World of Warcraft fan. I played the game for years and this is why I'm aware that I'm probably biased. I loved this movie! It was amazing to see the game come alive. Stormwind city, the portal, the giant wolves, the Gryphon and most of all: The Orcs! It was amazing to see them "real"! Terrifying, and huge! I wouldn't want to stand in front of one. And now about the plot: The movie has a good story, it has depth, it's about telling a story and not only about showing special effects as it is with so many other movies that has abundance of special effects. In the end I was surprised at how much I loved this movie since my expectations weren't high. The story had some heart breaking moments, it had amusing moments. It managed to show the emotional side in the conflict between humans and orcs. The Alliance and the Hord. A war is not made only of armies but also of individuals who had to make some hard decisions. What I liked less about the movie: Even me, who is familiar with the game, had to struggle in some points to follow the plot. I don't know how the experience is for people who are not familiar with it. I assume that if I came there with no previous knowledge I would have been very confused. The second thing I liked less is that the humans were portrayed too honorable and good for the humans' nature. People in power had to make some difficult decisions in difficult times but none of them were driven by personal motives. I found it not very realistic but I suppose that the creators were simply following the plot line of the game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly my Favourite Video Game Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm not as big a Warcraft fan as most others I just love everything fantasy! I went into this film with only some knowledge of the world and lore, and honestly thoroughly enjoyed it!I can understand some of the negative reviews that complain about the pacing as it was slow at parts but I don't believe in ripping films apart actively looking for things to hate, I just like to have a good time with movies and I honestly think Warcraft was a great time!The action is intense and the fight scenes between the Orcs and the Humans are bone crushingly entertaining! The acting on most parts was great IMO, though I felt the weakest among the cast were Ben Schnetzer as Khadgar, and maybe Paula Patton as Garona. I've been a huge fan of Travis Fimmel since seeing him in Vikings so I expected Lothar to be my favourite character due to fanboyism, but I can honestly say that Durotan was by far the best character! I feel Durotan really carries the entire movie!As far as the main villain goes, I thought Gul'dan was so cool! He was sinister and held a strong, intimidating presence early on! I'm in love with the soundtrack as well, Ramin Djawadi does a great job once again!Overall I feel Warcraft is a fun time for casual moviegoers, and there seems to be plenty of references etc. for fans of the games and novels. It has some issues and it's not perfect, but then no film really is. At the very least, you'll be getting some awesome fantasy action with BREATHTAKING visuals! Well worth the money in my opinion, and I'll definitely be buying it on Blu-Ray!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining movie but the ending threw me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I don't play World of Warcraft, so maybe take this with a grain of salt.I went into this movie not expecting all that much- lots of fighting, lots of CGI, and not a whole lot of plot- but I left thinking 'huh. That was actually quite good?' While yes, there WAS lots of fighting, and yes, at times the CGI felt too much, the plot was actually cohesive and it was a massively entertaining movie to watch. The settings were deliciously detailed, the costumes were fun, POC were included, and the fighting was epic. What more could I want from a summer blockbuster? As the characters cheered, I smiled in my seat, as things went bad (as they often do in movies like this) I felt angry along with the main players, when they cracked jokes I laughed along. It was FUN. It was GOOD. I wanted more, and then- It ended? The ending honestly threw me off and is effecting the overall score I gave it. I was into it, things were heating up big time and crazy things were happening, but then it was over? The ending had no warning, and did not leave me satisfied. Honestly, they only needed to add ten minutes to wrap some things up and make sure that we (the audience) knew that the end was nigh, but we didn't get that, and I left confused, puzzled, and without closure. All of that aside though, it really was an enjoyable romp of a movie and I expect fans of the game will highly enjoy it, along with open minded main stream viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Critics Even See the Same Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For people who grew up with Warcraft and Warcraft 2, this is a movie to see. The beginning and end of the movie were great. Durotan's story and Lothar's story were on point. The renderings of the orcs were amazing, I would even say some of the scenes with the orcs, specially at the beginning, were so good they even looked better than the live action characters. I brought my sister and nephews to it, my nephew's loved it since they have played the Warcraft games before but even my sister, who doesn't care about video games loved it. I really do not understand were the critics are coming from in giving it such low ratings, almost like they are just on a bandwagon and giving it the worst ratings. My only complaints are that Warcraft should have been made into a series. It would have been a perfect series for HBO and taken slowly because of the tons of lore available. That and the slowdown towards the middle of the movie. There should have been more of the fighting between the orcs and humans while giving the story of the king.I highly suggest it. Bring family and friends along, trust me, they will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>20 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It goes without saying that more often than not most movies based off of video games tend to be a massive disappointment to both the gaming and movie communities... For instance, the live action Mario Brothers movie from the 90's. However, in my opinion, the Warcraft movie breaks the losing streak that video game-to-movie attempts have had in the past.The combination of a great director, top of the line visuals and cast,coupled with the unending amount of great story telling/lore that Blizzard entertainment has given us through the Warcraft franchise, makes this a movie worth every penny that was put into it. It doesn't take a veteran player of the Warcraft games to understand and enjoy this movie. More of these movies need to be made and Blizzard Entertainment certainly has more than enough great lore to keep pumping out great movies such as this one. Easily 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as critics are saying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based of one of the most popular video games of all time,'Warcraft' tells the tale of orcs and humans fighting for their world. The orcs world is dying and one big bad orc opens a portal to the human world where they can rebuild. Except, they don't want to coexist with the humans. They begin destroying towns and taking slaves. Naturally the other people inhabiting this place aren't very happy about this, and they fight back. Now, I have never played the game and am not really a fan of Blizzard games. Even though I have never played the games I feel like this movie was one for the fans. (Even though most of those fans say this isn't like the actual story.) As I watched, there were many obvious things that were fan service that I didn't get. But when these things popped up they never really stayed for to long. I was happy that the film was actually trying to be a movie instead just fan service. That being said, this is a film that many people who haven't played the games will be frustrated with.It never goes into much detail about, really anything. Very few things are explained or spoon feed to the audience. While I appreciate when a film does this, this one didn't really know what it should and shouldn't explain. There are many things that, because I am not a fan of the game, didn't make sense. This is unfortunate because a film shouldn't be dependent on the thing that it's based off.You shouldn't have to read books or play games in order to get what is going on. This is the main problem with the film. There are far to many things that are left too vague. I shouldn't have to go through an extraneous process to get why a character is doing the thing that they are doing. I really had no idea who these people were and the film didn't do anything to show me who that person is.Even after two hours with these characters I was no closer to knowing them. Not a single one had any personality other than the motive that drove them. Not knowing or caring about the characters made the middle portion of the film very tedious. It cut between almost every main characters backstory back to back in the most sloppy way possible.It would show us a boring scene between two or three bland characters chatting about who knows what only to be cut off by a terrible transition. This happens nine or ten times. It seemed like the film knew it's characters sucked so it just jammed extraneous nothing into the middle and hoped you didn't notice. It made the 2nd act of the film so incredibly boring and tedious to site through.If you were to pull the majority of the second act from the film you would actually have a pretty good fantasy flick. For a movie that is being panned by critics it does a lot right. Most notably thanks to Duncan Jones and his direction. Because holy crap is this film pretty to look at. What I loved about it was despite the large use of CG It never felt out of place.This is mainly a product from having the majority of the sets be practical. Being in an environment rather than in front of a green screen seriously helps you believe that it really exists. But a lush world would be nothing without stirring music to capture the feel of the environment. And it does that very very well. This is made even better by the great cinematography. Watching as the camera navigates between giant book shelves or take on perspective shots is pretty cool to see. Doing this shows a level of grace and maturity that you don't see from many other directors today. It showed that Jones really cared about what he was doing and the effort put into every shot makes that sing true.Is it a perfect movie? No. But is it the disaster most critics are calling it? Of course not. The level of effort put into the technical aspect is unmistakable. It's very well directed and offers some really stunning visuals that your eyes can feast on. That being said, its story is pretty messy. It's uneven, poorly edited, and overstuffed. It tried to cram so much content in the film that it was impossible to really get involved in what was happening. If you're a fan definitely go see this but if not, it's probably best to stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The critics have proved once again how out of touch with what is actually good they are. I just saw this with a mixed group of fans and non-fans and when we came out it was no longer a mixed group. Although this will not bring me back to the MMO that shares lore and story based off the titular game it definitely reinvigorated my love for the world of Azeroth. Bring out Legacy Servers and you'll have me again Blizzard but I digress. The movie was excellent again not just for fans but for those who knew nothing about it at all as well. We all left with our expectations greatly exceeded, which for the non fans were actually surprisingly high. I cannot recommend this film enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Orcs we excellent. They were the best thing about the movie. I really felt for Durotan and Draka. Even Blackhand showed depth at times. Yes, I agree with some that say the Humans were less stellar than the Orcs. However, I think Duncan did a Brilliant adaptation of Khadgar. Many movie critics were giving LAZY reviews. The critics have almost ZERO time invested into this part of the fantasy universe. THey haven't spent years playing the game, reading the lore. But that is the thing about this movie. You don't need to have ever played! It's a great story on it's own. You just need your imagination! Go see it! As for us gamers and players of World of Warcraft. You are in for a treat! It's one thing to see Ironforge or Stormwind in great resolution on your PC, but this feels like you are there! To see Dalaran as it was intended to be seen! Not like in the game! The Lore holds true for the most part. If you really know your lore you can see that if this was going to be a 3 part movie series, it would wind up around the Lich King. What critics don't seem to know is that this story line has NEVER ended. It's still going on now! We are the new Heroes in the game and it is us who are completing the story line! Anyway, that's what I get out of it as a gamer and a movie fan. Worth the move! Check it out and enjoy a new universe!</fullReview>

If you know about warcraft, and I am not talking about people who only played WoW or DOTA, I mean people who played Warcraft(I) ie. before Reign of Chaos or Frozen Throne, they would be able to draw similarities in the story-line. This is beginning of a great story that went ahead and became so amazing that I played Reign of Chaos and Frozen throne countless times and even completed them repeatedly! The CGI's are great, and the detailing was good as well.I heard some kids smirking and saying - "Look at that armor, how can a human being carry such a load?". My immediate thoughts - I am glad you haven't seen Atari guys make Unreal Tournament or Microsoft's Gear of War armor. It's an adventure fantasy movie, just enjoy it in 3D and with great sound!</fullReview>

For the part of music,the theme is so majestic,and others are exquisite. Both the buildings and forests are real to see.The design of all the clothes is astonishing meticulous,and the suit of armor is gorgeous.Lion and blue gemstones are good pairs.The queen's image is a little weak,but Lothar is interesting.I really love the actor of the king,because of both his character and appearance.His long hair and big eyes images a shape of a romantic knight,and shows the character's loyalty and courage.His death brought great sadness to the viewers. All the actors are excellent.I like Mediveh most.His character is noble but complicated by the dooms he experienced.His capes are really beautiful,especially the one with black feathers.And the red one with embroidery is very elegant. The scenery is beautiful. The light is bright,which makes the movie more like a video of the game.But it's good. The director did a good work. Hope Blizzard will make a batter one.

		<fullReview>They've done it, they have finally done it. Hollywood has finally made a great video game based movie.Forget what the critics have to say about this movie, drop any doubt or any reservation that you have about seeing this movie, and buy an effing movie ticket! This movie transported me into a world that I have only previously visited within my imagination. Duncan Jones adaptation of the video game work was so accurate to my minds image, I was almost brought to tears. Now, there were a few liberties that were taken as far as story goes but they were understandable and slight enough to forgive. If the tweaks weren't there the movie would have been at least another three hours longer. Pros- Everything....lolz But more seriously- The sets, attention to detail, special effects, acting done by Durotan/Orgrim/Guldan/Garona/Lothar was fantastic, story was fun, action was rich, true to source material.Cons- only one con! The actor who played Khadgar pulled me from the illusion a couple times throughout the film, he just seemed out of place. Still, a forgivable performance. The kid that played Lothars son must have won a contest to be in the movie or something because he was not an actor. In Conclusion- Go to the theater, buy a ticket, NOW. Must watch movie. 9/10</fullReview>

All in all I have to say it was an amazing movie. I walked out of the movie with such a big smile on my face because I saw the game come to life on the big screen and the only thing I could think about was "I want to see the online reviews for this movie." Sadly to say some people were Sh%%ing in the mouth of this movie. I'm not sure where they are coming from but from a gamers perspective it was amazing. Lore/books/stories have to be changed to accommodate time for the big screen. Some are horrible and some are really good. I think they did a great job adapting the lore for the film. It's not how they change it but rather how it makes sense and it seemed very well done. All in all I payed money to see this film because I want to see more. Even if they did horrible and I was completely unsatisfied I would still want to see this movie. I support my favorite franchise because even if it does suck, the next one will be 10 times better. Go see it, be your own judge.</fullReview>

The motion capture performances and CGI of the Orcs really blew me away. I had watched YouTube videos (which did no justice) before I went to watch the movie but it wasn't until I seen it in IMAX 3D that I was really able to appreciate how much effort they put into the Orcs, they looked so lifelike.I went to watch Warcraft with two people who only knew the game existed, aren't gamers and knew absolutely nothing about the Warcraft universe. They both really enjoyed it. The movie goes right back to the beginning so it's not a movie that only people who are familiar with the Warcraft universe can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been playing Warcraft since Warcraft 3, in 2003 i believe. I've been playing warcraft-WoW since then. I expected movie to be more Hollywood style and not entirely how fans want to see it, lore messed up etc, i didn't expect ill even recognize the maps.. However i was wrong, movie has a lot of details which true fans will notice, meanwhile the most of people wont. Lore is changed, but its still awesome, couldn't do it better in 2 hours of movie.MY WIFE went with me to see the movie, and she loved it.. She has never played the game and she is blown away by CGI and story line!10/10 PEOPLE please support this movie.. Next parts of the movie are gonna be so amazing.. I want to see Arthas :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spectacularly beautiful, but rough around the edges fantasy superhero movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching the movie. As a major fan of the Warcraft universe and a big Blizzard fanboy, here is my wall of text:I have to applaud the attempt at bringing this movie to life. Similar to Civil War having a ton of characters, the insanely detailed and rich lore of Warcraft is incredibly hard to fit into a 2 hour screen time. However, unlike Civil War, Warcraft isn't that well glued together and suffers from many things a lot of critics have mentioned. Nevertheless, I think the movie has received an unfair amount of bashing and is definitely a good video game movie which follows the source material closely. I'll start of by saying that the CGI and the motion capture is amazing. Every single orc looks unique, moves and fights appropriately for their size and is menacing just like they are supposed to be. Lord of the Rings orcs are a joke compared to these bad boys. The true Orc stars are of course Durotan (the wise, young Frostwolf clan chieftain) and Gul'dan (the sinister, demonic warlock), who each shine in their own way. Durotan is probably the best developed character in the movie and his facial expressions are jaw dropping. Gul'dan is evil incarnate. The way he sucks the souls out of his victims is flat out terrifying.The magic in this movie is of the hook, balls to the wall, full throttle powerful. It is spectacular and a breath of fresh air compared to the lackluster, weaksauce magic you get in Harry Potter and other movies. The sorcery action clearly establishes that mages are by far the most dangerous and lethal people (and orcs) to walk Azeroth. I was afraid I was going to hate Khadgar when I saw the trailers, but surprisingly he ends up being rather compelling. The human armor is interesting, colorful and exactly what you would expect from a human army in this universe.While the armor is beautiful and shiny, some people wearing it aren't colorful enough personalities to make it work. The king, played by Dominic Cooper, is dull, uninspiring and is unreasonably friendly and naive (just like his Queen) when it comes to the interaction with the orcs. To me it felt unrealistic that both would be so open and friendly with Garona. A lack of prejudice on the human side made that side of the conflict seem too mellow, pacifist and boring in some cases. It is clear that a lot of hatred of the orcs was cut out of the movie (there is 30-40 minutes more available in the directors cut) since it was present in the trailers. This is a shame, since racial prejudice has always been a big part of the Warcraft lore. That makes the team up moments much more sweet when they actually happen.Other characters, specifically Medivh, Garona and Lothar are reasonable, but lack anything particularly interesting about them. They work for the movie but the performances could have been better. Specifically Lothar didn't get enough time to develop his relationship with his family. Everyone could have used a couple more minutes to give them more spice.The pacing in the movie, as mentioned before by many other reviewers, is bad. There is a bit too much jumping around from point A to point B, making each individual scene have less of an impact. As a result, the movie is not grounded enough to have proper world building, which in my opinion was what made the first LOTR movie so good. As such, a lot of mystery and wonder is lost because the movie doesn't leave the audience enough time to process what have happened. The movie has a lot of magic, but the magic of subtlety is not one of them.While flawed in many ways, I think this a decent first attempt by Blizzard to get into the movie business. What is great about Warcraft is that it doesn't follow a lot of terrible and boring Hollywood clichés. The Orcs are much more than just useless idiots, as they are an actual people with feelings and code of honor. The movie is bold with its plot (thanks to the story being bold) and these risks taken make it much more enjoyable. The fact that Marvel is playing it too safe with their characters is one of my greatest pet peeves.Warcraft has stunning visuals and a couple of very great and touching moments, but suffers from a story that is too rapid fire. 7/10 for me (and 7/10 for non fans also, if anything me knowing the story makes me more critical). Hopefully this movie gets the money and we get a sequel. The potential is there to get a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The critics have been too harsh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the reviews and I was expecting a boring, confusing, campy fail of a movie. I'm a long time fan of Warcraft and Blizzard, so I'm obviously biased, but I thought the criticism was WAY too harsh. I was entertained. The orcs were cool. The story wasn't any more complicated or hard to follow than a typical superhero movie. The acting wasn't stellar, but it wasn't horrible either. I think the thing that trips people up is that they aren't comfortable with the world. Orcs, warlocks, wizards, fel magic, dwarfs and elves that aren't from middle earth, Karazhan, Stormwind, Ironforge, Azeroth etc. All the unfamiliarity can be a jolt and cause the movie to be less enjoyable. I get it. I feel the same way every time I go to an avengers movie because I don't follow comic book movie stuff. Its a lot to take in without any explanation, but it doesn't really need to be internalized in order to enjoy the movie. Just let that stuff go over your head and you'll have fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Storyline" right from the very beginning unwinds coherently to keep viewer completely engaged in the immersive blend between animated fictional characters and special-effected lustrous humans. Although, there exist segments like 'Medivh' going over to the dark side of magic while again protecting 'King Llane' and his army, that yearn some explanation."Graphics" make you feel the sheer force with which the orcs attack while equally contrasting the effect of magical forces that hold them in-line. 'Medivh' definitely makes magic look so cool.And it is one of those rare stories in which characters "rise to being heroes". And remember this is just the beginning of what is yet to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well positively surprising, even for a Warcraft fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it was awesome. The action was great, and it really kept me hanging on edge of my seat. Even though the story differed somewhat from the games, it was well executed and fitted the movie to make it good.Though, in the other hand the cons of the movie were also the story. At the beginning of the film, the story started out good, but last fourth of the movie was story-wise ruined, in my opinion. It didn't, however, ruin the movie, but knowing the story of the game, it was disappointment. So 80% movie was absolutely great and awesome, but the last 20% story-wise was a huge let down: if you don't know the story of the games, don't read it. Or else the end will be ruined.Overall, apart from the story and ending was just spectacular. The orcs were done amazingly and the movie was just beautiful to watch. The action was breath-taking and keeps excited to the very ending of the movie, though the last battle could have been a little notch closer to a bit more epic, but was still great.TL;DR: It is a must-see in my opinion, a best fantasy action since LotR, and does a good job competing with that. You will love it, if you're a Warcraft fan (apart from few story changes), if you're not, you will love it even more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a Warcraft fan myself I found that the movie was very enjoyable. I felt that it followed the original lore very well, with a few changes to the story (which was totally fine). My only gripe with the movie was that it was too short. It felt that a lot of important details were left out throughout the movie that only a Warcraft lore fan would know. It may be confusing to people who are not familiar with Warcraft, but I think it should be enjoyable to watch for all. I am looking forward to seeing it again with my family, and I will provide them with the details that will confuse them, and I urge any Warcraft lore fans who also plan to take someone unfamiliar with Warcraft to do the same. I also look forward to seeing the extended edition, for it can only get better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair review with spoilers extending to what you'd see in a commercial.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, I'd like to thank the critics (rotten tomatoes) for helping me determine whether to see the movie. I know that they have terrible taste in movies so if they give it a low rating then I can count on it being a good movie since movies tend to turn out opposite of what they rate it.Next, I'm going to list the pros and cons for this movie so the average movie goer can get a more accurate depiction of the movie.For the average movie goer, the CGI tends to stand out the most among the experience. Even the magic, which can easily be boring such as the Harry Potter movie with the scene involving the duel between Voldemort and Harry, was up to par. The magic looked impressive as it should be. The fight scenes were well choreographed so if you're an action junkie and love a good fight scene, then this will not disappoint.Warcraft lore is packed with so much information that it isn't feasible to get a non-fan up to speed in just one movie. The movie's story line is more of a summary of the events that transpired within the World of Warcraft. All of the main characters have significant back stories and so do the locales. For example, Khadgar travels to Dalaran but the significance of that place has not been explained. Therefore, only the fan base knows why it is flying in the air or why Khadgar travelled there in the first place. The non-fan would only come to the conclusion that powerful mages reside there.The relationships were not explained in detail either. Orgrim and Durotan are best friends and when Orgrim betrays Durotan, a lot of the inner turmoil Orgrim faced before making that decision had been left out. He just "happened to do it".If you are a fan, you will love this movie. I spent the entire time examining the architecture and looking for details that correlate to the game. A lot of us raided Karazhan in BC so it was cool to see how much of it looked like the movie version. Even Moroes, who was a raid boss in Karazhan, had been featured in the movie, along with his death. Stormwind and Ironforge were wonderfully crafted and look like the in-game version. Practically, every visual detail had been pushed to perfection, in regards to precision.Then, you have a bunch of characters who were not introduced but as an avid player, would be able to recognize. Among them, Grommash Hellscream and Kargath Bladefist are shown on screen and easily recognizable. The characters look like their in-game counter parts and that was impressive. As a fan, my complaints are as follows; does a mediocre (at best) job at drawing in non-fans, cheesy/cliché dialogue which makes the characters harder to relate to since they don't display normal personality characteristics, and a weak lead in to a sequel.TL;DR versionGood CGI and fight scenes to make it a visually impressive spectacle for fans and non-fans alike. Underdeveloped story line leaving non- fans confused about each character's plight and motives. To be fair though, the Warcraft Universe has so much story in it that it would be hard to fill in an uninformed audience in such a short amount of time. Literally, to capture all the backstory leading up to the events in the movie would take up an entire movie slot on its own. Ultimately, a non-fan would have a general idea of what's going on but would not be able to appreciate the accuracy of architecture and character models since this would be their first time experiencing these elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but finishes strong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I played Warcraft II and III as a kid. I put 6+ Years into the World of Warcraft. I am a fan.That being said, I found this movie to be bit of a mixed bag. It is rather bloated. I can't tell if it was overlong, or if there was just too much story to tell in the time allotted. At times it felt rushed, and other times it seemed a bit slow. They do do a good job of developing the characters. By the final quarter of the film you are invested and care about these people. And boy that final quarter REALLY is strong. The movie ends very well, with a lot of action and denouement, and then a LOT of setups for sequels. And I left the theatre WANTING to see those sequels. There is a lot of fan service here, and most of it is very smartly done. Overall, as a fan of the franchise, i was pleased with the film. It wasn't spectacular, but it is a good start for what are hopefully going to be more movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decently (war)crafted game adaptation, but what's the hurry?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Duncan Jones made a name for himself as a director of highly intelligent science-fiction movies with a fair dose of humanism, so he sounded like an ideal guy to deliver a game adaptation that would stand out as really good for a change. Choosing Warcraft was risky, however, since it has become a multi-game franchise over the decades, one with its own complex story lines, characters and mythology. Distilling a story thread out of a game's lore that is cinematically satisfying while still doing justice to the gaming experience is a trap that many a director has fallen into. So the question is: did Jones succeed? My answer is: yes and no. Although I have played my share of Warcraft, I am no hardcore fan or connaisseur (I sort of lost interest halfway through WCIII: Frozen Throne), but I cannot deny that Jones delivered a pretty convincing visual representation of how I remember the Warcraft universe. The cities and castles look impressive and lush; the Orcs look physically imposing, realistic and dangerous, but they never become mindless beasts; and the colorful human armors and weapons are instantly recognizable from the games. The battle scenes look impressive and brutal, without going into much gory and appendage-shedding details (since teens should also be able to enjoy this). The CGI, often the scapegoat that disappointed audiences aim for, looks almost flawless here, and convincingly helps to create this universe. It was a prudent move of Jones to cast mainly Caucasian actors as the Orcs, because many directors before him had to battle allegations of racism for having a tribal people played by non-white actors. Both humans, Orcs and half-breeds are portrayed by a diverse mix of ethnicities now, which works fine.But did Jones really need to be in such a rush to get the story told? I haven't kept a score, but the first 15 minutes introduces about 5 different locations, 10 characters and maybe 7 unique terms. It is as if the entire first act contains more information than both 'Moon' and 'Source Code' combined. I love a bit of fast pacing, but here I got exhausted to keep up with this frenetic storytelling. Jones' scripts are usually pretty well- written, but here it is easily the source of most of the movie's shortcomings, or maybe it is in the editing. I had the distinct feeling that this was originally a 3-hour movie that had to be cut back to 2 hours on studio demand. Many characters are thrown in with little to no introduction (it's usually not a good sign if you have to learn character names from the end credits); some of the peoples (Elves and Dwarfs mainly) are merely referenced, so you never get a sense that Azaroth is such a diversely populated world; and some sequences evoke the feeling that a lot of exposition is missing (even some of the action scenes lack coherence). That makes it difficult to get absorbed into the story, or care for the characters, despite some nice, unexpected twists at the end, which would have worked much more satisfyingly had we known the characters better. Maybe I am spoiled by Game Of Thrones, where I get to know and love the characters over the course of many hours, and feel genuine heartache when they get killed off, but Jones should really have put more effort in building a solid foundation with a backstory and the characters.So, a nice visual attempt to make a faithful game adaptation, but again, the difficulty of translating game to screen is showing. I had a good time with it, but as the subtitle says: it is a beginning, and hopefully a good starting point for a better fleshed-out sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is suffering while it carry too much potential in the world made by blizzard company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft is a movie based on video game made by blizzard. It is one of the most popular game in this generation. The game itself serve a very authentic kind of world with huge characters. Too bad, Jones cant implement the incredible world in the game into his movie. There are so many things can be improved to make this movie on par with its typical such as lord of the rings's world by JRR Tolkien.If we analyze, nearly from all category, acting, editing, and writing, warcraft even not reach average level. Too be honest these are so bad. Its like the creative director Jones just lost his movie making skills. The actings are cheesy, but in this storyline typical, characters must drive the movie. Its because this movie focus on characters- based not story-driven or visual-based. If the characters, cant give impact into the story nor neither they're not given much appearing duration in scenes or maybe they cant deliver their motivation for the storyline-purpose such as race- safeguarding, then this movie is left with visual effects only. Even the panoramic effects not as good as The Jungle Book or LOTR trilogy, then no other things could carry this movie from plunging.So some improvements that i think could intensify this movie in the first thing is reduce its silliness. Some jokes should not be added and the jokes should executed precisely and classy, not like stupid things. Battles with magic should looks cool, not with some prolonging spell words which even too kiddy to watch. The camera position seems not precise in some battle scenes and it has too slow pace. Increase its pace in battle with good camera set piece to intensify its magic visual effects will pump the audience. Too much forced sentimental scene too increase its characters development with false timing also obnoxious. The ending or the last solo battle seems not epic as it could be. Magic battle or physical battle seems using oldish and kiddy choreography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the best video game adaptation ever made! Although, let's face it, this is faint praise. More importantly ? and I suspect this was director Duncan Jones's mission statement ? it's a good film. Not perfect, but better than the wham bam trailers would have us expect, and nothing like those Rotten Tomatoes numbers. Most will have heard of World of Warcraft, the western world's most successful massively multiplayer online roleplaying game. Although Jones's movie actually returns to 1994, to the original game, Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans, as its starting point. So, do I review this adaptation as a layman or a fan? I fall somewhere in-between: I've played Warcraft 3 and vanilla WoW, but then my knowledge falls away. Still, I know a Murloc warble when I hear it, and I understand the significance of the name Durotan. Durotan (Toby Kebbell) is an orc chief of the Frostwolf Clan. His homeworld Draenor is dying, and his leader, Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), is farming the souls of the indigenous Draenei in order to create a portal to Azeroth, where he intends to migrate his Horde and settle in the new world. Trouble is, Azeroth is already home to humankind (and elves and other species we briefly glimpse).The human military force in Azeroth is led by Lothar (Travis Fimmel), a powerful warrior who joins forces with the mage named Medivh (Ben Foster) and mage-apprentice Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) to fight the Horde and close the portal. But Durotan is equally sceptical about Gul'dan's crusade, and he is seeking to halt the mighty warlock via orcish mutiny. When the humans capture the half- orc Garona (Paula Patton), she becomes the bridge between Lothar and Durotan. But will it be enough to prevent Gul'dan from completing his apocalyptic plan?The themes are broad and basic but laudable. Displaced people from a dying land escaping to a new place and a new culture? There are obvious parallels with modern migration struggles. But Jones targets a more nuanced dramatic core, focusing upon those individuals seeking common ground ? who happen to be the proudest and arguably truest of each tribe. There's a hint of The Hobbit in the bright-but-grounded style of the movie. But the similarity ends there, because while Peter Jackson stretched a lot of content thinly across nearly nine hours, Jones and his co-writers pack more significant incident into two. I also feel that Jones has done a better job of integrating practical sets and props with CG environments. The special effects are something special, particularly during the orc scenes. I haven't seen such weight and clarity in CGI since Pacific Rim. While Warcraft doesn't seek to mimic the games' almost cartoony aesthetic it is evidently a work of great care and affection for the larger-than-life source material. On the performance front, Fimmel essentially reprises his roguish Vikings role as the charismatic Lothar. Patton's Garona plays a key part as the go-between for the clashing factions. I especially enjoyed her non-nonsense attitude to mating. Gul'dan is a wonderfully grotesque creation whose Fel power has left him utterly indifferent to the plight of the common man. There's a fantastically 12A-pushing scene in which he idly sucks the soul from a human captive like he's toking on a crack pipe. But it's Kebbell who steals the show. He lives and breathes the hulking Durotan ? with this role and Apes' Koba, I wonder if we have a successor to Andy Serkis in the motion capture maestro stakes. The focus on characters and by extension themes is what elevates Warcraft above standard fantasy fare. Even when, in the final battle, the intimate drama threatens to be swamped by spectacle, Jones has the sense to give us emotional beats: pay-offs for the patient character-building of the first two acts. Warcraft has been hugely underrated by professional critics so far. The temptation is to rally against this perceived injustice. But let's reach for some objectivity: Warcraft is a flawed film. There's some seriously clunky dialogue, as per the need for exposition in a fantasy universe that will be all-new to many in the audience. And a sub- plot about Lothar's son never really resonates, perhaps because there are so many characters vying for real estate in the relatively brief running time. Warcraft's chief flaw may be its subtitle. It means we're left with a dangerously inconclusive ending. How much it's possible to enjoy the final act of this film depends largely on whether "The Beginning" is suitably confident or hopelessly optimistic. Knock off a star if your interest in Warcraft doesn't extend beyond one particularly amusing South Park episode ? you're still in for a solid, enjoyable adventure story, somewhat old-fashioned in tone; and which also, in an era of turgid monstrosities, feels unusually brisk. For the fans, this is a no-brainer which happens to have some brains to go with its brawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic! Spectacular!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! I did not expect WARCRAFT movie to be this spectacular. And I'm not a gamer nor have I ever even played Warcraft games, so to come across an adaptation that is so well-done, so well-crafted is a breath of fresh air. This movie is as epic as it gets, jaw-dropping and visually stunning, a magnificent cinematic experience.Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures gave you this adventure saga based on Blizzard Entertainment's iconic property. Directed by Duncan Jones who spent more than three years working on this project, the story is essentially about a peaceful realm that suddenly faces the fearsome Orcs who have fled their dying home in search of a refuge. A portal connects these two worlds that ultimately collide in a massive war for the fate of their family, their people, and their home.I had my worries at first because I feared that since I didn't know much about Warcraft universe and its mythology that the film would somehow lose me. But the writers including Duncan Jones came up with this heroic story with its many complications and all shades of grey, because the motivations on both sides can be justified depending on how you look at each of them, and it's so well-structured that anybody can follow it just fine; that they can invest themselves in it. And there's balance as well, you'd enjoy the orcs storyline just as much as you'd enjoy the human dramas. Some can even draw Israel - Palestinian struggle comparison with this film, but that's another topic for another time.This year alone, just when you thought "The Jungle Book" had raised the bar in terms of visual effects, this WARCRAFT movie comes along and splits us in half, basically. Watching it in 3D even adds to its already many breathtaking, mind-blowing sequences. The world created, including the houses, the castles, the creatures, the designs are nothing short of astonishing, clearly this is the work of people who truly cared for this game, that said, this is a film that exits not only to just pay homage to the game, it's not by any means trying too hard either, it's the perfect mash-up of a great story, solid characters, and outstanding spectacle. The best high-fantasy film since "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensible review from a movie-lover and long time wow-player</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once you've plowed through all the tens and zeros fans and haters brand on frankly any movie these days, you might be looking for a sensible review if you haven't thrown your arms in the air yet by now. Well, let me make an attempt. As a movie, Warcraft fails on a few levels. As a fanpiece there's enough there to make you smile and enjoy the world you're already very familiar with...except there where the lore takes off in a direction I can't for the life of me remember happening that way.The movie suffers somewhat from an all too familiar ailment when making these epic multi-character stories. Not enough investment in the characters leads to you not caring for them at all. The story centers largely around Lothar, Garona, Khadgar and Durotan. Now for people who are familiar with Warcraft lore, there's not a lot to fill in for you. You know these characters and what their feats have been, you have already an emotional investment in them even before the movie started. For people who are not familiar with them however, the movie largely fails to deliver on that front. I went to see with a friend, who is not familiar with the universe, and at the end he admitted not caring for any of the characters in the movie. There is no real exposition of who these characters are and what they believe in, except maybe for Durotan, who gets a little more color. They were also looking for a female lead and I guess Garona was it, for lack of any other alternative. She gets a bit pasted onto the story, and gets more screen-time than her character actually deserves story-wise. Good stories are either plot driven or character driven. It becomes a bit of a mess if the story can't really decide which one it wants to be, which is the case in Warcraft. It tries to tell us who these character are, but we don't get deep enough into any of them for them to drive the movie; and the plot is not really all that impressive either, there is no intrigue or suspense, just a lot of clobbering, the occasional spellcast and a bit of character parading. Stories are driven, because they should literally move you emotionally from one place to another, be it through a fear, an anticipation, through experiencing a characters emotional change, etc. None of that was present in Warcraft.The acting is not very good. In fact the acting of the cgi orcs was far better than most human performances. The human side lacked a bit of presence, while the orcs are quite impressive. Travis and Paula do what they can with the little they have. Again due to a lack of character development, which even a romantic nudge between the two and the storyline with Anduins son can't help, they remain very two-dimensional. Seasoned actors will often fill that void themselves with what they believe should be the character, but that's not a given when working with a fairly young cast. I've seen better performances from most these actors in other movies.The music is one of the better things in the movie, from Game of Thrones composer Ramin Djawadi. The score definitely felt Warcraft. The cinematography is not bad, and manages in this cgi heavy setting to deliver some awesome pictures. Fans will smile at accurate depictions of familiar settings...even flightpoints in Stormwind.Overall, this is a fanfilm. You'll enjoy the familiarity of it's settings and you'll fill in the blanks with your own knowledge and in the end you'll find it OK. For movie-lovers without any warcraft knowledge however, this movie will not entice you at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie knowing critics had panned it. I went to see this movie having played WC3 and World of Warcraft since 2007. I wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about.What I saw went far beyond my expectations. So what if there's a lot of CGI? It was done masterfully. So what if the general population didn't have a clue what they were seeing. I knew many of the characters and was especially proud of Khadgar.I enjoyed every minute of the movie and really hope that a sequel is in the works. Warcraft is so very full of lore and history of its own, it deserves a full set of movies.And I'll watch them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie today. I myself haven't played Warcraft so I didn't have any expectations. The story itself was not difficult to understand and there were lots of cool graphics including awesome buildings, etc. So I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie. About characters, Travis Fimmel did a good job as a main character. I liked his character in Vikings and there he made Ragnar as a great and unique warrior who doesn't resemble any other warriors in the movies that I saw. But I was slightly disappointed that his character as Ragnar in Vikings was still showing in this new role. Especially in the early part of the movie. Maybe it was intentional. I don't know. But I think he eventually developed his own Anduin later in the movie. The female characters in the movie are somewhat weak compared to the male ones. I hope to see more of strong female warriors in the next sequel. Overall, I would recommend this movie and am looking forward to seeing the next one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth checking for anyone who's a World of Warcraft fan, now as a movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Warcraft with high hopes and expectations, much like Batman v. Superman, and much like BVS most of my expectations were let down by a few things that I found wrong with the movies themselves. However, I will say that I thought Warcraft was better then BVS in terms of character arcs, interesting story and better- handled action.Before I go on let me just make it clear that I myself am not a hardcore WOW fan myself, but my friends at secondary school told me everything about the lore and since then we always talked about it. Deathwing has always been my favourite character though, and if the studios are planning on bringing him into any future Warcraft movies then I'd slap down ?15 to go see that! Assuming of course they'll will be good sequels (fingers crossed).But back to the film itself, there are some neat stuff and some bad stuff. The bad stuff I'll focus on first, mostly to do with the pacing. This movie is two and a half hours long and at a point, my friend's sister fell asleep almost half way through, mostly because it was rather a late screen timing that the film was on at. The pacing of this movie really dragged on, and I felt like the narrative was a little unfocused and the characters and lore of Warcraft were both not given the proper development (unless this turns out to be the start of a series, perhaps trilogy, I hope it is so they can explain more).However, that's not to say that I didn't like the movie because of those things. I actually really liked this movie for the most part because it at least had enough interesting characters with deep emotion and amazing visual spectacle and epic gritty action sequences to the film a thrilling and enjoyable movie-going experience for me.The main villain, I thought was delivered great justice, the main orc character, Durotan, I thought was hands down the best part of the movie as well as the main human character, Lothar, who I really liked as well. Daniel Wu, Toby Kebbell and Travis Fimmel did a spectacular job and I was on board with their characters throughout the movie. The rest of the characters felt sort of bland to me, but I felt like they had some good story arcs there and interesting depth to them at the same time.So overall, I would recommend Warcraft to see for yourself and see what you thought, especially if your a Warcraft fan, then you have yourself some fan service.As it stands now, Warcraft, I feel deserves a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic movie for fans and non fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie with six friends and we all loved the movie. Me and five of my friends play World of Warcraft, one just played Warcraft 3 and another one never played. We dressed up with t-shirts with our characters in the front and our faction in the back (some with horde and others with alliance). It was magical when we found a group of other guys with T-shirts saying horde. I saw the Titanic in cinema and I really didn't feel that I wanted to cry but when I saw the Warcraft movie, since the portal was opened to the end with the baby Thrall, I became so emotional. I laughed and I almost cried many times but I have a reputation, so I held my tears (sniff). The look and feel is definitely Warcraft. The action was great with mages that are not afraid to cast a spell. I loved to see the Dark Portal, Stormwind, Ironforge and Dalaran in the movie. I left the cinema with a joy that I never felt with any movie. I enjoyed a lot Lord of the Rings but sorry, after I saw the Warcraft movie I understand that I only enjoyed Lord of the Rings so much because is the most similar movie with the Warcraft Universe. I really loved to see all the easter eggs they put into the movie, the murloc, the sheep, the meeting stone (although there is no dungeon in Elwynn Forest at least in the current time in WOW, we can imagine that in the past it could have existed),.. I usually play PVP in WOW so I don't know to much about the Warcraft lore but after I saw the movie I wanted to know more and I started to read the book "Rise of the Horde".Before I saw the movie I read some critic reviews and was afraid of a flop. Some critics compared it to the Dragon Ball Evolution.. and I liked Dragon Ball Z series but come on, the movie is awful. Another critic review that I read is criticizing the fact that the movie point to a sequel and is not a finished movie. Come on ... Do you feel Lord of the Rings is finished after the first movie? What about Star Wars? The Warcraft movie has a main storyline that starts and ends but off course there are more stories to tell and more things to explain. Who is behind the fel? What will happen to Go'el (Thrall)? Who are the blue guys (Draeneis)? So I really don't understand that kind of critics and I just conclude that there are a lot of haters because its a movie about a game and there is a lot of prejudice. But people who know the Warcraft Universe know that there are books besides the great games. Don't listen the critics and go to the cinema and see with your own eyes maybe you have an epic surprise.For me the movie is a 10 stars and I don't want a trilogy.. I want a lot more movies because there are so many and great stories to tell and a trilogy will not be enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film with so much hate for no reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had the pleasure of seeing the film on its premiere in Australia. Warcraft is one of the most anticipated game adaptation to ever hit the screen, it is the film that had the chance to beat the curse of video games to movies. Did it do it? well some would say no, others would say probably not! But, for me it was a yes. This was a very entertaining movie with really awesome special effects and amazing fight scenes and with an interesting story to follow. For those that say that the human characters were not developed properly or that there was only one real character that you can relate to, I would have to agree but also point out the fact that this film was about Durotan, and setting up the relationship that the humans are going to have with humans. I would have love to see how Llane Wrynn came into power as the King and how he and the Guardian became such good friends, but that's something they can do in later films. It is like complaining why can Han know what Chewy is saying? and why doesn't any one remember Obi Wan if Star Wars is set only 15 years after the destruction of the Jedi council.Overall I do not want to ruin the film, or give a lot away, except for the fact that this was a film that sets up the universe for Warcraft films still to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warcraft: The beginning, showcases not only visual treats but also accurate story telling based on the game that I used to play since I was a young boy. You will find that most of the hate comments and critics are from those who never played this game or any Warcraft game. The movie tells us more about the untold stories of the characters of the game, the good and the bad sides of both worlds (Orcs and Humans). How they value their families, pride and honor and how they fight in order to survive.In contrast to book-based movie, it is like a level-upped adaptations of Lord of the rings minus the boring ring and way upgraded Orcs. The movie is really good (if not great) and this movie deserves higher rating than it has now. It is highly recommended for everyone, not just for gamers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is absolutely positively everything I had dreamed of for years. Literally the only problem i had was that it wasn't long enough and I am sure that they will have an extended release version with all the parts they cut to make it short enough for theatres. I hate cgi, absolutely hate it makes films seem unrealistic and just seem animated. The technology they used for this film blew my mind and totally made me feel differently about CGI. Everything looked amazing I really saw azeroth come to life before my eyes and the nostalgia just blew my brains directly out of my skull. Im not kidding mind blown I was jaw dropped frozen with excitement I thought for sure id be leaving the theatre in a stretcher do to loss of cognitive control from nostalgic overload. Absolutely beautiful, I understand that people who never were into warcraft or wow wont get this same feeling but they will see its beauty. The reviews are absurd not even 40% on metacritic are you kidding me ??! This is not game of thrones this is a movie based on the lore of a beloved gaming franchise and if your going to criticize it on your lack of understanding of the subject matter completely blows my mind. It was made for the fans but enjoyable enough for the outsiders as well. Every review I see on YouTube talks about how the critics were to harsh. The user reviews even show it IMDb 8/10 user review rotten tomatoes almost 80% so its very clear that the critic reviews were far to harsh. My girlfriend happens to hate video games but loved me enough to come to the movie and she liked it and wasn't stumped by what was happening, its not to hard to follow and its still a good time for people outside the fan base. I just want people to know its the perfect movie for fans and a good one for others. Thanks you so much Duncan Jones and the people who helped bring my teenage years to life, i cant wait for the next one and whats to come. Lok'tar ogar!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the disappointment critics have claimed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really skeptical into seeing Warcraft because of the weak reviews critics have given this movie. After a co- worker recommended it, I saw it in Imax and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the story and the world-building. And this is coming from someone who has never played any Warcraft. I was able to understand most of the rules and worlds that the film showed. And the visual effects are stunning. They felt very fantastical but rarely ever to the point I felt like it was just cgi. This is especially true with film's orcs. Unlike the Hobbit, the mo-capped orcs are brought to full realization. Despite their ridiculous proportions, the orcs feel real from seeing the bulging in their massive muscles, the hair and sweat on their skin to the expression of their faces.The characters I thought for the most part were pretty likable. Toby Kebbel once again proves that he is becoming a star with mo-cap as he is the best part of the movie as the orc chief Durotan. Every scene he is in you see that he has so many strong human qualities despite being a 7-foot bulky orc from being a wise leader and warrior to a man that shows a strong love for his people and family. Paula Patton actually did a better job then I was expecting by acting as the medium between the Horde and the Alliance. Travis Fimmel does a fine job as Lothar by coming off as a bad-ass though there were times I felt he was a bit too unlikeable. Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga (both you can see on Preacher) did good despite being limited by the screenplay. Ben Foster and Ben Shnetzer still felt like a weird choices to play the two main wizards.The battle sequence between the orcs and humans feel very but at the same time pretty violent despite the movie being so colourful and having a pg-13 rating. The introduction to the orcs is probably one of the best openings ever. The same can't be said for when we are introduced to the human characters. This is when problems of film become visible. The intro to Lothar and all the other human characters feels nothing but forced exposition that lasts for the first quarter of the movie. As critics have pointed out, it does feel like large portions of this movie are missing similar to Batman V Superman. Footage of seeing Lothar being with his son and Durotan having more conversations with his friend Orgrim would help immensely with a lot of the character motivations. The director Duncan Jones has created a big and beautiful film that I feel is greatly hurt by the studio cutting out important character scenes just to have a shorter run time. In terms of Duncan Jone's past movies he has made, Warcraft is not the best (the best still is Moon) but I applaud him for creating this movie with such thought and care about a game he so greatly cares about. I certainly look forward to a sequel if it gets the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How much Validity is there in comparing WARCRAFT . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . to our current Real Life World Geopolitical Scene? "Two worlds. One home." is among the tag-lines promoting WARCRAFT. Many of my friends, particularly the military ones, equate WARCRAFT's Orcs with Jihadis when they play or discuss WARCRAFT. They point out that the Orcs amputate limbs in punishment for infractions, just as happens daily in the Jihadi third of the Real World. Orc factions constantly are in armed conflict with one another. Sound familiar? Of course it does, at least to them. The Orc clans share a love for Stone Age rituals, and the destruction of any bulwarks of more advanced Civilizations, just as the Jihadis razed Palmyra, Ninevah, and blew up the planet's largest statues and other World Wonders (not to mention the Pride of Japanese Architecture, New York City's World Trade Center). Orc warfare is often one-sided hands-on terror waged against comparatively defenseless humans, just as Jihadis are most infamous for beheading bound captives. It seems that WARCRAFT may well be plagiarized from Today's Headlines.</fullReview>

I don't know what critics didn't understand about the movie. We took my 11 year old brother to it and he understood the story perfectly. The Warcraft franchise has a special place in my heart. World of Warcraft was something that I picked up because of my husband. It was a game that we could play together from Michigan and Illinois. About two years ago, I was in a really bad place. I felt like I had failed in my life and wasn't on my medication. We renewed our wow accounts a couple months after moving and it gave me something to focus on. Not just the game but all of the books and other Warcraft related stuff. I know that it sounds silly but the Warcraft franchise was one of the things that helped me escape from feeling so down. After taking a six months break to move, I am ready to head back to Azeroth and finally get the stupid Ashes of Al'ar!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good beginning for a trilogy hopefully</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Warcraft universe is full of interesting lore, myths and background history and many important and minor characters. The creators of this movie had the difficult task to put at least some of it in a two hour movie and present it in an understandable form even for people who are not familiar with that universe. I can say that they succeeded. As a viewer and a fan of the games, I am now left craving more and hoping that we will some day see the story of Arthas on the big screen and more of the beautiful world of Azeroth. The move had plenty of action, good fights, and most importantly - characters you could relate to even if they were orcs. The people who are behind the visuals of Gul'Dan, Durotan, Orgrim and Blackhand did a marvelous job. My minor complaints are that we didn't get to see much of the continent of Azeroth, and that the other races of the Alliance had only minor background appearance. Also, I was hoping for some of the music of the game to get at least a bit incorporated in the soundtrack. Still, this was an impressive handling of this game franchise and a good transition to the movie form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warcraft is not LOTR. Warcraft is not Inception. Warcraft isn't a cerebral gem that inspires theoretical dissection of every line, scene, and character. Warcraft is an easy to follow, action packed, CGI spectacle that entertains for two hours. My fiancé doesn't play video games, had no prior knowledge of Warcraft "lore", and loved the film. She particularly loved the fact it wasn't the length of a LOTR movie, and that the story was very easy to follow. Too often movies try to be clever, catching the audience off guard, for what is supposed to be a mind-blowing plot twist. And too often those movies fall short, often wasting hours of your time. Warcraft has an unapologetically simple, in your face plot-line that shows you exactly where its going. And getting there is a lot of fun. Overall, Warcraft is a fun movie for fans of the game and/or someone who is looking for fairly mindless action packed fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to be honest. I am a big Warcraft fan, and so I acknowledge that I am somewhat biased to the movie because of it. That having been said, the movie was great. The effects were on point, the visuals were amazing, and all of it stayed very true to the source material, with a few acceptable exceptions, and was a fun experience. That said, I understand why some people were disappointed. It feels like a full third of the movie is missing our cut out, and the pace seems to pick up to be far too fast towards the end. There is no denying the shortcomings, (which will hopefully be resolved in the directors cut)even for us die hard fans. Unfortunately, I understand why this was the case: They have to introduce a lot of this world to get to the point where the story will really shine, and that is regrettably, at least a movie away if they want a coherent, understandable continuity . It doesn't make up for those shortcomings at the moment, but it is necessary to get to the real story, and I hope that its success will be measured in what it will herald in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good fantasy movie, great even for people that don't know Warcraft series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many game-based movies that turned off to be disappointment. Happily, this is not one of those.I can recommend this one even for people that don't know Warcraft universe, because fantasy lovers will surely like it, too. (Spoiler) There were some specific Warcraft things such as Fel magic, Kirin Tor council... but they explained it through movie, so even uneducated viewers will understand.Acting was so great I would believe them. Their emotions didn't seem to be fake and scenes were logical, too, so people that tend to find little mistakes in movies shouldn't be worried.Visual effects were great, I had feeling like I'm playing the game and not viewing actual movie. I was worried orcs will look funny, but they looked almost exactly like in Blizzard's cinematic. I saw orcs in them, not people combined with visual effects.I love Warcraft universe mainly for its background full of unique aspects. I could see that also in the movie. Orc architecture, their traditions, scenes build with fantasy components in the background. There were also parts spoken in Common or Orcish language. That was just heart-warming for person that read almost all Warcraft books and experienced its game universe.It was based off action and not talking, so it doesn't have too many complex, deep dialogues. Here and there were some, but it can be flaw for someone looking exactly for this in movies.I was very disappointment in changes in lore. I would understand that if they couldn't make that scene happen, but they just didn't follow it. (Spoiler) For example the fight in Karazhan. There should be also Garena, fighting by Khadgar's side. Medivh (or more like Sargeras) would fulfill her mind with confusion and because of that she will kill king Llane. And it will be betrayal, not because he wanted her to do so. And there were more changes like that.It's my most favorite movie and I can highly suggest it to others. If you want to have even deeper viewer experience, I suggest you to read Warcraft: The Last Guardian book. There were differences between movie's and book's lore, but you will get that (spoiler) Garena is half orc and half human, Medivh wasn't actually that bad and other things that can be unclear for other viewers.</fullReview>

What I liked most was the true Warcraft feeling. From the beginning to the end it felt like Warcraft.And Gul'Dan was amazing, exactly as I have imagined him to be. People should just go see this film, and if necessary go see it twice or more so that it earns enough money to deliver the sequels. We really need to see more of this.The "critics" have no idea what they're talking about. When a film gets 27% from critics and 83% from viewers, it tells a lot about how biased the critics were (probably paid by the rial studios).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting fantasy set up, could become a worthy successor the Lord of the Rings franchise?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To see the Warcraft story translated into full motion picture is like a dream come true for a fan such as me. I always believed the world of Warcraft had enormous potential, full of interesting characters, locations, tales and events. The movie definitely tries to achieve that feeling from the get go, putting us in the middle of ongoing action, introducing characters by the second and changing locations frequently, although I wished we could've stayed with a particular character, at least for the first act, to gain "footing" in the world: precisely where the movie struggles the most is in making us care for the personages.In a project such as this, finding the best team is tricky. You need a talented director that knows and loves the original material but, at the same time, distances himself enough to address the shortcomings. Duncan Jones is a curious choice. I absolutely loved Moon but Source Code was a disappointment (perhaps not entirely his fault but he is still the director). He is clearly a supporter of a more introspective storytelling which for a 'fantasy epic' feels like an odd pick. Nonetheless, if he was committed with the project and the material like he said (instead of simply the paycheck) one cannot truly question the choice (finding another director with the right motivation wouldn't be easy).The visuals achieved are jaw-dropping impressive. From the grandeur of a magnificent city to the detailed chaos of an encampment or a skirmish, the display of magical powers and world lore are impeccable (probably, to date, the most incredibly looking magic making Harry Potter cry and dwarfing Gandalf of The Lord of the Rings). I found the soundtrack to be somewhat unremarkable and disappoint (at least it doesn't get in the way), but the sound effects are for the most part very good, the clashing of weapons feels just right, the spell casting is thunderous and the fantastical creatures sound? rather real. The story has a notable fast pace, in clear contrast to the LotR franchise, and the inevitable sense of rush is felt in the characters interactions. You will see moments like two characters meeting and nearly immediate trust is earned.Concerning the characters, I'd say they do a good job gaining your attention. Almost all, if not all of them, are underdeveloped. For some you will never understand their motives, what drives them. Many just feel one dimensional: one is the screw up but with good intentions and strength, one is the gallant knight, another is the leader who cares for his people, and so on. No one feels truly an individual which is a shame. The orcs feel at least more interesting than the humans (basically high medieval fantasy clichés). The actors' performance is more each one's opinion: I liked Travis Fimmel as Anduin Lothar (others didn't), didn't mind Ben Foster as "Obi Wan" Medivh (felt fresh for the character), Paula Patton (Garona) had highs and lows, Ben Schnetzer (Khadgar) was rather distracting. A remark for Gul'dan (the orcs spiritual head and de facto leader): he is outstanding in the movie, a perfect villainous character, ominous and manipulative. And there is still so much backstory to the orcs? oh how I felt sad we didn't get to see more.Warcraft feels like a solid first step into this new world. Some critics remind me of the release of the first Lord of the Rings movie, but we don't need to dwell more on that. If you are a fan of fantasy, you will enjoy Warcraft. If you liked, for example, LotR for the lore elements and themes, you will enjoy this movie. A random movie goer will enjoy the action, the visuals, one or another character. For the fans, such as me, it's a dream come true to see the movie and I can't wait for the next. I just hope it gets better for now on, the building blocks are in place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might convert a heretic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though "Warcraft" can by now surely be regarded as a part of cultural heritage, and warrants a film to its name, I expected that its cinematic incarnation be nothing but a cynical exploitation of the popularity of the game itself. Not really knowing that much about the game I could appreciate the film purely as a film.Gosh, what a pleasant surprise! The production, the direction and the script must really breathe some fresh air into already stale "sword and sorcery" genre. Principal shooting reportedly took four months and post-production took additional twenty. And you can see that the time was well spent. The CGI characters look incredibly vigorous and real, the scenery as well, thanks to motion capture, skilled animators and acres and acres of render-farms. The cinematography (or whatever filters they've used in the post) is vividly colorful, luscious and glamorous as one should expect from a fantasy film. The costume design, the props and the sets are done impeccably and to a tremendous detail.The script is unexpectedly self-conscious. Although it pits humans into battle against yet another monster species, we're allowed to observe both sides on equal footing. Both factions have their motives, their good and bad guys - we learn what's at stake for all of them. Not only it makes harder for the audience to pick sides, it makes for a more thrilling viewing as well.Still, despite all these things going for "Warcraft", it's still the direction that sits at the heart of it all. It plays to the strength of the script, it's concise and matter-of-fact, and it never leaves a dull moment. Timing is so good that it makes you both laugh at tremble at desired moments. You can freely see it in 2D and give your eyes a break, no thrills will be lost. Really kudos to always intriguing Duncan Jones. Who knew "Zowie Bowie" would get so far. I hope he sticks around for the sequels.If I should name flaws and thus justify not giving "Warcraft" the highest mark, I'd say that the pace, although needed to keep the attention in the complex story, didn't leave much room for relationships between characters to sink in completely. If it did, it would be an Oscar-worthy material, but hey. Doesn't matter all that much.There will be people who will complain that the story is derivative. And indeed, how many stories about humans, kings, good and evil wizards, monsters and dwarfs are already there? Quite a lot, no doubt. It doesn't bother me, though. I'm glad this one came to be, and that is was brazen enough to go through all the familiar tropes of the genre as if they were anew. Because "Warcraft" could give lessons to some better known franchises of this and other genres. It could, for one, teach "Lord of the Rings" how to not be cold and heartless and it could teach Marvel how to avoid making listless villains and stories without stakes.I'll never ever play "Warcraft" the game, but I'm now thankful for its existence because it gave me another cinematic franchise to look forward to in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blizzard has broken the curse! Fantasy Galore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The people that give this movie a low score are those who should not be watching the movie in the first place. Lets start with who Blizzard is targeting with this movie. Fans of the Blizzard Warcraft Universe and those who enjoy fantasy will LOVE this movie. Those who give it a bad score are those who critique it harshly for its few technical flaws such as multiple time lapses/fade-aways as a way to progress time quickly and a few faulty actors (most of them picked it up by the end or you got used to their acting as they grew on you). And yes the plot isn't a masterpiece, its a mixture of cliché and corny but it is still much better considering that it is from the Warcraft Fantasy. It also helps if you know what is happening and remember the names of important characters from the games as well as the different locations. For instance their is a scene with the gryphon landing in the stables when traveling to Stormwind which hit me hard with a case of nostalgia. (which i as a past Warcraft player had visited many times). Other than that the movie is a great viewing experience as the visuals blew me away. The epic fights, the landscapes, and the clear inspiration from mythology to references from all of their games. This movie is a MUST SEE FOR ALL FANTASY LOVERS. The movie leaves room for a sequel and considering that the movie focuses around Orks and Humans(if you haven't guessed that already from the trailers) i hope that we would be able to see more of the the different races from Warcraft in the future movies. Everything from Dwarfs to Night Elves to Draenei and to all the races in the Horde(and the newer races since i last played which was Lich King). Throughout the entire movie i had a massive grin, It had so much nostalgia for me and as a fantasy die hard and a video game lover it was amazing to see Blizzard pull this off with flying colors. Kudos to Travis Fimmel with his amazing acting as well i would expect nothing less from Ragnar Lodbrok :D i really hope to see him again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the critics give it credit for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really excited about this movie, but then I let early critical reviews poison my outlook. I ended up going, but with decidedly more trepidation than I needed to have. The movie was perfectly good. I think it might have been a little better when you understand the lore, but even to the uninitiated, if you pay attention, I still think it introduces its characters well.While some of the action was so, for lack of a better word, epic in scale, it suffered, sometimes, looking cartoon-y, but those moments are short lived. And the good stuff more than makes up for the bad. All in all it is well worth the time to watch.Another criticism was the acting. To that I say nay. The acting is just fine. I think these newcomers do a good job. There was once a time when Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher where unknown newcomers and today they are household names. I don't want to digress to much, but save for Oscar Isaac, the cast here are betters actors than the cast of The Force Awakens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Put - The Critics Have It Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rare occasions when I have ignored all of the critic ratings, outside influences and just went and saw the movie fully hoping I would enjoy it. I have been a big fan of the Warcraft games since I was in grade school, and I must say that other than a few slight differences, it follows the lore quite well. The CGI is absolutely next level and the battles were as ferocious and impactful as I had hoped. The acting was quite good, and there were some moments that actually sprung to life emotional responses from the crowd (both laughter and sadness). I went with my wife who normally tears apart movies quite effortlessly, and after it was finished, she just turned to me and said "that was actually really good, this movie has something for everyone". So long story short, if you are on the fence about seeing this movie, don't be. I think it has enough solid content to offer a great movie going experience, and is a great way to spend a couple of hours even if you know nothing about the games. I for one will be looking forward to a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both fans of the game &amp; non will enjoy this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I am very much a fan of the game. I have played World of Warcraft for several years, and am sitting in my garrison as I type this. However, that does not mean I am writing a biased review. I have been a fan of other video games which spawned movie adaptions and not at all been a fan of the movies themselves. Warcraft is different.I went into the theater utterly thrilled to see the game that had been a part of my life for nearly 8 years on the big screen, and I came out blown away. It exceeded my expectations tenfold. Every aspect was spot on. The story, the performances, the CGI, you name it! They truly brought the lore from the game to life. It was an emotional roller coaster and a truly epic adventure.My 15-year-old went with us "for the popcorn" and ended up loving the movie. She became invested in the characters and the story and talked about it with my husband and I a long time after. We actually all went to see it a second time. I haven't seen a movie in a movie theater twice since Titanic when I was a preteen in love with Leonardo Dicaprio.For non-fans of the game, or even for people who have never even heard of the franchise: the story, characters &amp; performances stand on their own feet. It is a great ride from start to finish. The critics are being unfairly harsh with this one and so many of us want more Warcraft movies! Go see this movie &amp; show your support!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're familiar with warcraft universe universe you'll probably like it. If not be catious, it's whacky over the top high fantasy. Extended version would be preferable, editing is choppy at times, but overall, really good effort. Acting-wise orcs were the best, Paula Patton was over-acting sometimes, emotional breathing was not natural at times, her tusks looked kind of ridiculous, on the other hand Draka looked very good. I think Garona should've been CGI too. Travis Fimmel was likable enough, maybe cause i like Vikings. CGI orcs are awesome, unlike kind of bad and ugly Draenei at the start of the film. Also ending sets up sequels and is somewhat anti-climactic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A video-game movie done right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first need to address where I come from going into this movie. I have played many of Blizzard entertainments(he creator-company behind the Warcraft Universe) games and I have also sunk hours upon hours into the lore of Warcraft. And as both a gamer and a Warcraft lore nerd I think this is so far one of the FEW(If not the only) movies, based on a video-game franchise, that can hold up to the franchise it's representing. And with that being such a rare thing this movie deserves the biggest praise.With that said though, as a movie, it has obvious flaws. But also moments that are excellent. There is some parts that you just can see where Blizzard have had their hand in making things that are as true to what makes their video games on a unparalleled scale. And that is the "CGI". The Orcs and their home-world looks amazing and you cannot help but to feel strongly for the animated characters in many different ways just because of how they look, move, act and talk. It's truly, yet again, a masterpiece of art created by Blizzard. They really feel like they have a soul unlike many other animated movies and cut-scenes created now a days.With that said though. If I had not read and invested so much time beforehand and already knew these characters and where they came from I most likely would be VERY confused as to what was going on on the screen. Especially the first parts that throw you from scene to scene and character to character making it very hard to follow and get emotionally invested as to what's being shown. And even though that is not as big of an issue in the rest of the movie it's still there and it made made it hard to be able to connect to the characters as I wanted to and many of the witty and emotional scenes that could have been great fell short because of it.And when the "CGI" parts still won my heart due to how excellently made they are. The parts with real life actors made me cringe most of the time and also the choice of actors felt off. It made the movie at parts more feel like a mediocre sci-fi/fantasy TV show than a big movie production. I so wanted it work but I knew it was going to be hard for me even before I went into the movie-theater as I have never been a fan of the mix of animated characters and real actors. And when the non-animated parts feel closer to a low budget production than a high budget one it throws me off even more.Now I could have been fine with all of the non-animated parts flaws IF they had taken the time to develop all the characters and the story. I very much want to make a parallel to Lord of the Rings since if they had followed a similar model to LOTR and made the movie 30-60min longer and worked the scenes(specially the parts in the beginning) in a way as to not make it feel as rushed, not only would the choice of actors have felt as weak but many of the scenes in the movie would have hit closer to home than it does in its current shape. One could hope that there is a Directors cut or something similar to get your hands on in the future, if so, wait for that. It would be worth it.BUT with that said, for this to be one of the few(or the first) TRUE movie based on a video-game world that stays true to the world at hand it does get a big plus, as well as for the animated parts.As a video-game fan or a Warcraft fan this movie is a yes. As someone who does not have any prior knowledge or interaction of the Warcraft world, I don't see how this movie would be anything for you. But if you like amazing animations. Go for it. But you most likely will not leave this movie behind you with your emotions swayed in any way even though many scenes try to get you there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the initial reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no idea why this movie got initially panned by critics. After seeing the movie it seems these initial reviews were being harsh just for the sake of being harsh. The movie was great. The action and special effects were very well done. Being a warcraft fan, I loved to see the transition onto the big screen and it was a delight to watch. I would say that anyone who likes the fantasy genre will like this. You do not need to be a fan of the game or even have ever played the game to enjoy this. Someone who is familiar with the game will obviously 'get' the easter eggs and homage to the game, and it is awesome that Blizzard put those items in there (a 'nod' to the many fans of the game). Blizzard/Legendary did a wonderful job of making a major motion picture that does the product justice and can appeal to any fan of the genre. I have heard that up to 40 min was cut from the movie, and I an really hoping an extended version is released in the future. Can't wait for the sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only played "Warcraft III". Thoroughly enjoyed it, I used to load it up every day I returned from school. So, that being said, I ain't much of an expert on this world nor I am some huge fan. No.Though, I happen to be a film fan and I simply enjoy good filmmaking. With Warcraft, this is the case. Outsdandingly good film-craft. There is everything in the fantasy flick needs to be - stunning visuals, interesting and relatable characters, solid story and tons of ACTUAL magic. Story pacing is just fine, there is not much of a character development though, but hey, that's because mostly all of the main heroes and villains are already established, and that is perfectly fine with me. Neved did I feel bored or underwhelmed. I personally didn't have any problems following the plot and understanding all the reasons within the film itself.A subject on its own is the soundtrack. I divide the OSt into 2 groups - the ones I hear in a film and right after the screening almost instantly forget, and then, there are those SPECIAL which you never forget. And in Warcraft there is an AMAZINGLY brilliant soundtrack. Actors are great. They really sunk into their respective roles. My favorites are Lothar and surprisingly Gul'dan - his voice-acting and overall appearance were mind-blowing. A perfect villain for the film that is establishing the cinematic universe.Summarizing, I have a feeling that this film is the case of BvS which launched earlier this year - critics buried it instantly, while fans and average moviegoers wholeheartedly enjoyed and accepted it. I am just so glad that there is going to be a sequel for this excellent fantasy flick and that it is successful in the international box-office.Do yourself a service - forget the critics' "valuable and knowledgeable" opinions and go give this film a chance. You live only once to let someone else's opinion influence your own view on the matter - Do no be a sheep.I give this film a 10/10 not because it was flawless (cause it was flawed), not because it is a masterpiece (which it isn't, none of the existing films are, actually), but because it simply made my life a little bit better and more meaningful. And that, I can say about only a few films out of those thousands and thousand I've ever seen. Be buying this on Blu-Ray and keep re- watching this and BvS while waiting for the respective sequels.</fullReview>

The movie explains and sets out what we a viewers need to know. and takes us on the journey. It is the beginning and if the franchise continues we will find out more.Saying that it I must explain that it is a self contained movie and they did not do a BvS where they were building up the next movie .This movie was very enjoyable and entertaining.

		<fullReview>I am 28 years old, and I have played pretty much every Blizzard title they have released. Regardless, my expectations were not high for this film, as every movie based on a video game ever done, tends to be weak and cliché. After watching Warcraft, I can tell you 2 things, one is that my opinion is different, and two, that I can see this Movie booming to the level that Disney has done with Star Wars and The Avengers series, not only for its already loyal following of fans around the world, but also for its story telling. The movie had good character development, and told me enough about the characters to understand the already established Warcraft universe. The actors were on point, the story was simple, while original, and the relationships were genuine (nothing felt forced). The ending was strong, and really set it up for a series of sequels to follow. The graphics were out of this world, and the art was amazing.Overall, highly recommended. Can't wait for the next one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ATTENTION: Those Whom Never Played the Games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should note that I am a 27 years old from the United States, who at one point in time fell deeply in love with Blizzard and their games (Diablo I &amp; II &amp; IIX, Warcraft, WoW and even Starcraft for a period). I have since then moved on to experience college life, enjoy a social life, and obtain a degree while at it in Electrical Engineering. Recently I became a member of the workforce landing my first job as a developer! So now that you better understand who the reviewer is and have gotten to know a little about me ...on to the movie:Very rarely do I feel so compelled to chime in on a motion picture... but after sitting through a screening of Warcraft, not realizing how tightly clenched my jaw had truly been, was I able to recognize the impact: A successfully told backstory for a video game, brought on fierce nostalgia for my inner-nerd. Furthermore, a tale which offered up similar emotions to those shared by other great films of our generation.THIS IS FIRST, AND FOREMOST A MOVIE WHOSE INTENT WAS MASS ENTERTAINMENT! Blizzard wants to provide something that anyone can sit through and enjoy. Only then, as a bonus is there the story of a video game for us geeks.With that being said, the story is solid and easy for anyone to follow. The action scenes (despite there being no blood) were positively outstanding. IT WILL NOT OCCUR TO THE VIEWER UNTIL AFTERWARDS THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO SIMULATED BLOOD!Don't miss out on a groundbreaking effort by Blizzard to create a solid piece which provides us an opportunity to come together as two historically opposite populations united (that is the nerds and "non-techies") ...or was it the orc and human faction (sorry but I had to get in at least one for old times sake)?Much speculation on box office numbers has been thrown around, but I honestly haven't even batted an eye. Friends, even if a sequel does not manage to emerge (and I hope that not to be the case), Blizzard has already done us a great service through this epic. I for one am already grateful!</fullReview>

I have to say the movie itself looked amazing. The GCI was off the roof, just worth alone spending that cash already in my opinion. of course i have seen blizzards cinematics and was expecting something good but this just incredible. Characters progress nicely and the acting was quite alright! Some things might be a bit confusing to normals folks in the beginning and feel a bit rushed. They throw some names at you like dalaran, Fell, Kirin Tor etc, the guardian. My girlfriend was a little confused but when the movie progresses pieces start falling together. You have to remember its fantasy and its based on a large story. This movie made me proud watching it like other people were watching a bit of me because i played the game for so long. if you played the game or not it doesn't matter you'll have an amazing time watching this.

		<shortDescription>Just another proof that movie critics live in their own world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All these negative critics do absolutely no justice to this movie. You can see it everywhere that the opinion of so called critics and the audience differs big time. This movie claims to be a fantasy movie telling an epic story and it is exactly what it does. And it does it in a very good way. The lore of Warcraft is a very rich one with several games and novels. They are tons of important characters and events which build the background to the story. Even if this is the beginning of it, its not an easy task to compress such a huge background into a time frame of two hours and make a movie which satisfy the warcraft fans and the people who have no idea about this fantasy universe. You cant satisfy everybody equally. Many fans simply missing their favorite aspects of the lore and newcomers are already overwhelmed with so many unknown places, characters and background. But this movie did a fairly decent job to find a middle ground. Many critics say you cant build up an emotional releations to the characters which i think depends on the point of view. If you have no idea about Azeroth and concentrate the first time you see this movie on all those strange places, characters then yes maybe you get overwhelmed. But if you focus on the basic principles which are survival, friendship, thrust, family, love and making the right decision than you can immerse very easy in the world of azeroth. This is not a socialdrama, a romcom or a society critic. This is a movie that let you dive in to a wonderful fantasy universe and entertains you. Its kind of a escapist movie which isn't a bad thing. I am glad that the audience that has seen this film likes it overall (around 80% likes on every major movie side.) So make up your own mind and don't let tell you from overpaid unproductive hipster critics what you should like or not. Very good fantasy movie with some minor flaws and big potential for really great sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, before I begin, the movie had some problems. I am a huge fan of WoW and the old Warcraft games. So I'm a tad bias, though I like to think I judge this movie fairly. The story is a little clumsy at first, but it does eventually find its footing. It's nothing terribly new, and is based of the first Warcraft game's story. Loosely, and I'll spare you the geek-out reasons why there were some changes. All and all, it was pretty good. Even if the first third of the movie was straight-up fan service.The visuals are beautiful, with a good amount of not-so-sloppy CG. I was blown away by the orcs animations, and the locations in Azeroth itself. Graphically, it's a masterpiece worthy of awards.The acting...meh. It wasn't bad by any means, but I couldn't help but compare some of it to campy sci-fi movies from the 90's. But that's OK! It actually kind of works and gives the movie a bit of charm. And you'll get more than a few chuckles out of it, too.Is this movie worth Oscars? No. Is it worth your money and time? Absolutely! I took my daughter and girlfriend with me to see it, and they LOVED it! It's fun, pretty, and even engaging. Guaranteed to stimulate your imaginations and take you on an adventure!</fullReview>

CGI and action scenes are classic blizzard work of art. It was really nice to see scenes and armor and personas from the game to come "allive" on the big screen.All in all i give it 8 out of 10, cause there is always room for improvement.Keep up the good work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't ever write reviews about movies as everyone has there own tastesBut after all the negative ones I felt the need to help balance the scales a little. I really enjoyed the movie, much better than some idiot critics are saying. The CG is fine the acting is fine and the fight scenes are good. I't not LOTR and it does not try to be it. If you have ever played any of the Warcraft games or WOW then you will enjoy the movie more than someone who hasn't. That said my friend has never played any of the games and he really enjoyed it also. Simply put if you want to watch a good fantasy action movie go watch it. You will enjoy it..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is exactly how I was feeling all day until the moment the movie started. FIRST OFF! The "official critics" and their reviews are garbage. I do not know how any of them are allowed to give their reviews, when they were SO far off course (not all, as some had valid points, but still very shallow reasoning for them). Before I start on the review, a little history so you understand where I am coming from... If you want to go straight to my thoughts on the movie, skip down to "REVIEW!"My introduction to Warcraft was when I was 5 years old. Parents were out for some reason I can't remember anymore, and I was going through my dads CD's to find a game play on the computer. I found a copied disk with the name "Warcraft II." BAM! My first game I ever played that was some sort of fun action and not educational or some sort of puzzle game (Memphis Math, Wallaby Jack, Jump Start, Read With Me, etc.). I would take the scrap computer parts my dad had lying around (they were more actually organized into bins by categories) in attempts to put together as many machines as I could to get my friends to play with me. My dad taught IT at a junior college during this time, and he would let me bring my friends on nights he was grading paper work to play networked. Sometimes his students would come in and play with us as well. We played other games too; like Starcraft, Doom, Quake, but Warcraft II was the one game we all loved to play the most. Building these machines and learning how to troubleshoot and configure networking settings like adding IPX as a protocol was where my love of technology started, and got me into my career working in IT.A couple of years later, I was so excited about Windows 98 and a windows desktop option called something like "live wallpaper." I downloaded the GIF's from the website during development of Warcraft III because I was so excited for the next game in the Warcraft series. Then World of Warcraft was announced. The idea of having a hero inside this world was mind blowing. Long story short, it helped me through a time when I chose to remove the negative influences in my life for the better. Then I got married, was made fun of by my new wife, made her try it until she actually started to love it and became better than me at some classes. I now have 4 kids and still working my tail off, so I do not have the luxury to enjoy it anymore. Regardless, This game has a lot of meaning to me in how many wonderful memories I have from my past.Every since I was five years old, I have dreamed of this world coming to life on film. I can now say that one of my childhood dreams have come true. Now, you understand how much this movie finally coming to fruition means to me and what my expectations would be for such a tremendous influence through my life...REVIEWWe all know how well games coming to film has worked out over the years. Not so good in general. So, I went into this, hoping and praying that it would be good, but expecting some half-#$% CGI work and terribly fake magic. The trailers showed a bit, but not enough to really tell how well they did the Orcs or how well magic looked overall. I can say that I was blown away, compared to what I was expecting! The Orcs looked phenomenal! The fight scenes were awesome. Sometimes they felt like they were moving a bit slow and they were flashing through scenes too quickly to fully enjoy the combat, but I loved it still. They have some especially awesome action stunts here and there!Magic was terrific! There was one part that it was a little "eh," but I was able to let it go. The rest of it looked fantastic!Considering what they could have done to change the lore and story, they did a wonderful job keeping mostly to it. There are a few details that those who have read through the books will be able to point out, but those details I was also able to get over (they were not huge changes to the overall story). There was one change I actually liked better. There was also one change that I still am not so sure about, concerning a certain Orc, but the main points were hit. I loved how they put in little details here and there to emphasize a certain title, name, location, etc. (trying not to give spoilers) without having to go into too much detail to explain. It is no where near as bad as the "real critics" seem to think it is in the storytelling.The acting was great. I was especially impressed with how they were able to effectively portray the personalities of Khadgar, Medivh, and Durotan. Garona and Lothar were two that I was not entirely impressed with, but they didn't do a BAD acting job by any means. I just did not really connect with the two as I felt I should have (Lothar at least). They really showed the true side of traditional orcs in here as well, which was a big one for me.If you are not a fan of Warcraft, but enjoy fantasy and action movies, you should not be disappointed! (some people still have different opinions, no matter how much I think any stated above would love it)Fans - I suggest you keep your eyes out for particular personages and details throughout ;). Also, remember that this is before World of Warcraft. This is the actual time line, not WoD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a simple fantasy movie, Warcraft is an experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the movie ended I came back and bought another ticket for the next show. Warcraft is the second movie in my life that I watched 2 times in a row, the first one being Avatar. I am a huge fan of Avatar, mostly because I am considering it to be much more than a movie, but a real experience. Same thing I felt with Warcraft. Both are a real spectacle where you become part of a fantasy that feels so real that you don t even question what is happening there, because... it is real. You don't question something that is real, you just accept it. Because reality is different than movies, reality can be cruel, unjust and so many times not according to your plan. I also enjoyed a lot LOTR series, but Warcraft and Avatar are something different. LOTR is a pleasing movie, easy plots, very good guys vs very bad guys and with the good guys having happy endings. This, plus the great visuals and good casting made it a movie for everyone.Warcraft has war in title, so expect to see a movie about war. It is NOT a "feel good" movie. It is a not a movie with happy endings, it s a very sad war story where heroism and sacrifice are not rewarded accordingly. It is also a movie where bad and good are relative. It feels more like a reality show from a war zone. The characters are what they are, with flaws and weaknesses, driven by simple motivations like survival or protecting their family and friends. The relation between them are honest and simple. The movie is not trying to make you love them, the movie just tells their story in a very difficult moment of their existence. You can sense their fear and there is a permanent tension in the movie that in my opinion is the reason why some may dislike it. The movie does not have those feel good moments where tension is released, instead the tension builds up until the last part of the movie where the dramatic charge is overwhelming. If you add the tragic and dramatic fate of the characters I can see why the movie was not been appreciated by some folks who expected an easy going movie with handsome elves and good wizards defeating the bad orcs and the bad wizards. Go see Warcraft with open mind and enjoy this amazing experience. It is an unique movie, a real work of art that deserves some sequels. I will be a very sad panda if the hatred of the critics towards game adaptations would ruin this movie to the point where no sequels will be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First game adaptation that convinced me to play the game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion this movie is fantastic. Why then you should go and watch it? CGI, I'm usually not a big fan of CGI, but this movie has best CGI since Planet of the Apes or Avatar. Apart from that there are two reasons to watch Warcraft. First of all, is to prove to the critics that they are wrong. Believe me, it gives a lot of satisfaction. Second thing is box office. Maybe this movie deserve good box office, or maybe not, but if you want see more movies like Warcraft or more fantasy movies, or game adaptations with big budget then is necessary to support this movie. Only good box office will show to the producers that is worth to reach for more games or fantasy books and put them on the big screen. More than that, Warcraft is simply worth your money. I love Warcraft, and I never played the game. I've already seen it 8 times in cinema, and I want more that kind of movies, and how about You? Ask yourself and then go to the cinema and watch this movie or stay at home. The choice is yours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's how you tell a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a feeling I was watching Planet of the Apes (the original one) for a second. The story telling is just so good, so different from your usual Hollywood flick, almost makes it look like a 1968 movie with 2016 CGI. The fact that it actually has substance and a story to tell would make it a good movie alone, add to that top notch special effects, especially the scenes where magic is being used and the interesting and likable characters (I loved Medivh, the king's brother was also very well portrayed). And I will stop here with the additions, because I do feel there were a few points where the movie fell short of being a true masterpiece, such as the scenes where it wanted to convey emotion but failed miserably (at least for me) or the (at times) lackluster battle scenes between humans and orcs where at certain points it looked like they weren't even trying, but the movie doesn't rely on that fortunately.From my perspective, this was better than the Hobbit series and almost as good as Lord of the Rings, although not as epic in scale. With a story better than all current Hollywood movies put together, state of the art special effects and a very innovative focus on the use of magic, this is definitely a must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie in Azeroth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was terrified going into the movie with my friends, we were 6 people, while 3 were Warcraft and WoW players, the other 3 weren't. I will never again read critics about movies again, it seems like they all came together and conspired with their biased, simply false reviews, some most likely didn't even watch the movie.I have never seen that many fans of this franchise coming together (besides blizzcon) and celebrate another milestone in the history of warcraft, a huge crowd has gathered in front of the IMAX theater, waving faction flags and an occasional FOR THE HORDE shouting was heard, even before the movie started, my personal experience was epic, which raised my expectations to a whole new level.As for the movie, excellent. It isn't a 100% made to lore, but let's be fair, whoever knows the lore, should understand why that was done, the other viewers wont even notice. You will get your 2 hours of epic entertainment, no matter if you are a fan on the franchise or not. I haven't heard a single complaint from actual viewers until now, only some self-named critics have told us it's not good while it was legendary!</fullReview>

As someone who spent ~10 years playing WC3, not knowing much about previous story except what i red on Wikipedia i loved it and can't wait(hope that Chinese audience will like it$$) for sequel. All in all, i can't be objective because i am fan of Warcraft, but i could say that even if you are not into warcraft universe and you liked Avatar, LOTR or similar fantasy you will probably like this movie. I'm pretty sure that sequels for this movie will be better and better, just like LOTR. I hope general audience will except it enough to get there. I give it 10/10 for the beginning of the great trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, critics have zero clue what makes a good movie. They all give this poor reviews, and yet reviews from the normal money paying populace, are overwhelmingly positive about this film.(7.9 here on IMDb for users vs 31/100 for 'critics'). This is an amazing movie.If you are fans of Warcraft, you have to see this. If you are fans of Lord of the Rings, you have to see this. If you are fans of fantasy in general, you have to go see this. If you are fans of action movies or heck, any type of movie (except for those independent art house crapdramas the critics swoon over... you won't like this.) you have to go see this.The video game movie curse is officially broken. If you were ever a fan of the Warcraft series, then you will be very happy that this movie does justice to the source material. I loved the fact that in scene after seen, I saw locations instantly familiar to me as I have traveled Azeroth for the past 12 years. When they showed a shot of Ironforge, I was instantly transported back to 2004 when my little gnome mage ran up the hill and got his first glimpse of the gate to the dwarven capitol. I stood there taking it all in then and I drank it all in then.But you don't have to know Warcraft to enjoy this movie, as this is the beginning of the saga. You can come along on the journey that millions of us have taken once before, and we welcome you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie. Just not perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Warcraft movie was shown in theaters on June 4th at an early screening across South Africa, and seeing the universe on the big screen was amazing. It has been a very long time coming, as many other fans like myself would know.The movie was in no way a disappointment to me since it has everything I hoped for. The CGI was truly amazing, and I think they've nailed the look they were going for (which is not meant to be entirely realistic).The only reason for myself not giving the movie a 10/10 would be the fact that I feel as though the movie was way too fast paced. I felt like information, locations, characters and movie concepts were being shoved into my face scene after scene.Comparing the movie to other existing universes does feel pointless to me; but one that I would make is to simply describe the pacing in Game of Thrones. I think that one of the more significant reasons why something like Game of Thrones is so explosively successful is the fact that they more often than not take their time when bringing in new characters, and then spend more time sharing the characters' experiences with the Audience. It creates an atmosphere with each and every character without boring everyone to death.The Warcraft movie does not succeed in doing that. Although having MUCH less screen time (I know...) I feel as though they simply tried cramping too much into the movie.All in all, a great experience seeing Warcraft on the big screen! The pacing should have been done differently however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The critics are wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far from the best film I have ever seen, but a thoroughly good fantasy story, and very good for a game adaption. And I can proudly say this from the perspective of a non-WoW player. I have only played the free trial of that intriguing but confusing game, though I have I admit thoroughly enjoyed reading its Wiki and playing Hearthstone. But being far from an expert at the lore of Warcraft, and far from a devoted fan, I have to say, I liked this movie a lot. It is crafted stunningly; the special effects just beautiful. The portrayal of the Orc's is good, though I much prefer the aesthetic of the Green ones (see 'villains are lime green'). The uncanny valley effect of the non-green ones played a bit with me.I saw some critics decrying WoW as 'ridicilous' and 'never meant to have deep lore'. You can be sure these people have never played an RPG in their life. The source material is bursting with lore, and it really shows. There is an uncovered depth beneath this film, and I hope it is explored in the future.I think to a point the script writers may have decided to skirt around explaining lore when they felt like they could do so, for fear of upsetting fans if they got it wrong. And this I feel hurts film as it can be confusing at times, even with my cursory knowledge of WoW. But overall, a good time spent watching with some popcorn. I always said they needed Blizzard films. Their trailers are always breathtaking. And I am glad it has happened and gone so well. It was never a question of whether this film would be successful financially - given WoW still pulls in a billion dollars a year, nearly two decades after launch. The name would pull people to the theaters as surely as Star Wars has this year as well. But it was up for debate about how good this film would be. And it is great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a warcraft fan it was fairly entertaining, maybe a bit less for other audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a warcraft fan, and I think that made the film more enjoyable. The movie throws the viewer into a beginning conflict between two races, and the plot follows that conflict. Normally this would be fine, but there is a lot going on on each side, especially in back story, and it isn't really explained or at least sufficiently. For non-Warcraft fans I think they might not be satisfied and confused. For Warcraft fans, you will know the backstory and can move along with the story in the movie. I don't know why they decided to use the story they chose, I think it would have made much more sense to pick a "back story" to do the movie around, for example what the book Rise of The Horde goes over.Other than that, the movie looked pretty good, there was some entertaining scenes, it catered to the Warcraft fans pretty well. Some low quality scenes. The story wasn't too interesting, but I am biased having heard the story already.Overall, it was entertaining, but nothing too memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing a lot of bad criticism for i was very skeptic in going to see this movie but then i remembered that many movies that i loved had got terrible reviews on there release and then became praised. Some examples are the Sixth Sense,Malcom X, Fightclub,The Shining, Caddyshack, The Gladiator, Forest Gump, The Wizard of Oz, Titanic and of course Star Wars episode 4 are these critics serious. I'm not saying that Warcraft is a masterpiece but it's not utter trash as they are saying. Then you have a reviewer that is saying Warcraft is trash but at the same time this person has given Dragonball Evolution 4 out 5, my opinion is go see the movie and don't hear these so called "experts".Sorry for this rant but i had to let this out so lets go to the movie. The first thing i felt when i saw the movie i was blown away by how well the exterior of the land was so well done from Stormwind to Dalaran. The graphics on the Orcs was very well done i didn't felt a moment that it was fake. In the meantime there story line was very well told so people that haven't play the games could understand what was going on. You could see that on the usage of the character names was frequent because the were so many names to keep in line. The battles were very well done and had a sense of "epicness" in them.The three people that shined in this movie was Travis Fimmel as Lothar,Toby Kebbell as Durotan and Robert Kazinsky as Khadar that nailed the role. As we said about Khadar the magic graphics were the best i have seen throughout the years and they set a new standard of magic spells should be done. My only objection is the editing from time to time felt it was missing something but all in all it was a great film and a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Die-hard Warcraft fan here, having played all games since the 90's so naturally my expectations were high. I was also very curious to see how the movie would be received by people who don't know anything about the Warcraft universe as I expected a lot of lore references that would be difficult to understand for the general crowd. So, my wife joined me and she had some big reasons to hate Warcraft purely because I used to spend so much time playing it.It is very difficult to achieve a good Warcraft movie, simply because there is so much depth to the story, very much comparable to something like Lord of the Rings. It is very difficult to strike a perfect balance between the millions of fans who know the story inside out (almost to a disturbing level) and general people who just want to have some fun watching a fantasy movie.For those who don't know the Warcraft universe, this is a dark, heavy and rich fantasy, across a very wide world with tons of characters, of which you could take a single one and do a full trilogy about. The events depicted in this film are the very early days of the Warcraft saga and these characters, although some are very dear to the heart of Warcraft fans, are not the main characters, if there is such a thing on this story. Are there some simplifications to the story? Die-hard fans will notice (as I did), most people won't know or care, but I honestly think it was needed. After all, this is a movie and not an encyclopedia and the movie needs to be enjoyable without a master's degree on Warcraft lore.On to the movie itself: it is very enjoyable, and my wife actually liked it a lot. Sure, she doesn't get the importance of the baby orc, or knows who Sargeras is and what is the burning legion. And that, to me, is the biggest accomplishment of the movie: it managed to tell a convincing story, in a way that left most people wanting more, without pouring tons of unnecessary backstory and plot lines on top of the audience.The CGI is amazing, not going to waste more time talking about that as every single review here raves about it.There are maybe a couple of Hollywood moments that are a bit cheesy but overall I don't think it caused the movie great harm. It is clear they are trying to setup a move franchise and I honestly hope it happens as there are so many great story lines that could result in great movies. I also believe the movie is receiving a lot of hate from critics simply because it is based on a video game. I didn't find any major flaws that could justify the bashing it is receiving. I had a smile on my face throughout as I watched the careful craftsmanship of bringing so many familiar locations and characters to life in a way that didn't disappoint me. Several other people I know who don't share this experience were intrigued by the story and want to learn more. Which means the movie accomplishes the objectives it set out to: please the fans, draw in newcomers.I thoroughly recommend it. It's great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was Durotan's story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read many reviews that talk about how the human side of the movie was weaker compared to the orc side, and they have rated the movie lower because of this reason. While this is true, what they don't understand is that this is Durotan's story, the humans are merely a back drop for the story of the orcs to develop. The movie starts and ends with Durotan' narration; the first close up of any character we see was Durotan. This may be irksome to some, because it does not follow the classic formula of the orcs being one dimensional bad guys, and the humans being the heroes. The orcs portrayed here have language, culture, emotions, honor and morals. Warcraft tries boldly to bring something new to the table here, and like most new things in art, it will get pounded down to the ground before it is accepted. Which is a shame really. A lot of people have already praised the movie for its art, cinematography, CGI, and action sequences so I won't go into them in detail again. I took 1 star off because the editing made the movie very fast paced. For a person like me who was not familiar with Warcraft lore some of the details was hard to follow on the first viewing. I heard the producer cut off 40 minutes of footage so hopefully we will get a director's cut and see the movie in its entirety. I took off another star because some characters in the movie did not enunciate well so the dialogue was hard to catch at times. All in all Warcraft has an interesting story, beautiful art and invigorating action backed by powerful music. It brings something fresh to the fantasy genre and is definitely worth a watch even if you are not a fan of the game. If you like fantasy movies then there is a good chance you will enjoy this movie. If you do not, then it might just change your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A faithful and entertaining adaptation of a popular computer game series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many popular video games have been adapted to the big screen over the years. Some, like Tomb Raider, have been reasonable. Others like Mario and Wing Commander were terrible. Warcraft is the first one that I think was genuinely not only a very good movie, but also a faithful adaptation of the game it was based on. With a story based primarily on the first of the Warcraft games, the film included elements that would be familiar to players of later games also including World of Warcraft. Locations in the game are faithfully reproduced so that they are instantly recognisable in the movie. Costumes, buildings, even the way magic is portrayed looks very much like in the games. This is very much a film for fans of the game. As a standalone movie it also works well. Though of course many of the game's references will be lost on viewers not familiar with the game, it still works as a solid action film. My one complaint is that in some parts of the film, especially early on, things felt a little rushed. I found myself on more than one occasion wondering if there were some deleted scenes there since some parts seemed a little disjointed. I'm no expert on film editing but the pacing just seemed a little off. Over-all, I found it a fun film. Great effects, great action and a real treat for fans of the game. Good enough perhaps, to make up for how disappointing the game itself has become in recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is what happens in the reviewing section: we have two factions (no pun intended with the Horde and the Alliance, but why not) of opinionated viewers, die-hard fans who have played WarCraft, and unrelated audience who were drawn because of the heavy advertising.I belong to the first faction, yet I will try to be as objective as possible. Before my review, I want to mention that the argument of "not having played the game, thus you should not have any opinion" is terse at best. Blizzard, as we all know, is a video gaming company and they have spread their wings to film-making as well; why not, given that the cinematic trailers of their games are AAA quality. Although I feel compelled to actually use the previous argument against someone saying "it was a very mediocre movie", I am at the same time overwhelmed with rationality: Why do you have to be familiar with the game, in order to appreciate this movie?Blizzard's responsibility, after having decided to take a stout venture in producing an actual film adaptation, was to immerse viewers in a world they have so elegantly and meticulously created. As with other movies, we do not need background story to acquaint ourselves with the movie's plot. That said, they should have found ways, given the abundance in narrative techniques, to bring naive viewers to a similar level of cognizance. Failure to do so implies that the narrative was mismanaged.One of the first things you witness as a player in WarCraft is the insatiable loathing of humans against the orcs and vice versa. This part felt extremely rushed and undefined in the movie. The pace was so prematurely overtaken by the wicked and demigod Gul'dan, that before you know that humans are natural enemies of the orcs, you get to see them forming an alliance. This movie was destined to be an introduction to this universe - and it should intrinsically entail demonstration of races occupying the world, their relationship and some cultural idiosyncrasies.It was pretty clear that humans thought of orcs being beastly, but we got to see a very emotional Durotan which inadvertently coalesced into a humane version of an orc - yet he was still mistreated by the humans with reluctance. I might suggest that the conspicuous humanity is linked to the World of Warcraft game (my arguments concomitantly enter this realm), where players can also create orcs and thus identify with them. However, I am not sure if they should assemble human-like traits; if the director and/or writer wanted to instill empathy to the viewer, they could have achieved it by giving focus on the injustice of the imminent events, not by turning naturally brutal warriors into weaklings. It is not explained why orcs, who grow in a society of the same standards, and are bound to obey their authoritative commanders like sheep, have such a deviating behavior. Thus, the fight taking place in the end, between Durotan and Gul'dan, was admittedly belated, for a sadistic and forcible ruler like Gul'dan.Additionally, the voice overs were a huge disappointment. The voices of the orcs were very distorted and by no means reflecting the typical voices in the game. The game voices were much easier to understand and they did not sound like their pitch was exaggeratedly decreased by 20dB. They had a natural husky and roaring tone.As for the acting, I did find it to be weak. It was Hollywood acting (and yes, this is derogatory): exaggerated facial expressions, overly dramatic with slow head motion, know-it-all attitude and shocking bravery (because let us recycle the stereotype that men are fearless). The actor who played Medivh felt completely out of place. His body- type would fit a barbarian or a warrior more than a wizard (we all know how wizards appear skinny or under-built in video games). Plus, I dare wonder, why did they choose a blond actor? I have not seen any depiction of the character with blond hair.I will cast aside the fact that I have played the game. As a movie, it was entertaining, but it was not what I had envisioned. The only commendable part for me, the potential source of its entertaining value, was the CGI. I could never get enough of the spell-casting. Gul'dan was perfectly portrayed, very intimidating and demonic. I am also glad that certain "eggs" lied there for the fans: e.g. a Murloc standing in the middle of the river or Draenei used as prisoners. However, this is the problem; someone who is not familiar with the game will not pick up these details. These exact details are what constitute this universe and make it so unique. Draenei, Elves and other races made appearance, so that the viewer takes a glimpse of the forthcoming story in the sequel, but they are all redundant when they are not given enough focus. Plus, the assemblage of different races to make decisions on their role in the war, did ring a huge Lord of the Rings bell. However, Lord of the Rings achieved a better reconstruction, because racial conflicts were uncovered throughout. Warcraft's assemblage, on the other hand, was very generic, purposeless, and lasted what, one minute? I am not sure how naive viewers are expected to keep up and appreciate the glory, imagery and richness of this world, when they are bombarded with visual stimuli of little importance.In my opinion, the movie did not feel like the game. I have seen others stating that they had tears in their eyes because of the consistent resemblance to the game. Unfortunately, I did not have this feeling - it did not even manage to echo the magnificence of the game's cinematic trailers or even the in-game cut-scenes. Good movie, but not the perfection I expected from Blizzard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible. Acting, Graphics &amp; Effects are Stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so first off if you have no clue what Warcraft is, then you may be a little confused but it's real simple. We have bad guys (Orcs) and good guys (Humans) who each have cool mythical creatures and warriors. As long as you understand that, you can get the rest. The movie was great. Acting was very well done, effects blew me away. Similar to that of Avatar, this movie is so worth it. I already want to see it again. If you liked Lord of the Rings or any sort of fantasy based shows, you'll love this. It's a fantasy movie of epic proportions that does not disappoint. It will definitely leave you wanting more. I found the storyline to be great with several twists, and moments that made you cringe. There are sad scenes, happy scenes, and incredible battle sequences. Loved this movie.</fullReview>

I hope they make a second one, I'd be more than happy to go see that too. I highly recommend this movie to anyone into high fantasy and/or any of the Warcraft books or games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft, first good video game movie ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I know a lot about warcraft lore but I watched the movie with someone who doesn't know anything about it, and can tell you it is a little hard to keep up with all the names and places but is still very possible. No matter what you think about the movie, you cant argue it looks absolutely stunning, every scene is a joy to watch and leaves you wanting more. The decors, props and costumes are, also, of really good quality.The movie starts with a little introduction to the how the orcs, and the humans, are doing. The beginning does develop every character, their relationships and what their main goal is.The characters themselves though, aren't all particularly interesting, especially the magic wielders (excluding the main bad guy) : they would fit more in a movie for 8 year olds and lack any original development. In contrast, the orc good guys have a shocking, sad and excellent story to tell and are without a doubt the main strength of the movie, which is made even better by Kebbell, Kazinsky and Galvin's performance. The movie succeeds in giving every character a chance to develop, immediately making it much better than any other video game movie to date. I have to say though, that the movie depends way too much on magic, especially towards the end. Speaking of which, the ending is the only moment where the movie fails in making you feel anything, which is weird considering how well it had succeeded so far. Lothar, the human main character is a very good, funny character and is the only one with his relationship with Khadgar to make you care about the human side.Overall, i'd say its very well worth watching. Even if some parts depend too much on magic, and that it fails to make you feel anything in only one situation, it tells a truly good story that even those who aren't fans of warcraft will like. In my opinion, it's not even comparable to other video game movies. Also, the movie doesn't try to be violent but is savage (in a good way) when needed. I have to mention again the quality of the orc side of the story because it really makes this movie an enjoyable watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not play video games,actually I do not care about video games; but this film as itself is simply beautiful in a lot of aspects; the visuals, the music, the story, the direction, the acting, actions sequences, I mean as a whole this film is just a work of passion, art and with a heart at its core. I don't know how can this amazing story comes from a video game, and I really don't care. All I care is to say that this film is worth watching and enjoying. And it deserves positive recognition. The script is unexpectedly self-conscious. Although it pits humans into battle against yet another monster species, we're allowed to observe both sides on equal footing. Both factions have their motives, their good and bad guys - we learn what's at stake for all of them. Not only it makes harder for the audience to pick sides, it makes for a more thrilling viewing as well. The attention to detail was spectacular, exciting and well-crafted story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat annoying, but good overall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie overall was good, however the Director ignored that Khadgar had studied with Medivh for many years prior to the invasion, and several other things didn't add up, however the acting was superb, and it gave the feeling of authenticity. The recreation of iconic areas in the game(s) was amazing, and the graphics were amazing. The speech used in the film sometimes got a bit awkward, and due to the lack of, let's say backstory, or prior knowledge, such as the Draenei co-existing with the Orcs for x years before Mannoroth corrupted them, without the knowledge of this, seeing the Dranei at the start of the movie wouldn't make sense for a person new to the Warcraft franchise. However the Director did a good job of minimizing the issue of lacking backstory, so it wasn't too bad. Overall the movie was pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For Warcraft fans its Christmas. I went with my wife and even though we know nothing of the Warcraft story-line, we enjoyed every bit. Superb plot, acting was good and the effects was awesome. The Orcs are crafted brilliantly, but I think Lothar character has more potential then its plotted. Creating a movie form a popular game is always hard, its crowed with high level of expectations and judging from reactions from hall full of people I think it doing well. Yet one of the best movies of the year. Defiantly look forward for a squeal. I think It has elements of creating a trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was DREADING going to a showing of this 3D film but I am so glad I went to see Warcraft. First you should know that I do not like science fiction and I don't like action films. I asked my visiting grandson what he wanted to do and he said "Warcraft in 3D!". This loving grandma sighed and tried to talk him out of it but he really wanted to go so I went along. We saw the 3D version of the film at an IMAX theater. The story was great and I could follow the characters. The design was terrific and the 3D wonderful to see. The story contained everything including action, love, caring relationships and humor. Go see the film, it is a little long and at about the 1 hour 30 minute mark I looked to see how much time was left but the movie was quickly over. Grandson is 11 and he was just old enough for the film. No sex scenes and while there was violent overtones and a lot of gruff talk, the action had a little graphic violence but nothing a kid hasn't seen in a video game. Go see Warcraft. I think you'll like it, like me!</fullReview>

The facial animations, as subtle as they were done sometimes, made Durotan more believable than any characters played by actual actors.Honestly I expected nothing and was still disappointed.

		<shortDescription>Stop comparing it to Lord of the Rings!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get your heads out of your backsides! The Warcraft universe is something utterly different and there is literally nothing to compare it to. Lord of the Rings is a generic, slow paced and boring movie that somehow became a classic, even though there's nothing really great or unique about it. Warcraft is not even trying to be similar to the LotR, but somehow there's this bunch of people who are making an unnecessary parallels between the two. Warcraft is more like Star Wars, because of it's unique taste, which you can either accept or not.I believe most of the people who passionately and blindly hates Warcraft, do so only because it's a video game adaptation. I have no other explanation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the great things about Warcraft on the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living in Japan, I had to wait until July 1st 2016 to eventually see the Warcraft movie. By then, I had found it impossible to avoid the negative internet vibe emanating from the mainstream media, so I was a little unsure when I walked into the cinema.I needn't have worried. I loved every second of the movie. EVERY SECOND. The cast was superb, the direction excellent, the soundtrack stirring, the script perfectly balanced, and visually - well, it's just stunning. If there is just one thing extra I might ask for in this movie, it would be an extra 20-25 minutes running time to add a few more details to certain characters and plot points - but that's what DVDs are for, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a truly hefty extended version when it comes out to buy.Seriously - to everyone involved with this movie, you should be proud of yourselves. You took everything that is great about Warcraft and its universe and put it on the big screen. If I ever get the chance, I would like to buy every one of you a drink and shake you firmly by the hand. In short, this is the most fun I've had in the cinema for years.I can understand why the mainstream media and it's legions of small-minded, nay-saying reviewers didn't get Warcraft, and I actually prefer that they didn't (or perhaps couldn't) get the movie. That's absolutely fine by me.This is so good I might even go back to see it at the cinema again - that's something I haven't done in quite a while.To the producers - keep 'em coming, please!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really skeptical before I got to the cinema. The moment I started watching the intro to the movie though, I started having this weird grin on my face that I just couldn't remove for the entirety of the movie.Those 2 hours that I spent watching the movie were more than worth the money that I spent on the ticket to see it (it cost me about 4 bucks). The CGI was amazing, the majority of the actors were really good in the movie, the plot was really original when it comes to fantasy movies and it was just overall simply fun to watch.My only gripe is that sometimes while watching the movie I felt like there were some scenes missing from it (like they were shot, but removed afterwards), which makes me wonder if they will ever release an extended edition of the movie if it does well. Some of those scenes might have helped character development, but still I really liked the final product that Mr. Jones gave us. Warcraft is something that you simply must see if you like fantasy, but even if you don't you will most likely find yourself really enjoying it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do Not Listen To The Critics Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so I've inconsistently played World of Warcraft since I was like six years old (starting up new characters every few years) and I was so excited when I heard about this movie! Then the movie comes out and I'm about to go see it so I check what reviews it's getting from the magazines and such and I'm really not surprised. I didn't know until afterwards that it was actually based on the Warcraft game and not WoW, but I knew anyways that the critics would immediately put this movie down because it was based on a game and it apparently has to be Oscar-worthy to get any positive feedback. Anyways, don't let what they say stop you from seeing it because it's awesome!! The main pull is the effects!! Oh my good lord, the effects are unreal and I would watch the movie just for that. I find that whole world super cool and mystical anyways but on the big screen like that it was amazing. I couldn't find a ton of connections between the game and the movie, but a little ways in I realized it was an actual origin story and not just the game's story that it tells when you first start an account. Storyline wise I really did like it, none of it felt really forced or anything. My one big negative about the movie was the fact that they had to put in an unnecessary romance like all movies apparently have to have. Besides that, I want to see the next one because the ending was good and seemed to set up the chance for more movies. tl&amp;dr: Insanely good. Even if you don't know what WoW is, I recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many other Warcraft gamers, I have been waiting for this movie to come out for years and years, ten years for me to be exact. When I finally knew for sure that the movie was actually going to happen I became scared, what if this movie was just to squeeze a few more bucks out of a "ancient game" what if now that most of the remaining population is more into orc lore the movie was based solely on orcs, what if on a lot of things, and then with the horrible rotten tomatoes review it took me nearly 2 weeks to finally build up the courage to go and see the movie.I won't say a single thing to spoil anything at all to other die hard fans but I will say that they did a absolute amazing job blending the horde and the alliance into a perfect story, everyone and everything is included to be sure and not disappoint anyone's faction and you will find yourself feeling for all the characters on both sides. The scenery, the music, the battles, the magic, literally everything was perfect about this movie. Shame on rotten tomatoes, and the negative critics. The fans have clearly stated through numbers alone what a success this movie is, breaking records and taking names, just as the game did. Warcraft for life, and I absolutely can't wait until the next!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into the movie theater expecting the movie to be a complete let down based on the reviews of many critics. I'm very surprised to find out it was actually pretty good. For one thing, the cities and locations in the movie were spectacular and the battle scenes were phenomenal. But the CGI must have been the best part. The orcs were my favorite part of the movie because of how amazing they looked. Medivh was a little dull but overall the characters were very interesting and engaging to watch. I still can't believe the critics have rated this movie so low. I thought they did a great job of fitting the massive amount of lore into one movie. I hope they make a sequel because this movie was really good. There were a few flaws to the movie. I didn't understand why they showed Ironforge or had the meeting in Goldshire instead of Stormwind. Otherwise, the movie was very well made and performed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world of Azeroth is ruled by a mix race of elves, dwarfs, gnomes, orcs, and trolls. They are invaded by the warlike Orc. The Orcs aren't very smart but they do possess a code of honor and are very warlike. When their world is destroyed but the powerful yet evil magic of the Fel, they are forced to relocate in order to save their race. Aided by a portal under the magic of the Fel, the Orcs are transported into the world of Aredoth.The narrative focuses on the human warriors and their protector is a Gaudian Madivh. He's a powerful wizard. Madivh displays of magic are top notch. It really is better than its rivals movies. I don't want to mention any names but I recommend that you to go by the first guess that comes to mind. Although I will give you a hint: the rival movies have several installments and a few are on the list of highest grossing films ever made.Madivh and their other soldiers must figure out how to defend their kingdom from the Orcs. The Orcs are lead by an evil Shaman named Gul'dan. Gul'dan controls the Fel magic.The film is so well done. Visually stunning. You can actually see their facial expressions that are so human like. So, I give a huge thumbs up to the visual effects team.The story is straightforward and fairly easy to understand therefore you can follow the plot even if you're newcomer to the Warcraft lore. The voice actors for the various race of Orcs is superb! The other actors are wonderful in their respective roles. The narrative really lends enough buildup to support most of the battle sequences and there are plenty of those! Terrific movie to accompany a date or even your family. There isn't any gore at all so it's appropriate for children ages 10 and up. Another feature of this film that I enjoyed was it's presentation in the writing and script. The script is minimal,no pompous dialog whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Warcraft. You can probably chalk that up in part to the countless hours I've personally spent in the World of Azeroth but the movie certainly does not deserve the negative reception it's received so far. I found this movie vastly more entertaining than the Lord of the Rings trilogy.People say there are holes in the plot but I feel like the pieces were there but they didn't put them together. They don't spend much time on the fact that Gul'Dan is demon possessed which drives much of the story. Probably because they didn't want parents to have to have a discussion about demons with their children after the movie... There are a couple rough casting decisions that were probably made to keep the already high budget a little more manageable but outside of that, I loved everything about this movie and it bugs that crap out of me that it's getting such a negative reception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What were the critics smoking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I finally got around to seeing the new Warcraft movie in theaters. I've seen the previews, read the dismal critical reviews, and heard all about how it tanked at the box office, at least here in the States, so I went into it with rather low expectations. But as a rabid WoW player and a person heavily versed in Warcraft lore, I had to see it, regardless of the reviews. Was it perfect? No. Was it a great movie? No. Did it stick to Warcraft Lore perfectly? No. Was it the "worst movie of the year"? Not even close. The acting was solid, the effects were good, the fight scenes were engaging,(the scene where the Stormwind infantry form the shield wall had me jumping up and pumping my fist while shouting "Hell yeah!") the fictional world of Azeroth was well portrayed, and all together, it was a pretty good movie, if it didn't quite fulfill my hopes. Granted, as a WoW player, I knew what was going on and knew who was who, and can see how non players could get a little confused, but still, the story wasn't that hard to follow even if you've never heard of the games. Most of the fan reviews I've read have been positive, with many saying they plan to see it again. I myself plan to go see it for the 2nd time later today. If you haven't seen it yet and are a fan of the games, or of fantasy in general, I urge you to give it a try. It's not perfect, but WAY better than the critics say, and here's hoping there's a Warcraft 2, which irons out the bugs from this one.</fullReview>

Yes it did, but I forgave it the flaws because it was a film made with passion and love, by people who really care about the world and its people.

		<shortDescription>This Will Surpass Your Expectations!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, a couple things about me... I'm old. I played the MMO on it's first night of release in 2004. I'm jaded. Especially when it comes to video adaptations. I'm skeptical of gratuitous CGI.Warcraft managed to turn every one of my preconceived notions around on me. I went to see it out of pure nostalgia. Let's see how they completely obliterate this. It happened to so many video game adaptations that should never have been made, I had no reason to believe this was any different.I walked out of the theater and literally said out loud, "That was excellent!" Sure I haven't played the video games in over ten years now, and my friend who accompanied me had never played any Warcraft games at all, yet that didn't interfere with his enjoyment of the film at all.If you're a Warcraft fan, every element of this film is a loyal nod to the original material; From the bricks in the buildings and familiar landmarks of Azeroth, to the over-sized armor and even the musical score was beautifully composed in that iconic WoW style.For once, CGI is used properly: To give the characters and creatures that distinctive look. It's never distracting! Which is amazing! Because I am so tired of these 200 million dollar movies using CGI just to say "Look at me! I have 200 Million dollars!" I have so much respect for the filmmakers who opted to use CGI to bring the characters to life rather than give us a shoddy substitute with big explosions.I walked out absolutely delighted with the film. It had a cohesive storyline; Well defined characters that are faithful to the original context they are adapted from, and the visuals are used in masterful ways that will leave you in awe. Don't let a lack of familiarity with Warcraft stop you from seeing this film. It stands on it's own merits and is the perfect introduction to that universe and legacy that has been so successfully created over the last two decades.If you are familiar with the film, I leave you with something that made me laugh out loud in the theater with absolutely stupid joy: Keep and eye out for the Murloc!!Bluhrglelerglelurglelurgle!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get Critics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Short Review. I like Fantasy, very much. Lord of the Rings is my favorite Film of all Time, I know Warcraft for quite some time and the film from it is quite nice. I understand and saw a few ,,Why is this happening?''-Scenes in the Film, but not enough to rate it very low or to make it 37/100 in Metascore. I had much fun in it and it does not deserve these bad critics, at all. I don't know the game, I only know it exists and I find it really good. It is important to point it, that this is not by far Lord of the Rings, it is a completely different thing, as a whole. It takes the game and tell a story, a very heavy story, yes, but a very good one. These are the flaws I saw, plus two or three scenes, that does not make sense to me. Still, I loved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Exceeds All Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, even though I counted down the days to the release in great anticipation, I had my doubts and concerns on how they intended to base the plot. 1- Worried they would do as many anticipated, WOW themed, and was not thrilled (explained in #3). Then the first trailer came out and I find the plot is centered around the actual story-line and explaining the birth of Warcraft. First concern reassured and +1 in approval. 2- Worried it would turn out like 99% of 'game inspired movies' and flop. When in reality I can't really think of anything that could have made this film any better. The CGI was some of the best I've seen, it was extremely well written, and very well performed. Hands down the best 'game inspired movie' of all time and adding to my approval +8. 3- Worried it would end up as a 'one&amp;done' film. The way this film played out left a gaping hole of possibilities for the series to grow making me foresee, at the very least, two more films coming our way adding a final +2 to my approval. **For those paying attention, yes that adds up to 11 but IMDb will only allow a max rating of 10.**In conclusion, I am relieved to say this turned out to be nothing I expected, but instead, exceeded all my expectations and threw up a big "F#$% You" to all my doubts during pre-production and filming. This is absolutely the movie to see for any Blizzard fan, SyFi fan, and, in my opinion, even those who are not fans will still enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps it was ten years too late</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to take this film seriously, or even see it as an installment to the Warcraft franchise. To older fans of a now twenty plus year old franchise, it might just seem like a bad parody video on Youtube. To newer fans, it may seem wonderful because they believe its reigniting the legacy of a franchise's heyday they were never around for. To those uninitiated with the story at all, it may just feel like yet another bad fantasy flick on par with Gods of Egypt or Wrath of the Titans made for children.A severely diluted and inaccurate retelling of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, one might wonder what the point of this film even was. Why go through the effort to dramatically change it for the worst, and deliver it through poor dialogue executed through overacting which starred actors who might not even be considered B List quality? We're introduced to bland and dry humans who wear bad Ren Faire garb or armor that is humorously far more ornate and impractical than what we even see in the games (which is accompanied with an excessive amount of post-production metallic clanking sound effects), and to contradicting and superficial orcs donned in pseudo-primitive attire rendered so poorly that you might begin to question the effectiveness of motion capture. Through superfluous narrative, the plot thrusts us from one green screen sound stage to the next, barely giving us time to garner a sense of atmosphere as we're whisked away within three to five minutes to yet another random locale. To those unfamiliar with the franchise, they're never likely to remember the goofy names or nomenclature of the characters and unique story elements, and they're undoubtedly lost in the sheer amount of backstory that's never unveiled but simply implied to fans who spent years soaking it all up. The CGI rendering of the inhuman races (sans elves) might make one question the wisdom in such a decision; to waste more money on rendering them, rather than simply using practical effects and costumes on appropriate actors as has been done in fantasy films prior. The elves in question might present an answer to that, as they appeared to be shoddy quality cosplayers with poorly fabricated latex ears, foam fantasy outfits, bad wigs and LED light contact eye lenses. The question as to whether this will prevail over the likes of Lord of the Rings or not is quite evident: it will not. Lord of the Rings provided great immersion for longtime fans, while Warcraft could hardly make one believe any of it; from the over usage of huge light show spectacles for otherwise simple magical spells to incoherent plot progression and more than questionable (or confusing) character decisions, it's certainly not going to dethrone the LotR films anytime soon.When it all boils down to the future of this film venture, the franchise could only continue if it willfully alienates those who have never played the games and caters strictly to those who know the wide berth of backstory, as the vast amount of plot holes and unanswered questions can only worsen as they delve into the stories of the later games, which feature far more plot elements which the filmmakers could never squeeze into the respective subsequent films. While at the same time, how soon could we expect to see a sequel, given the production hell this very film endured, and the divided response it garnered? If not for China, this film may very well have failed to break budget, as it hasn't even grossed three times what it cost in total. Given Legendary Pictures was acquired by a Chinese production company during the production of this film, what fans this film has garnered may be relieved if a sequel is produced if just because of the positive interest the Chinese audience has shown in this film, as undoubtedly no American company would trust a sequel to succeed based on the poor domestic US box office results.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Jesus gave up on the world....after seeing "Warcraft"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, if you are one of those people who've asked themselves, why has Jesus forsaken the world, and when is he coming back?! Your answers are, because of "Warcraft" and never.I am not familiar with the game (games?!), so I am not judging them. The movie, while based on the game and perhaps appealing primarily to that fan base, should also try, at least try, to appeal to wider audiences who are perhaps not familiar with it.Well it doesn't! This movie is unforgivingly boring, the cast is sub par and so is the acting...the directing and the production values are just underwhelming! Besides, seeing Ruth Negga and Dominic Cooper share the screen yet again, I can see why the TV series "Preacher" over on AMC sucks..."Warcraft" also amounts to visual plagiarism of "The Lord Of The Rings" and "The Hobbit" movies...something it doesn't even try to hide.I had high hopes, then just hope, then reasonable expectations, that "Warcraft" would deliver the kind of fun, well made, summer popcorn movie entertainment we've been missing. But it doesn't do any of those things. Instead "Warcraft" joins a long line of lame, crummy, lacklustre and failed video game adaptations.I think that Jesus saw this movie...and suddenly realized he died for nothing, so he said "F **k it!" and then cancelled the Second Coming..."Warcraft" is basically larping with a $170 million dollars budget!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another bad video game and fantasy adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasy has not had a great history of cinema with the exception of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. Video game adaptations have an even more dubious history. Warcraft melds the two genres into a terrible movie that has very few redeeming qualities. One thing about the movie that I did enjoy were the special effects. The film does a great job making the Orcs look real and humanizing them despite being CGI characters.The genre has not attracted the finest actors but Travis Fimmel is passable as the protagonist just as long as he doesn't have to show any real emotions. There are a few parts where he is supposed to be sad that just come off as ridiculous but he takes his humor and Vikings experience to elevated his game just a little bit. The rest of the cast is awful from Paula Patton as the half-orc/half-human mumbling over her fake teeth or Ben Foster doing a poor impression of Gandalf. It does not bode well for the so far somewhat disappointing Preacher comic TV show adaptation that the two lead actors Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga show up in this movie and phone in performances.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catering to the juvenile Warcraft gamers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason why real gamers pick on Warcraft gamers as being immature, and the least respectable of gamers. Blizzard doesn't care so much about quality as they do for their bottom line, so integrity in gaming goes out the window, especially obviously in movie making as well, and flashy over the top seeming special effects trickery get lost with the extremely weak and unmotivated story line. The majority of most of the character motivation are lost with unexplained illogical pettiness. All of the civilian reviews are of Warcraft gamers base. If Blizzard didn't have that they would never have made a movie knowing they would not have gotten their money back. There are some that even dare to compare this to 'Lord Of The Rings'. Are you kidding me? They are different worlds, and don't even belong in the same universe. If Bizarro would have made a fantasy movie based off of 'Lord Of The Rings', 'Warcraft' would have been it. Flashy special effects can fool the least intellectually challenged among us, and the weak story line, and conversations can and did smoothly slip by like a snake to the uninitiated. Even the special effects really weren't that well done. If I can tell it's CGI then it's not very good. The whole point is to fool you that its real isn't it? It's an 'Avatar' wanna be. It's the same people that think '2012', 'Battleship', 'Hardcore Henry' where phenomenal movies. If you are one of those people I'm sure you will be tickled pink by the lost attempts at humor, and puns. The only time I knew there was a joke intended was because of the very awkward long pause. Then I was left thinking, what was the joke?I have played Warcraft for years, and had thee most successful guild of over 300 active players on my server, and quit, because of the maturity factor with the game and the players. Too much trolling. So if you are of the more cerebral variety you won't get much from this movie including your money back. There is a reason why we need to ignore the wanna be civilian critics since they tend to always be wrong, and rate opposite of official critics. Why is that? Take a look at Rotten Tomatoes. 27%. I didn't think anything could be worse than 'Superman vs. Batman'. I was wrong. You will get the same shameless overzealous immature wanna be critics of that movie as well saying it's the best movie ever! I think there should be consequences for these critics that they pay for your ticket if you didn't like the movie, and I don't mean little bit, but hated it. Maybe then they would be a bit more conservative with their over zealous critique. Comparing this to 'Lord Of The Rings' is beyond laughable. No Oscar nominations for this movie, not even for special effects. LOL</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft: The Beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World of Warcraft is one of the most successful video game franchises of all time, I've never played it myself, I've just seen images and heard of the fandom, and seen both spoofed in a hilarious episode of South Park, I went to see this because it had a good trailer, directed by the late great David Bowie's son, Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code). Basically the lush world of Azeroth, occupied by human and dwarf people, had been peaceful for a long time, but then orcs escaped their dying home world of Draenor, travelling through a portal activated by magic into this new land. Since then the Azeroth civilisation and the orcs have been strong opponents, orc Durotan (Toby Kebbell), the Frostwolf clan chieftain, only wants to save his people, including mate Draka (Anna Galvin) who gave birth to their son after they entered the kingdom. Durotan is prepared if necessary to attempt to make peace with the enemy, but green-skinned orc Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), who possesses evil powers, wants to take over the kingdom. Sir Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), the military commander of the kingdom of Stormwind, King Magni Bronzebeard (Michael Adamthwaite), dwarf ruler of Ironforge, and Llane Wrynn, King of Stormwind (Dominic Cooper) are among the characters either to find a way to create peace between the two sides, or indeed a way to defend themselves from the oncoming collision. This includes the introduction of a weapon called the Boomstick (a gun), and consulting Medivh (Ben Foster), the fabled Guardian, of course the friction between the two sides, the Alliance and the Horde, is increased, and with magic brought into the equation the situation intensifies when they go into battle. Also starring Paula Patton as Garona (who appears to be half-human and half-orc), Ben Schnetzer as Khadgar, EastEnders' Robert Kazinsky as Orgrim, Ruth Negga as Lady Taria, Clancy Brown as Blackhand and Callum Keith Rennie as Moroes. Computer geeks across the world must have been excited to hear there was going be a movie adaptation of this phenomenon, unfortunately this follows in the footsteps of Super Mario Bros., Tomb Raider and Doom, it based on a video game that millions have played, but even the connoisseurs will be let down by the result. There is so much going on, underdeveloped characters and a flimsy plot, that I lost my way many times, you cannot deny that the special effects to create the many mythical creatures and bring to life the engaging climactic battles are amazing, but that's about it, unfortunately it is a fairly boring and disappointing fantasy film. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A textbook of clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only a matter of time before the massive online role-playing game World of Warcraft was adapted for the big screen. With high fantasy still hugely popular thanks to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies and HBO's Game of Thrones, now seemed the ideal time to bring Warcraft's world of orcs, mages, trolls and elves to the cinema-going audience. Yet even with a talented director at the helm, Duncan Jones, Warcraft flopped hard domestically, but proved such a smash-hit in China that there's now talk of a sequel tailored solely for the Chinese market. That little factoid, symbolic of the increasing importance of overseas box- office to U.S. productions, is probably the only interesting thing to emerge from the film.Somewhere in this tale of giant green orcs, giant grey orcs, magical portals, hairy men, hairier mages, grumpy dwarfs and huge CGI battles, there's the faint whiff of a plot that focuses on both sides of a war between the peaceful humans and a brutal hoard of orcs. In order to cater for us noobs - those of us who have never spent days slurping energy drinks and munching on Doritos in front of our computer playing the game - writers Jones and Charles Leavitt spend most of the film explaining this world to us and the many factions that operate within it. The main focus on both sides of the battle is Durotan (Toby Kebbell), an orc chieftain with a pregnant partner, and Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), a stock warrior-type with a charisma vacuum.Durotan is under the command of warlock Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), who has already sucked the life out of one world using a dangerous magic called 'fel' and has used sorcery to open a portal into the next world, Azeroth. Lothar, observing the devastation caused by one of their attacks, comes across mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), who wants to bring the traces of fel to the attention of Guardian Medivh (Ben Foster) and the king Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper). When an orc scouting party are beaten by Lothar and his fellow humans, they capture half-orc slave Garona (Paula Patton) and send Durotan back to the hoard defeated. However, seeing the devastation Gul'dan is causing to the land and his dismissal of honourable orc tradition, Durotan secretly plans to team up with the humans to defeat the evil tyrant and free his people.I actually quite enjoyed the opening 30 minutes of Warcraft. Unhappy with portraying yet another man vs. evil orcs story, Jones' decision to give them both a voice is a breathe of fresh air. But this thoughtful approach quickly gives away to a textbook of clichés, from the humble warrior with a great destiny to the annoying young sidekick who just may be the one to save them all. And don't expect a complete film, as the 'Beginning' in the title means exactly that. Clearly the film-makers were banking on squeezing a trilogy out of this, and don't bother to give us an actual conclusion that would make us want to see a next instalment. With daft names that anyone unfamiliar with the world of Azeroth won't remember, you'll be too busy trying to figure out what's going on to care about many of the characters, with only Kebbell - delivering another impressive motion-capture performance - and Foster getting through it with their reputation in tact. And so the search for a decent video game adaptation goes on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Normal Movie, Amazing 3D Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best times I've had in a movie theater, especially as a 3D experience (No, I didn't see Avatar in theaters). The movie itself is good but not great. However, the visuals, spectacle and fantasy aspect make it a spectacular movie when it's seen in a theater in 3D. Throughout the movie you care about some of the characters and the story itself is fairly compelling although the ending feels rather convenient and the conclusion (that Anduin hooks up with Garona and becomes king) feels derivative (of Return of the King) and like the writers took the rather easy and clichéd way out. However, this fits the format of the movie, which is basically mainstream fantasy story with emotional moments sprinkled throughout the movie. All-in-all, this is a good, solid movie that sets up the lore of the world while leaving you with questions you still want answered and gives equal attention to the characters and the world they are in, which is more than previous video-game movies have been able to do. Warcraft proves that it is not impossible to make a good movie based on a video game and will hopefully open the doors for future video-game movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a mess. But a fun mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never played the older Warcraft games on PC, nor WOW. So that's where I'm coming from. But even if I was a die-hard WOW player I doubt I would have gotten much more out of this CG heavy fantasy action spectacle. Fact is, it's a bit of a mess. Warcraft is what you get when you try to cram an epic LOTR story inside a 2 hour movie. Because of this the movie feels rushed, and a little disorienting. It feels like they were trying to cram decades worth of Warcraft lore into one film, whilst at the same time trying to make it as accessible as possible to the masses. Whilst the story can be followed (it is a fairly generic formulaic tale) we get little bits of information that don't really make sense and aren't explained enough, or at all. Example: the magic. To put it basically, Blue = Good, Green = Bad. But I was waiting for information about the magic itself, how the orcs came to possess it, why there was only one orc to become corrupted by it, how the Guardian became possessed by it etc etc. So much of Warcraft's story needed to be fleshed out more thoroughly. It feels like there is a 4 hour cut of this film that has been butchered down to 2, and as a result is far less enjoyable than it could have been.Performances are pretty average across the board. Nobody looks that invested in the material. The CG is decent, albeit occasionally pretty cheap looking. Its a bit troubling when CG in 2016 is not on par with LOTR circa 2000. But honestly it is pretty good. The orcs all look pretty impressive, and the lighting effects are good.Warcraft is a fun, no brainer kinda film. But the problem with Warcraft is that while watching I couldn't help thinking i would rather be watching LOTR instead. Epic tale, great CG, great acting, fleshed out story and characters. All the things that Warcraft fails at for the most part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An invasion not totally supported by the invaders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft is an extremely dense movie considering that fantasy fiction movies are expected to have simplistic stories that are easily followed by a fourth grade child. Though LoTR introduced us to complex fantasy storytelling, Warcraft is among the first of big budget fantasy fiction movies to show us a story that gives its viewers a grey-vs-grey narrative instead of clear-cut heroes vs mustache-twirling villains. Make no doubt, there are villains and heroes in this story--but their alliances are not so razor-sharp. This may have played into why the movie wasn't as big a success as it should have been--especially in the West, we want our heroes and villains to be easy to define and easy to identify, which is not completely the case in this story. For those gamers familiar with the lore of Warcraft, this movie will satisfy; but for those unfamiliar, there may be an existential challenge, simply because there is no clear line of demarcation between good and evil--there are two poles, and a large muddle of in-betweens that more reflect real life than we might like to admit. The fact that there is no ultimate triumph of good over evil (which also pervades the game itself) might disappoint. But nonetheless it holds very true to the strong morals present in the game, and as a player for 10+ years I can't help but love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as good as fans want it to be, but better than critics say it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this is my take on Warcraft, as a long-time WoW player.This is yet another example of how critics and fans can have such radically different viewpoints on movies. And honestly, there's nothing wrong or particularly surprising with it. Average movie-goers just want to have fun. Critics have the job to actually look further into a movie, to detect its faults and praise whatever small details are deserving of such praise. What's happening with Warcraft is that fans are giving it way too much credit, and critics are apparently unable to look past its shortcomings.As a fan of the video game, I enjoyed watching the movie. However, I can't help but feel that some things have been handed miserably. The story is based on the first video game, Warcraft I, but it doesn't follow the script at 100%. Such changes could bring a breath of fresh air to the Warcraft lore, improving what might otherwise not have been good story-telling choices. However, pretty much every of those chances have been a turn for the worst. Take Garona, for example. In the video game, she kills King Llane because she is being mind-controlled by Gul'dan, not because the king tells her to "kill him so that the world has a hope to have peace", which is a pretty stupid justification. How would Garona personally killing him do that? Furthermore, there's that cringe-worthy love-story with Lothar, which serves absolutely no purpose. Warcraft the film is filled which such side-stories that don't seem to develop anywhere that made them worthy to be in the film in the first place. As a result, they are often unbelievable. Lothar's son dies in battle, just in front of him as he is left to watch without being able to intervene. What could have been a great scene, even by the standards of film in general and not only the niche that video game film is, loses all the impact when 1) Lothar shows pretty much no emotion, in one of the worst acting examples of the entire film; 2) the audience never develops an emotional connection with his son because he is seen so few times in the movie and never meaningfully. Then there is the dissidence from Orgrim Doomhammer, which never goes anywhere, because in the movie he doesn't get to face Blackhand. Instead, Lothar does, which never happened in the game and has no good reason to be in the movie either, instead for a cool looking action scene that reinforces the cool-guy type of character that he is.Going back to the chances from the original lore, we can blame Hollywood on this one, because most movies nowadays don't seem to be audacious enough to do any kind of ending but happy endings. In Warcraft the game, Stormwind city is razed by the orcs, and Humans, lead by Lothar, are left to seek refuge north, and form the Kingdom of Lordaeron. In the movie, no such thing happens. The movie repeatedly seems to take the parts that make Warcraft lore so compelling and audacious and turn them into bland, generic Hollywood clichés, in an attempt to appeal to a general public that, honestly, will probably never care that much about the film and would probably enjoy the original story a lot more. And here is where most critics go wrong: they'd rather bash on Warcraft for doing the best they can than on Hollywood producers who don't want to take risks and would rather have every movie follow the same formulae.On to the acting, yet another part where the film falls short is that the orcs are somehow so much more believable than the humans. Humans' acting is a bit poor and unbelievable, passable at best, Medivh being one of the worst examples, in my opinion. It doesn't help that their armor, their swords, their crowns, etc., seem to be made in cheap plastic. Compare it to the orcs, which are maybe one of the best examples of CGI done right up to this date. Orcs are believable, show a great range of emotions, they at the very least seem to have some weight. However, dwarfs and elves also show up in this movie, and they don't seem so believable. Elves' ears look made of plastic, their glowing eyes made of very poor CGI. In general, though, the CGI is done right, with beautiful environments and special effects. But it is also done very poorly at such times.The movie isn't all bad, though. Action scenes are decent, orc scenes are amazingly well-done, the environments are beautiful and there's enough humor and drama to keep you entertained, if you like the fantasy genre and/or are a fan of the Warcraft universe. But it falls short because it could have been much more. Those who know the Warcraft lore know how rich and compelling it truly is. Warcraft the movie is afraid to take risks, and follows a formulaic path instead that is so common to Hollywood blockbusters. There is enough Warcraft here to keep you entertained, but it's no Lord of the Rings. If they fix some of its shortcomings in an eventual sequel, however, it may manage to become more than a mere video game movie. Until then, that's what it is. Entertaining, but ultimately shallow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They say this blockbuster season was the worst in decade but so far I'm surprised by the quality of films such as the latest X-Men film and this movie. Sure, they won't become classics but they are bonafide blockbusters: 100% epic entertainment from start to finish.I'm not a Warcraft fan at all. I do play roleplaying games but I found World of Warcraft to be rather mediocre and I was never a fan of strategy games. So I went into this film not being a fan or even very familiar with the Warcraft franchise but still knowing its cultural impact. I can say that I finally understand the obsession of the fans with the lore of Warcraft. It is rather compelling and I'm looking forward to the next film to continue the saga.Having said that, this film is far from perfect. It is clear they have a lot of great content to work with but somehow it feels half done. Even so, that's still sufficient for a solid score in my opinion. But it feels like the movie could have been better if they had given us a slower introduction to the world and the characters. I only started to care for most of them in the final act of the film.At the same time I feel the film shouldn't have been longer since I sometimes wasn't fully engaged as it was. Characters make or break a film so I don't endorse simply adding more content but if the film had add 30-45 minutes to better flesh out the characters and story then it would have made for a better film. Particularly the opening felt rushed and was uneasy for me as someone who was new to the franchise.I advice the creators to look at Lord of the Rings (LOTR). The discovery of the orc invasion and the dark magic behind it could have been revealed at a much slower pace similar to the discovery of the ring in LOTR. They would have made me more engaged in both the characters and the story which would have also made me more interested in the action and effects (which remain topnotch by themselves regardless).In short, this movie showed a lot of potential and I think the sequel can fully realize it. The great thing about the Warcraft franchise is that it appears to deal with generations and the next could focus on the son of the king and the orc chieftan. So the creators have a change to re-introduce the world and the plot line at a better pace and in a more compelling way in their next outing! Looking forward to it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really enjoyable for both fans of the games and genre fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film a couple of days ago and waited to write this review so I could reflect a bit on it.Because when you're dealing with a film which is based on a game franchise, you have to look at things from different perspectives. The people who played the games and know what they exactly want from this film. The lore has to make sense for these people (and I have to say that for the most part it seems to be pretty accurate). And then there are the people who just want to watch an enjoyable film without having to care about the lore of the games.So why did I give this film a 7? Because I think this is one of the better video game films to date. Is it perfect? No. Especially not for those who absolutely don't know anything about the games and their lore. The first part of the film has the inevitable problem of cramming in a lot of characters and lore in a relative short time. However, I have to say that the backstory is told in a very focused way so they kind of get away with it. Nevertheless the film could have used 15 more minutes to explain everything at a slower pace IMO. Don't worry though the plot is pretty clear and you won't feel left out if you don't know anything of the games.One thing I kind of missed was build up in some places. Especially the fight scenes. You might say why do you need build up in big fight scenes. Well let me compare it to another successful fantasy franchise: Lord Of The Rings. The fights in the Lord Of The Rings films have a strong build up where the armies are facing each other. This adds to the tension and make the fights all the more epic (at least IMO).In Warcraft you don't really have that. I personally missed that a bit, especially for the last fight scene.I really liked the music in this film. It's excellent, no other words for it. The effects are really impressive. The Orcs look brilliant. Other effects are also well done.Another thing I really liked was how colourful this film was. Everything from the effects to the landscapes have lots of colour which makes it really enjoyable to watch.The plot of the film is pretty straight forward. Humans vs Orcs + an orc chieftain (Durotan) who doubts in the Orc leader Gul'dan. everything is pretty simple to follow. Don't expect a very deep story. That said the plot is delivered in a good way so it never comes over as confusing. In fact it's fairly predictable what will happen towards the end of the film.There are no big surprises or plot twists.The Character development is pretty well done... for the most part. Durotan and Garona are the ones that stand out for me. Others like Callan (Anduin Lothar's son) could have used a bit more development. Callan basically comes over as "I want to please my father" and that's it. Overall the acting is well done and the build up for a next installment is there (like you would expect from it). In conclusion I can say that I enjoyed Warcraft. I personally think critics expected too much of it. They expected the next Lord Of The Rings (which it definitely isn't) since it was directed by a very capable director. There are definitely things that could have been done better but at the end of the day, I liked it.To end this review I will say that those who know the lore will probably give this film 7 - 8 out of 10. Which is what I would give it as well. Those who don't know anything about the lore might give it a lower score. Something around 6,5 - 7 out of 10.I personally recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the games and to fans of the fantasy genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. I played the very first Warcraft game when I was 8-9 years old, and I've played Warcraft 2, 3 and World of Warcraft as well, so I do really appreciate these games. Especially Warcraft 3 was an extremely good game.However.... This movie just falls short on multiple fronts. The biggest downfall for this movie is probably the dialogue is extremely poor. You have people like Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper and you give them such below-average dialogue which causes all that potential and talent to just go to waste, it's just left unused. Also, they made the classic mistake of rushing the story line, you don't really get to know any of the characters, you don't really get to feel anything for them. Otherwise, the CGI was actually quite good, and this movie could have done very well if the storyline/writing was better. Unfortunately, this is not the case.Lucky for Warcraft fanboys like me, it seems to have done well in the box-office so maybe we will get a sequel with a better storyline :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i should say that i do not know Warcraft the video game. I know of its existence of course and i know it by name - but i never played it, nor did i ever learn about the story, factions and everything else.With that said - i should say that i found the story to be highly confusing. Most of the time i had no idea what was going on, who were the good or the bad guys.However - the movie looks good. It merges CGI and human characters surprisingly well (mostly by making the live action actors more cartoonish - in a good way) But is it a good movie? - i was not bored; but i did not understand most of it. -... sooo - yeah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not without its faults, but even so, this is what video game movies should aspire to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start the review by saying that I am a long time player of both Warcraft and World of Warcraft series, so my review will be affected by the fact that I am a fan. It would probably be very different if I were a person who never played any of the games.That said, this is probably the main fault of this movie as a movie in general. It will hardly appeal to anyone who hasn't played the games. Why? Because the movie has so much content in a short amount of time, it was hard enough to not get a little lost watching it even as someone who already more or less knew who everyone on screen was and where they were. But for a first timer, I can imagine it being extremely confusing. Imagine if the three Hobbit movies (not talking about the book), and all the content they contained, were mashed into one, roughly 2 hour long movie. It would be a deeply confusing experience. This is about the scope of Warcraft. The scope of this movie is huge. It deals with two major factions, having prominent characters on both sides, and covers quite a hefty amount of events as it goes. It should have been a three hour movie, easily. And it wouldn't have felt needlessly padded, in my opinion. Perhaps later we'll have a director's cut released that will slow the pacing down a little, but until then, this movie blazes through too much, too quickly. And yes, the infamous romance should have been left out- it felt unnatural, with no chemistry, and seemed to be added as an afterthought, following the age old movie principle that the main guy from one faction and the badass girl from the other have to get together at some point on screen or we can't have a movie. The screen time that took could have been used for something more important.That said, all that criticism aside, this movie is great. It is clearly a movie made with existing fans in mind, with no shortage of fanservice everywhere. But it's not just thrown in as an afterthought. The movie breathes detail. It shows that the people who made the movie, loved the game, its universe, understood how everything must look, feel and sound. It is a truly wonderful experience for a fan. The locations are wonderfully well done and instantly recognisable from their in-game counterparts. The characters, even the background ones, are also instantly recognisable, sporting their iconic features, armor, weaponry and the like. It is nothing short of pleasurable to watch and immerse yourself in this experience for someone who played the games.The movie also does a brilliant job of portraying the factions just right. The Horde and the Alliance are both represented by their fair share of charismatic characters and both sides are treated fairly. There are no generic good and bad guys in this movie. This movie features a war between people, as it should. It does not openly favor one faction, in that, keeping with the tradition set by the games.Speaking of war, the action on screen does not disappoint. It's a good thing they did not make this into a kid-friendly movie, despite Warcraft having an artstyle that may make it seem appealing to kids. War is in the name, and war is brutal. You will see blood flow in this movie, the occasional limb fly and the like. It's nothing over the top or needlessly brutal. But when you have a battlefield of guys going at each other with all manner of sharp or blunt instruments of war, you should see blood, and you will in this movie. Speaking of story, I will reiterate- this is not a movie for kids. It's not a happy story. Losses will be had, sacrifices will be made and it probably won't end the way a first time viewer would predict it to end. That said, once again, it fits what I said earlier, when talking about factions- this is a story about people. Few people in this movie are wholy good or bad. Most of the characters are morally complex and thus, the story the movie tells is as well. To conclude, Warcraft is a great video game movie, a solid first entry of what I hope will be several sequels that further the story. While the movie would have benefited from longer length, so the pacing could be slowed down a bit and thus, first time viewers would not be as confused, this is clearly a movie primarily for fans. And fans will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am pretty disappointed with this movie.Don't get me wrong. It's still a decent movie, I gave it a six, it's verging on good, but not quite there.There are a fair number of things in this movie that you won't notice or won't quite make sense if you aren't familiar with the material... they never get explained or commented on. But at the same time they seem to have randomly changed some things to no benefit, and even to fairly obvious detriment. There's no one they won't kinda annoy a bit.'Decent' is pretty good for a movie, but this movie was a collaboration between LEGENDARY PICTURES and BLIZZARD. This should have been the best movie of the the year *easily*. It had everything lined up, it had piles of money behind it, but it just didn't quite...It's still a solid movie, and it's still a good choice if you're not sure what you want to watch... but this *could* have been a epic to reverberate through the ages. It's really not though.But hey, if you're bored, definitely go for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so the movie's good and you should probably go see it.Personally i'm not a WoW player, don't have much patience for all the lore and fandom related stuff. movie is solid though, very nice action!If you like Fantasy movies, or have a fond memory of playing Warcraft as a kid like me, this movie suits you just fine... i was a bit taken back with all the nasty reviews, decided to check it out anyways &amp; really happy for it. - acting was solid. nobody went 'full retard', while most leading actors were pretty darn good. - scenery &amp; world creation was top notch! immersed from the start, and i gotta say costumes rocked ass - storywise, all the characters fill like ACTUAL PERSONS with an actual juice in their brainbox. so, the script was really packed and had some plot holes, minor though, but bottom line the plot grabs you. - camera work is sweet! action scenes were tight, none of that 33k- 10-frames-shot-per-scene nonsense we usually get in action movies that get you dizzy. watched it in 3d, could follow every blow and thrust. man those orcish hand got a wi-de reach in 3d. - the laughs! this is the kind of film you watch with a crowd &amp; the punchlines will get you that crowd laughter vibes you just cant get in a living room sitdown.bad stuff: if you like to understand everything and be spoon-fed by the story, you gotta be a total fanboy to enjoy this film. if you don't like big orcs, huge swords etc, its prob. not for you. if the occasional flat CGI cover gets you totally irritated beyond relief, yeah its not for you.otherwise, don't bite into the whole sh*tty reviews fashion. go see it, you'll love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For any fan of Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft, I know you've all been waiting to see if the movie Warcraft (2016) leaves us all hanging like the last few expansions or if it was a good movie. I've been playing WoW since Vanilla and like all true Warcraft fans have lost a lot of interest in the game since Cataclysm, Blizzard has burned us all with Warlords of Draenor, Mist of Pandaria, and contemplating if to waste time playing Legion; the list just keeps going when it comes to the let downs we've endured being a Warcraft fan but??The movie? To be honest Warcraft (2016) really made me feel like playing again. Over the passing few days a few of our guildies have started logging back in the game play to see if we want to play when Legion arrives which we've all pre-order; though being that all of us have watched the film now?.. I felt like we had just played the game again. Warcraft (2016) took us on a journey in which every movement in the film reminded us of those quest lines. To see a realistic version of Stormwind, the characters in the film looking so close to reality; this film was a marvelous reminder of the game we all fell in love with.The bonuses to watching the movie Warcraft (2016) versus playing the game are you wont find any douche bags in chat or in a raid while you watch. Also we noticed the difference between the film and the game are:In the movie you don't see naked men running around with swords. You don't see dead people being tea bagged by a bear tank. There's no chat screen of whining ass-hats bickering. You don't see groups of people dancing in the middle of StormwindThat's just to name a few lol. The movie Warcraft (2016) is awesome! They done a great job with the cinematics, the story, the cast; it was perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humans vs Orcs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Warcraft", starring Travis Fimmel-Vikings_tv, The Experiment; Paula Patton-Mission Impossible:Ghost Protocol, Deja Vu; Dominic Cooper- Howard Stark in the Marvel movies &amp; TV shows, From Hell; Ben Foster-The Mechanic_2011, The Punisher_2004 and Daniel Wu-Into the Badlands_tv, The Man With the Iron Fists.This movie is based on a video game and as I have mentioned on numerous occasions before, I do not play video games. I have nothing against them, I just never had the spare time to play them, what with other interests taking up my time-which I'm sure some people would think were just as absurd time wasters as anything else that people occupy their time with, but I digress........ I CAN tell you about the movie, though. There are humans living in a kingdom called Azeroth and they are ruled by Dominic/King Wrynn. There are other types of species surrounding them, including elves and human-looking sparkly eyed creatures. Travis/Lothar is Dominic's brother-in-law and also toughest knight-in his spare time, he flies around on a bird/horse type of animal that also can handle himself in a fight. Then there are the Orcs. They are bigger than their human counterparts-and they have tusks-and they come from another planet-which is dying, by the way-through a magic portal created by Daniel/Gul'Dan to colonize our planet as their new home. Daniel uses the life force of other Orcs or humans as fuel for his magic. Ben/Medivh is Dominic's sorcerer that comes from a group of sorcerers that try to maintain order. Paula/Garona is a half Orc half human hybrid-I don't think they ever mention her back story, of how she became a half breed but I'm sure fans of the video game will know it. The motion capture characters and all the other CGI effects look really good and the battles are pretty fantastic. Wait until you see an Orc pick up a horse and throw it, knocking down opponents like bowling pins! The movie ends as if there will be more sequels, depending on box office, of course. It's rated "PG-13" for intense violence and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 3 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best video game movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft is directed by Duncan Jones and depicts the story of the first meeting between orcs and humans on the fantasy world Azeroth. This film has 2 main stories which I will talk about separately as each has their own positive and negatives. These stories do intertwine with each other, but that happens far into the movie.We begin with the orcs. We follow Durotan (played by Toby Kebbell), who is the leader of the Frostwolf clan (one of many clans of orcs living together). All he wants is the best for his clan, and he doesn't trust Gul'Dan (Excellently played by Daniel Wu, he looks and acts exactly the same in the game), who is a powerful but evil warlock. This eventually leads to Durotan trying to contact the humans for help.First of all, the motion capture for the orcs is excellent. At some points they even looked more real than the humans, if that makes sense. This was portrayed excellently in a shot at the beginning of the film, where Durotan is just looking towards the camera for an uninterrupted 10 seconds. His face moves just like a real face, and the way his expressions change is incredibly realistic. I was worried before I saw this movie as I thought CGI orcs interacting with real humans would look odd, like in The Hobbit Trilogy. I am glad to say this wasn't the case, and it worked extremely well. The only orc I didn't like was Garona, who is half orc and half draenei (other reviews I have been reading keep saying she is half human, the film never states this so i'm not sure where they're getting that from). She isn't motion captured, which I thought was strange because all the other orcs, dwarfs and night elfs were. Her performance was pretty weak, which is a shame, as I wanted to care about her character, but I didn't.I also liked the relationships between the orcs. They're not the bumbling idiots like they are portrayed in other fantasy licenses like Warhammer or LOTR. They actually have intellectual conversations with one another. I especially liked the scenes between Durotan and his wife, where they were discussing their worries about having a child. This is where Duncan Jones shines through, as his other films have been almost entirely character driven. Many were worried that a project as big as this wouldn't be possible for a director like Duncan, this isn't the case though and fans of both high octane fight scenes and insightful character interactions will be pleased.The orc combat in this film is absolutely fantastic. The brutality of the orcs as they fought against each other was incredible. The same cannot be said about human/orc combat, but the orcs look real and fight like actual living breathing creatures. There's a fight scene with Gul'Dan near the end that I won't spoil, but it is amazing and will have you gripped in your seat.The human story on the other hand is a mixed bag. We follow Anduin Lothar(played by Travis Fimmel) , a strong fighter who is trying to defend Azeroth from the orcs. We also follow a mage called Callan (played by Burkely Duffield), who is presented as an awkward, wimpy type character. There are many other characters I am not mentioning, but I'm not here to do a plot synopsis.The humans look like they're ripped straight from the game which is brilliant. They wear shiny armor with massive shoulder plates which gave me a grin. The mages are also extremely cool, with long robes and bright blue eyes. the special effects shine through here too, with the mage's spells looking amazing and feeling real within the world of the film.My main problem with the humans is that they're not explained enough. I didn't feel for any of the characters, unlike the orcs, who showed a surprising amount of emotion. A certain character died and I should have felt bad, but I didn't. Apparently 40 minutes have been cut from this movie, and it's obvious where things had been cut. I hope this cut gets released, if so i'll do another review.Now i'll talk about other aspects of the overall movie.There are many easter eggs throughout the movie which any fan of the series will notice. My favorites being a polymorph and a murloc. These are thrown in throughout and will bring on a smile from any Warcraft fan in the audience. The locations that are visited are all recognizable from the games, and seeing Ironforge and Stormwind on the big screen was great. Other races are shown throughout the film, but they are only for a short while. I wish we had more scenes with the dwarfs or night elves, they could have even helped with the battle at the end which would have been enjoyable. But, I do understand that this is based on Warcraft : Orcs and Humans, which was only about the orcs and humans. There are some differences made to the original story, but nothing was drastic and I didn't have a problem with them.Warcraft : Orcs and Humans, what this film is based on. The pacing at the start of the film was a bit iffy, which is most likely because of the 40 minutes of deleted scenes. The film kept jumping around from place to place which would have been very confusing had I not been a Warcraft fan. My partner who I saw this film with is not a fan, and she was also confused with the start of the film as the characters traveled to 4 or 5 different locations in 30 minutes.Overall, I really enjoyed this film and I am extremely excited for further sequels. With a lore as vast as Warcraft, they could make an entire film series out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first great video game movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been excited for this film since the first trailer and even after the poor reviews I still was hyped for it and I really enjoyed this film. The premise of this film sees the orcs leave there homeworld to try and survive which causes conflict with the humans of azaroth. Travis fimell plays lothar the main human and he delivers a decent performance that makes you care about him. He has charisma to him and depth to his character as he tries to stop his world from being destroyed. Tobby kebbell plays durotan, the main orc chief who wants to see his people to survive without war with the humans. I liked his character because he goes against the typical orc because you can tell that he has depth to his personality over just wanting war. Ben foster plays the guardian of humanity and he does a great job, his character had awesome powers and his character developed throughout the film. Paula patton plays garona and she really delivered a good performance from a character who really thrived In this film as more then just a simple romance. Dominic cooper plays the king and even though he doesn't have loads to do I thought he did a pretty good job in this film. All the orc characters were interesting and it is done well enough to make you care about the orcs. The story has some decent drama to it on both sides that made both sides interesting and compelling. However, I would have liked to have seen more interaction between the two sides as at times it does feel like that the two stories are quite disconnected which hurts the overall story. The script has some great drama in it with the individual stories developing well. However, this film does lack any real humour in it which is disappointing for a film like this. The style is pretty breathtaking with all the cgi being seem less and making the action scenes flow very well. Overall this film is a great time that should be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What about the lore??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody seems to give a damn about the incredible amount of deviations from the original Warcraft lore! Spoilers!!!!!For crying out loud, they completely changed everything with Garona, FOR THE WORSE! She became a frustratingly compassionate goody two- shoes who kills her king not because she's being manipulated by the Shadow Council (which doesn't even exist in the film...) but because it was Llane's request to do so, so that she becomes accepted by her people yada yada blablabla. This all happens in a battle at the dark portal.. Sigh.. during which Medivh is killed by being crushed by a clay golem. For crying out loud, is this a children's film? Just let him get stabbed by Lothar! And after the battle, Anduin comes in on his Gryphon to take Llane's corpse from the battlefield, and he just lands there and takes the corpse while his Gryphon is apparently powerful enough to hold off a thousand orcs. I wish my Gryphon could do that. After that he fights Blackhand in a Mak'Gora (dont forget, none of this actually happened - in the lore.) and literally just slices through his crotch and stabs him in the back like he's cutting through butter. With a CGI fancy butter knife. Of course, in the LORE, Orgrim actually challenges Blackhand to a Mak'Gora and defeats him, and then becomes the warchief and besieges stormwind, sacking it, during which Garona assassinates king llane in the keep under the control of the Shadow Council. Long story short, the sacking of stormwind was scrapped. On of the most major events of the first war, if not the most major, was just scrapped just like that. Maybe it'll happen in the next film, but Garona's story is messed up anyway now. Also her romance thingy with Lothar was cringy, cliché and stupid. And the fact that she gets a fancy ass golden super fancy fancy dagger to "protect herself" from the queen that looks like it'll break if you try to slice your bread with it almost made me laugh.And dalaran is apparently floating. Yes. Floating. That didn't happen until Wrath of the Lich King, like 30 ? years after.The whole thing about Alodi is intentionally confusing, and it's particularly confusing because in the lore Alodi is in fact the first guardian, and a male half-elf. Now it's a sad lady in a black box. I am confuse.All in all, I loved the film. Aside from everything I mentioned above and more. Please make a sequel &lt;3</fullReview>

		<fullReview>another interesting fictional medieval story similar to the lord of the rings' world but not as great as it was, an enjoying conflict between the orcs and the humans with some magic. Warcraft, starring Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Dominic Cooper, Ben Schnetzer, Daniel Wu, and directed by Duncan Jones. entertaining movie, with good story development. but not convincing acting, some silliness. I think Dominic Cooper was a bad choice for king Llane rule. not very good graphics. good soundtracks from Game of Thrones' Ramin Djawadi. despite the problems i think you will enjoy the movie especially if you are a tolkien's fictional world fan. in fact, i'm interested in seeing a sequel for this movie. final rating 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know movies based on video games are normally bad but this one aspires to be bad and fails. Warcraft WISHES it was only Bad instead of the insipid pile of dung that was flung on the screen. Some people say they want their money back, others say they want their 2 hours back... this 'movie' makes me regret ever playing the game since my monthly subscription probably contributed to this offense against film-making and story-telling in some way. Save yourself, avoid seeing this travesty of celluloid... and if you must see it for some reason (abduction with a gun at your head for instance) drink heavily in the hope of blacking out before the opening credits.

		<shortDescription>Great Movie for Any Fantasy Lover!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't listen to the critics! See this movie and judge for yourself! I absolutely loved it. I don't normally leave reviews, but this movie has got to get a sequel! I've seen it twice in theatres so far, and I plan to see it again. It's a wonderful movie for anyone who is a fan of action/fantasy. I have never played the game, but I didn't feel at all lost while watching this movie. I think they did a great job at introducing their world and the story was absolutely fantastic! What makes it even better in my book is that they didn't feel the need to add cursing or inappropriate scenes. Did I mention the story was great?! It was. It had all the elements that a story should have (and most movie nowadays are lacking). This is a movie I will see again and again and I recommend it to everyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing - Some explanation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft 2 was the game that made me buy my first PC back in '96. WOW was the game that made me waste many many days and years getting lost in the lush story and massive world however I had an on and off relation with WOW, did not play it constantly since 2004 when it came out. I was never a massive lore fan but I did look stuff up on WOW Wiki and on Nobbel87 YouTube page which has so many video on the Warcraft Lore.If you enjoyed the movie and want to know more about the Warcraft Lore I encourage you to visit Nobbel87 YouTube channel.The movie is well executed, the CGI alone should get awards, the Warcraft lore is massive, way bigger than anything you have seen before, bigger than the Middle Earth Lore and yet they tried to fit in as much as they could with a few things being left out and some of the lore changed however the end result is exactly the same. There is absolutely nothing I can add besides saying that the movie is well worth a watch and maybe some educating on the lore is needed to fully enjoy it. I had shivers just watching the first few minutes.My only gripe is that they could have added an extra 30 minutes and go over the reason why certain individuals became corrupted with Fell magic and what was the reason and promises. Then again that would probably need 3 prequels.In regards to the movie, many negative reviews mention lack of good acting, no idea where they got that from, the acting was superb as you would expect from a big budget movie. They also mention that the viewer is not able to sympathise with either the Alliance or the Horde, who is the bad guy? Well the simple answer is neither of them are the bad guys, both parties were used and corrupted by the Demons (Sargeras and his Burning Legion). The Orcs were seen as nothing more than cannon fodder by the Legion, promising Gul'dan POWER beyond his dreams only to do his bidding and destroy every world in the Universe. The Orcs were pushed to destroy their own world and every race on it then marched on to another World to do the same. Due to their aggressive warrior culture/nature most did not question this and went in blindly, hence the Fell corruption for greater power, Green orc skin and not Red/Brown original look. This is the reason why you can very well root for them.The common enemy not shown is the Legion and their Leader with Gul'dan coming second as he was their puppet. The Orcs have a tragic past, the Humans unfortunately are in their way and neither can trust each other for various reasons (meddling from higher powers).The Warcraft Universe is tragic, there is no happy ending, no winners, constant war, no one is safe, constant attacks from the Demons and their schemes. I think the movie tries its best to show this torment and you can root and sympathise with all parties (except the Legion).For any newcomer it will be hard to get attached and involved especially when the story in the movie is about 5% overall. However you need to bear in mind that this story is always shifting, expanding becoming richer and richer (after all Warcraft has 26+ years of constant Lore which is still being added to with the new WOW Legion Expansion coming out in August). Can you really get sucked into the ever expanding Warcraft universe and truly enjoy this amazing movie that doesn't scratch the Warcraft lore surface? Probably not, but if 7 movies with 2 3 still planned:)) hint hint come out you might think of Warcraft as one of the greatest fantasy series ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Fantasy Epic that *could have been* absolutely Great- but isn't...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some spoilers about the story, but most spoilers are with how this movie IS/ was made. (How the acting is, how the certain scenes are shot etc). Rather than how the Story is.I wont go too much into what the story is about in this reviews, other people have done that. Nor will i write very much about what this movie does right, other people have done that. My review will mostly focus on some of the problems with this movie.I played some WoW, but i played a lot of Warcraft 3. Warcraft 2, but especially Warcraft 3 (both reign of chaos and the frozen throne) had a big impact on me, and I love the characters and the stories in the Warcraft universe.The reason i write this review is because I CARE about Warcraft...Lets begin.The problems with this movie as what i would like to call "basic movie stuff". The effects, the CGI, the Orcs, or the story as a whole (the story on paper) ARE NOT big problems with this movie. In fact, the effects on the Orcs, and the Orc characters in general are among the best things in this movie. And the story can be EPICLY GOOD- as long as you get the basics right...What i mean with "basic movie stuff" I mean the acting, i mean how certain characters are cast and portrayed, how certain scenes are shot, what emotional connections there are to characters from the viewers and between characters themselves. Things that are not strictly exclusive to fantasy movies, but for ANY movie with characters. Basic.Let's take the word "plot" and lets make a verb out of that word. This Warcraft movie is pretty "plot-y". Some examples of "basic movie stuff" problems: 1.The human main character (Lothar)'s son is just a plot device, nothing else at all. 2. The acting and casting of Lothar was at times... very bad. As with **most of the human cast.** 3. The decision Draka the orc character made when coming to a river... Lets just say it seemed to be a very light-hearted decision. The scene is fine on paper, but the situation needs to seem more desperate for the decision to make sense.4. Some characters motivations for their actions aren't explained or even the least bit HINTED at WHAT.SO.EVER. (Even when i know there are some) If you don't already know the story, with some characters you'll just say to yourself "okay then i guess" with what their actions are. They just kind of just decided it was a good idea to do this or that. There are with these things i am annoyed at when it comes to this movie that is actually story related.5. Some scenes are shot very... weirdly. There is this scene with Garona, the queen and Lothar in which the camera pans down on Lothars back and hes holding a gun... This scene makes zero sense. What is it trying to say? That he doesn't trust Garona??? But i mean... yeah... lets just say that it is a bit... weirdly made... And there are multiple of these kinds of scenes in this Warcraft movie. It seems as if they wanted many different minor stories and characters conflicts, so they shot these scenes, but then decided to skip them.5.5 There is a scene close to the end of the movie that is shot in slow motion... And i get what is happening here. And i overall like the human actor. But this scene needed to be done A LOT better. The scene/ the story of the scene is fine on paper, but the way it is shot, how that line is delivered. It was almost a bit silly/ cringeworthy... Also, why the hell is there a scenes in which Medivh is half naked playing with mud. WHY6. Its impossible for me to explain this all with 1000 word limit, but basically this movie needed to have a slower start to ease people into the world(s), and what peoples normal struggles and everyday lives are in the world(s). Basically, show the world(s)!! This is to better understand characters actions etc etc, but also some plot points, why certain things happen, why certain big decisions are made (the first example where this is kind of a problem is less than 10 mins into the movie). LOTR does this pretty good, by starting in the Shire, let us get used to the world, and understand the characters. This movie needed something similar.I heard 40 minutes was removed from the final cut. So now we have a 2 hour 3 minute movie. This explains a lot of problems with this movie. THIS IS A FANTASY EPIC. GIVE US 3 BLOODY HOURS FFS!!The reason my title is that this movie COULD HAVE been absolutely GREAT (LOTR levels of GREAT) is because if they would have just gotten the basic movie stuff right- the problems in this movie start to disappear. And those problems are what drags this movie down. Credit to the Orc actors, they are what held this movie together!!I really hope they learn from these mistakes in a potential sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't do the name warcraft justice, watch and take it with a pinch of salt :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me and my wife decided to watch this because we used to play world of warcraft. We thought watching this would be a fun reminiscent of our earlier years together. The movie started well enough, I love how the orcs look, I love how the movie shows us the different cities in warcraft, but then the movie lose me halfway through. I understand the movie was made for warcraft gamer, but a movie should stand by its own merit. You can't create a movie and expect people to already knows the lore behind it. And based on that, no I don't think the movie stand by its own. The good: - In game items come to life (The ride, the magic) - The orcs looks good - Cities and locations are pretty much spot on - Murloc as cameo The bad: - Pacing was really bad, we're being led from one scene to another without real sense of purpose. There was one time in the movie where I checked my watch and groaned that it's not over yet. - Acting was pretty meh (Travis Fimmel is so one dimensional, it's almost like watching Ragnar Lothbrok got stuck in a different movie setting). - Bad writing (that supposed "romance" scene, I cringe every time) - Dwarf and Elves look fake as F***.So yeah, I don't enjoy the movie that I would love to like. Maybe I'm just getting old, but this movie doesn't do the name Warcraft justice.People should stop rating these movie 10/10 just because they are fans of the game. Clearly there are a lot of audiences that really enjoy this movie, but for me it's an average movie at its best! 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually stunning, but plot line-wise a bit disappointing movie, worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched it in IMAX 3D and was continuously amazed at the visuals and grand scenes this movie has to offer, superb sound and good acting as well. I highly recommend this movie just for that, it's a visual marvel, and, as someone who's never played the game, I didn't feel too lost on what was happening, which was good. I was correct to give it a chance.However it's filled with plot holes and it ends with one that's massively disappointing, nearly ruined the whole movie for me; for inexplicable reasons, a certain someone told someone else to do something unreasonable and drastic for no reason whatsoever. And even more disappointingly - they did. This is a case where in attempt to lure the viewer in suspense for the next movie the writer/s instead ruined the ending of this one, and killed any positive feelings I had for certain characters, cheaply. I was enjoying myself trough most of the movie, but after that ending, I didn't feel good as we left the cinema. I spoke with my friends who saw it with me - nobody liked the ending and everybody felt cheated as an otherwise good movie suddenly stopped making sense near the end for the sake of plot twists and a "to be continued" moment.Not happy with the cheap ending "twist" at all, but I still recommend watching this movie for what it has to offer visually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warcraft, the movie, depicted the fictional war game story in an accessible way for mainstream viewers! The 3D computer graphics and real life actors and actresses were an evolution of the cinematography from the Avatar. Duncan Jones directed the first of a promising series given the success of the 21st century sci-fi and fantasy genre with the Matrix, X-Men, and the Avengers. Help came from the advance of computer generated graphics and the growing comfort of acting with these technologies. There was plenty of action in this gamer's delight though the story line was obviously adapted for a movie audience. Warcraft's fantastic scenery and fictional conflicts manifested magically in this thriller.</fullReview>

From Orc cameo appearances for the wow "veterans" to feast on, to the amazingly created gryphons and frostwolves and impressive combat scenes this movie will seriusly entertain the fans. For the rest? Well if you are on to fantasy movies you cannot be missing this one (those mage spells were jawdropping in the 3D version). Movie critics? i doubt that many of them can appreciate this movie for what it stands due to its unique nature. They can go and watch Cleopatra all day long for what i care.Are you an Allie? get a kirin-tor mage to open a portal to Dalaran and see it with your own eyes!

		<fullReview>This is something that could easily beat any other story in the Blizzard style. Main comparison is of course made with LoTR mini series and I'm just saying' this as a warcraft fan since day 1. They have what it takes to make it a longer miniseries, longer than Mr. Lucas Film with his Star Wars soap, with a nice story line and turns with up and down. Can't wait to see the next part from it... I expect better same way I can expect worse just because Blizzard disappointed me not only once. If they will stick with the original story, or at least close to the in game line, will get more sci-fi fans than they could ever think of. Story itself isn't bad at all and they might have to work for it for, at least, next 5 years filming it. They have the "know how", they have the money, I just wonder if they will have the guts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the MMO-RPG, Warcraft, the movie sets itself before the games; where the orcs from another world invade the inhabited world of Azeroth, where then the war between the two begins. The world of Warcraft is both greatly designed and beautiful to look at. The CGI in this movie, while obvious, is great to look at and doesn't get to the point of thinking you're actually playing the video game instead. The motion capture, in particular, is great to fantastic, giving both weight and expressive emotion to these "larger than life" characters. And the designs of the humans characters manages to be over the top is not an issue, instead adds both a unique and fun aspect to the movie. The charters in this world, while most lacking development, are interesting enough to keep the audience entertained; one of the best characters, having the most development, is the orc Durotan. And while the mixing of CGI giants and over armored real life characters may sound like it would be a disaster to have together, the work put into it creates great action between the two. With all the characters actions weight to them and is still kept nicely passed, the action is overall great to watch. While these aspects help the movie, the flaws of it may overshadow them for some audience members. The major issue is the pasting, with characters and the story jumping from location to location and the amount of time taking place being uncertain, both the characters and story lack the development and explanation needed for the general audience. The story also suffers giving the sense of impact it tries to have. Overall, the movie, while flawed, has a unique flare and enjoyable characters, story, and world to make a fun fantasy movie.OVERALL SCORE: Critical - 7/10 Enjoyment - 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Much Story, So Little Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a Warcraft fan. In fact, I didn't even know there were games before World of Warcraft until this movie came out. However my qualms with the MMORPG have nothing to do with the gameplay or story, so I was still reasonably interested in seeing the movie version (or the movie version of those older games, at least). I went last night, which is unseasonably late for me to see a movie, I'll admit, but there were too many smaller movies that I feared would stop their run if I substituted either for Warcraft.Warcraft: The Beginning follows the start of the war between the Humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who have been driven away from their dying world. I figured that would be the extent of fantasy races we might see, but thankfully I was wrong as mages and wizards have a very strong presence (as someone who always plays the more mystical characters in an RPG, this made me quite happy), and dwarfs and elves have small cameos every now and then as well. There's even a strong hint at demons and dark magic.One of the biggest things that drew me to Warcraft was how it promised a balanced look at the two opposing sides of the conflict. Typically a movie like this will favour the human perspective and paint the alien creatures as the faceless enemy. It was refreshing to see this other race explored and developed, although it's very easy to pinpoint the changes Duncan Jones made to the script in order to do so. The development of the Orc factions is largely relegated to it's own little sub-plot, which disappointed me a bit. It has it's own beginning, middle, and end (an end that occurs well before the movie's climax), and rarely intercedes with the main storyline at all. In fact it almost squanders it entirely as it builds up to a different trade-off, but ultimately the movie has to reset it's status quo for the finale to still make sense. In this respect, and many others, the film does feel a little rushed at times. If there's anything I've learned from the movie, it's that the world of Azeroth is huge, with many different races, factions, cultures, and ways of doing things. There's no way anyone could do justice to this massive world in two hours, and as such some elements are included but glossed over. Often something happens and we quickly move to the next event with little downtime or explanation of whats going on. That said, what we do see of Azeroth feels rich and plentiful, and while the development of the Orcs could honestly have been cut entirely without any impact on the main story, it is refreshing to see their side of the war as well. We come to understand why they've been forced out of their world, and more crucially see that they're not just faceless evil, but they face their own form of evil and corruption. There's also a lot of development for the magical elements as well. Like everything in the movie I feel it should have been developed more, or just left out entirely.But moving away from the story, the special effects were sublime. This is high fantasy at it's best. The humans use big, ornate pieces of armour and weaponry, and yet it never looks campy or too over-the-top. There's griffin-like creatures, and giant wolves, and even some kind of large frog- like thing (yeah, it's starting to become obvious I've never played), and all look great, although Lothar's hand does seem to fall through the griffin when he pats it. The biggest triumph when it comes to the CGI though is with the Orcs. They get the Avatar/Gollum treatment, with motion- captured actors underneath, and it adds a huge amount of facial expression and body language that just wouldn't have been present otherwise. The sheer depth of variety in the Orcs is also great, as no two Orcs look the same.Warcraft: The Beginning, is a strong, if understandably flawed start of a promising franchise. It's biggest sin is trying to cram too much story in so little time, so I have no doubt it would have benefited from a longer running time, or even being split up into multiple movies. There's no denying that adapting such a rich universe like Warcraft would be a huge undertaking, but Duncan Jones took the challenge, and he was largely successful in delivering an entertaining, bombastic movie that appeals to fans and non-fans of the games alike. The music is top-notch (had the main theme stuck in my head all night), and the fate of many characters don't end at all how you'd expect, even if the main twist itself is hugely predictable. I give Warcraft an enjoyably flawed 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best fantasy movie I've ever seen. Years ago had an expert told me, a classic film, there are always the first person, then the world, the second of the film is always first in the world, another person. I to translation, meaning probably is, really good movies, always based in one or a group of abundant believable characters, around these characters will produce a good story, and then construct a moving world. If, in turn, things are often not quite right. In fact, "world of Warcraft" is doing really well. Regardless of is the character of the image of dress, make-up or sets of exquisite detail, whether it is higher than the standard of the industry effects to create out of cool magic, or animal armies pitted against each other grand battle scenes. For tens of millions of world of Warcraft game powder, they are familiar with the Azeroth and Delano, Stormwind and Ironforge, Guldan and Medivh who is one faithful to the setting of the game appear in the big screen, the movie are the most important already completed. As a loyal fan of Warcraft game, director Duncan Jones also understand that, in the name of the popularity of Warcraft super high "big IP" brand, the first task is to conquer the game of death. In this regard, "Warcraft" and even a little hypercorrection. From the beginning of the film with a simple subtitles one by one to introduce only a senior game players will be familiar with a series of place names this point of view, the world of Warcraft is willing to risk the risk of not being understood by the general audience. In this case, the "world of Warcraft" is a too typical of new century Hollywood blockbusters, it and the Avengers and all Marvel's superhero movie, just want to use the most gorgeous visual presents you with a colorful world, and increasingly ignores the role of "person" (recall that you will find, marvel movies, the best, exactly is the character portrayed most vividly the several). I have not the slightest fear behind if cadres "world of Warcraft" will see more amazing wow magic in the world, but I want to see more like people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Non-Warcraft player, but I liked the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never played any of the Warcraft games but thought they did a good job making an entertaining movie. The fantasy was great and didn't mind getting thrown in the middle of the story. I didn't need spoon fed to figure out what was happening but don't ask me to name any of the characters. &#x1f603; Overall I thought it was cool and hope that a second movie is on the way soon. It's not Lord of the Rings nor did I feel like it was trying to be but I liked what it was trying to do despite a few nitpicky flaws, cough, romance, cough horrible Orc tusks on the half-Orc female lead. Was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Go see it if you like fantasy movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft - Fantastic Movie for fans and uninitiated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignore all the critics. Legendary nailed Warcraft with this movie. Bravo!!! As a long time Warcraft fan (bought the original at Best Buy circa 1994, and have played every game since), I went into this a huge spoonful of skepticism and doubt after reading all the bad press.Within 10 minutes, all those concerns were abated, and what a ride it was. The story felt epic and honored the original story closely. The characters were well developed and interacted in surprising, yet believable ways. The battle scenes were amazing and were choreographed and filmed excellently. The effects were spot on and amazing (the magic especially... not over the top, but a visual feast).The only thing I'd give it a ding for was the pacing. It was a LITTLE to fast at times... but honestly, they covered so much, I don't think they could have slowed it down without it being a 3 hour movie (can't wait to see the director's cut!!!).And even if you don't know Warcraft, this is GREAT cinematic high fantasy, and can stand shoulder to shoulder with the Jackson LotR movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blown away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have played Warcraft for the past 11 years, and my expectations on this movie were very low going into it. For the record, I started out early playing Alliance when WoW first came out, then slowly transitioned to the Horde, and currently root for the Horde. Rarely does Hollywood get things perfect, but I couldn't believe my eyes, and in fact, I was absolutely blown away. The visual effect were absolutely stunning with everything appearing perfectly natural. We get to see Ironforge, Stormwind, Dalaran, Elwynn Forest, Armored Gryphons, Frostwolves, and even get to see Khadgar sheep a guard, along so many others that I can't name them all! This movie covers when the Dark Portal opens, which is the very beginning of the meeting between humans and orcs. Varian, son of Stormwind's King Llane Wrynn is just a little boy, and baby Thrall is born. Some things were changed as it pertains to the actual Warcraft Lore, but it all works out perfectly as the movie ends. Any Fantasy movie lovers will love this movie, and of course any Warcraft fan will be satisfied. Many people are complaining that this was a one sided movie, gravitating toward the Alliance, but in truth, it is not. The Orcs have been roaming the universe conquering many lands, and the Alliance have no such belief in other worlds beyond theirs at this point in time. I look forward to future Warcraft movies, and cannot wait to see how Blizzard explains it all out on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>after reading some Reviews before seeing this movie i expected it to be horrible I was pleasantly surprised! yes, it is off from the books but, I think it made it easier for people to understand. I do agree the person they cast for Medivh was an awful overly dramatic actor and i hate the roll Garona plays when she didn't matter at all in the books. I loved how they portrayed Anduin and Khadgar's Relationship it was spot on. this movie had everything you would expect magic and awesome fight scenes i thought the CGI was AMAZING!IF you go in thinking its going to be exactly like the story line from WoW you will be disappointed and frustrated thinking the whole time "they got that wrong! that's not how that happened!" they Protraied all the Heroes Like they were suppose to (expect Medivh i blame the horrible acting on that one)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft:Entertaining but with some flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I write this review as a fan of the franchise.Warcraft 2 was my first strategy game(RTS),at a very young age. It laid the foundation of my love for RTS games.Having said that i didn't know/remember the story behind the characters walking into this film.It is difficult to adapt a video game into a movie successfully,especially the cartoon like "feeling" that Warcraft always had.Also i was not so interested in the story of the first game. Add the low score reviews from critics and my expectations were pretty low.So...i can say i liked it.It isn't in my all time classic list,but it has its moments and bringing back memories certainly gave it a better aftertaste leaving the cinema.I liked: -CGI Orc protagonists were superb.Well made and well acted. -Some battle scenes -- Magic --The world(especially fans will find a lot of things to recognize)It was OK: 1)The actors that played the humans. 2)Story.Felt a little rushed 3)Score.Nothing really memorable.I didn't like: 1)Script 2)Pacing 3)Some scenes were poorly acted.To sum it up,although Duncan Jones succeeded creating the world,the characters didn't manage to connect.Some things felt forced(love scenes),some things unnecessary(Lothars Son) and generally you will not care for the fate of most characters.In my opinion if you are a fan/like fantasy or you are in for the spectacle you will enjoy the movie.If you think CGI is silly and are looking for something with a deep story and character development you will probably be disappointed.7.5/10 from me (+1 being a fan)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a die-hard Warcraft fans for 22 years who doesn't like misty of pandaria or anything too cute in WoW. Played all Blizzard's game HOTS, Warcraft 123, Diablo 123, Starcraft12, WoW until warlords of draenor. . . THIS MOVIE IS very GOOD but it cannot be EPIC yet. It sure is hell better than LOTR Orcs that can die by hobbits throwing stone at them!, my best scene is the dark portal scene.I'm going to see it again, Lothar's for the Alliance gives me the SHIVER !! . I'm getting a lot of criticism on the "character development" issue, but before you bash please find out why 40 mins was cut from the movie. . I even watched a leaked video showing Grom Hellscream talking to Doomhammer in a camp fire with other tribal chief. They cut all this i'm not sure why but most probably due to Sam vs Duncan vs Blizzard vs Universal vs Legendary issues. . GO WATCH THE MOVIE , FREE YOUR MIND FROM MINDLESS CRITICISM AND ENJOY THE MOVIE!! YOU WILL!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start by saying that I Played wow from vanilla beta, to after WoD but no longer play. I am not a fan boy, I do not think Blizzard craps rainbows, or everything they do is gold. I went into this movie expecting it to be crappy honestly, but I felt that the game had given me enough joy over the years to see it. I was pleasantly surprised by the film. It had some over the top moments, and some plot/time line flaws, but I really enjoyed it. Travis Fimmel has once again impressed the hell out of me as Lothar, and the Orcs were also bad asses which was nice to see as an ex horde player.All that said, if you have never played the game, and have zero clue about lore and settings, it is still a solid fantasy movie on a massive scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable movie / The best video game based movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I'm a big fan of the universe, but I definitely have my own bag of memories when it comes to Warcraft. I've tracked this movie for some time as well, since it was announced quite a long time ago. Usually I'm very critical about these types of movies, but not with this one. It captured me with it's first scenes and just made me smile through the whole movie. I was not disappointed and I'm glad that I've spent my money on it, this way I can invest into a sequel. And don't get me wrong, it wasn't a well tailored movie when it comes to Hollywood movie standards. Some of the cuts were messed up (like near the end of the movie, a scene involving Medivh, Khadgar and Anduin had a really hard cut, making it obvious that there were a scene there, but it was cut during the editing). Also, either the Ukrainian VO was not good, or the dialogue itself was weird and nonsensical at times. But there was that one thing that made me forget about the flaws. It's the memories. It took my childhood/growing up memories and experiences playing the games and used them in the best way possible. It's like seeing something you've crafted in your imagination getting real. I guess it's obvious that this is a must for all Warcraft fans. However, it still might be a good experience for a general movie public, even though it's not very friendly to the newcomers. 8/10 - enjoyable movie, and definitely the best video game based movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: this review is heavily biased by my love of Warcraft lore. I have been browsing through YouTube for one week now and almost all critics, even non-critics and lore lovers like Nobbel87 (which I very highly respect and like) were giving this movie a 7 out of 10, a 6 out of 10 and I was like 'nooo, really? Come on, you're not even a bit biased by the fact that you love the lore and the Warcraft universe?!' I finally managed to watch the movie today and even though it ended 30 minutes ago, I still can't wipe the smile off my face. What an amazing experience it was to finally see one of my favorite fantasy universes on the big screen. Lothar, Gorona, Khadgar and even young Go'el (or Thrall).. Unbelievable. I was continuously smiling throughout the movie! Sure, it did contain some lore inaccuracies, sure Gorona didn't kill Llane there, but! That is not the essence! The essence is that she did not have a choice. And that is perfectly underlined in the movie as well! I will say no more. For a Warcraft lore fan, it was great. Sure, the acting could have been better, but I couldn't care and will never care. Not when it's good enough to make me smile through a whole movie and it's about Warcraft. The only bad thing about this movie is that it ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to note something before I start reviewing this movie - yes, I was, I am, I and will be a World of Warcraft player. Who has not felt in love with WoW after completing his first quest? Who has not eagerly waited for guild raids every Saturday evening? Who has not dreamed of being one day a Gladiator? Haven't we all, WoW players, done that at a particular moment during our journey in Azeroth? Well, I've been through all of the 3 mentioned above. But let's wrap it up for the video game. Both the screen-adaptation and the video game have sentimental value for me, so I might be a little bit more emotional than I should be as a reviewer.Thank you Duncan Jones, Charles Leavitt, Chris Metzen for bringing "Warcraft" to life! You have fulfilled the big dream of all WoW players, namely adapting the video game into this epic movie. We all have been thirstily waiting for this movie. The subheading says: "The Beginning", well it really is the beginning of a great journey, a journey that we've been into since the first spell we'd cast with our characters.Many people do not like "Warcraft", though. My theory is that half of the people that have seen the movie had not known what WoW or Warcraft is until they entered the cinema hall. That is where the problem comes from. Warcraft players, of course vote from 6 stars and above. As for the non-players, the people that have never played that game and have no understanding of what a game it is, their vote of course drops radically - below 6 stars. Besides, 40% of the people have rated it with 10 stars. Even Star Wars : Ep. VII hasn't got that much 10's ! Most of the fantasy movies have got up to 20% 10 stars from all votes. You don't see that every day!Anyway... What a movie this was! Boy, was it a pleasure watching "Warcraft"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The intro of W3 Reign of Chaos is a masterpiece. From today's standpoint, the animation of the battle between the foot-soldier and the orc grunt might be dated but the directing, the way this little sequence is "shot", is just incredible. You can feel the power of the blows as the orc smashes the shield away from the foot-soldier's hands, leaving him shattered but firmly holding his sword, now with both hands. The soldier dude is a friggin tank, armored to the teeth, pretty much capable of holding his own against the brutal orc attacks. We needed to have that in the movie. We needed to have a cast of huge dudes with fat, muscular necks in huge armor, wielding huge swords and huge shields, not a bunch of scrawny dudes who aren't wearing helmets and a 16yo kid killing orcs with ease. That's not how it works in Warcraft, Duncan Jones, you should've watched those W3 animations and learned from them. King Llane's biceps is frig-gin' huge, even the peon, your average villager, is super-duper buff. That's how Blizzard rolls dude, check the StarCraft stuff as well. Also, them elite foot-soldiers aren't getting one-shot-ted even by Illidan. You dun goofed. No, really, there was no epic-Ne's in none of the battles in the movie. The sole exception was the battle between Durotan and Guldan. We have the orcs one-shot-ting every foot-soldier in sight, while the human heroes were one-shot-ting orcs without ever receiving a blow. That's some lazy ass directing.The mag-es. Why did you have to stray from the norm, Duncan Jones? They are old and have gray hair and wear funny hats. Did I mention they have long gray/white beards? Other than that, the movie is OK. It does have some pretty illogical moments and a very, very non-believable romance but I guess I can let that slide. The effects are good. The orcs are made really well. They'll motivate you to hit the gym more often. Yes, Travis Fimmel, I'm looking at you. Dem forearms must get bigger, boy. You gotta stand up to deem orcs and not deal dirty low blows, 360 MLG no-scoping style. Stop it.8/10 just because it entertained me. I'm expecting much better from the second movie.</fullReview>

I went with a group of family and friends who are all fans of the game(s) and have extensive knowledge of the lore. We all had permanent smiles on our faces both during and after the film. We couldn't stop raving about how good the film was and what we would like to see in the future (if a sequel was made).

		<fullReview>I definitely love how magic is used as a weapon just like in the Warcraft games and it's a relief for me to see Blizzard's brand of Warcraft magic brought beautifully to life in a movie and how exciting the magical effects are unlike many other fantasy movies. The visuals of magic in Warcraft are definitely unique and they are quite nicely translated to the movie - the best out of any fantasy movie so far. The movie is a little choppy, especially the battle near the end between Khadgar and Medhiv which is abrupt and a bit confusing, but I understand that they had to cut 40 minutes of footage out of the movie, which could explain why. I really hope for a sequel and hope there will be water elementals in the next movie! And I also hope they will make a DoTA movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I had low expectations going into the theater to watch this movie. I hadn't seen much of the previews so I expected a "cartoonish" kind of film that would be satisfactory entertainment for 2 hours. Instead, I got a film that had a serious plot, great action scenes and amazingly well done marriage between CGI and real life acting. I want more!... You will leave the theater as if you had just been showered by a fantasy world and immediately you'll want to go back for more (the movie and another shower!).I won't spoil any of the plot or fun references to the game but for any fans of the Warcraft series and especially the game World of Warcraft, this movie is a rare treat that you really should indulge in. I left the game around 6 years ago but the movie took me back to those early days of Azeroth where exploration and adventure was waiting at every corner.This movie is faithful to the geography and history of Warcraft but was much more serious than I expected. The characters and their stories become real and you care for their development. There are twists and turns that I did not expect and really fun references to character classes you may have played. Even for the un-initiated to the game, there is enough character development and great storytelling to enjoy the movie as a stand alone. But if you have the background, you will enjoy it so much more.I really want more! I may actually pick up a book of the series if they are anything as good as the storytelling of this movie. What a wonderful bonus that the acting, animation and direction was so good as well. If you like fantasy, action or role-playing genre and your imagination allows for the existence of other races such as orcs and what-not then this movie is for you! Now go soak yourself in this wonderful fantasy world!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since American Psycho I haven't seen a movie that embodied so well the original story. Blizzard as ever is the master on doing beautiful graphics and on delivering what the players of warcraft have been waiting for. This movie is really for the people who had been playing the game as every bits is based on the game. There was some interesting shots that remind the view one had when playing the games. Warcraft as a first movie delivers a solid introduction on the world of warcraft universe but lacked a bit when reaching the climax of the movie. Warcraft is a first promising movie for the genre based on video games but we regret a bit of that acting that was sometimes off.On the hand it should not be discard, Real Fantasy genre has been forgotten from the movie theatres and such movie is refreshing.</fullReview>

Diluted with admittedly OK CGI, yet that means absolutely nothing when you have such a terrible movie. Avoid at all costs! I desperately wanted my 2 hours returned to me after watching this terrible movie. Please recognize that it is only rated so high because fanboys have entirely zero ability to distinguish derivative narrative trash from a subject they love and good film. There was potential to make a good film out of World of Warcraft lore, but this movie missed the mark it's entirely possible to think you are living on a different world where there exist people who think that this movie could be considered good, much less a perfect movie. Once again, do not watch this movie if you value your time, your honor, your mother, or your understanding and awareness of quality.</fullReview>

And I gotta say, after watching this I have to agree that it's pretty damn good. I have not played the video game, and I found this entertaining anyway! The special effects were good, the story was good, the action was good...pretty much the whole movie was good! It had memorable scenes and one emotional death scene, which made the movie even better. So, if you like fantasy, go watch this at the cinema if you get a chance. If you do not, you may not enjoy this movie. So, if you like fantasy, get some popcorn and enjoy this great movie! Overall, I would rate this a 8.2/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, reviewed by a person with no experience with the gaming franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great movie if you're one who is a fan of the gaming franchise, but coming from a person who has never had any experience whatsoever with the game (apart from hearing a lot about it), i thought that it gave me a great introduction into the future of a great blockbuster series.The move was full of intense battle scenes much to the likes of representing the distinguished moral of the story and the grief and raw new rivalry between the mighty humans who are decisive in not holding back from letting their land be taken over from the orcs of a different world. I thought that the director Duncan Jones coordinated the movie to an average standard that just about suited the needs of viewers, giving any rookie a very informative introduction and any thoroughly experienced fan much more to be entertained by through their beloved gaming franchise. But, although the movie had many ups, there were also some downs, which i couldn't help to argue with. These include the idea of nearly every scene of the movie being computer generated, which from my point of view didn't made the movie look as realistic as it could have been. I had caught a few iffy parts in which i could tell that there were some mistakes made with some scenes in which the perspective of the CGI characters movements were almost made to look a bit dodgy and unworkable with sustaining a realistic environment meant to make any audience feel engaged in the movie. I couldn't help to feel disengaged during some scenes were I was caught picking up these mistakes, most notably during one of the last scenes of the movie where it was most certainly shown that green screen had made some default mistakes in making the setting and buildings in the background make the cast look out of the scene to a point where I could definitely see that mostly everything around them was computer generated.Although the movie had some ups and some downs I personally thought it was a fantastic movie with a promising blockbuster franchise on its way (if there is a sequel). Once again I must note that this has been reviewed by a person with no experience whatsoever with the well established gaming franchise, although the movie has inspired me to try out this popular game (with the free game I was given when buying the movie ticket).Overall rating: 7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie (mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been playing WoW and Warcraft games for several years now and I really liked the movie. As I am also heavy into Warcraft lore, I was worried movie will make too many changes to it. Movie did make some changes, but they are little and of little consequence to the overall story.Orcs are great, visuals are great, battles are great, environment is great. Lots of nods and eastereggs for the fans in the background.I am glad this movie is good enough to bring us sequels which are definitely set up in this one. :D Things I didn't like are mostly in the Alliance camp. Btw, I play exclusively Alliance in WoW. Maybe Orcs came off better because of good CGI, but Alliance actors felt weird at some points. Mage actors were greatest problem for me. Young mage grew on me during the film, but the great mage wasn't so great. His robe was underwhelming and felt like he was walking around in his sleeping robe all the time, drowsy after waking up. Storywise it makes sense why would they make him like that, but the great mage didn't come off as great for me. Much better in the books where he comes off as drowsy but at the same time mysterious and very very powerful. Movie didn't do justice to his mystery and power. Magic effects felt great btw."Love" story isn't so "in your face" as I expected reading some reviews but I too think it was redundant.Because of Alliance side, I would give it 8.</fullReview>

Mind you, since it was ages before a Dungeons and Dragons movie hit the screens (and a fairly bad one at that) I suspect the reason they took their time with the Warcraft movie was that they wanted to do a decent job (and also probably because Blizzard, who owns the rights to Warcraft, may have been dragging their feet a little, but that is speculation). Anyway, as is evident from the title, this is the first in a number of movies (though I'm not really sure at this stage how many they plan on making, though there will most likely be three, more depending on how well the trilogy goes).My thoughts were that it was good ? not really a movie that I would probably watch multiple times, but then again I have never been really drawn into watching films that are clearly a form of merchandising (and this is definitely one of those films, especially since when I was down at Epping Plaza today I found myself at the local EB checking out how much a copy of World of Warcraft would set me back ? the fact that it doesn't seem to work on Linux, at least from what the box told me, stopped me from actually buying it). Still, while I have never played the MMORPG, I did play the old strategy games back in the 90s (Warcraft and Warcraft II specifically), so I do have a bit of a connection to the franchise.Well, the film begins with the horde, lead by Durotan, opening a gate on a destroyed world and leading the horde into Azarth to basically loot, kill, and plunder, and to also collect prisoners so that he might have power to open the gate again and let more of the horde into the world. We then jump over to the humans (the original game was called Orcs and Humans) when they hear about this army ravaging the land, and seek to go and find out what is actually going on. As is expected, the film then culminates with an epic battle at the gate, but then ends leaving it open for a sequel.Despite not being hugely familiar with the MMORPG I still quite enjoyed the film. From what I have gathered it does follow the storyline of the world (another thing that I am not hugely familiar with, namely because I basically played two of the original strategy games and little else, and that was actually quite a while ago so if there was any plot beyond building an army and then going to war with the otherside, I can't remember much of it), though how close I couldn't tell you. I guess that having little knowledge of the actual world helped me enjoy the film a lot more, though there were a number of aspects, such as the magic, that did bring back memories of the original game.I guess, in the end, it is a good thing that I use Linux, otherwise I probably would have found myself purchasing a copy of World of Warcraft, and then spending way too much time (and money) playing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Effects, OK acting, DARK movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The move was entertaining. The special effects were pretty amazing, but, like the Hobbit movies, it seems to me that the reliance on CGI is getting out of hand. That being said, this movie would not be possible without it. I thought the Characters were OK and the writing was fair. i would say the PG-13 rating was accurate but for those sensitive to dark magic, scary images and the like I would say be careful. I also prefer stories where the evil is evil and the good is very good. My thought coming out of this was that the evil was VERY evil and the good was just kind of OK. For those of you that really like fantastic images, special effects and action, this was a decent movie. Otherwise, wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GAMERS Review to Warcraft.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from someone who has enjoyed Warcraft and WoW I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. There are lots of little things that only someone familiar with Warcraft can appreciate. However the story is strong overall even for someone new to Warcraft that being said there was room for more character development. I do think King should have been played by someone else as his presence on screen wasn't strong.The CGI was excellent! The orcs looked amazing. Coming from WoW I was expecting the colours of the gryphons to be brighter but they went with a more natural/realistic look.Fingers crossed for more Warcraft movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Entertaining Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although disconnected from the current lore of Warcraft, I did spend a lot of hours with Warcraft and Warcraft II, the real-time-strategy games from over a decade ago. This, I think, helped with forming a healthy expectation of the style of film that this would be, even if there is a plethora of information alluded to in the film that the average viewer, like myself, will probably never understand.If CGI is not your cup of tea, then just steer away from this film altogether. Almost all of it is CGI, and the real sets are noticeably small. This is a common feel of the film, the conflicts, the armies, everything has a skirmish feel to it, much like the games.Warcraft has never been an epic-scale game, and the world of the film shares this impression. Although there are meetings of councils and clearly an allied, peaceful world in Azeroth, the dominant faction shown is the humans, who are outnumbered by the war-bands of Orcs who have travelled to Azeroth through a dark sorcerer's portal. This is just the vanguard of a larger force, called the horde, who are attempting to flee their dying planet.As far as direction goes, the film moves along at a quick pace, not wasting any time on transitions beyond some basic setting to tie key conversations together. Later in the film, action picks up and culminates in a logical progression, even if it gets a little muddled at times over where loyalties lie. This is, I might add, one of the areas that the film heartily breaks the mould of most films today - shades of grey morality. There is clearly an evil side, but there are many shades of morality that are populated by characters regardless of faction. This complicates things, but has the benefit of creating a larger story than just Orcs VS Humans.Visually exciting to watch, and with a handful of strong characters makes Warcraft an entertaining film for the right audience. It is true to its art style, clearly deals with good VS evil while allowing cultural differences that reinforce its characters, all while filling the screen with visceral combat to the extent that you will wish you saw more of some characters. Feeling most accurately like this movie just scratches the surface of its world, Warcraft will only improve with another instalment in the film franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft, great movie but has a few plot point issues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who have read through book 3 The Last Guardian by Author Jeff Grubb they will immediately see the connection to the main Warcraft movie story line. As someone who has read through the books and played the games I have to admit that I was very surprised that Blizzard OK'ed the script that was given for the movie. There were several very important plot points that simply needed to be portrayed in a clearer light to the audience and those plot points just were not clear enough to be understood. I have even read the books and I barely caught a glimpse of the four most important plot points of how the orcs and the humans came into contact with each other, it was very hard to catch it but there was some basic explanation as to those points, but still 3-4 of those points were completely unexplained as well as others but all of those points should have been the highlights of the movie and they were barely noticeable and therefore the movie ultimately made very little sense to the audience.#1 There was no explanation that Medivh was the last of the guardians of Tirisfal.#2 There was no explanation of the purpose of the guardians of Tirisfal. I'll provide a brief synopsis: Essentially there was only one guardian at a time. They were chosen by the Council of Tirisfal and they were imbued with powers from all members of the Order of Tirisfal, becoming extremely powerful mages in their own right. They were magically empowered to secretly fight the Burning Legion and other demons wherever they appeared on the world of Azeroth.#3 Magna Aegwynn who was Medivh's mother was the previous guardian of Tirisfal. She vanquished Sargeras the most powerful of the Demon Lords, or so she thought. It was one of the greatest of all the known battles between the Guardians of Tirisfal and the Burning Legion. Magna Aegwynn was with child (Medivh) when she thought she had killed Sargeras but with all the power his dying body Sargeras possessed the child in her womb with what was left of his evil soul.None of these first 3 points were explained in the movie, these were probably the most important things required to explain how the orcs came over from Draenor, but nothing...?Other important plot points that were not explained very well at all in the movie:#1 Khadgar was Medivh's understudy and had been for a long time, months, possibly years, but all you get in the movie is that Khadgar went to Karazhan (Medivh's home) with Lothar, all you can tell in the movie is that this was the first time Khadgar and Medivh had met and it could be considered the first time even according to the book but they had a much more extended relationship in the book after this event, this was not portrayed at all in the movie.#2 Over Medivh's lifetime the influence of Sargeras soul partly corrupts him time after time and he secretly helped Gul'dan, and essentially provided Gul'dan with the knowledge of how to build a portal which would allow him and his fellow Orcs to enter into Azeroth. This was very poorly hinted upon when Khadgar found the book that the dark spirit lead him to in Karazhan. This was right before Medivh sneaks up on him and then cast that spell to hold Khadgar up on the wall and Medivh was yelling about how he was sneaking around spying on his work. Then Lothar comes in and says we need to go.Also near the end of the movie just before Medivh was killed he was almost completely transformed into Sargeras. There was still no actual explanation for any of this transformation in the movie.So again, as a person who has read the books and played through the games and also done much research on the history of things in the Warcraft Universe, I have to admit that there was a very poor job of story telling in the Warcraft movie. I very much hope that there is a sequel but there needs to be a much, much better focus on the important plot points so the audience can be invested in the story. As a player of the games I think there is definite value and enjoyment watching the movie but if you knew nothing regarding the Warcraft Universe and came to see this movie you would walk away wondering what you just saw. Simply put the focus of the story telling was not in the right place. The most important plot points were completely missed. Storytelling focus definitely needs to be worked on if there are plans to have a great series of movies from the Warcraft genre.Many people may disagree with my review but if you ever read the books you'll see that what I have explained is basically correct according to the books, as well as the majority of the Warcraft lore.But I want to give credit where credit is due. The incredible quality of CG is mind-blowing. Stormwind looks like a real life Stormwind the costumes are simply amazing. I love the detail that was put into everything the Orcs tribal look and how their weapons were made of parts of bones, the tusks, literally everything was taken into consideration when it came to costumes for Orcs and the Humans. The areas were so well thought out and look so realistic! Spell casting is simply awesome and looks so cool. Those who know the Warcraft Universe will love this movie.As a total story line and plot point buff I seriously hope that there is an hour and a half of epic extended version released on the Blu- Ray/DVD edition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warcraft is a work of art. It is bigger then ever on the big screen. The action sequences are like nothing you have ever experienced. Warcraft will make you think you are actually there with them in the movie. The directors did a great job bringing the wonderful video game to life. Parents this is based of a popular video game so expect a lot of blood action in the movie and also expect a lot of violence. This was a shocker for me I went into this movie wondering is it going to be good or is it going to be corny and it was out of this world amazing.Warcraft will slap you right in the face with a big powerful punch in the jaw it is like nothing you have ever seen.Parents wait until your kids see this masterpiece they will say thank you so many times that they will get on your nerves.Thank You for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The latest Warcraft franchise epic..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was excellent, despite negative reviews. It was so well that in fact it sold over $145 millions in China with under four days.However, it did have problems. Firstly it lacked any introduction to the universe for new people who had not played the games or read the books. People new to the franchise felt hanging between many characters, areas and plot holes that gave no conclusion. Secondly the movie felt too short, it deserved at-least 4 hours to fully explain and emerge itself into the vast lore of this World. Scenes felt like they moved from one point to another, cutting minutes of missing character development.Finally, the special effects, landscapes, Orc characters. They were all so perfectly designed and brought to life to the big screens. It was a very immersive experience.The story-line was excellent, certainly it might not be well explained to new people. There were a lot of new things that didn't even occur in the lore or the games, that provided something new even to hardcore fans who already knew so much.Overall, this was a fantastic experience. I highly recommend watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining fantasy with an Interesting lore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never played the games, know nothing about them so any Easter eggs and references would get lost on me. The film directly puts you in the middle of this fantasy universe from the start, some people may need some time to get used to it but I dug it. The special effects and CGI are mostly excellent (except for a couple of spots). The action is pretty intense. The lore and the world building of this universe I found quite interesting. The acting was fine, it was cheesy and over the top but I think that was the point, I dug it. Inspite of the CGI and action the film is mainly character driven. Garona and Duraton are the most interesting characters in the film and its their arc that carry the film along with that of an immature magician.The story is straightforward, decent enough. It could have had a normal cliché ending but it ends on a rather interesting note which overall makes it feel like a chapter of a much larger story-line. Inspite of ending on somewhat of an incomplete note, I had a lot of fun watching it. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft was released as video game when I was 14 years old (I'm almost 36) and it was the most talked about PC Mactinosh game in high school. Being a video game movie I was already expecting the movie to be a flop but I was wrong. I was blown away and I still can't believe I enjoyed it immensely. It kept me engaged from start to finish. The plot was great and like other video game movies the creators removed the complexity of getting into too much detail on all the characters by focusing on the key ones. It is action packed, with a touch of comedy and a couple of scenes that pulls the heart strings. Graphics were amazing and the acting was very well done. 10/10 for me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of World of Warcraft for ten years now started the game at 19. I can honestly say the movie does do it justice. I found the cinematics and the visuals very stunning. A lot of times, I kept saying this is what I imagine if it were brought to life. It was nice to see some of the iconic places of the game come to life, as well as some iconic characters. I felt the acting was also great as in no one over acted their part and that kept me interested in the movie.The story line as well as the action balances each other very well. So even if you have never read the books, played either Warcraft or World of Warcraft you can still follow the movie without become bored with it.I do recommend the movie if you are into fantasy and am hoping for a sequel if not even more movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I stopped playing this game 5 years ago because it was very time consuming. Seeing this movie brings back lot of good memories playing with good people on the net for years. For movie itself, the plot is good. The acting is alright. You can feel that people made great effort in making this movie. It is a product of love and dedication given limit financial supports. This movie should be longer to allow the story to be fully developed and allow people who did not play the game understand the setting before jumping into action. The army of Storm Wind should be a lot larger to be more realistic. For the StormWind town, more details on people interacting with each other and have some shopping activities to make it more realistic. I would have a 3 hours movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went and saw this with the family last night. Out of seven of us, 3 (including me) were active and avid Warcraft fans. The other 4 had no back story or knowledge beyond just being exposed over the years. Everyone enjoyed the film, and we all agreed we wished we had seen it in the IMAX 3D since we saw it standard. If you go in with the expectation that this is going to be a movie based on a video game and its lore, then you will not be disappointed. If you go in expecting the next version of Lord of the Rings, you are setting yourself and the movie up to fail and should probably save your money and time. On a side note, as player of all Blizzard games, it was awesome and I hope and pray they are successful enough to generate some sequels and build a film franchise. Remember, the critics hated Star Wars and other major films initially. Don't be so fast write off a movie because of what someone else says.</fullReview>

Yet I have done every raid in the game. That said I really enjoyed this movie taking my son tonight. As I watched a late premier last night. Critics don't give movies based on games a chance. I mean yes there was a lot of info in the movie but not to much to follow. I mean captain America civil war got rave reviews and it was OK. I mean yeah we know the people so you don't have to do back story. What if you had not seen ant-man would you jump up and down because they did not do a back story about where they were born.Anyways if you like fantasy movies it is a very good movie IMO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My expectation for the movie wasn't very high. Blizzard have been making cinematic trailers for each expension, they were great because they were short. Making a movie of similar quality would be much harder. However the movie proved to be fantastic, it not only has great visual effect, it also perfectly fitted stories from two novals into one movie. Yes, the movie is slightly different from the novals but the director successfully made the pieces into a great story. Even the non-fans will like the story and will be amazed by the world of Azeroth. I used to be a college student ten years ago when I played WOW in a Chinese server. I'm a huge fan and read some of the novals about warcraft. I have my own vision while reading the novel however the movie exceeded my imagination. For fans, this will remind you of the good old days doing adventure with your friend in a completely different world. Whether you're a fan or not, this is a movie you must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is coming from both someone who played the games and someone who didn't. First off, it was easy to follow for both of us. Yes, there were tons of easter eggs for the fans, but you can watch this knowing nothing and not have to worry. Second, the cinematography was stunning. This made the giant war scenes a spectacle. The characters where very lovable also. It does stray from the lore a tad, but that's normal with book/game to movie adaptions. It's definitely a great fantasy film. If you loved and of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, give this a shot. This movie ends with being absolutely set up for a sequel, one that me and my non gaming girlfriend both want to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying, it's a shame and unfair what is happening with this film. I play the video game, but to be honest, I wasn't even excited about this film. Why? because I'm 35 years old and I'm not interested in low budget / video game / bad acting movies. With that said, I still went to see it on opening day. I was shocked! It's not bad...it's not bad at all...in 3 words..."go see it!" I cannot understand how all these critics that go into this movie with a so called "open mind" still think it's a bad movie. It's not a blockbuster, but who cares. Not everyone is into fantasy, but those who are into it, it's a really good movie. I'm not here to give you spoilers or anything, I'm here to send a message that I would like those of you into fantasy or movies like "lord of the rings", to ignore the title of this movie. Put aside the idea about the nerdy World of Warcraft and focus on the fact that this is simply a fantasy film with a complicated relationship between Orcs and Humans.I told my wife about the movie when I came home from the first showing and she agreed to go see it with me tonight to give her fair review, since she knows nothing about Warcraft. She hates anything related to Warcraft/World of Warcraft/Blizzard, etc because she thinks it's all nerd stuff. So that will be a real test of a real viewer, which I will update this review with her feedback.</fullReview>

Most super hero movies for example are turned way down low from the comics. Well not this movie. Magic is everywhere and it's the front and focus of it. Unlike some movies where Magic feels weak and it almost seems better to grab a sword or a gun, this movie made magic strong and powerful. The plot moved at a brisk pace which some people complain about, but I love. This was no Lord of the Rings were you spend 20 minutes on montages of people eating and walking. This was constant plot. You couldn't cut a single scene without losing something important. I also loved the fact that the movie was well lit, I was never complaining about shadows hiding things, and every battle was well lit with out Shaky CAM! I hate shaky cam. This movie was great. Will buy on Blu-ray, probably will see it again in theatres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With, at its peak 10-12 million players of the game, I am not sure they needed to make a movie that all the aged critics understood, nor are they trying to make another Lord of the rings, as suggested. The rich history of the game provides plenty of material without needing to be a rip-off. Sadly the scores are unfair from the pro's and spot on by most fans. I suspect many will continue to not "get it", but as I said there is a wonderful base of 10-12 million that will get it. Additionally I foresee many more that never spent a moment in the game that will enjoy it as well, simply because they will not go into it trying to see a rebirth of fantasy flicks prior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie with great visuals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a WoW player, I wasn't expecting much from Warcraft but I was mistaken. This is a fine movie with its fast-paced (perhaps a bit too fast) story-telling, great visuals and Easter Eggs for WoW fanboys, which I think made the movie much more enjoyable.Acting was top-notch. Travis Fimmel's acting had a bit of "The Vikings" touch but it wasn't out of place. In fact, I think it fit quite well. Their efforts to introduce the notable places in Azeroth and its races and orders, I think, fell a bit short. They could spend more time to explain Azeroth. This movie could use another one/one-and-half hour, exclusively focusing on magic, elves, dwarfs and various orders such as Kirin Tor etc. WoW players with relative amount of investment in the story would know these factions and I believe it would be a better move to introduce them and their ways to non-player audience as well.The dose of mystery was just right and it wasn't absent in any part of the movie. If it was a bit longer and more detailed in story, audience would probably leave the theaters with bunch of questions in their minds, which I think is not a bad thing and makes people look for next episodes of a movie.Although I see how people could rate Warcraft below 10, I personally enjoyed it a lot with its flaws. I rate Warcraft 10/10 and recommend it to anyone with relative interest in fantasy movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Video Game Curse is broken - Epic film, even for those not familiar with the lore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this as an avid Warcraft fan but with low expectation for any video game to film port. I'm glad I did so, as this totally beat all my expectations and had me literally on the edge of my seat the whole time. Travis Fimmel was an excellent choice for Lothar, and the CGI is just stunning. The cities are recreated beautifully.Very close to the original lore, the characters, costumes, magic, and battles make it feel like a new contender to The Return of the King, and we're only one film into what is surely going to be a long franchise. A couple of the actors could have been slightly more passionate, but the amazing job done with the horde characters completely makes up for this.Not a fan of Warcraft? Don't worry, you'll still have moments that will give you goosebumps. Looking forward to the rest of the saga on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK movie. for a non fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There may be some spoilers in here. I haven't played WoW at all but i've seen some twitch streams. I am not a fan of WOW and i never will be a fan.However i did give the movie a try. Script was alright but way too much CGI for my taste. However it is good CGI but it is way over the top. The story is surprisingly OK, but then they have to get it right at least one time.I was kind of surprised to see Dominic Cooper from the marvel franchise hop in and take the place as the king... as well as some people from marvel's agents of shield. Conclusion: its an OK movie that is kind of enjoyable to watch but it is way too much hyped, like most of these movies, mainly by the gamers of WoW. So i suggest anyone who hasn't seen the movie to ignore those 8-9/10 because they are hopelessly biased.I gave it a 6/10 because of the excessive CGI, the story was kind of OK but there were glaring problems and way too many one liners or cheesy lines. Too hyped up like many of these films ( Batman v superman, the latest xmen movie, the captain America civil war... don't get me wrong they are OK-ish but not worth to see in the movie theater)I also led my friends opinion guide me so if you are not a fan of the WoW franchise steer clear and wait for bluray/streaming services. It will be way cheaper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the guys completely trashing this movie. Just read.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie won't make you leave the theater with an emotional connection, it won't make you feel unexpected feelings or cry manly man tears. It won't buy you dinner and it won't make you coffee. What it will do, is sit there, and be pretty damn entertaining for the next two hours of your life.Let me point out the cons first so that I can get those out of the way:- Supporting character actors were very lacking in acting ability. Most were cliché at best and "highschool drama class" at worst (looking at you Khadgar).- Pretty predictable plot. I can't think of a time where I was surprised at what was going on.- Pacing. This is a world with depth levels approaching Lord of the Rings and they try to deliver it all at the pace of Mad Max. Fast and the Furious couldn't keep up with this train.- A very abrupt ending. I'd almost call it anti-climactic, and that's probably due to the pacing. The movie is constantly going at 110% so that when you get to 115%, it doesn't feel much different.That's about it. Those are the only things that really stood out to me, and they weren't enough to make me think any less of the movie.Pros: - Excellent main character acting. Holy crap. With the exception of Garona at the very beginning where she attempts to speak broken English (which was actually pretty cringe worthy), I was completely sold on the main characters.- The special effects are the best I have seen in any movie. Ever.- I actually felt for Garona. The end made me feel sadness for her. Some of the characters you really felt for, even if it wasn't enough for it to linger after leaving the theater.- The fight scenes are excellent! Some of them are so brutal and keep you at the edge of your seat!All of that said, some people are calling this the worst of the video game movies. Considering that Dragon Ball: Evolution exists, that statement is not even remotely close to true.This is actually the best video game movie I have ever seen, and its a very solid mainstream fantasy movie. Fans will love it, there's tons of Easter eggs, and I think any fan of the fantasy genre will at the very least enjoy it.As I've said, this was not a 10 out of 10. I'm actually leaning more towards a 7.5, but this universe has so much potential. This movie franchise has so much potential. Hopefully it does well and they can get a better staffed sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has been long awaited for, by myself and fellow wowsters. I won't say gamers because people who play World of Warcraft are a difference bred of gamers, a bit like what New Yorkers are to the rest of America. This was a film I was both excited and apprehensive about, knowing the usual result of games being adapted into films. Read my 'Games on the Big Screen' to see what I mean. Now, I am a avid gamer and a confessional 'vanilla' role-player of World of Warcraft, starting in 2005 and having been clean now for around six years. I have played the games from the first Warcraft game on PC and spent over a whole year, to the minute, of the maybe eighty years I might be lucky enough live, in the realm of Azeroth and beyond. I have made some good friends from around the real world, friends who still visit me and visa versa today. I lost many night's sleep staying up to do 'just one more quest', earned the achievement Loremaster and even attended the BlizzCon in Paris back in 2008. (Just to get my Tyrael mini pet.) This could mean I'll be very bias regarding this review and, and or be unforgiving to the people behind the film. So, I went with a trusted friend who's never played Warcraft and knows nothing about the game so to get his opinion as viewer, but let's say, this film is really for the players, which does make it a challenge to please non-players. The game itself is a phenomenal MMORPG franchise boasting millions of subscribers, larger than some country's populations. It's online economy has been reported to be larger than Bulgaria's and has players from all walks of life, from all over the world, from pornstars to politicians and film stars like Vin Diesel, Mila Kunis and even some of the cast of this film. (Robert Kazinsky! Bill Westenhofer! Put the laptop down! We're filming!)The film is beautiful, luscious and vibrant, baring the game's neon enchantments and stunning landscapes. The scenery is recognisable and I could hear the crowd agree when seeing Ironforge and Stormwind brought to life. I, myself (my characters) having been drunk many a time in the Lion's Pride of Goldshire, (the real me doesn't get drunk, few would argue.)There's a staggered pace to the film, which suggests a lot of edits, sometimes feeling like a lot of cut scenes missing the gameplay but it isn't bad enough to ruin the film. There's a good balance between the Alliance and Horde which pleases me greatly, showing that each side can be just as good and evil. Now the lore has been a little tweaked here and there, but the core of the storyline is very much there and would be surprised to find players raging about the matter. We have to accept some elements have to change for the bigger picture and being that the people at Blizzard were very much behind this film, the tiny glitches and can go unnoticed and the nods to the game that are 'dropped' are good enough. Toby Kebbell is one of my favourite actors, especially in Guy Ritchie's 'RocknRolla' and Shane Meadow's 'Dead Man's Shoes'. He does the clan proud playing the hero Durotan, also playing a Mage for a small bit. Also great was Vikings star, Travis Fimmel playing legendary Lord Commander Anduin Lothar. He reminded me of a sleeker Tom Hardy. Paula Patton (Deja Vu, Ghost Protocol) does a good Garona and Khadgar is well played by Ben Schnetzer. Ben Foster was brilliant as the twisted guardian, Medivh, though my only wish was for the fight to end with an ageing Khadgar. The only nerfed character was Dominic Cooper's King Llane Wrynn. I don't think he was strong enough and I understand he's not to overshadow Lothar, but, he's still a King and a main character at that. I was a little disappointed game-composer, Jason Hayes didn't do the score here as he works on Warcraft have been amazing but, Game of Thrones' and film composer Ramin Djawadi does a fine job embellishing parts of Hayes' game score, highly dramatic. At first I was undecided but looking back on it and refreshing my lore, I enjoyed it. Quite gruesome and pretty at the same time, the CGI is outstanding. 'Moon' and 'Source Code' director, Duncan Jones does a grand job that hopefully gives players and non-players the epic loot they have been waiting for. As for my non-player friend, he enjoyed it greatly, himself saying younger audiences would love this. I can imagine some critics hating on this film but for what it is, it's a great tribute to the Warcraft world and I don't think it could have been done better (apart from casting King Llane) Not that anything has been announced, the UK's title 'Warcraft: The beginning' might suggest a series. I would look forward to seeing more and can only assume it depends on the success on this film, whether they continue. It's definitely aimed at the more 'vanilla' players of the game, such as myself. I will go raid this again. DING!! Running Time: 9 The Cast: 7 Performance: 8 Direction: 9 Story: 9 Script: 6 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 9 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for sticking mostly to the lore as much as cinematographic possible and recreating Azeroth in true fashion. 85% 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun film for Warcraft fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, this movie is not a masterpiece. The acting is a little stiff sometimes, some of the dialogue seems a bit forced and the story is a bit contrived and maybe a bit too fast moving sometimes. But goddamn if this isn't Warcraft!I had the exact amount of lore knowledge to know the characters names but not enough to know what was going to happen to them. I also obviously recognized the world of Azeroth and it was brought beautitifully to life. I was worried the somewhat over-the-top creatures and armors of Warcraft wouldn't translate well to the screen but it really did. The entire movie was a beautiful reference to the Warcraft games, from the polymorph "It lasts about 60 seconds", to the murloc, to the vanilla wow character select music playing in the end it almost made me tear up a bit because I knew this world so well.As for the actors I thought Travis Fimmel did a decent job as main character Anduin Lothar, he pretty much did his old Ragnar from Vikings rouitine and it worked out pretty well. No actor was distinctly bad but most didn't stand out either, the one I do think stood out was Ben Foster as Medivh who I thought did a splendid job with a lot of monologueing. Also Ben Schnetzer did great as the comic relief-y but ultimately game changing Khadgar.Finally the special effects, I had heard that the movie looked like a cinematic for one of those shitty strategy phone games and I can kind of see where they're coming from but I thought It looked great for the most part, It might not have looked real all the time but it looked like Warcraft and I liked that. But then again that comes from someone who likes the look of the Hobbit movies. I was wondering how they were going to handle the pretty mundane spell casting of Warcraft "FIREBALL, FIREBALL, FIREBALL" but I was pleasantly surprised when every spell felt impactful and looked really cool (that 160 million dollar budget).I went into this movie expecting nothing at all. But I was surprised to find a fun and captivating adventure that I would definitely recommend for anyone familiar with the Warcraft universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warcraft - The BeginningTo put it simply, the film serves well to fans of the already established franchise. That is, if you are familiar with the Warcraft universe you have a much higher chance of enjoying this than someone who is not familiar at all. I liked the film, seeing the characters and locations I know and love up there on the screen is what made it for me. But, that is all the film has going for it. Where this film fails as an actual film, is in its pacing. There were moments where within a 5 minute window, 3 scenes would have already passed. Some scenes so short they consisted of only 4 lines of dialogue before being thrown into the next scene. Leaving you with the sense of either wanting more or asking 'was that scene really necessary?' The CGI to me felt lacking, too stylized for my tastes, there were moments where it looked really great and then there were moments where it looked like I was watching a game cut scene. otherwise the world the CGI department created was beautiful. All in all, the film was a bit better than I had anticipated, its score was true to home, feeling very Warcraft-esque, the characters felt relateable and they way 'magic' was portrayed was fun to watch. It just needed better work on its editing/pacing, the script itself (Bad dialogue and character decisions) and some of its CGI. I rate it a 5/10 (5 is average - a lot of people seem to forget that, you find a lot of people using 7 as an average these days)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgia is a dangerous thing ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me put it this way.At some point, World of Warcraft had 10.000.000 paying customers. If we take this plus everyone who bought Warcraft 3 and the other titles in the series, you've got a pre-sold audience for a best- selling movie.Movie adaptations of games usually are hit and miss. Resident Evil was okay but that's about it. Most are a joke. Warcraft though ... is okay, even good.The production value on this is very high. From the effects used to the editing to even the story, it makes sense. There are some small easter eggs that only WoW players will understand that are a nice add to the movie. It is not the next Lord of the Rings movie but it is way more than a way to capitalize on a video game.Why have I've paid the ticket for it? Nostalgia is dangerous. After spending tens of hours in Azeroth, I couldn't resist seeing it in a movie adaptation and I wasn't disappointed. Even if I barely remember the characters by name (they do sound familiar though), it stays true to the universe and the entire two hour was a roller-coaster ride, with hardly any moment to catch a breath.It is a perfect movie? No. It is one of the best video game adaptations ever made? Yes. I've seen most of them. This takes the first prize by a large margin. However, with a $160 mil budget, it was expected.And with an potential market of: 1. 4.5 millions from Warcraft 3. 2. 100 accounts created in WoW ...... You have a pre-sold market that wants to see it, no matter if it is good or bad. The thing is that it is actually good. If you also add the fact that there are many people who never played the games and want to see it, I don't doubt this will enter the top fifty best sold movies of all times. So yes, spend your $10 on it, it is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never played the game (or, for that matter, had any interest in this type of games - I'm a FPS guy) so for me there is only this movie. After forcing myself (yes, sorry) to watch it, I must say that it is a pleasant surprise. Direction is excellent and the character performances very good. Yes, this movie contains elements from many others (harry potter, avatar, star wars, stargate, LotR and so forth) but it is a well done "compilation"and very entertaining. Of course, it could not be done with an abundance of sfx and they are up to the standards. However, the movie is not for the kids, except for those still living inside adult viewers. As I said, cannot recommend the game (still does not interest me) but as the movie - go for it and have fun. It is really good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I don't really know if this contain 'spoilers' but just in case, beware. First going into the cinema, I was pumped. My dad and I have avidly played World of Warcraft for many years and I personally have looked into the lore and read some of the books. Although I haven't played the first three Warcraft, I know a lot about what happened regarding lore. In general, the story was eh when it comes to accuracy, but the visuals were amazing. For having an 100 million dollar budget, they did good. Seeing iconic towns and areas come to the big screen in such detail was pretty great. The orcs looked pretty realistic as well so you can tell they put a lot of effort into the CGI. But its hard to say if the visuals made up for the lack of character development and very fast plot. I don't know if it was due to budgetary reasons that the movie isn't even 2 hours, but they could have made it a little longer and thus put more story behind the characters. Personally, I could follow what was happening and following the characters, but for people that have never even heard of World of Warcraft, it may have been a struggle to keep up with all of the names and pretty much who was doing what. All in all, the movie could have been amazing if the plot was as good as the visuals. Hopefully the filmmakers lived and learned because I really wouldn't mind a trilogy, not going to lie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very solid fantasy movie (which are scarce)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first review on IMDb and that says something.I grew up on fantasy. Read all of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons books, was fascinated by Warhammer, Read LoTR and Silmarillon, read the whole thing by Tad Williams (much better than LoTR btw, read it again a year ago just to make sure). Ultimately, when I was younger, everything was captivating: the landscapes, the power, the EPIC of it. You can find it all in Warcraft the movie. I was trying to find a comparison, or a contender to this movie. There are none. The only thing that comes to my mind is the Huntsman for their fairy tale world. People keep comparing this one to Game of Thrones, or LoTR, saying that this is not it.. well it's not, neither it was supposed to be. And this is by design. What Warcraft proposes is a completely new quality, a different approach, visual and narrative, to hundred years old tales. Spoiler: it doesn't use the ash filters very much. And people in it are not generally looking sad, or malnutrition-ed.I gave it a 7, in my opinion it's closer to 6.5 and I believe that this is fair. The story is the same one reinvented, the story about power and the corruption it brings. About its price. A story about loyalties, responsibility (for your kin, for your clan, for your race). And the story unfolds steadily and with proper pace. There is a couple of things that might be counted as the movie vices: - there is a lot of CGI, and I mean A LOT - it is generally pretty good, but if you're not a fan, then you might just as well skip the whole thing (and if you're a fan I can recommend Final Fantasy: Advent Children, Appleseed and Ghost in the Shell 2) - The motivations of the characters included are not always sufficiently explained - and upon reflection, this is pretty big, I mean we can imagine them, but can't know for sure and this affects a lot of characters in the movie. I think that the only motivations we know for sure are the group character - Horde, Anduin Lothar, Durotar and Garona, maybe Llan Wrynn, but certainly not Gul'Dan, Medivh, Khadgar, or the Kirin Tor mages. Which brings us to the next point - this is the first installment and the amount of things it is trying to convey is head spinning. I get it, first installment, you need to set the stage, but LoTR 1 did it over 3 hours and there wasn't much fighting in it, so it could really develop the story. You didn't have this comfort, so the script should've been reviewed. - The CGI in a couple of instances sucked - like in that fight scene in the mountains, or the last fight scene - generally not a big thing, just needs notingMajority of the movie thought was excellent, I am just trying to be fair. The things to look for and those that were particularly good: - depiction of magic - magic play a big role in fantasy movies, however people generally don't know how to show it, this movie does an excellent job of it - (as said previously) good storytelling tropes showed in a fresh way - well paced, well balanced - high fantasy without the obvious: beautiful people are good, ugly orcs are bad attitudeAll in all 6.5 is fair. Even if you never heard of Warcraft but is remotely interested in fantasy as a genre, you would do yourself a favour to go and see this movie. I know that the previous sentence is an oxymoron, but I choose to end with it, Thanks for reading!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shadow of what it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched the Warcraft movie and I found it underwhelming. Not in terms of visuals, of which I found amazing despite being mostly CG, but rather in terms of buildup and relate-ability. The pacing was slow, the characters were walking stereotypes, and the whole conflict could be resolved in a few minutes if people were listening to common sense instead of ignoring the obvious. Hey guys, that green magic thing is not good. Why are you all pretending you don't see it? Then it's the world building that despite feeling like there is a lot to it, they never go beyond surface level. You see Dwarfs and Elves, flying magic islands, lots of kingdoms, and none of them have any personality or lore to distinguish them from any other fantasy setting. Yes, there is definitely a lot of that if you play the game but the movie does not attempt it because it assumes you are already familiar with all that. This does not excuse how bland it feels for anyone who hasn't played the game, and even I who play Hearthstone daily, I found it to be very dull.Then it's the scene transitions which felt very sloppy at many points. They were showing a few seconds of something, before jumping to something else, resulting to not giving you enough time to comprehend or care about its importance. I understand that there are time restraints in moves, you can only do this much in two hours, which begs the question of why did they stuff so many characters when they knew there isn't enough time to flesh them out? They should have a smaller cast or the movie should instead be a series. With everything being bare-bones and shown in a hurry, you are just not engaged.Terrible pacing aside, the story is not special either. It's a pretty straightforward scenario of two civilizations clashing for survival. The concept is OK for making a mediocre war drama out of, but when the solution is so obvious and yet everybody is blind to it, then you cannot take anything seriously. Not to mention how vague everybody's motivations are. Why did the warlock resurrect the baby? Why did the female orc reveal everything about her people right away? Why didn't the wizards sense fel magic when it's everywhere? Why did the orc chieftain challenge the warlock to a duel before he brought all the orcs on Azeroth? There is no clear answer to any of that.Also, they were abusing magic to make anything possible way too often. I lost count of how many times the guardian teleported or opened portals to wherever the hell he wanted. There is never a sense of distance because they can fly or teleport anywhere they want, and the sudden scene transitions are making you assume the whole world of Azeroth has the size of a small country.It is not a complete travesty of a movie, since the colors are pretty, the battle scenes look amazing when magic is not involved, and it doesn't have a typical fairy tale ending. It was actually pretty grim and almost depressing. If you just want to have mindless fun based on a video game you play for years, it's going to be a blast. Other than that, it's only a shadow of what it could have been if it was a series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an amazing movie. I think people who have down-voted this movie, didn't get it; and they complain about movie being only for game fans. I have never played a single Warcraft game and I loved this movie. Story line was perfect; by the end of the movie you could see how perfectly it was written, how setup was done for the upcoming movies. The visuals were perfect; emotions, action, dialogues, casting, everything worked out. I was holding myself against saying this, but if one doesn't get a movie as simple as this, then he/she must have a very low IQ. This reminded me of how BvS was rated; critics didn't get that movie too and complained about it being for comic fans. Trust me, if you have a decent IQ, you can figure out any story line (I have never read a single DC comics). To sum it up, for me this movie means a new franchise; it had me checking my phone as soon as movie finished, to learn more about the Warcraft world; and you know what was the first thing I googled? "Who is Thrall".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review is for the regular version, not .3D or IMAX.I didn't expect the Warcraft film to be this excellent. It s magnificent. It must be hard for those not familiar with the stories and characters to follow this though. In many ways the Warcraft "lore," is far more complicated then "Lord of the Rings." Because the Warcraft stories are so sprawling and each aspect if the story requires minutia details, this film is just a tiny tip of the iceberg. I hope it makes a fortune at the Box Office, to ensure many more films to come.I saw the midnight show last night in Hollywood during the first giant battle scene, there was a large earthquake in Anza Borego in CA. The earthquake was thundering along with the Orc and Human armies. It was surreal.Technically the film excels. My only complaint would be that I'd prefer more wide screen long shots. The film is mostly closeups. Back that camera up more for wider panoramas.A 10! See it a few times while it's in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than your average video game adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to video game adaptations, Hollywood has proved time and time again that it's unable to produce compelling, entertaining narratives that appeal to fans of the games themselves and general audiences. While Lara Croft: Tombraider found some success in 2001, films such as Super Mario Bros. and Doom failed to perform at the box office and received widespread critical backlash upon their release. Regardless, studios still try to find a formula that works on the big screen when it comes to video game adaptations and despite many flaws, Duncan Jones's Warcraft is one of the better films based upon a popular game.it could have been a disaster. Based upon the long-running World of Warcraft series, the film has a legion of loyal fans to impress while also bringing in casual viewers who have no experience with the game. With so much history to fit in, Jones was always at a slight disadvantage when adapting the source material, yet with Warcraft he's created a fantasy film that should be able to hold it's own against the superheroes gracing our screens during blockbuster season and doesn't depend upon knowledge of the game itself.Set in the fictional Azeroth, Warcraft tells the story of a legion of Orcs attempting to invade and conquer the world of humans after their own lands have been destroyed by dark magic. Unwilling to allow the creatures to burn Azeroth's villages and take it's citizens hostage, King Llane (Dominic Cooper), Commander Lothar (Travis Fimmel), and the realm's Guardian, Medivh (Ben Foster), try and stop the Orc forces with the help of the half-human, half-Orc Garona (Paula Patton). It may sound like a classic case of good vs evil, yet Warcraft cleverly tells both sides of the story and reveals that the enemy the humans face may not actually be the real threat to Azeroth. As the two sides wage war, an alliance is formed between Frostwolf Chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbel) and the humans in an attempt to stop the demonic forces that plague both their worlds.It's an ambitious effort to create a fantasy epic that doesn't follow all the usual beats and Jones does a fantastic job at presenting the Orc's motivations while the humans try to drive them back. With some surprise plot points that are rarely seen in films such as this, Warcraft at times feels like a breath of fresh air in a genre that has become all too predictable, yet it's ambition ultimately leads to the films biggest flaw; pacing. With a runtime of only 2 hours, Jones and his crew had an awful lot to fit into the narrative in order to tell a cohesive story. It's because of this that the first act seems extremely rushed in an attempt to introduce all of the key components so that the battle between the two sides may commence. Given that this is a fantasy film, this often leads to some fantastical elements being brushed over and unless audience members have played the game in the past, this may lead to some confusion upon a first viewing.When we do enter the second act, however, the film seems to find it's feet and becomes quite an enjoyable affair which sees the humans and Orcs come to blows several times. Though these encounters are often over quickly, they are entertaining nonetheless and showcase Jones's talents when working with largely CGI environments and characters, proving that the young, indie director is ready to move into blockbuster territory after the success of smaller productions such as Moon and Source Code. His ability to find interesting shots hidden within the battles is impressive and helps elevate Warcraft above films similar to it, yet he often fails to properly flesh out the characters he's handling throughout.Some fair better than others with Orc Chieftain Durotan in particular proving to be a compelling protagonist rising up against others of his kind seeking to conquer Azeroth. His motivations for betraying his people are both clear and justified, and his role as both a husband and a father is examined several times during the film, which is much more than be said of Commander Lothar. Travis Fimmel has enough charisma to make the character work on the big screen, yet there's very little depth given to him throughout besides a brief scene involving his (mostly absent) son and it's aftermath and because of this, it's hard to engage with him at times. The same can be said of Garona and Medivh who are both present throughout, but certain aspects of their characters backgrounds are merely alluded to and remain slightly unclear even when the credits begin to roll.Despite some shallow characterisation, however, the film manages to remain entertaining from the second act onwards and it's climatic showdown between the humans and the Orcs proves to be a joy to watch on screen. With impressive CGI from start to finish, in particular the Orcs themselves, Warcraft is a visually interesting and the film's reluctance to conform to a Hollywood happy ending deserves applause, especially in an age when Marvel's family friendly films dominate. Should the film be successful enough to earn a sequel, it'll be interesting to see how Azeroth and the beings that reside within it learn to live amongst one another in harmony.Problems with pacing and characterisation plague the film yet Jones and co. have created a video game adaptation that is fun to watch at the very least. Some daring plot points and an often inventive narrative ensure that Warcraft is value for money this blockbuster season despite it's flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glorious high fantasy film that had room for improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't really get into the Warcraft RTS games and my experience with World of Warcraft results in wandering around a forest picking up piles of logs so I pretty much knew nothing of the lore or the world (and you shouldn't be required to either). But I've always been a fan of fantasy films such as Legend and Excalibur and collected Warhammer for a while so I found this film a good fit for my tastes.I think if you're engaged by it enough at the start you're going to follow the film easily enough but I feel they could have spent longer in some locations as you barely spend any time in one location to learn anything about it, but the story is easy to follow and I think they did do a good job of establishing visual look of the world.I was really surprised by how much of a connection I made with the main Orc, Durotan played by Toby Kebbell and his relationship with his wife and thought the Orcs as a whole had the more interesting story. The humans on the other hand were a little bit flat and some of the acting wasn't that good but the main roles were good enough and there are some interesting elements to their story.I think the most striking thing about the film is the look of it and I can see how some people might think it looks a bit silly but personally I liked the exaggerated, larger than life look and it helps set this universe apart from others. The CGI for the Orcs was pretty amazing and the technology really captured the subtleties of some of the performances. There were a few moments though when things get a little too cartoonish but overall it's visually impressive.I think the film suffered from not having an extended length as you lose some of the motivations for characters and every now and then it will cut away and then cut back and it'll seem like you missed something, and I think this is the biggest flaw of the movie as you don't get long enough to take information in before you're whisked away again.I think a longer run time would have helped establish the locations, the characters and the rules to the magic and made for a clearer, more interesting film, but I think overall it was a glorious high fantasy film that has room for improvement and I hope and look forward to a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm finally sure that I won't ever listen to the critics again. I don't know what they're at, but this was a good movie. Fantasy world unlike any other, believable depiction of the warcraft world and at the end also a really good action/war movie with occasional humor. Acting is better than average. I think that critics should make up their minds. Meta 32?? Tomatoes 29?? Are you kidding me? I talked to people who never played or heard about warcraft and they'd give this movie at least 6/10, fantasy lovers 7/10 and warcraft lovers even more. US audience should stop listening to critics, it's a shame. Make your own decisions, don't let others tell you what you should or shouldn't like. Peace out everybody, I hope there will be a sequel.</fullReview>

When I did see it for the first time my expectations were not too high, due to bad reviews. I must say that my feeling after the movie was surprisingly positive. During the 123 min run time I was not bored a single second. And the special effects of the movie is just totally awesome. Some say that it was the best effects they have ever seen and in some ways I do agree. All the people out there that don't believe in the movie, give it the chance it deserves!

		<fullReview>From playing the game to watching it become a movie is astounding. I came with the impression that it's going to be a major big FLOP like all the other movies that's been made to movies from games. This movie did not disappoint me at all, I was very well captivated with the visual and OMG the music is intense~! Story was so clear so even non Warcraft fans would clearly understand whats going on and not be lost in the story. From a YouYuber who does VFX for his video contents I could say the immense work they put in to make the world become a Warcraft world is incredible. If you're questioning it, just go watch it for yourself. You'll be left with a good impression, I'm really looking forward for the next Warcraft movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's worth seeing. The special effects are incredible. The actors playing the orcs are outstanding. And the ending is almost awesome then becomes tropish but still good.You've seen this happen before.. when writers/directors try to shoehorn 50 things into 30 seconds.. but don't have the talent to do it. What LOTR did perfectly (conveying 50 things in a 2 minute scene with hardly any dialogue) this fails at. You can tell every scene is cut for time and the actors try to babble their piece of the exposition in.. it doesn't work. You cant blame the actors.. thats pure writing/directing. They've set up for a sequel but honestly they should have taken their time, split this into two movies and done it right. If you miss it .. well you didn't miss anything. If you saw it.. well.. it's entertaining. You wont remember the plot or the characters a week from now.. even if you're a wow fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie intended for the FANS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the movie as it was released on May 25 here on PH and what I can say is that this movie is indeed for the fans. I loved it. But I can see why critics and "the not initiated" not liking the movie. The CG is great. trust me. i really loved Gul'dan here (not because i main as a Warlock haha).What I can nitpick though is how fast paced the story was. Thus, for those who are new to the story, will not find themselves attached to the characters and not see how relevant the events are. The movie is just around 1hr and 45min (not including credits). Should they had decided to make it a 3hr movie, this movie could have been made more friendly to the normal movie goers. But it will undoubtedly bloat the needed budget. (from what i read, the budget for this movie was around $160m)I personally rated the movie 8/10 (maybe 8.5) but if I have to put myself as someone who doesn't know anything about the lore of Warcraft, I rate the movie 4~5/10. The saving grace was the CGI used in the movie.If you want to know my taste of movies, here is the rating I will give to the latest movies I watched.Capt America: Civil War - 8.8Jungle Book - 8.5Batman v Superman - 4X-men: Apocalypse - 5Deadpool - 6.8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What were the critics thinking!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Warcraft" is directed by underrated director Duncan Jones, who brought us "Moon" (2009) and "Source Code" (2011). Both films are very underrated and so is "Warcraft". I saw the movie yesterday with a friend and honestly I didn't know what to expect of it. Many critics were hating on the film but it was directed by Duncan Jones, so how bad could it really be? Walking out of the theater I was very satisfied with the movie. Jones brings the Warcraft world to the big screen beautifully. I never got into the game and never even played it so I don't know a thing about the universe or the world itself. With "Warcraft" you don't have to know/play the game to enjoy the movie because Jones does such a good job bringing the universe to you and doesn't leave you hanging. Throughout the film I couldn't help but feel this "Lord of the Rings" (2001; 2002; 2003) kind of vibe.The film feels that way because the structure and the universe of the film very well resembles that of "The Lord of the Rings". One thing I must say is that the motion capture and CGI for the film is spectacular. Everything looks real and has beautiful detail. The movie plays the clichéd romance which felt very cheesy considering that the two characters didn't have that much in common and it was truly just poor writing. At times you can see where the CGI and actors differ very drastically, but considering how great the movie looks with all this CGI you can't help but let it slide. There were times where I laughed/giggled at serious or dramatic moments in the film. It felt cheesy and kind of cringe worthy. For a film to be called "Warcraft" you should expect a lot of combat and boy do you get it. I was actually surprised how violent the film was since it had a PG-13 rating. You see limbs get blown up and cut off, and bones being broken, and I love it. You feel the force and power that the film has during its combat scenes. At times I even did an "OOOHHH!" during a fight scene. The performances in the film are good to say the least, they're nothing spectacular but they fit for the film itself. The protagonist of the film is a cool character who I enjoyed seeing on the screen but I couldn't help but feel that his character was very underdeveloped. Toby Kebbell who voiced the main orc of the film was by far the most interesting and relate-able character of the entire film; and he's not even human! You cared much for the character and what was going to happen to him. The film has an issue with the human characters. Whenever we transition back to the humans I couldn't help but feel that the film slowed down drastically. The characters of the humans are very uninteresting and nothing new. Plus, they were at times boring. But whenever we went back to the orcs the film picked up its pace because the characters of the orcs are much more well developed, and they were simply more interesting than the humans. I cared much more about the orcs than the humans. Overall "Warcraft" is a solid film by director Duncan Jones, but critics tend to disagree with a 27% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Honestly the critics got it wrong this time, I don't know why but they just did. If you're looking for a fun, harmless, Summer movie "Warcraft" is definitely the one to go see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe why the critics smashed the movie. I mean - seriously, stupid and pathetic movie "TED" with fart jokes and stupid porn jokes has better rating than Warcraft? Or last stupid Hobbit movies are better? I'm from Poland and I am very sad to say that, but American critics are stupid, really. Once they smashed really cool movie The Lone Ranger, and now they smash Warcraft. I can't get it.Warcraft is the best movie I've ever seen. Not only because I'm huge Warcraft fan, but this movie is: smart, funny, entertaining, beautiful and full of magic and battles. There's much more magic than in all Harry Potter and LOTR movies combined. And there are no cheesy dialogues and scenes like in Hobbit movies.All my friends loved the movie. I've seen many fan reviews - on RT fan's gave Warcraft 81%, on one polish movie page it's 7,6/10 and on the theaters's website it has 9.2/10. People LOVE this movie and I recommend the critics to change their perspective.</fullReview>

The cinema I saw it in was rather empty for opening day, I won't be going to play the game any time soon. They jump around place too place a lot and not every character was given time to grow, sadly That is why I gave it a 4/10 hopefully the fans enjoy the film and it did it fan service.</fullReview>

This is in line with that bit of refuse. Had I known, I never would've wasted my time watching this. My energies would've been much better spent watching online porno. The story line is difficult at best. The characters are none appealing and probably deserve the peril that should be around every corner.

		<fullReview>If a title that strong as Warcraft is taken for a movie, you better prepare a good one! And here, even without the whole 'being a Warcraft' glamour, this is a pretty weak movie! The plots are easy to predict, the acting is below average, the dialogues don't build anything, and the whole story does not pull one into it making it a movie that you want to see till the end. I would say you wait for the end, but for the wrong reasons - for it to end, and not to see what happens in the end. Will a fantasy fan watch it with pleasure? Not sure. Will a movie lover watch it with pleasure? For sure no. One thing good about the movie, is that when you think (and there are numerous places where you encounter such scenes) that something in the movie will happen that will make the film a complete disaster, this does not happen. But man - should we praise a movie for that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Review: Warcraft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, first and foremost, I will begin this review by saying that I am not, and never have been a Warcraft player of any sort; meaning, I have not touched the online game, board game, card game or any Warcraft product since its inception. So, going into Duncan Jones' third directorial feature film Warcraft, I was a complete outsider amongst an army of loyal and very aware Warcraft users. Unlike most built-in audiences, each and every person who was in attendance of the early screening, possessed none of the typical geeky, fan-boy characteristics I have come to expect from franchises such as Star Wars, Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings film franchises. So, how did I feel finally being an outsider and what exactly did the audience I attended the screening looked like?The thing with the Warcraft universe is that everyone at some point tried it and you would never know who is a Warcraft fiend. Young, old, men, women, Warcraft is the type of obsession that could be just about for anyone. So, while I am somewhat aware of the massive universe Duncan Jones was responsible for bringing to life on the big screen, I had no idea how expansive and detailed this world really is.Upon the opening frames, seeing humans battle off against Orcs, and beginning much of the story in a fantastical world of Azeroth, I was one of few audiences members who was just along for the ride, and not for the love of the universe, but for the love of cinema. Having been late to the party with Lord of the Rings (truth of the matter is, I have never seen any of them nor have any interest to), one of the biggest complaints with many of my friends now with Middle Earth is, thanks to the massive success of HBO's Game of Thrones, violence, sex and exponential gore is what audiences want with fantasy films. The action solely isn't enough anymore. And while Daenerys Targaryen actress Emilia Clarke's newest film Me Before You, a romantic drama was playing in the cinema beside mine, I couldn't help but laugh at the fact that, fantasy doesn't always sell anymore; but sex surely does. As I can assure you, I may have never seen an episode of Game of Thrones, but you can sure as heck bet I have seen pictures on the interest of Clarke's bodacious naked bod.With Warcraft, the premise is simple. Orcs, lead by a sadistic leader who possesses the fel, Gul'Dan (Daniel Wu), sucks the life out of other world's inhabitants and uses their energy to open up a portal to a new world, inhabited by human, called Azeroth. To the dismay of Durotan (Toby Kimmell) an his pregnant wife Draka (Anna Galvin), they follow along with Gul'Dan's plans only in hope of finding a peaceful life in the new world. Once through the portal, Gul'Dan wages war against the humans who inhabit that kingdom, putting him in a direct collision course with King of Stromwind Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), and as well as his trusty and noble military commander Sir Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). A fierce warrior and destructive orc killer, Anduin finds himself partnered with the fumbling Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), a young and inexperienced warlock whose powers have yet to be contained. Advised by the council due to the recent threat of the orcs, Anduin and Khadgar head to Karazhan to summon the Guradian Medivh (Ben Foster) and use his wisdom and powers to help defeat the army of orcs and Gul'Dan once and for all.Fantasy isn't my preferred genre of cinema to watch. Being able to capture these films on the big screen is something wonderful though, especially amongst all its loyal and faithful fans. While the world of the Warcraft universe is highly new and almost unheard of to me, I can honestly say that I was very intimidated by its great reach and length, along with its history. After all, the first ever sighting of the Warcraft real-time strategy game came in 1994, when I was only a child. Imagine how much the world has grown since then? Like anything fanatical and with such a rich history, the more you know, the better. Was I a fan of the film as a whole by the time I left the theatre? Maybe not the biggest, but, does that suggest it was a bad film overall?I believe that audience members, especially ones for this fantastical, built-in audience, is important to consider, especially given the universe's endless possibilities. But, what is the difference between a built in universe such as Warcraft, or, say, the cinematic universe of Marvel or DC? Comic book characters that have been around decades and whose worlds mix, blend and cross- over to other universes regularly? Nothing really. So with that said, as a whole, was Warcraft an amazing fantasy experience? Absolutely not. At times, the film suffers from straining and overwhelming special effects, especially during its action sequences, its action is brute and forceful, giving audiences a bit of a spectacle overload. Where does the film succeed most? In its glory and beauty of showing off the orcs by the firelight, in the dark or marvelling at the great narrative scenes of honour and glory, especially when the camera gazes against the massive arms and shoulders of its main orc protagonist Durotan.</fullReview>

The others races are pretty well done, especially the orcs, jeez they look really good, every punch they give looks awesome, you can feel the weight and the pain, and the expressions in their faces are just amazing.I have another problem with the characters, especially the humans, they looks weird, but that it's not the only thing, my problem it's with the performance, the only character that interested me was the protagonist, the others I don't feel like I care about their lifes, and the names, god the names, there are so many characters and so many weird names that I can't remember any one (Seriously, i cant).Those are my problems with the movie, but if you don't pay attention to that or you don't care about it, it's a good movie, it's fun, clever, interesting, and i think that get to the point, invites you to play the video games telling you a little bit of the story, I'll waiting for a sequela, you can watch it with friends, have fun, and entertain you, I recommend it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I begin? I have never played WoW &amp; I believe fans of the game will quite enjoy this film. The Orcs looked really cool &amp; I liked the main orc character, but coming into this with no understanding of the world or characters I was mostly lost. The problem with introducing so much in so little time is that everything falls a little flat. The characters don't develop strong enough to care for them and you get a sense there is something really great going on, I'm just not seeing it. I believe this might have worked better as a 10 episode series and then a feature film, especially in today's media universe where detail and development are key to engaging the audience. I can't imagine the film did anything to expand the audience. I will say many of the sets, costumes and cinematography is nice, but a little too computer graphics generated to help make the environment more believable. Had I produced this film, I would focused the story down to the main orc, made it a smaller story in a larger universe, like A New Hope, and used more real constructed sets and less CGI, much like what Star Wars is now doing. I am sure there will be more to come, so my best advice is to find someone else at the helm, but I will check out the next one and see how it grows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My experience with the world of Warcraft is limited to the classic video game Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness, the RTS (Real Time Strategy) which was quite popular in the mid- 90s, one decade before that the studio Blizzard turned the franchise into a hugely successful MMORPG (online role playing game with thousands of players). So, I know some basic elements of the war between orcs and humans, but I have never deepened into the extensive "lore" developed during many years of conflicts and cataclysmic events in the virtual universe of World of Warcraft. That might be the reason why I found the film Warcraft moderately entertaining, but so hollow that its assimilation by casual audiences will be difficult. Among the pros, Warcraft displays an impressive production design, while the orcs are made as digital figures with motion capture and very realistic appearance... with the exception of the facial animation which can't express emotions as eloquently as if they were "real"; fortunately, the voice actors (such as Clancy Brown, Toby Kebbell and Daniel Wu) bring enough personality and emphasis to attenuate that limitation. On the negative side, I found the screenplay of Warcraft poorly structured and full of wordiness which doesn't contribute to the development of the story. There are too many scenes with characters speaking in serious tones, without offering concrete explanations; they simply repeat what we already know, or describe what we are watching, instead of establishing the necessary bases of "world building" to emotionally capture us, or at least, bring the fights, alliances and betrayals substance. And if the answer is "you need to play World of Warcraft to understand", then the film failed as an independent entity. Anyway, the result is a movie which is visually attractive, but narratively weak because it employs clichés instead of drama. As for the actors, Ben Foster exaggerates so much as the sorcerer Medivh that it's impossible to take him seriously, while Travis Fimmel and Ben Schnetzer (as the heroes by default) feel apathetic and distant; on the other hand, Dominic Cooper, Paula Patton and Ruth Negga feel credible in their roles. In conclusion, Warcraft didn't bore me, in part because of the nostalgia of the RTS in which I invested many hours of my life; and in part, because of its visual achievements. However, I feel that the film needed a firmer hand from director Duncan Jones, or less corporate influence from the army of producers (12, according to IMDb). I'm not particularly interested in watching a sequel, but I was left with wishes to install the old Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness in order to listen to the voices of orcs following my orders again, and enjoy the mini-battles with low-resolution 2D sprites, which back in the '90s, brought me much more excitement than the expensive and photo-realistic mediocrity of the film Warcraft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a long time the hype was through the roof for this fantasy blockbuster, not only as a potential Lord of the Rings successor ? orcs and dwarfs and wizards (oh my!) ? but also as the motion picture to break the pattern of poor computer-game adaptations. Thankfully the resolutely mediocre trailers brought expectations crashing back down to Earth, because if you enter the cinema hoping for a fantasy masterpiece you'll be sorely disappointed. Go in with more restrained anticipation and there's two hours of silly fun to be had. Unlike LOTR there's no set story to adhere to for writer-director Duncan Jones, so the narrative takes the form of an orcs-vs-humans war saga, with the (pleasantly respectable) runtime split equally between the two races. The plot is largely predictable and uninventive ? undefined magic powers are lazily employed to gloss over holes ? but there's a surprisingly strong focus on character development that lends the movie an emotional side and subsequently increases the stakes at play. Considering the source material, the massively multiplayer online role-playing game 'World of Warcraft', the universe isn't explored or fleshed out as much as it could have been either, with the finale frustratingly open-ended. Of course the action is priority number one though, and there are a plethora of clashes, both big and small, to get the adrenaline pumping. Despite the numerous all-in battles, it's a bone crunching one-on-one fight between two powerful orcs that is the standout. Unfortunately there's an over-reliance on CGI that detracts from proceedings; all of the orcs are created via motion-capture technology and majority of the external environments are entirely digital, feeling particularly hollow. Not the most memorable of beginnings for what will undoubtedly become an ongoing cinematic series; Warcraft is nevertheless an energetic, ambitious and successfully diverting piece of escapism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spoiler-free review of Warcraft: The Beginning for both fan and non-fan movie goers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I need to let you know that I am a huge fan of the Warcraft universe and Blizzard games for a long time. I have big expectation for this movie for two reasons: it is a Warcraft movie and being made by passionate individuals who respect, understand and love the source materials, namely Duncan Jones, the director of the film.With all that being said, lets get to the review so that I can tell you my opinions about various aspect in the movie. 1. The story and settings: Warcraft: The Beginning is a movie about the war between two races: the humans, who are natives in the world of Azeroth, and the orcs, whose invasion was forced because of the decaying state of their homeland. Jones intended to bring a more compelling perspective where both sides have their own motivations to participate in battles as oppose to the generic, straight-up good versus evil stereotypes we saw many times in Lords of the Rings or the likes. And he nailed it with the excellent portrayal of the orcs. You feel that they are not monsters. That they are sentient beings. That they have culture,language and traditions. Even though their baring tusks, outlandish hairstyle and warmonger, tribalistic demeanor are not exactly empathy-provoking. In contrast, the human world and its population are as dull as they could get. They run around, doing their epic quests in their amazingly-put-together, faithfully-designed armor sets while the orc's storyline explores very humane problems like the destructive lust for power, the helplessness in the race against extinction or the ever-ending conflict between duty and personal priorities.It is ashamed that the human's robotic, lack-luster nature really clouded the movie's noble attempt. 2. The acting and charactersOverall, the acting is averagely good. With the humans being mediocre, and the orcs being decent, especially the orc main protagonist. The film features a big,if not daunting, cast of characters from either sides. I like the approaches Jones and his talented team took on each character. However, the problem is, some of them show off their lack of personality depths and one- dimensional writing fairly quick the deeper you get into the movie which is a little bit unfortunate. I grew to care about the orcs, and their fate more than I did with the humans. I also thought an important role on the human side was a miscast. That the actor did not fit the role (hint:the character's name starts with M.) 3. The sounds and visualsThe sounds and visuals in Warcraft are amazing! From the statuesque, towering physique of the orcs to the bone-crushing blows of their hammers bringing fury upon their foes. You can feel the human bones and their frail bodies just crumble under the massive onslaughts that penetrate through their shields and armors. The music was great, and the CGIs looked more realistic than ever. The battles were brutal and in your face. Some of the action and fighting shots just blew me away. It really spoke volumes of the dedication,talents, and quality that went into the production of this movie. I can say without hesitation that the film is still enjoyable for its action alone even if you have no ideas what the hell is going on most of the time. 4. The narration and pacingThe pacing is what brings the movie down the most to me. Warcraft, along with Batman v. Superman, became lesser when they entered the editing rooms. The film rightfully deserved (and definitely would have profited from) more screen time. It had a very strong start in the first 5 to 10 minutes, but it flashed through locations and characters so fast you could not grasp any emotions or ideas for the next 20 minutes. Transition is jarring, and in some case even disappeared, indicated that the movie was heavily and rawly cut.It was quite anti-climatic when this happened in some scenes. The speed of narration was eventually the greatness-killer of Warcraft. 5.ConclusionIn the end, Warcraft is an entertaining movie that has a few stand- out,epic moments.As a non-fan movie goer, you probably would not understand half of the things that are going on. But, again, the action, the awesome CGIs and cinematography still grip your attention. I guarantee you shall find enjoyment in it, and your money is well paid. However, I strongly recommend you stay away from the critics'reviews of Warcraft which has been bashing the hell out of it since its release. They scored it 0, 1 or 2, calling it the worst movie of this year or all time. My advise? Do not listen to those garbage. Go see the movie and judge it by yourself.Warcraft is mediocre at worst. And condemn it as trash, or crap is outright arrogance or lies. I hope you will have a good time with the movie. Thank you for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just might buy this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew of this movie, that it is coming out but it did not interested me that much. I never played the game and the trailers didn't do a thing for me. Than the movie opened in the states and critics wrote it off right away as a failure. Today I wanted to see a movie, and this was the only one on play that I have not seen yet but was willing to pay for. Given that my only expectation was to be entertained, I must say that this movie was a very pleasant surprise. It is not a great movie, not by a long shot, but it does the job it was set out to do rather well. And that job was: set up a franchise.The good: The basic plot of the movie is quite good and there were some twists and turns that really payed off. The ending especially was very satisfying to me. The orcs look freakin great and basically all the scenery look beautiful. The genre of the movie is fantasy and it shows. another thing that I really liked is that the wast majority of the actors who were not doing motion capture are best know for their TV work, so this movie could be a career launching pad for many talented people.The not so good: The movie is based on a computer game and has to set up the franchise, meaning that it has to show locations and factions and stuff that are not relevant to this movie. Now, this movie already has a build in audience of millions of gamers to whom all this exposition is useless because they already know the mythology of the world our story is set, but as for the casual movie goer, that only knows that warcraft is a popular game, at best. So half of the first act is basically a huge information dump that is incomplete, unnecessary (for the current story) and overall unusable. But it will make sense 2 years from now in the sequel. My second problem with the movie is that its too short. There must be a good 20-30 minutes of story that were cut out because of length. Because of this some things are not set up as well as they should be. Like, the motivation of the main villain is not explained. There is a hint towards the "why" but thats about it. Also, some lines of dialog were rather flat, like if they were taken right out of the game, so yeah, some better dialog is badly needed. And as a personal taste, some of the costume design of the humans were rather tacky. It just goes to show that some elements needs to be adapted for the big screen as they do not work as well as they did in the game.Overall, this is a decent movie, and if they will nail the sequel, which will come, we will have the first good fantasy franchise since the lord of the rings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good,beautiful,but as a fan,it left me feeling a bit betrayed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all,I have been waiting for this movie for way too long,I am invested in the entire Warcraft universe a lot.That being said,I will mostly point out the things that I disliked,but of course,will mention pros as well.First of,to all those critics that bash acting,it's BS,there is nothing wrong with acting at all,actors were quite good,Travis Fimmel stood out the most to me but then again he is the main character.Another good thing about the movie is the way it looks.The spells (although portal spell was used a bit too often) and orcs and gryphons and cities and camps were great.But now to the bad part.I really want to point out one sort of important fact that was left out of the movie.In the original Warcraft story,the human city Stormwind was..well...SACKED!BURNED TO THE GROUND!In the movie the orcs never reached it.Another thing is Garona is supposed to be devious and she in fact betrayed the Alliance when she murdered king Llane,whereas in the movie he urged her to kill him and even called her a hero.She murdered him in the Stormwind keep (which was beautifully recreated by the way) and his son saw it,and Anduin Lothar (main hero) saved King's son and all the men he could from burning stormwind,hence why later on when the King's son grew up he named his own son Anduin,after Anduin Lothar.Another thing untrue to the source material was Medivh not casting a curse with his dying words on Khadgar and making him old and decripit.Well that,and the fact that Garona was also there helping them kill Medivh AND the fact that Medivh died by being stabbed by Khadgar and then getting decapitated by Lothar in one swing.All in all,the movie on its own feels good but it feels like it takes away from an epic story and replaces it with something much more stereotypical Hollywood-esque material,a mostly happy ending and no brutal loses. Edit:Looking back on it after two days,I can say it's a good movie and as a bit of a lore nerd I can tolerate the changes,and I am definitely going to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't go if you don't know the background of the film. You will miss so much if you do so.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every single critic post starts as: "This World of Warcraft film is like Lord of the Rings but worse. Worst movie of the decade". Stating that it is a WoW movie, and not a Warcraft movie, makes it clear that the critics had no knowledge about it (they also end up saying that those who are not fans will get lost). Well, the movie is not for newcomers. You need to know who is Thrall, which are the specific locations of the world, who is every orc and what is that murloc that appears for half a second to truly appreciate the movie. This isn't made for all the audiences, obviously. It is made for the 12 million users of Wow and all the Warcraft I,II and III fan-base. So, if you like Warcraft, go see it. It has some cringeworthy moments and some mistakes in the plot, but it is very good nevertheless. If you are new to this genre, search for information beforehand, or make a friend tell you what is going on without spoilers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another franchise ruined.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LOTR, Alien, Spiderman, Terminator, Jurassic, Star Wars... Will this century be the death of everything that makes us human? Will technology kill the last brain cells that Apple still hasn't?Something is wrong... When Tales of the Past 3, a machinima circa WotLK, made by one person... Can outperform a marvel of CGI. A hand-made game engine movie... that has more soul than a 160$ mil motion picture. How could Blizzard do it? When I found out that Legendary Pictures is producing it - I was overjoyed. They are to movies like Blizzard... "is" to games - every movie is magnificent, even if it's written by Snyder. But I thought that... with minds like "the" Metzen, with books that were written by bestselling authors, the series that can rival any other major and older franchise... I thought they would do Warcraft justice.Warcraft is their baby. How could they do it? Who in the bloody blue **** is Duncan Jones? How can he say something like "was the stale fantasy trope of, humans are the good guys, monsters are the bad guys"? Now I respect Moon and treat it better than Martian, but Moon was... like a puppy to the elephant, compared to Warcraft. It was a good "indie" movie, but with just two movies on record, how can Blizzard hire someone like him? Is he Shyamalan? Who may be fanatical, but who damn knows how to write a mystery? Is he Jackson? Who at least has directed the best fantasy trilogy in the history of cinema? Is he "the" Nolan?I know it's too cliché to say "Nolan should've directed it". Hell, that's all DC has been saying since DKR. But if anyone is good at directing EPIC grade masterpieces - that's either Nolan or Jackson. Why give the rights to the movie to a person, who first of all did not understand the core concept of Warcraft. Who tried to make it all mopey and kind, when it's... ****ing WARcraft. Not LOTRaft.So without further "ado", let me say that I, being a heartfelt fan, who promised to curse the movie for eternity if they **** up "The Last Guardian"(which... oh boy, they did) - still acknowledge that the movie has its heart in the right place. Like Medivh explained the hourglass - the order of how the pieces fall does not matter - they all are in the bottom of the glass. So does the movie resolve mostly according to Warcraft lore. However, only "mostly". And I feel like the remaining part will yet cause uncalled for protraction that will screw up even more memories. Like - Doomhammer will kill Lothar, but it would not be a champion, who would later go in a long journey of repentance and searching for new purpose. It would be a silly "BvS Martha" level of misunderstanding, because of how Llane assassination went. Hell, how many tears were shed upon the lines "The orc chieftains agree with you". Hell, even Yogg-Saron encounter was better than this movie's "Kill me, save yourself", that completely removes all the guilt, because it was a voluntary death, an order...Bah, okay. It should be obvious by now that the story has been twisted beyond any value. It should be painful to realize that the simple people will imagine that this is Warcraft. It's like thinking that Tolkien wrote the Hobbit trilogy(you get my point). If only the story perversion was enough - that would be fine. However, the acting, the performance is deplorable. Where is the brooding Medivh? Who is this clown that is trying to make a serious face? Where is the grand Lothar? Why is there Ragnar Lothbrok? A troubled comedian viking, whose place is on small screen? Where is the King Llane? The strategist, the hero of his people? Who is this... this... popeyed creep? It's like Emma Stone in TAS. So creepy it's revolting. They've CGIed the orcs, why not draw some Final Fantasy level humans as well? Lines feel empty, scenes feel awkward(and downright insane to a real fan). Khadgar is a laughing stock. I wonder how will they ruin Thrall later... though that won't happen soon.If there is anything, even a slightest hint of value in the movie - it's the visuals. But that's just the Legendary Pictures. As much as I despise CGI in movies, I must say - the movie was a fine trailer. Worse than Warcraft 3 or WoW trailers. But still a good chance to see a realistic Warcraft, something WoW engine can't provide. However, if the orcs might have some nature to them, the dwarfs feel like a caricature of the most clichéd fantasy dwarf. Even Hobbit did a better job. Elves feel like plastic action figures with rubber ears.So... I delayed watching this movie. I tried to relive myself of all hope, I've heard what they say. So I thought I'd watch it with a glad heart... But some things can not be swallowed as a "summer blockbuster". It's not Independence Day 2, which I'd popcorn any time.They might as well have picked Uwe Boll. Can't be any worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I am not a fan of the games so I'm not standing for a bad movie only for childishness just like DC fanboys constantly do.the movie has a screwed up rhythm, it remember us the Star Wars prequels which has several very short scenes alternating between the cores during the film takes place many things get weird just because it is too rushed, the film has two hours could have been bigger and better care, we ended up with some kind of weird cuts and even some scenes that make no sense in that context.Other than that, It's GREAT - Although all the editing and Rhythm problems you get excited all the time, the action scenes and the look of the characters were very good, despite the CGI. All characters are likable &#x200b;&#x200b;and the story is simple and makes sense, as it should. Only the final can be disappointing but only because the film was thought (most likely) as the first part of a series, I do not know if it will happen or not but I'm much more confident in a possible result of that was when the first film was announced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I'm not a fan of world of warcraft the game if I'm honest, I set this movie aside for a good while thinking it would be garbage as there was little hype in the build up to the films release, so I never really got wind if the movie until just recently. After watching the movie I've got to say that from the moment it started it captured my attention with the great cgi and the orcs character, then came the magic which also kept me well impressed and firmly glued to the screen. Mixed in with a little revenge and a shed load of violence I was very excited with the film and even will go as far to say that the ending got me taking to Google with the hope to find sequel confirmation. I was astonished to see the critics review of this film and considering its the biggest selling game movie of all time speaks for itself, A lot of critics complain of the film having no real direction and being messy!, well I couldn't disagree more I was captivated by some of the scenes the film had to offer and would definitely watch this movie a second time. Fingers crossed for a sequel, hopefully the popularity in china is enough to see many more films to come. Well done to the director</fullReview>

This movie can be cheesy at some times, but is also establishes successfully the universe of Warcraft. It sets up a series I look forward in seeing, the story telling is well done, the effects are impressive and immersive, the characters are no caricatures, the plot is rich and unpredictable.Many hate on the amount of information, and I don't understand. In movies what is not revealed to the spectator is source of extrapolation and stimulates the imagination. More is that once other movies come out more exposition will ensue and that would change and enhance the experience of re-watching the previous movies. Be patient I say for this was a call for support and if the movies get better and better I will certainly not complain. We will maybe witness the birth of a new saga I hope for I don't doubt for a second the people who made this movie made it with passion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Done really well, considering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were several constraints that the movie had to work with. There was the already established Warcraft mythos and stories, there was the terrible stigma of game adaptations and finally there was the matter of so many main CGI characters that had to look realistic, not like something Pixar or Disney designed. Given that, I was not expecting much.Yet the movie exceeded all my expectations and gave me hope for the future. The story is something placed at the end of chapter III of the mythos and the beginning of chapter IV. In game, it is the story of Warcraft I, which was another bold move, considering the hordes (heh heh heh) of World of Warcraft players that weren't even born when that game was published. It pits the peaceful kingdom of Azeroth vs the war clans of the unknown Orc, fleeing from their dying world through a portal fueled by the very thing that destroyed it. A half human, half orc girl is instrumental in providing information about who the Orcs are, what they want and how they have reached the kingdom.Characters were well developed, graphics were good, the script had few holes and the mature story was clearly well smoothed out. The only problem one could have is that it's just the first part in many, with the main conflict point resolved, but none for the character story lines.Actors came from all kinds of TV series, Vikings, Preacher and Legends of Tomorrow to name a few. The only predominantly big screen actor out there was Ben Foster. It shows both the direction of cinema and TV blending together (and perhaps with games) and the fear of well established cinema actors getting caught in unsuccessful game adaptations. Perhaps with the success of this and - one may only hope - Assassin's Creed, things will begin to change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite part of the film was 'Legends of Azeroth' playing during the credits. I played WoW for a while and one thing I will say, with the video game and with this adaptation, the composers have done a great job.It is a good movie. Not bad, though not great either.There was too much special effects and CGI for me, like literally 60% of the movie was effects. But that's just a personal opinion.The action was enjoyable, if a bit cartoony. The cinematography, costume design, setting design and weapons and armour was outstanding. The dialogue was lazy and cringe-worthy at times, packed to the brim with sheepish one liners etc. The plot was dull and its obvious this movie is about da action dude. Acting aside, their were no compelling characters. Am I supposed to sympathize for the death of a son who I felt was literally just put there to die and add sorrow into the life of Lothar? Am I suppose to sympathize with Garona because she was given 17 seconds to tell us something poignant about here past? The acting was quite good, but I feel they were held down a bit by the writers/directors/ and the time they had to tell the story. Lothar was portrayed well. Garona was decent but a bit over-acted. As I've said it was a decent movie. It doesn't however deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as Lord of the Rings (I'm not drawing this comparison, but many reviewers are). Guardians of the Galaxy (Hey isn't Medivh basically that?) and Avatar are more in Warcrafts league.</fullReview>

The dwarfs did look like they had been flattened and rushed ( no reason why they can't do dwarfs the same way as LoTR) and elves are more then just glowing eyes. The orks where done very well and I did like the female ork, she was a good strong character and with more room for character development.

I can't comment on the characters' inner drama, or the Orc/Human battle, or anything like that, but I can say that despite the film having zero to say about anything, it was a fun watch and a good way to spend a mindless couple hours seeing things blow up and turn green.

		<fullReview>My three sons and I have all played Warcraft and World of Warcraft since 2003 and had been looking forward to this film. I took my youngest son (19) on Friday night to see the film. In his words: "It wasn't just awesome, it was frigging (spelling changed) awesome!". I had to agree. On Saturday, I took my eldest son (27) to see it again and I loved it just as much the second time around. This film did not disappoint our family of WOW heads. It had everything, action, romance, humour, great CGI, music...the whole thing was great. The haters will always hate but we loved it and cannot wait to own it on DVD. The film is true to the games and we were immersed from the first scene to the credits. I thought all of the actors (most unknown to us) did an excellent job. What critics have to understand is that this film is based on 'Warcraft', not 'World of Warcraft', two distinctly different gaming platforms. The first is a multiplayer strategy game while the second is a role playing game where the player becomes a CGI character inside the game. The first would be much harder to turn into a film than the second.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The two things i did not like about Warcraft was 1st the romance part which was boring and could have been excluded.. and the 2nd is that in some fights the choreography was a bit poor.The fact that the orcs when we first saw them at the beginning of the movie they were overpower against the humans and by the end they were equal if not down-sided was a bit irritating. I wouldn't mind as a horde fan even to make the humans overpowered but when you decide to something keep it that way for the whole movie. On the other hand the visuals were great (for those who are a bit skeptimistic of the quality) and the acting was satisfying.p.s. I'm very happy to finally watch Warcraft after all these years cinematized and can't wait for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, fan of Warcraft or not - This movie is what any video game/ comic book/ story adaption should strive to be. Go watch the movie and vote for this movie - just to break the critics hold on the industry as to what they dictate to be a good movie.There are some unknown faces and the acting (Especially on the human side) is kinda meh..but Durotan's acting as about as good as it gets for any CGI animated character. It is along the lines of the legends, and I am not even exaggerating. The plot is immersive and you are just swept into the story right from the beginning. The story has also been set up to give us a wonderful couple of sequels. Personally, knowing the whole storyline - I can predict at least 5 sequels.Thrall - should be a standalone movie based on the book by the same name One for the night elves story line while bringing up the other races and the clash between the various horde races. The Lich King - THE MOVIE to wait for (this would be way better than what Marvel has planned for with all its characters jumbled up in one movie to fight for Infinity War)Oh well...hope is a wonderful thing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in with very low expectations for this film, and was pleasantly surprised. The special effects are some of the best I've ever seen. The degree to which they brought the game to life was truly amazing to behold. Travis Fimmel (of Vikings fame) particularly stands out for his crazy yet dashing performance. To be honest, I was rather disappointed in the seeming lack of a story line, (and I thought Garona and Lothar's scenes together were quite awkward-no sure what they were thinking there) but I'm hoping they'll fit more plot into the sequel. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of MMORPG's like I am, or even just whoever can appreciate a good old-fashion fantasy flick. Will definitely try to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than I feared, less good than I hoped, and yet somehow almost the same as what I expected...this movie is hardly a sweeping phenomenon, but it was enjoyable. I hesitate to call it "fun", given that it exceeds even your average high-fantasy epic in how seriously it takes itself (there may have literally been only one funny moment in the whole film, and even that one wasn't even played for laughs); it's firmly rooted in the standard knights-and-wizards clichés and has very little originality to it, but in playing to its strengths as a fairly typical example of the genre, it shows great attention to detail. There were a few twists in the plot, and a few little innovative nuggets thrown in to catch the eye; it certainly could have done more to break the mold, but it stands as a reasonably well-made and decently entertaining movie (albeit that it is essentially a prequel, and thus has an ending that may not satisfy those who were hoping for a self-contained story).As a casual player of Warcraft 3, unfamiliar with either its predecessors or the MMORPG spin off sensation, I failed to understand any but the broadest references; this combined with a habit of the human characters mumbling or hissing their dialogue under their breaths in certain tense moments left me feeling that I'd missed out fairly often. None of the characters is all that deep or complex, and the relationships among most of them are somewhat unclear; while the film is refreshingly light on extremely obvious white and black hats (just one or two of the first, and a single clear villain who holds his own quite well), neither does it feature anything close to truly grey morality.I could nitpick the flick's many flaws for a while longer, but I'll keep things as TL:DR as I can manage, and get right to the good stuff. The film is absolutely gorgeous, with breathtaking backgrounds and special effects (not that these are rare in modern filmmaking, but this is still top-notch work), and most impressively the blend between the real actors and their CGI surroundings is virtually seamless; I couldn't even begin to tell where the animation met the motion-capture faces. The soundtrack is by the always amazing Ramin Djawadi, and the horns and drums of the marching orcish horde really get your blood pumping from the very start of the credits, all the way to the end (sadly there's no post-credits scene to really justify the wait, but the music alone might suffice). The movie is definitely pure eye-and-ear candy, with very little nutritional value, and it will almost unquestionably appeal more to die-hard fans of the franchise than to casual fantasy-movie viewers (though I suspect the latter will at least largely enjoy it too).To sum up, I give the movie a B- for characterization and tone, a B+ for story, an A for the score and an A++ for its visual effects, all of which amounts to an A- for the movie as a whole. I could have wished for more, with a sufficient number of magic genie lamps, but if I had an actual studio the size of Legendary and had to run it myself, I doubt very much I could have done this well (perhaps better in some ways, but certainly worse in others). I definitely feel that the makers of this film deserve to turn a healthy profit; whether I will be as eager to see any more entries in this universe as I was for this one, that I am not so sure. But I went in with great expectations did not find the film a disappointment, even if it didn't manage to blow my socks off either. I'd definitely say it's worth the price of a matinée to experience at least once, and I'm fairly likely to go again. (Especially to see the 3D version, which I cannot vouch for at this time.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I'm real fan of Warcraft. Played since 2000. Also i'm real lore hunter on World Of Warcraft. Almost read all Warcraft books. This movie show us very first war of Warcraft history. In my head almost 10 year if movie created by Warcraft it's all like this. Those main land of Azeroth all characters, buildings, civilians all looks like same as novel in my opinion. Movie visuals are great sound is really stunning buildings, clothes, main cities all looks cool. Actors play perfect and those spells looks really sick.If you read this review just go watch this movie. You never regret it. For Azeroth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to Its Lore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straight off, I am a longtime Warcraft fan. I've been playing their games since Warcraft: Humans &amp; Orcs. We'll start out with the cons. First, the movie's 'human' cast is pretty wishy washy. They often speak too quietly, they don't sell their lines, and manage to be kinda boring. Khadgar was decent, and I liked the queen, but beyond that, they were flat. Second, the pacing is choppy. They jump from scene to scene, never dwelling on what's happening. It can be disconcerting, and it doesn't help the story. Third, they tried to fit waaaaay too much into this movie. They essentially tried to tell a majority of Warcraft's early lore in one movie, and it feels like it. They really needed more of that forty minutes they left on the floor to fill it out.Now the pros. First, this movie is gorgeous! Everything about it is absolutely perfect visually and audibly, minus the aforementioned human dialogue. The scenery is excellent, the music is engaging, the magic looks amazing, and I could keep on running on and on about this part of the film forever! Second, you know how movies often skimp on the effects, visually impressive battles, monsters, and all the cool stuff they can do? This movie blows that idea of movie-making out of the water! There isn't a single thing that was left out, from gryphons in battle, to beautiful and impressive magic, to every detail on every orc! It's not just visually impressive, it's full of those moments to the point it pushes the story out just to showcase it! Third, the feeling of the movie. While they don't convey some of their actors as well as they could, they still sell their world! You feel every hit, the sense of doom as towns are burned, the weight of consequence as things happen! It's not perfect, but it's darn near close! Fourth, the lore. There was no way they were going to fit the full scope of the story into this movie, not even the early stuff from Warcraft I, but they tried anyway. Dedicated fans will be able to pick apart the weak details, but overall they did an impressive job of keeping the continuity together. They kept little details in place, made sure to mention the right things at the right times, and made sure moments of great importance weren't overlooked or written out. While this is less important to the casual watcher, for a dedicated fan, this was a gold standard few movies try to hit these days. For that, I salute you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the genre I thought it was a great movie, critics seem to always be looking for the next "Red Balloon," but often times people just want an escape and this movie certainly provides that. The complaints about CGI were a bit overblown as there was no other way to do a movie such as this without CGI and keep it faithful to the canon of Warcraft. This brings in the other thing about this movie, it has is a built in audience from all of Blizzard's Warcraft games and books, if it isn't loyal to canon those people will stay away.The action is strong throughout, the characters hold your attention but do not overpower one another. Additionally, the writers did not make the movie a simple black and white Good vs Evil fantasy piece, there are intricacies to the conflict.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the movie, I'm a hardcore Warcraft player and I forced some friends that have and haven't played the games to watch it with me. The movie is extremely well done in my opinion, and my friends seem to agree with me on that. I think the decisions they cleaned up Warcraft; Orcs and Humans story line, and done some minor (and one major) changes that doesn't affect the games story line too much.These are my points why I loved the movie and enjoyed every second of it:1# Action, action, action.. oh and action! There is so much action in this movie, I love it. I heard people complaining that they aren't fireworks &amp; fancy attacks, but those were from players that played World of Warcraft, and only did Dungeons and not old school questing (cause in questing you see lots of MELEE NPCs fighting a enemy that also uses melee). The fighting scenes were incredible. The sound was so good, whenever an orc hit someone with his hammer, you can literally feel what that guy felt after being hit by that hammer.2# Story line. The story line was good, not amazing though. It's because it's based on the first Warcraft game, which had a very basic and simple story. I liked that they cleaned some of it up, yet some changes I really had to get used to. I think at the end of the day, we all should keep in mind that Warcraft; Orcs and Humans is the weakest game of the Warcraft franchise story/lire wise (Warcraft 2; tides of darkness expended Wacraft's universe).3# CGI &amp; Spell effects. I LOVE the CGI in this movie, it's extremely well crafted. I only saw some orcs with less detail than the other, but it was still very good in my opinion. The spell effects are breathtaking, I've never seen magic spells so well crafted as those.4# The Characters and Actors. The characters and actors are pretty good. I must say that Orcs did better than the humans acting wise, yet they all feel well developed, and you can see/feel the emotions on certain parts of the movie. Some of the characters shouldn't been in there though, because they didn't had enough time to develop. The names are kinda hard to remember if you are new to the Warcraft series or only played WoW. I had no trouble with the names, but most of my friends including the ones that played WoW didn't remember all of the names. Most of the time they just say "that guy that did this or that" if you catch what I mean.I love this movie &amp; I want a sequel right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only minus of this movie, from my point of view, is the "in your face" propaganda of interracial relationships. There is a "romance" line between Orcs and Humans in the movie. I get it. Social issues.But apart from that, its a great fantasy movie.Very nice characters. Characters who have souls and are not boring to watch.All Orcish CGIs are unique and well stylized and drawn. It's a pleasure to look at the Orcish Horde.Also, the scenes are not boring and each scene ADDS a logical piece to the whole story. It's NOT a random CGI hack and slash.Character interaction is very logical and follows the story, explaining step by step what is happening.The acting is very well done. As well as live acting, the CGI facial\body expressions are amazing. To be honest i've never seen such intricate facial\body expressions on a CGI character before. And let me remind you that there are hundreds of unique CGI characters in this movie. Every single one is unique. It's quite impressive.The story itself is straight to the point. There are no slacks or plot holes.Basically this movie tells us about HOW and WHY Orcs arrived to "our world".Its a very nice enjoyable movie. To be honest i didn't expect it to be this good. I thought it would be one of the generic hack and slash none-sense without any coherent plot.But this movie is on par with LoTR. Of course not as complex, but dramatically it's very immersive. Warcraft CGI is way better then CGI in LoTR though. As I said: CGI here is amazing. I'd give an Oscar for CGI in Warcraft.I give it 10\10.. even though there is some social issues propaganda. Orc chicks are kinda hot though, so not really a big problem. The movie is very nice. Watch it.PS I don't play Warcraft and I don't like Blizzard. Just so you know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Video Game Movie I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waited nine years to watch this movie, and it is my great pleasure to say that every year was worth it. As a fan, I loved the depiction of the orcs in this film, as (seeing as I'm a Horde member) they really channeled the muscly green dudes I've been playing alongside for years (given I prefer Blood Elves)! Durotan is an amazing character with much charisma, power, and spirit. And surprisingly, I actually liked Garona! From the trailer alone, I thought she'd be a dud -- a dull, uninteresting character. But boy was I wrong! Khadgar was the most surprising, as I thought the actor would ruin the role, but he was very tolerable. And lastly, I loved Ben Foster's Medivh! My first character was a mage, so it was nice to see a strong caster in this film! Beyond that, the plot was very straightforward, with a nice balance struck between the orcs and humans on both sides of the Horde/Alliance divide. Furthermore, Gul'dan was incredibly evil! He is an amazing villain -- perhaps one of my favorites. And outside of that, it was incredible to see Iron Forge, Stormwind, and to hear the king speaking of "Red Ridge Mountains". The picture itself was amazing, as each scene displayed the magical world of Azeroth at every turn. We see Draenor dying, then a portal, and eventually find ourselves staring at beautiful towers, throne rooms, and mountains through which heroes are flying on their mounts! It's everything, visually, we fans should expect from a Warcraft film! Outside of that, the sounds were amazing (with sharp tool sounds and loud blasts during battle scenes), while the music was very appropriate and complementary to the content, events, and action. We hear soaring, heroic music during heroic moments, tense music during tragic scenes, harps playing during mysterious moments, and loud, thundering music during battles. It was, simply, amazing (just like the game)!Hence, the movie was simply (for these reasons and more) an amazing experience. But that's where the positive ends. It must here be noted that this movie is not very accessible at all to general audience members. Despite what may have been intended, this movie does not at all do a great job at bringing in newcomers to the world of Azeroth. Things are slightly rushed, nothing is explained, there is no background or sufficient exposition -- and this leaves one feeling as though there is no reason to care about certain characters at certain times. By contrast, Peter Jackson did a much better job bringing in the general audience to Middle Earth. In that film, everything was slowly unraveled so that you feel you're beginning the adventure with Frodo, whereas in this film, you are simply thrust into a predicament you don't fully understand (unless you're an informed fan). Thus, in this way it has a very terrible introduction. Too bad Duncan Jones didn't have a better story structure to work with, the way Tolkien provided Jackson all the meat he needed to craft a great film. For these reasons, most general audience members probably won't like or understand this film, and this is the reason most critics have been very harsh in response. Simply put, this movie is not very accessible. And as a result, only true Warcraft fans will actually find themselves capable at all of appreciating this film's many positive elements. And lastly, this film did have some more particular negatives. The pacing is much too fast, as this one movie alone should have been broken into two or three films. Things feel crammed and rushed. Yet unlike other reviewers, I felt the characters were developed well enough (for fans). I didn't particularly find myself feel as though the characters were foreign or difficult to grasp. They were instead very intuitively understandable. Duncan Jones did a great job bringing the characters to life in a very subtle manner. Nothing is thrown at you; you simply have to watch and infer. It's that simple. And I loved that aspect of this film. And additionally, the casting was slightly poor, as some actors don't seem to ideally or optimally suit their roles, while overall (at times) the entire movie felt like a sitcom series of some sort rather than a serious film. And the screenplay dialogue was at times ineffective (with intended slapstick that just wasn't very funny). Yet at the same time, there were many effective moments as well. Mostly though, if you can actually understand and appreciate this film then the positives of this film -- the magic and wonder that is Warcraft -- will drown out and outweigh the negatives. Largely, the pacing and second-rate actors amount to tolerable, minor flaws. And while being second-rate, many of these actors gave exceptional performances! And this goes along with the fact that the directing was very good! (Not great, but not bad.) And so, in the end, this movie turned out to be a minorly flawed work of cinematic art that provides fans with plenty of pleasing Warcraft moments. It won't, therefore, win any Oscars. It won't win any awards. It won't be praised or among the most highly rated movies of all time. But it is good enough to possibly be the greatest video game movie adaption done to date (and in my view, it definitely is)! It is ultimately a "good" movie (for those who understand it). But it is a GREAT **video game movie** (for those who get it). For everyone else, this movie is so entirely directed at those who already understand the lore that it really won't be worth much at all. But regardless, those who care and love Warcraft should rejoice, because the video game movie curse has been broken (whether general audiences ever fully realize this or not)!!! If you are a Warcraft (or fantasy) fan, go see it now!!!</fullReview>

It has been 12 years (almost) since WoW was released and it took the players about 5 seconds to realize "this would make an awesome movie" and this is what you give us?????!!! I was late to the party, mid 2015 and only played for about a year and a half so i'm sure i missed a lot of name and history references, but for f**k sake where are the gaming references??? This piece of steaming garbage plays like a daytime-B-fantasy-TV-show. Where are the classes? Where are the races? Where's the third person view? where are the awesome pieces of armor (plastic is not a thing in the game) and cloth? Where are the muscles and where are the females?? You might say "oh, but this is only a build-up for the sequels" but sequels are f*****g EARNED!!! This pile of excrement (not for lack of good talent) would have been embarrassing if released in 2003. With all the amazing concept art and cinematic blizzard and fans have produced over the last 2 decades, there are no excuses for making a single frame of this film seem mundane. It took me 1 minute to think "what the hell..?" and that feeling only grew stronger for each minute. This could (AND SHOULD) have been a milestone for fantasy and game adaptation that would blow the LOTR-films in to the last century, but no. What we got was a cold slap in the groin and some dude probably making a lot of money of the name, adding Transformers hahaha-moments that made me want to gauge my eyes out with a dagger. Any kind of dagger. A whole bunch of people should be ashamed of themselves. Very ashamed. Positive? Some of the orcs where OK, CGI speaking. Sheep scene was amazing. Negative? This being released for everyone to see. FFS... (note: i know Warcraft has been around longer than WoW, but come on, WoW what we build most of our expectations on)</fullReview>

When talking about game based movies they should play the game, talk with gamers and try to see what was so appealing about the game.For example the Orcs Necromancers could summon undead, they also had Ogres in the Horde and not a single view of ballistas nor catapults, and specially of Beserkers if want just straight forward Orc infantry.I mean I think you can impress 5,6 years old with this but or people that likes Batman vs Superman crap but I really cannot believe a single fan of Warcraft liked it.Go back to direction school 2016 directors, shame on you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really would rate this -1000 if i could. If you in any way know anything about Warcraft novels, games, and the world of Warcraft in general, than set yourself up for the most disappointing movie portraying anything you already know about its' title. It's unbelievably disappointing to trust such a movie title to an amateur director who has directed four movies in his entire "career"; someone who probably tried so hard yet failed so miserably. I think this has been the biggest mistake Blizzard has ever done and will ever do. I don't even think this director ever watched a Blizzard Cinematic in his life. Probably he has done so after this major nonsense, missing every detail possible, and i'm not even talking about production. This really feels like some parody movie, which focuses solely on sentimental aspect of Warcraft, and there can't be any sentimental stuff in a movie called WAR-CRAFT. I CAN'T f believe i saw a KISS. Are you kidding me???????????? I can write two days constantly without even stopping a single minute, and tell you how much this, i cannot even call it a movie anymore, su---. I cannot even compare it to any other failures in the movie industry that i know of. This is definitely the worst i've seen on screen. Can't get any worse than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not like that part of the movie but there is somewhat to like. Problem is the pacing and the whole seems very uneven. In the beginning I had some problems with the CGI but that got better as the movie moved along.It was sometimes confusing on which the story was focusing and in a point of the movie I even thought the orc wife was killed but I guess that was another female orc.I'm not familiar with the game but it feels they scaled all the races down to just orcs and humans. You could have had some more references to that instead of another useless battlefield. Especially towards the end they just kept dragging on and lost a lot of it's meaning. The ending took a lot of points away from my rating because it tries to force you into a franchise while the appetizer they gave you was at best mediocre.The few people I liked in this movie get knocked off so I really don't see why I should still invest in this franchise. Strangely I still want this movie to do good so along the line better adaptations will be made of gaming properties.The actors were O.K. but I think the directors or the studio failed on this one, so I hope they learned a lesson from this.The world building was very well done,but also not fully explored. It needs a better flowing story and an ending that doesn't feel like a cheat.So...I did not like it but I still recommend you go see it.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never played a World of Warcraft game in my life. So I went into this film knowing almost nothing about it other than it is a fantasy film which is a spawn of Lord of the Rings, like most fantasy whatevers out there. The movie is about a bunch of hulk like creatures invading a realm of human or humanoid creatures. The plot is okay and the action is good but sh!t does this movie drag out like heck. Especially the first two thirds of the film, it drags out like a mother and it is boring as anything. But the last third of the film does save it, just a little. If the ending didn't turn out like I did, I would have scored the film a 4 out of 10. Is it worth paying money to see this? No. Is it worth checking out on TV? Yes, mainly because you can pause the movie during the boring parts and come back to it later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least video game movies are going somewhere now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is no secret to anybody, video game movies are rarely good. Mostly because the source material is ignored by the producer or simply because the point of a video game is the gameplay, story can still be a big thing in video game, but transferring it into a actual movie you now see how that story isn't really that good actually.I am an avid video game player and also a movie buff and throughout the many years of countless video games I touched, I played trough the Warcraft games. At a young age, the first one so I don't remember everything about it but I played some good hours of Warcraft 2 and 3 and also, World of Warcraft. Not the biggest fan of the franchise, but I still love it and seeing that the were a movie going to be made actually by the studio of those games, Blizzard, it was actually a really good news for me. Finally somebody that knows it's video games will make a movie about them and Warcraft has a lot of story to tell and to turn it into a cinematic experience might actually be really good!Unfortunately, after many years of waiting and being skeptical after that first trailer, I left the theater not so impress. I will say first that most of the CGI effects are really good, the orcs were believable and so are most of the landscapes and decors. Where to movie falls flat is actually because of the actors and the dialogues. I found the orcs being better actors, you know there's a problem when virtual actor are more believable.The story is quite simple, the place where the Orcs are living is no good anymore and they need to find a new place to live. They found a portal to transport them to another world, where the humans and all other races are living. No need to say after that there is war going on to try to overtake that land and the humans to defend it. The are some little plot twist, but I am not here to spoil anything.The first act of the movie is actually quite good, though the pacing is not perfect because things feel rushed, but you are into the universe and orcs are not one dimensional monsters, but have actually good development. The are also a lot of odes to the video game franchise, the fans will love it while the ones that doesn't know about the it just won't notice, so no harms done here.Where the movie is starting to struggle is after about the first hour, where things starts to slow down and you see humans more than orcs and it just feels like it's dragging on and the acting was terrible and most of the lines were not good to the point that I even some times cringed my teeth and at some point, died of laughter because of how terrible some of the deliveries are. The worst offender is the king, he was not believable and I couldn't stand him when he was on screen. That mage that looked like a kid also was really annoying. The only one that was okay was the main actor, but even then he was border line.In the end, Warcraft gives us some good actions scenes that are really well made and you wish you could see the orcs more often because they really were the stars of the movie. I am being harsh on the critique here, but I really couldn't stand the second half of the movie and the ending, it really broke it for me and it is just not a really good movie, if there was no Warcraft name after it it would get more destroyed than it is actually because in the end it is just a generic fantasy movie and to be quite frank, we are saturated by those movies and they are rarely really good.Fans of the franchise will defend the movie and love it probably, that movie was made for them, the rest of the crowds will see an enjoyable flicks with nothing special to it, it is entertaining and worth a watch, but wait for a rent, it is not worth the whole Imax experience or 3D.As for it's standing in video game movies, it is a good step, a really good one. Finally a video game that respect it's source material and attempt to do something with it and if a second one is made and they correct the problems of this one, we might have a good future movie franchise here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again I am left stunned at how disconnected these 'professional critics' seem to be. It seems they just like to torpedo films, but scores like 29% putting things like Warcraft and Batman vs Superman below well-known howlers are just bonkers.I played World of Warcraft and so did my 16 year old daughter, whereas my partner never has. We all really liked it.The cinema clearly did too, with cheering at certain points and a really positive vibe.The film pays SO much subtle tribute to the game and its players, yet is accessible to everyone.I am so glad China has made this film a success because it deserves to be. The world of Azeroth and the quirky games set in it deserve it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The elf-dwarf love affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First feeling after watching the movie: Have you seen the Hobbit trilogy?Remember the love affair between the dwarf and the elf?It felt a bit forced and without much background storyline,so every scene with those two you were like "next scene please".Well that's the plot of the warcraft movie..Storyline/pace:4/10 Don't get me wrong,the story itself is pretty interesting but the way they showed it was like someone chasing them with a stick in order to reduce the run-time(which kinda happened).Warcraft has an enormous history and i get that it would be amazingly difficult to explain all the details,but unfortunately the movie fails to deliver even some of the basic stuff.Graphics/cgi:8/10 This is the redemption of warcraft.If you exclude some scenes where the background is blurry,you can easily compare the graphic quality to Avatar's.Actually sometimes it goes beyond that..There are nearly no dark scenes,the details of the cities and costumes were spot on and the orcs were exactly as they should have been.Epic feeling/battle scenes:7/10 There is a lot of action in this film.The choreography is fine,the battle scenes are good and the spells are amazing.Best portrayal of magic i have ever seen in a film.The thing is..For a movie called WARcraft, the war scenes should have been GLORIOUS!Good is a fine word,but not for a movie that we have been waiting for a decadeAll in all/Fun factor:This is an entertaining pop-corn movie.You will not get get bored and there are 2-3 scenes that are excellent.No less but no more..If you are a fan of warcraft you will probably have a blast.If not,drink your soda,enjoy the beautiful cgi and try to go along with the plot</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of a game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Warcraft (alternatively known as Warcraft: The Beginning) is a 2016 American fantasy film directed by Duncan Jones and written by Jones, Charles Leavitt and Chris Metzen. It is based on the Warcraft video game series and novels set in the world of Azeroth. The film stars Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Toby Kebbell, Ben Schnetzer, Robert Kazinsky and Daniel Wu. The film portrays the initial encounters between the humans and the orcs and takes place in a variety of locations established in the video game series. The film was first announced in 2006 as a project partnership between Legendary Pictures and the game's developer, Blizzard Entertainment.-Warcraft will premiere in Los Angeles on June 6, 2016 and is set to be released by Universal Pictures in the United States on June 10, 2016. It has received negative reviews from critics and has grossed over $70 million.--Filming: -Principal photography began on January 13, 2014 and lasted for four months, finishing on May 23, 2014. Filming took place primarily in Vancouver among other locations. Post-production lasted twenty months. Regarding the use of computer-generated imagery, Jones said, "It's a tool like any other. It can be done well and it can be done bad. The best CGI has you forgetting (that) it's CGI, and accepting the visual as whatever it is supposed to be?like props. No one has an issue with props in film, do they?"--Production: -Development: -Duncan Jones also faced personal struggles during filming as his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer soon after Jones took over, furthermore his father, David Bowie, also died from cancer late in production. Jones thus summed up the challenge by telling The New York Times. "My film started and ended with cancer".--Critical response: -Warcraft has received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 19%, based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 31 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews." -Dave Robinson of Crash Landed meanwhile praised the films depiction of the Orc race and the motion capture performances portrayed by the actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprised to see such low score given by critics. I wanna sayIt's a damn good one!I really enjoyed it. It is easily understood even without game experience. But if you are a WOW player, you'll certainly gain even more fun. I spent some time viewing explanations about the movie after watching, and came to understand a lot of details I missed when watching. This is also fun!I think it worth 10 out of 10. If I have to find out some claws, I'm a little bit confused by orcs' relationship. Some adaptions are made in this part.Can't wait to see the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Purely for fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For over a decade I have waited for something like this movie. Blizzard has been teasing us gamers with great games and short animations to display a great lore and story. This movie now brings forth a more lengthy viewing of Warcraft's great lore! Too bad they decided to put humans in it instead of just GDI.The story of course took many shortcuts compared to the lore. I would've liked to see this split into multiple movies, much like LOTR, to actually show the background of how Medivh became corrupted (Sargeras) instead of just 'He wanted power!' Lothar would've been a more lovable character if his family and story would've been brought out more, the elves, dwarfes etc. given more screen time. It's a shame the movie was so short packed with so much. I felt nothing for Anduin Lothar when his son gets killed by Blackhand. His story was not built up at all. The thoughts about that I had: 'Oh he had a son, now he doesn't. /care'. They showed us Ironforge, Stormwind, Dalaran, Goldshire, Kharazan so fast! I would've loved to see way more of Dalaran and it's mages, Kharazan with it's secrets, Ironforge with it's depths..I'm a true fan of Warcraft, been playing the games since I was a little boy. This movie was supposed to be great and I loved parts of it, especially the orcs. The GDI of course is clearly visible in some scenes (mostly background and Gul'dan) which lowered my enthusiasm during the movie. Too bad the main characters both male and female just sucked so bad. But I loved Gul'Dan character. So awesome! Pure evil! The orcs were fantastic. Human characters, not so much. Riddled with bad actors their expressions, speech, everything dulled the pure feeling of awesomeness I had for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular adaptation of the Warcraft beginning story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the game World of Warcraft, I fully expected to love the film. I also feverishly hoped that it would live up to my expectations, that it would break the curse of crappy video game movies, and that it would have many, many sequels.I was not disappointed at all! Granted, it is a fantasy film, and as such it has some of the typical fantasy tropes. Good guys fight bad guys, bad guys do bad things, and good guys try and get bad things corrected by the end.That has been the formula for fantasy story telling since before Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings. The movie follows some of these familiar story lines, but goes much deeper than most into the characterizations of both sides.Unlike Tolkien, Wacraft has over 20 years of story-telling behind it. The movie only introduces the world of Azeroth, and sets up the start of what could be many movies to delve into the rich lore and history of the Warcraft world.The movie did a great job introducing the Orcs and showing the conflict between the Humans and Orcs. It also introduced the land of Azeroth as a beautiful, green, lush paradise that was ripe for the taking by the Horde.Like I said, the CGI was spectacular. The Orcs looked totally real, and I forgot they were even CGI creatures after the first few minutes.The settings were amazingly rich and diverse, from the flyovers of Stormwind to the vistas of Dalaran. A lot of attention was paid to getting it right.Although it is thoroughly enjoyable if you have never played the game, you will be pleasantly surprised to see the fan service in the film. From the brief appearance of Murlocs to the discussion of the Polymorph spell, things are inserted all through the film to show how much care Duncan Jones put into his movie. He really shot from the heart.Go see the movie. It is amazing, and deserves your patronage. Hopefully, if it does well enough, it will be a series of 4-5 films that can fully flesh out the world of Azeroth.</fullReview>

Hell if they made a second one I would go and watch it. The movie was entertaining. IMDb is making me write ten lines. Overall it was a 7 out of 10 rating movie. I really liked Duraten character, His wife, and the human fighter and magicians. Are they making or will they be making a sequel to Warcraft because I don't know man common this is stupid. Why do you need to write ten lines or one thousand words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of Warcraft since the very first game and I must say I really had fun watching this movie. Is it perfect? Not at all! Not even close. But from the beginning I had the clear feeling that "perfection" was NOT the main goal. The main goal was to introduce events leading to a huge lore that has potential for a pretty good franchise and Duncan Jones nailed it. The story overall was not very detailed, but I can see why... if they wanted to go into details from the beginning, the movie would have been 4 hours long, instead of 2 hours. Several characters were there simply to get things going. For example King Liam was there simply to introduce Anduin Lothar, who has a much bigger role in the events of the first two "great wars" against the Horde. Dwarfs and High Elves are just touched (and the elves really looked cartoonish, but it didn't really bother me that much), and really they didn't even need to be there, except to show the different races of Azeroth. Purists probably would mind, but the majority of movie goers simply wanted to have a bit of context and "that's it"! CGI for the orcs was absolutely fantastic and the armours of the Human soldiers was "spot on"! Lots of reviewers are saying that this movie was ONLY for people with Knowledge of the games and the Warcraft lore.... couldn't be more wrong. Went to see it with my wife and she loved it.. Yes there were bits here and there she didn't get, but she understood everything and she actually really liked it. Nothing a little explanation after didn't clarify. The locations were amazing and superbly detailed (loved the Griffon landing platform in Stormwind). Overall a good start, room for improvement of course, but really a good start. Editing was fine... not sure why some people are complaining about it.... "Games of Thrones" is waaaaaaaay worst than that and nobody is saying anything about it.... Another point, I thought that putting this movie as a G, was a mistake, but actually it worked (strangely enough). Plenty of violence and some pretty graphic scenes, but they were able to keep it to a level that would please to a wide public, instead of targeting just a small demographic.Job well done.. and don't listen to some "professional" critics... 3/4 of them never even touched the games, so they are maybe a little alienated! Just my opinion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, i have never played WoW and i did expect this to be a big CGI train-wreck, or a weak storied video game movie. But it's safe to say, i'm really, really excited to see a continuation to this film. The characters are very well thought out in terms of emotional drives and the female characters are just amazingly well thought out. The movie does ,however, try to stuff too much story into 2 hours of screen time, and you might leave the theater still thinking the why to many scenes. Which could be good or bad depending on who you ask. But above it all a great eye-candy film with good characters and storyline. Strongly recommend it to fantasy lovers or anyone who wants a good challenging movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel compelled to write this review after just watching it because this is the first great Movie I have seen in years that is worth writing a review for I'll be watching it again but in 3D because I admit it's a fast moving plot and you'll need a Second screening to absorb all the details. But my goodness it blows away all the repetitive superhero movies the has Become the norm and which quite frankly all suck. Ignore all the negative reviews - they are written by ill informed people who are Quick to judge it as simply a Cgi orgy fest based on a video game and overlook The character development and story which would make sense only if your familiar With the Warcraft universe. But even if your not you will find the cgi is absolutely Incredible and real compared to many other movies (transformers, marvel and others) They only spent 4 months shooting live acting but spent nearly 2 years just on Post production to produce the best cgi I've ever seen in a movie. That alone is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I went to see this move I was the unlucky or lucky? person that was not in Uk where the movie was already in the cinemas Ages before the rest of the world could see it. So I really did get to see a load of not really pleasant Reviews all claiming the movie to be a sad Addition to the game based movie failure list. Really? This only made me more curious because from what I could tell from the Trailers this looked to be epic. And it was! Idefinitelly enjoyed watching the movie and from the start until end I was blown away many times by the Warcraft universe and it's beauties and wonders. I have no idea based on what did most of the Reviews see this movies as a failure in fact for me this Comes definitely as one of the best movies of 2016. For every Warcraft fan this movie is a well deserved reward. Something that moves the game outside the Gamers Corner to the "public" which I think is not ready for the Amazing universe Warcraft has in it's pocket ready to blow your mind. The only Thing I see as a negative is the length of the movie which is !only" 2 hours. I could have watched it for at least 3-4 :)) I hope this movie get's a Sequel because i don't want to watch the same movie all over again and again and again ..:)) this SHT has potential! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculously misrepresented by the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never played World of Warcraft, but I am a major fan of Warcraft III. However, I went into this film with no expectations simply because of how badly it was getting bashed by the critics. Like, have you read some of those reviews? Geez, do critics hate this film. When the credits rolled my friend (who has never played Warcraft and knew nothing about the lore) and I turned to each other with wonder and asked "Did we see the same film as them??"The beginning scene was jaw-dropping, especially for a Warcraft fan, and from the beginning the film was amazingly immersive. The first shot of the main orc blew me away - you could really see emotion in his eyes. The critics should be ashamed of themselves for claiming the acting in this movie is poor. Somehow the huge cast managed to make me totally believe in the high fantasy storyline and it felt like there was actually something at stake. My friend, who had never heard of the characters before, actually teared up twice. The one problem with this movie is there's a LOT of name-dropping, which is fine if you've played WOW before, but it took a while for my friend to differentiate between a few people. Medivh and Khadgar were amazing. The mages and magic in this film are just so well done.Anyway, if you like fantasy or action films, I highly recommend watching this, even if you don't know the lore. Go in with an open mind and it will definitely exceed your expectations. The visuals and acting are brilliant, and it manages to stay true to the aesthetic of the game without looking tacky or garish. The only design I did not like was the look of the elves, and I hope they refine them a little in the sequel (if there is one, and I really hope there is!) Best fantasy film so far this year... don't let the critics change your mind! They are ridiculously wrong. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I found the story to be a little muddy in the beginning - it assumed a little bit of knowledge that I didn't have, even as a World of Warcraft player - but once it got past the first bit and on its feet, it was great. The story was compelling, the characters were interesting, and you really get into their lives and stories. The visuals, and especially the music, were excellent. And the fight scenes! I'm not usually one for a ton of action sequences - and for those who are also in this camp, I would not say there are an excessive amount of them, and they're not overly long - but they're very well-done. The orcs were really intimidating. For the most part, the battles were pretty realistic, which was appropriately jarring... but sometimes they verged into over-the-top moves that were pretty entertaining.Lastly, for fellow game-players, I have to say that it was cool to see little scenes and bits in the movie that remind you of playing the game. For example, there was this one shot of Stormwind that shows the entrance to the flight path for the gryphons, and someone flying into it :P It was kinda cool to see little things like that and be like, "Hey, I know that place!" That said, I did see it with a family member who never played the game, and he really enjoyed it as well. Familiarity with World of Warcraft is not a prerequisite to enjoying this one. I'd definitely recommend it, and hope they make a sequel :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of Orcs and Men, and generic fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging from the on-again, off-again subtitle The Beginning, it's clear Universal Studios hopes for this first entry into the Warcraft film franchise not to be the last. A ton of money has been thrown at the screen on a project that has been in development for nigh a decade to entice both fans and ignorant audiences alike, but the best intentions regardless, it's unlikely the film will sit well with the latter demographic, while it remains to be seen whether it'll be to the liking of the former. After all, the gamers are simple spectators on a quest played by Duncan Jones and his team, rather than their own. General viewers meanwhile get treated to a grand and supposedly rich fantasy universe for which they have a tough time developing a feeling, considering Warcraft only forms the tip of the proverbial iceberg.The World of Warcraft is vast and extensive, yet a film franchise has to start somewhere explaining it all. The Beginning addresses the origin of the wars between Orcs and Men, so it is said in the opening narration. Which also proves a major spoiler to the movie's own plot, considering the outcome of it all has already been determined. While much of the movie follows a minority of Orcs attempting to establish a truce with the world of Men they just invaded, with that opening statement in mind, there's few narrative surprises in store for us. Which doesn't mean we don't feel for this peaceful, noble Orc warriors, who find themselves a pawn of a sinister force's greater schemes to suck this world dry of life like it did their own home before. Brought to life by the latest motion capture innovations, the movie follows the new path of creating convincing digital characters based on intense acting performances, in the same style as the recent Planet of the Apes movie. It works, as these are some of the finest Orcs we've seen on the big screen thus far.Alas, the same cannot be said for their human counterparts. The noble knights and conniving warlocks of Azeroth aren't nearly as interesting to behold as their fresh enemies, a victim of both dull generic fantasy writing and uninspired performances. Though there's definitely a pool of talent assembled here, none of these actors truly seemed to have affinity with the exotic subject matter. All the silly spells and swashbuckling sword moves can't change that, and there's plenty of both to go around. In fact, Warcraft fanatics will recognize plenty of everything from their beloved games much to their enjoyment and to the detriment of ours, the casual viewers not acquainted with this realm. Especially in the first thirty minutes of the movie, the plot travels from one outlandish location to the next without allowing us much room to absorb it all, get to know its rules or develop a sense of geography for the whole. While names like Ironforge and Stormwind are no doubt iconic nomenclature to the fans, they never rise above the feeling of generic fantasy to inexperienced ears. Same can be said for the other inhabitants of Azeroth: Dwarfs, Elves and the like are briefly seen here and there but otherwise play no part.Undoubtedly there's more to the World of Warcraft than what's shown here, but for the general audience, what realms are served never really click. it all looks fabulous but none of it makes us truly care on the same level as the Lord of the Rings movies did. Whether the fans will absorb this take on their beloved franchise as much as they did their interactive equivalent remains to be seen, but the studio better hope they do. Other audiences at best get a decent two hours of generic fantasy entertainment out of it, but nobody will be converted to the Warcraft cause. Which, considering the cost of this hugely expensive movie, might easily suggest The Beginning will also prove the end for the Warcraft film franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warcraft is a fantasy epic based on Blizzard's video game franchise directed by Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code) and starring Travis Fimmel, Dominic Cooper, Toby Kebbell, Paula Patton and Ben Foster.Warcraft is set in the fantastical world of Azeroth and follows the race of orcs as they start to seek a new world in which to settle in, considering theirs is dying. The orcs are led by Gul'Dan (Daniel Wu) who uses dark sorcery called The Fel, a sorcery which requires sacrifices, thus keeping the portal to the new world open. One of the orc chieftains, Durotan (Kebbell) does not agree with Gul'Dan's methods and he starts to doubt his intentions. The world the orcs flee to is called Azeroth, the house for races like humans, dwarfs and elves. Thus, a conflict begins the two factions.First of all, let me start by saying that this movies was savaged by critics. It currently holds a 22% rotten score on Rotten Tomatoes and some reviewers have even said this movie is as bad as Battlefield Earth. This is truly not the case. This movie is far from perfect and indeed it has some flaws, but to go as far as calling it a new Battlefield Earth is simply ludicrous. This movie is very good for what it's supposed to be: a fantasy epic with exciting battles, unique characters and a rich mythology.Fans of the video game franchise will surely love this movie and will notice all the little easter eggs and references thrown throughout the movie. I myself am not a huge follower of the game series and I still enjoyed this movie. By far the weakest link of this movie are the characters, especially the human ones. Travis Fimmel plays Anduin Lothar, commander of the human army who is supposed to come off as witty and charming but unfortunately is just annoying most of the time. Dominic Cooper plays King Llane, a good king who cares about his people and wants to protect them from the coming invasion. Cooper is a great actor but he's not a good fit for this character. His looks are too boyish and make him seem like he lacks experience, thus not having enough gravitas. In fact, this is a problem for most of the human characters, as Ben Foster and Ben Schnetzer both play mages, but they don't fit at all in their roles.One of the best characters in this movie comes from the orc horde, and that's Durotan played by Toby Kebbell. Kebbell does a great job in bringing to life a character that cares deeply for his family and people, a just and noble ruler. He is also the wisest from the Horde, as he realizes an alliance with the humans must be made in order to save his world. Kebbell plays Durotan using motion capture, his second role of this nature (he also did a fantastic job in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). All the orcs in the movie are portrayed by this technology, and, for the most part, they look great. CGI is a must requirement in this kind of movie, and even if it falls flat in some of the scenes, the look of the orcs is very well achievedHaving said all that, Warcraft is a movie that's beautifully directed by Duncan Jones, with some great visuals for the most part, with beautiful looking landscapes and battles. Unfortunately, it falls short in the story and character depth departments, but the way I see it, I knew what I was getting in to. I was not expecting a Citizen Kane, I wanted to see crazy giant battles between orcs, humans and other beasts and I got all that. Warcraft is one of the best video game adaptations out there (not saying much) and I give it a 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft: The "Rushed" Beginning. Not bad at all. But not great either and here is why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No amounts of down-votes is gonna change the fact that this movie has cut a lot of corners. We all know and we all know / understand why. It could have been better. Though considering the fact that it is a large story I would have preferred maybe 1 or 2 films before this one here. Explaining more rather than rushing it because when you rush...this is what you get. All the meatiness of Warcraft is primarily in its past. The stuff we read and didn't so much play in World of Warcraft. More so the older games. I can understand Blizzard wanting to use this approach but in a way I think its lazy of them. Especially of Duncan Jones to even go aboard this kind of writing. Let me make this simple.Pros: LOTS of potential and I wanna see more. The characters were in part interesting and certain moments are really intense and noteworthy. The CGI was good. It portrayed the Orcs and their culture such as honor in a good way. Though they appeared stupidly squishy. orcs are strong yet the alliance cuts them down like crazy. (Yes, I play horde.) Overall it was okay. But... here comes the but. The Mediocre / bad: Almost EVERYTHING else in the movie. It felt so rushed.(rushed being the only bad thing to me) Some combat felt very... poorly executed. Something is off with the choreography. It felt very rehearsed and sorta lackluster = Too quick, without punch). Its nothing like the action scenes we got from LOTR or the Hobbit or fantasy flicks of that sort where orcs and Humans would clash in these epic ways. Something that holds it back considering the bloody movie is called "Warcraft" but yes. I truly hope we get a like... 3 or 4 hour extended directors cut or something because the theatrical version, though full of potential... doesn't offer all that much significant context. There are moments in the start where I can see that patient storytelling aspect and I love that. But by the end of the movie it gets so annoyingly rushed. And the moment you discover a MAJOR lore feature has been COMPLETELY reworked into arguably oblivion... that doesn't sit well with me. That is however not the reason for my score. I knew lore has been reworked that before watching it and I can to some extent understand that. Hollywood...The reason for a 6 is because of how many elements this film literally races through. And that is again because of it being the theatrical release. I need more content. I need more story. More build up. More character development. More of those memorable moments that make the film nice to see rather than a CGI fest with orcs roaring. Certainly that has its place but Warcraft is about a LOT more than just that. And this film / This Theatrical release... doesn't manage to capture enough of that. Of what it does capture I absolutely love. Especially Draka and Durotans relationship as well as Durotans sacrifice. And the way the reworked Garona and Llane I am actually not entirely against because they made sure to keep a vital aspect that is "The bond they shared" And though we lost a TON of lore which does anger me, I can get over it Score wont be judged by that. I will however hope the next film offers less changes of rather massive lore elements but we shall see. As it stands the film is okay. Good. but NOT great. Maybe the extended directors cut etc version will be if we get like 1 whole hour or more of stuff to put things into better context. The same thing happened to Event Horizon long ago. All the good stuff was removed from the film due to an age rating problem. Destroyed the film at release but since the director released the complete film the score got much more deserving results. And I hope it will be the same for Warcraft. Its too bad so many fanboys are defending this to their dying breaths because it prevents true words to be spoken when we all know whats up and we all want some things to be better. Its not a 10 out of 10 and I can prove that by asking anyone rating this a 9 or a 10 to compare their viewing experience (NOT ITS FUTURE POTENTIAL) to other films they've seen and rated the same score. All I have to think of it Batman or LOTR or movies like that. Movies I've watched countless times and lots more. This film reminds me of Dracula Untold. Again lots of potential but made in such a way that the story becomes terribly rushed followed by sequel bait. Bottomline: Theatrical version = 6 out of 10. A good film. Above average. I wanna see more. Both in the future but also in an extended version for this. I wanna see the directors cut...NOW. Because if we get an hour more or longer like in other very large films. Like LOTR or such I like to believe I possibly could rate this a 7 or maybe even an 8. A GREAT film. Arguably even an AMAZING film. That is assuming the content for the context is even there. Time shall tell. Thats my opinion, fellas. Upvote or down-vote. I don't really care. By the end of the day the film is what it is and no score or amount of angry fanboys both rating it 11 out of 10 or 1 out of 10 (Of which is unfair and it being neither) is gonna change that.(Crossing fingers for Directors cut)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly surprised!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday, by chance, I saw the new Warcraft movie in the local theater. I have never played any of the Warcraft games (nor any other Blizzard game for that matter), so I wasn't particularly planning on seeing this one on the big screen. Knowing how live-action adaptions of video games (or any other animated media) have a tendency to turn out complete failures, I went in without any expectations. I was however pleasantly surprised! Sadly this movie is getting panned on a lot of platforms, which is a pity since I found this movie to be much better than expected. So I decided it was only right to give this film a positive review from a non-fan.Fans of the games obviously love this film but it has enough to offer even for people like me who are completely new to the Warcraft universe. Of course if you're expecting to see the next Lord Of The Rings or Game Of Thrones, you'll leave the theater a disappointed viewer, but the charm of this movie is that it doesn't aspire to be the next groundbreaking fantasy epic. It doesn't try to hide it's video game origins either, rather it stays true to it's roots, which works very much to its advantage. Storywise some expected fantasy clichés are present, but at the same time it takes enough unexpected turns to maintain the balance and keep the viewers interested. The characters as well, though having their roots in fantasy stereotypes, have enough complexity to keep them from being caricatures and places them somewhere on the axis in between good and evil rather than at one end or the other. I particularly enjoyed having sympathetic characters on both sides of the fence.Visually the movie is stunning as well. Blizzard, being notorious for it's high quality cinematics, and Industrial Light &amp; Magic, known for breaking new grounds in VFX, let their expertise shine through abundantly. Although I was initially skeptic of the live-action approach, preferring the movie would have been made completely animated (like their famous cinematics), they pulled off the blend of real actors and mo-cap creatures surprisingly well and all actors involved gave decent performances. The design of the characters and the environments as well is one of the best things about this film, no doubt the merit of Blizzard's renowned team of concept artists.I've heard complaints about the pacing and editing of the film, but despite the 2 hour run time I didn't feel any problems in this area myself. I am of course not familiar with the lore surrounding Warcraft, so I can't really tell which parts of the greater story were cut or rushed and which ones were dragged. In this regard it might even be an advantage to watch this movie as a newcomer to the series. The ending ties up the story arc pretty well, but leaves enough out in the open for a possible sequel (which I very much hope to see).If you're not a fan of the games, Warcraft won't blow you off your feet, but it's a very good film nevertheless that does what it set out to do with great style!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warcraft, at the beginning it seems to be very complex and that if you are not a fan of the video games you'll not understand, but the rhythm of the film ( that first it is slow but then a lot of things happen) explains you very well the context of this universe.Maybe one of the mistakes of this film is that there is a lot of CGI used on the film, but you get used to it and it's a really good quality CGI. It's not perfect, especially in one part of the film in one of the end fights ( you'll know which one when you see the film, it's something about a thing that starts with the letter G).The real mistakes , are that this movie is rated PG-13 and in my opinion this type of film needed an R rating to make the universe more mature and to make The Warcraft Cinematic Universe original and more serious ( this is one of the good things of the film the movie is not the type of movie where the good people always wins). Other mistakes are the unnecessary epic moments (when you see the film, you'll understand).Warcraft is epic and entertaining , you will not get bored on the most part of the film, Duncan Jones made a great job in this movie, we need sequels of this great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The War is Just Beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flushed with astounding CGI and epic scale fights, Warcraft is the next big blockbuster of 2016 that will wow viewers with its flare. Unfortunately, its messy plot and questionable character choices drown what could have been the next great Fantasy flick.Initially the largely CGI/green screen world building had me hesitant after seeing 2014's Hobbit installment, but that's not at all the problem here. The motion capture of the orcs and colorful landscapes that director Duncan Jones displays may very well be the best thing about Warcraft. The story centers around the orcs arrival in a human world and the inability for the two to coexist. Surprisingly, I found myself more emotionally connected to the orcs, and in particular, Durotan.Toby Kebbell isn't new to mo-cap. He burst onto the scene in 2014 as Koba in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and his performance in Warcraft proved to be just as impressive. Durotan is one of the few orcs who saw the need for the humans and orcs to work together against the all too powerful, Gul'dan. His arc didn't necessarily go the route I had hoped, but it was the part of the film I felt most invested with.On the other side of things, the humans, led by King Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) were far less interesting. Not only is not enough time taken to explore the depths of each of the main humans, but the story is taken in a frustratingly predictable route. In order for me to feel the weight of an emotional scene, there has to be enough character depth set up, Warcraft fails to do that on numerous occasions.What Warcraft does have going for it is promise. While I wasn't all that invested in the story they were trying to tell, I see potential for future films taking a more daring approach to the battle between orcs and humans. Shave off the confusing lore of Warcraft that seemed shoved into the first act and balance mind-blowing action with intriguing character drama. Even if this wasn't Duncan Jones at his best, I believe there was a good film here somewhere. There seemed to be quite a few missing scenes or background information that could have been helpful with a longer cut. Hopefully, that cut will see the light of day.+Great CGI+Kebbell's mo-cap performance-Didn't feel emotionally invested-Missing scenes and confusing lore make for a messy-feeling plot-Could have been more daring, less derivative5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks character motivations but succeeds in creating a fantastic world of conflict</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After several years of back and forth, the game giant Blizzard finally united and chose Duncan Jones as director and leader of their first film, Warcraft: The Beginning. It is based on the first Warcraft game from 1994. Azeroth is the world where the humans for several years have lived in peace together with the other creatures. The orcs are forced to leave their dying world Dreanor behind and travel to Azeroth to survive. The crazy orc Gul'dan lead them into battle with the help of the warcheif Blackhand. But all orcs are not impressed with their thirst for blood and their lack of respect for life. Conflicts appear in several directions. I have played these games when I was younger and I am also pretty familiar with the story because I've read some novels and facts about it.I will start by saying that Warcraft is an incredibly good looking film. The computer made effects combined with real actors, makes for a nice contrast very fitting to the style of the film. However, the characters of the film are a bit messy. It is a lot of characters on both sides and also certain ones who hasn't chosen a side which makes it even harder to keep track on everyone. We are quickly thrown into the story without a proper background explanation which is a pity and may cause confusion before you really understand everything. I like the fact that they have chosen to focus on both sides of the conflict. It makes the battle so much more interesting when we can follow it from two angles with two perspectives.The big weakness of the film also lies in the characters and their at times lack of development. Sometimes we are quickly cutting from one scene to another without ever really staying long enough to get to know anyone. This forces the filmmakers to use cliché dialogue to quickly make us understand what's going on. They've also added a forced love story. The thing that's really good about the film is the story itself. The conflict between the humans and the orcs who just invaded their world is very interesting. I personally really like following the orcs. They have everything to gain after leaving a dying world behind. When we follow them we also see their family situations with children and life mates. I care about them. Medivh, the guardian of Azeroth is also very interesting when he uses his magic. Warcraft is like I said, a bit messy and at times clumsy edited with strange short scenes and fading black screens. I do however like the world and the conflict itself so I forgive these blunders. It's no masterpiece but definitely an entertaining fantasy film.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft it's not only the best video game movie ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's also one the most entertaining movies of the year, and for me, the best so far. I enjoyed every minute of it more than Deadpool, Civil War, X-Men and BvS (and I truly enjoyed them), but I think it's because I wasn't expecting anything of a video game movie, of a game that I haven't even played. But I gave it a try and... Oh, boy! This flick is AMAZING! A must watch in the big screen! A cult classic is born !!! 10/10!!! The CGI is FANTASTIC, rich in details and immersive. The cinematography, the action, the music... almost everything is perfect! And you can easily forgive the imperfections you can find, because you can feel the passion of the director who cares too much developing a great experience for the viewer. But you have to live this experience on your own and not by reading the reviews of others. In the fantastic realm, I put it in a level a little below of the grandiose LOTR series but better than The Hobbit series, and much better than any one of the Harry Potter film series and, obviously, all of the rest. I loved ALL the characters, especially Durotan (his honor), Gun'lan (this guy is truly evil), Medivh (and his last redemption), Lothar (a charismatic swashbuckler)? And I want more! I want an ULTIMATE EDITION with 40 minutes extra and I want a TRILOGY, please!!! Thank you so much, Duncan Jones! You are a genius who inherited the talent, the creativity and the imagination of another genius, your father.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last movie as poor as this one that I watched was London Has Fallen.Truth is I was very excited about it being fan of the game and also I had read the reviews here and they were very positive.So the disappointment was complete and at some points toward the end of the movie I was like please God make it stop.The CGI was great but everything else was just crap - the story, the dialogues, the scenes that were not shot on green screen looked really awful, like childish-lego stuff. And I really rarely write something like this but even the casting was poor. Except Travis Fimmel - Ragnar Lodbrok of course, but everybody else were just so out of place, even just physically.They were like skinny even for humans, considering these were supposed to be warriors, kings, hardened people and so on. The apprentice and Ragnar's son looked like some 15 year-old spoiled children and looking at that kid in armour was just so ridiculous. I hope they don't make another one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know anything about WOW or whatever this movie is based on. The trailer looked average, it didn't have anything different or too spectacular in it and could well be cheesy, but i went to see it anyway as i had a free ticket. My friend had seen it and told me it was rubbish but i still went in with an open mind because the reviews on here were VERY good and the box office seems to be really impressive as of right now, so i thought i'd go and see for myself as i like this genre.Anyway, the movie turned out to be average, a seen it all before thing. I wouldn't have paid to see this, the only redeeming parts for me were the fight scenes because im a sucker for action, but having said that, it isn't anything you haven't seen before and it has been done better. Without those parts i probably would have thought of walking out. Its not that much of a interesting story, boring in places, it isn't gracefuly told/made like the LOTR/Hobbit films i've seen,haven't seen all of those btw but they're the closest things i can compare this to. Travis Fimmel and Ben Foster gave cool performances though.I think this is maybe more for the fans of the Warcraft games and people who like these kind of movies that will settle for an average review. I love this genre of movie too but it needed to be better, there needed to be more to it, considering what we've had before with the likes of Harry Potter, LOTR! I've only seen the first of the Percy Jackson and Narnia films but Warcraft was as average as them i'd say, watchable but nothing i feel necessary to go back to.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cringeworthy Experience And An Absolute Waste Of Duncan Jones' Talents.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasy may not be an easy genre to pull off but one doesn't need to look past the prologue of The Lord of the Rings to get an idea of what all it takes to plant the seeds of interest in the minds of the filmgoing audience and compel even the newcomers to tag along on a journey to a world they don't know anything about. Even Harry Potter series serves as a pretty good example, if not an ideal one.Warcraft, on the other hand, is cringeworthy from start to finish. Infested with excess CGI, terrible screenplay, soulless characters, forgettable performances &amp; incompetent direction from the very filmmaker who's responsible for two of the most amazing sci-fi flicks in recent memory, his latest is a bland cinema that fails to create any sort of interest at any given time, and is simply a pain to sit through.Based on the popular video game of the same name, the story of Warcraft unfolds in the kingdom of Azeroth where peace is disrupted when it is invaded by a fearsome race of orc warriors who are fleeing from their dying world into Azeroth through a portal. With one world facing destruction and other facing extinction, the plot follows two warriors from opposing forces whose actions ultimately decide the fate of their family &amp; race.Directed by Duncan Jones (best known for Moon &amp; Source Code), Warcraft is an absolute waste of his talents and marks the first dent of his impressive career. Without familiarising the viewers with the world it puts on screen, the film dives into its main plot within the opening minutes and follows it up with one inexplicable scene on top of another. There isn't even an attempt to explain what's happening here as most of it makes no sense at all, and the film as a whole is far too up its ass to notice that.Even the technical aspects are a letdown in this effects-laden picture. The grand set pieces have no sense of awe to them and the production design team fails to infuse a live-action feel to those props. Camera-work is lazy although it does duplicate the ambiance of its source material, Editing is a nightmare as this narrative is all over the place while its pacing is even worse. Characters are cardboard cutouts and performances aren't any better either. Even Ramin Djawadi's soundtrack fails to provide an epic vibe.On an overall scale, Warcraft is one of the worst films I've ever seen and this level of monstrosity wasn't expected from someone like Duncan Jones. No introduction, no explanation &amp; no sense of direction, this uninspiring feature is shoddily crafted, sluggishly paced &amp; horribly performed and I can't think of one redeemable quality about it. Failing at even the basic aspects of storytelling and presenting its director diving head-first into the sea of CGI excess, Warcraft is fantasy filmmaking at its very worst. An absolute waste of time. Skip it, folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, albeit a bit messy, watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft is a video game adaptation of the popular game series of the same name. In order to escape their dying world, the orcs invade the world of Azeroth, while the inhabitants of that world, namely the humans, try to stop their efforts. Now I have never played World of Warcraft or any other game in the franchise except for Warcraft 3, and that too only online matches with my friends, meaning I have little to no knowledge about this universe, its lore, its characters etc. Having said that, I was still interested in watching this movie as I just love fantasy worlds and this looked like another good one. From the very first scene to the very last, this movie was RUSHED AS HELL. There was literally no breathing room, none at all. This is the core reason for all of my problems with the movie. It felt like they had the material to make two movies, or even a trilogy, but crammed it all into one 2 hour long movie. The movie just went from scene to scene, locations to location, without giving you time to take it all in. This also resulted in little to no development for majority of the characters. There was also a super rushed forced romance in the movie. And the movie just ends. No proper resolution. Seriously, it feels like they just butchered a 3 hour movie to make it shorter. I hope there is an extended Bluray version or something. Keeping the extremely fast pace in mind, the movie was somehow still entertaining. I wanted to know more about the world, the characters, the races and what have you. The story was straightforward with some interesting characters. Surprisingly, the main Orc, Duratan, was the one who had the most depth and emotion in the entire movie. This was not only thanks to a good performance, but also thanks to some amazing motion capture work. The facial animations and detail was almost on Dawn of the planet of the apes level, which really brought not only Duratan, but other orcs to life, whether it be Guldan: the big baddie or Duratan's wife. This brings me to the overall CGI work. The orcs, as stated above, looked amazing. Huge, fierce, powerful beings. Their fights had impact and you really got the feeling that humans were puny little things in front of them. The locations looked great as well. The different landscapes and cities were quite beautiful at times. However, CGI was inconsistent. The creatures/animals didn't look as good, and at times, when there were both live humans and CGI orcs and environments in the mix, things did get too green-screen-ey. The action was good and entertaining. It wasn't anything outstanding, something I was expecting for some reason ( :p ), but it was good enough that you get thrill out of it. I wish there were more Orc vs Orc brawls cause that looked AWESOME!! The magic stuff was great. The effects, the power and feel, it really made magic a force to fear, and I loved it. Soundtrack was good enough with some really good tracks on the orcs side. Coming back to the characters, while Duratan was great, most of the humans were really hard to care for. This again can be attributed to the fact none of them got any proper time for development. BUT, some of the acting was bad too. Stilted and lifeless. And with movie being so rushed, sometimes characters just pop out, even near the end for furthering the plot, making things more messy.Still, surprisingly enough, it was an entertaining watch, even if a messy one. The 2 hours flew by. If it wasn't such a rushed job, this could have been a great fantasy action movie and the general audience would have liked it more. As for the fans, I get why they like it more as if you know the ton of lore already, the rushed job won't have a big effect. My recommendation is that it is worth a try if you like fantasy worlds. There are things to appreciate in the movie and can be a good time for many. Seeing the box office, I don't think we'll get a sequel but I really hope they do make one. I wanna see more of this world. 7/10</fullReview>

All I can say is that this movie was just okay. From what I have seen of the Warcraft games, this seems to be quite loyal to them. I especially appreciate how good the CGI is. There are some moments where it's off, but for the most part, it's a pretty good effect. I guess it does have the feel of the actual game. I just wish I was more familiar with it. I don't want to have to go through all the trouble of getting an account to understand this, as I know how complicated this game is.I do recommend this to people who are Warcraft fans. The acting isn't bad at all, although there are some pretty badly done scenes. I actually like the Garona character and think she has some pretty good moments. There's even a nice little scene at the very end of the movie. This is a lesser film for me this year, but maybe that's because I've seen so many great movies. I am in no way trying to offend players of the game. It just doesn't seem like a movie made for me, but I didn't find anything terrible in it. **1/2</fullReview>

There wasn't much suspense nor was it very intriguing. The pacing is quite slow and there really isn't much to say about the plot as it is very simple. The CGI however is great, the imagery shows mythological concept quite well. Most of the CGI was excellent and had quite a realistic feel to it and wasn't really overdone. Money well spent.The acting is also quite bland. The actors show do not show much emotion and it looks to me they are not portraying their characters in the way they are supposed to. However, Toby Kemmel and Travis Fimmel were brilliant how they represented the characters. As a motion picture character, Toby Kemmel had a hard job show emotion and have an emphatic effect and he did this very well.However, the problem with mythological films is that most films do not explain mythology or at least its origins. This is immensely key especially in warcraft as it has such a brilliant backstory with its many games yet fails to show this. The film does show a character being developed later on in the next film foreshadowing something quite mysterious happening involving Durotans son. The cinematography is splendid.Quite scrumptious if i may add. Films like Warcraft need to have great cinematography in order to capture key elements of the film. warcraft did a great job in this department. Duncan Jones is a good director. Although with very few films under his belt, he is great director. Watch Source Code, the film is great and he did a brilliant job keeping the film together running everything smoothly. However, the lack of experience and only one film which was critically acclaimed to have done quite well, there was too much expected from him. Duncan Jones ruined this film and had a hard time keeping it together. I believe he wasn't the man for the job.This film is yet another blockbuster film which isn't great and is another film with critical controversy. Hopefully the next film will be better after its intriguing conclusion of the first film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I play the game for like 5 years now, and this movie is pretty much representing the story of Orcs and Human races. Game also nicely presents clases avaible in the game! Movie has many awesome Computer- Generated effects, that beats many many movies about magic and fight. Modeling of non-human characters and costumes are very realistic and to be fair - they look almost the same as in the game. Story is rich and some scenes are really exciting to watch. But some scenes are really scarry and frightening, so make sure that you follor the 12+ age redistrection. This is not a fairy tale. This is serious action- strategy movie. Only thing I really wasn't waiting (&amp; kindda hoping it won't happen) was the ending. The end of this movie is actually not quite like end, so there MUST be a sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as IMDb's rating. Not even close.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good: The CG is very well done for the most part. A fair bit of action and interesting special effects. Seeing a world from a much-loved video game franchise brought to life on the big screen will fill WoW fans with contentment for a short while.The bad: Although the plot has more than a few twists, they aren't that surprising. Worse, they don't have much impact because, among the large cast of characters, only a couple can be connected to on an emotional level. In my case, Durotan, the main Orc protagonist, was the only character I felt any attachment to, and it wasn't all that much. Garona, the human-orc hybrid, played by Paula Patton, was next in line. She has some complexity and an interesting look, but I mostly "meh". The rest of the characters could bathe in glory or their own blood for all I cared.My two sons agreed that the movie was forgettable with my eleven year-old stating that the best thing about the movie was the popcorn.Which brings me to my point: As I write, Warcraft currently has an IMDb rating of 7.4. The reviews written in May, most of which were made before the official release date of May 24th (in France), are highly positive (9-10). The reviews begin to shift to highly negative (3-4) in late May and into June as the movie was released in more countries (ie. North America on June 10th). Currently, the main competing movie and TV review sites rate Warcraft much more negatively than IMDb. Clearly, the IMDb rating and review system is being successfully gamed. I will be taking that into account from here on out when looking at IMDb reviews and will be consulting ratings from competing review sites before making any decisions.How the mighty have fallen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good action, but poor character development and a plot that just lacks realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is especially written for those that are not familiar with WoW. The world of Warcraft is entirely new to me. Never have I played these games. A friend of me told me this was a must-watch. Sadly, I disagree.It surprises me that this movie has an average rating of 7.5/10. I suspect that most of these viewers like the aspects that are familiar to them.You could argue that fantasy movies are not realistic by definition. However, within this fantasy world, story development should be realistic. The main reason for me to give this movie a poor rating (6/10) is the plot, which seems too simple and lacks realism. The love story between the two main characters feels awkward. Moreover, character development is poor. The young magician is suddenly able to defeat the 'great and powerful Medivh'. Neither the magician, nor the character portrayed by Fimmel train their skills and gain power in some drastic manner. This victory does just happen. The story builds on identifying evil, and thereafter destroying it, without learning why and how.I feel like the acting is not great. Even though I love Travis Fimmel's dark and unpredictable way of acting in Vikings, his performance lacks in this film. This is mainly due to poor dialogues and a lack of humor.What do I like about this movie? Visuals, yes they are outstanding. There are some nice action scenes.If you like the kind of medieval battle movies, give it a shot, but don't expect to much. This film offers some nice action, but lacks a surprising plot and decent character building.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft: The War of Orcs, Bores, Magic and Confusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Warcraft expecting nothing but a confusing mess of an adaptation that'd further prove why video game movies don't work but to my surprise Warcraft wasn't nearly as bad as many reviewers say. The biggest problem I had with Warcraft was that I didn't understand anything about the lore. I'm not a World of Warcraft fan/player so I was expecting it to at least attempt to explain certain things like the creatures, the characters, and just the lore behind the movie but unfortunately it didn't really attempt to explain things. Some may argue that's a good thing as it's a movie for the fans of the franchise but as a movie you have to explain the lore behind what's going on.I only cared for about four of the eight main characters and they were Garona the half breed, King Llane Wrynn, Durotan, and Khadgar and aside from those characters the rest of the cast was just, meh. The actors did a good job but the characters themselves weren't very interesting. Another thing about the film was that the sections where the film takes time to have the characters talk about what they're going to do are for the most part kinda boring. I think I would've liked these scenes better if the film actually explained the lore behind the world.The best part of this film that honestly makes up for many of the problems with the film is the action and CGI which are both outstanding. Watching the film I knew in the back of my head that all that was going on when two orcs battled was just two CGI creatures battling but honestly they were so well animated that it felt like they were actually hurting and you feel like every blow in the movie leaves an impact. The CGI in this film is outstanding and is probably some of the best CGI I've seen in a film in a long time.Overall Warcraft or Warcraft: The Beginning is a film that's made purely for the fans of the franchise which is good for fans of the franchise but bad for general moviegoers. I'd highly recommend this film for fans of the franchise but for general moviegoers...I think you should only watch it for the action scenes but nothing more.Also it's a little sad that there's no Leeroy Jenkins easter egg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Exposition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, a quick 5 minute exposition in the beginning about the titans, burning legion, Drinking the blood of Mannoroth, Could've made this movie so much better. Yeah it's supposed to focused on what the characters, but it's kind of harder to relate when you don't know wtf their doing. That was a seriously bad decision on Duncan Jones part. With a quick foundation like that in the beginning you have a solid enough fantasy foundation to just have the liberty to make a fun story. But what we got was a really quirky attempt in trying to make up for that missing 5 minute exposition for 2 hours.In the age of open acceptance for fantasy movies, medieval movies, without shame of it being too nerdy, quirky, or weird, I don't understand why they don't just straight out come out with concepts from the game universe without being embarrassed about it and hiding it underneath the rug.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Video Review: https://youtu.be/PYSjuDFN15AWarcraft, starring Travis Fimmel and Paula Patton. This is the new movie from director Duncan Jones, and is based off of the worldwide video game phenomenon; World of Warcraft. Let's jump right in. With Warcraft, I didn't quite know what to expect. I knew of the games of course but never played anyone in particular. I was worried that not knowing the backstory might make the movie confusing but this film actually does a great job of letting you know the characters and the world at a gradual pace. Whether or not I find these characters good at all is another story but we'll get to that. Warcraft looks amazing. Duncan Jones has proved from previous films like Moon and Source Code that he can make a sharp looking movie. With that, I was interested that he decided to do Warcraft, something so different from the films he's directed so far. This movie is on a bigger scale than his other films and he does a great job of bringing the Warcraft world to life. The motion capture CGI for the orcs looked great, the sets and CGI backgrounds are expansive and the overall style gave the movie a very cool look and feel.Now speaking of orcs, their characters were the ones I felt to be the most interesting as they had the best emotional core to them. Travis Fimmel plays Lothbar, our hero on the human's side and I just didn't care for him much. His performance wasn't lacking anything but I just felt he was a boiled down version of every major action movie hero of the past 5 years. Paula Patton is a half breed orc and I was on the fence about her in the whole film. She had a lot of good lines and great delivery but then had scenes where she'd just grunt a lot. Ben Schnetzer played Khadgar, a sorcerer who to me seemed very flat and I kinda wanted him to get hit in the face with one of the orcs hammers for his deadpan performance. The combat of Warcraft was very impressive to see on the big screen although it almost feels like it's the same fight scene each time. Most of the fights are clan vs clan and lacks variety, as a result the movie lacks those stand out bad-ass moments. The only great 1v1 fight we had comes in the last act of the movie and was a nice treat for fans but is never followed up with a comparable sequence. The ending is also anti-climatic as the final battle scene is pretty lackluster after a boring second act. Overall this movie does a good job of showing and introducing us to the World of Warcraft. The characters are interesting, the CGI was very impressive and I'm interested to see how the second one turns out as this one didn't quite knock it out of the park but it at least got to second base. I'm giving Warcraft 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good, but still fun?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel as though I should be conflicted with my thoughts on Warcraft. The spectacle of seeing the whole perspective of hype turning into savaging anti-hype of this movie should make people like me sit out and ruminate for how I feel about the movie as a whole. But I don't; glaring flaws aside, I still appreciate it. Make no mistake ? it's an overwritten, occasionally phony, shell of a movie, but chock full of ambition and the classic ludicrous charm. When it comes to fantasy action/adventure romps, I would openly compare this to Brett Ratner's Hercules, a movie that is also not traditionally "good" but bask itself with ironic fun. The story pretty much boils down to a conflict between Orcs and humans, as the human realm of Azeroth endures an invasion from the Orcs for no other motive other than to find a new home to replace their dying realm. Among the Orcs are Durotan - a would-be father conflicted by his orders to attack the humans by force and his desires to endure a peaceful route ? and Gul'dan, an evil warlock Orc so obviously evil it's near baffling. Among the humans could be humbly classified as "stock king" "stock future king" "stock half-breed" and "stock rogue character" who all come to terms with "stock secret bad guy" to fend off the intruders. Will the humans end this peacefully or with force? Who is the real bad guys? Will the humans trust the Orcs or will this movie end badly? Are you sure you need answers to all these questions?All kidding aside, the movie does wisely takes the ambiguous approach to this storytelling. Not only does it make both sides virtually more complex, but it also pays homage to the old games where players chose which faction they would play. Even though the movie constantly insists you on caring for these otherwise one-note characters, the way it emphasizes their struggles is bolder than any summer movie would dare to be. The Orcs don't intend any harm; they just need a new home. The humans don't really want to kill them as much as they want to protect their world. They just need to do what they need to do and that's it. These attempt at dynamics, sadly, cripples itself once we actually get to the meat of the story, which is way too bloated and way too unfocused. It feels as though the movie either wants you to understand every last speck of world mechanics or to have us ease into the broader surface of the story, so it opts for both clumsily. The Orc scenes (which are easily the best part, don't get me wrong) are clearly have us invested in their overall struggles with little to no explaining the whats, hows, and whys, while the human scenes sadly convers that for them and little else with one expositional dialogue after another. Its makes matters worse when the real actors aren't all that interesting, with Travis Fimmel playing the weak sauce Aragorn clone, and Dominic Cooper slogging himself as the King. The less said about how unfortunate Paula Patton looks and acts in her ridiculous half-breed get-up the better. It's tedious and bloated, but not really offensive on my part. Honestly, once we get the whole "this is important, pay attention" detail out of the way, it just looks like gangbusters. There will no doubt be a bazillion articles ruminating on Duncan Jones shift from his other works and how much he's out of his league with this movie, but I cannot deny how committed to this bizarre aesthetic of the Warcraft games. He is, no doubt, out of his league and this movie is by far the weakest of his relatively short catalogue, but his basic elements play out well enough here; the world of Azeroth looks beautiful yet lived in, the CGI is used in the best of their capabilities (specifically in the impressive motion-capture with the Orcs and the lavishing action scenes), and there is a very potent theme of family dynamics and emotional conflicts. Granted this movie lacks any sort of consistency, gravity, or enough compelling characters to make it great, but the way it compensates that for such loyalty to this goofy Warcraft aesthetic doesn't mean it's anywhere near lazy.It seems as though I should really hate this movie, much as the movie itself tempts me to, but I really don't. No, this isn't the Battlefield Earth of video game movies, nor is it the beginning of the end of bad video game movies finding some level of good quality. But it's a fun, weightless yet hugely ambitious, movie that cannot be denied for what it tries. Destined to be a cult classic.For more reviews, check out my blog!! http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/2016/06/review-warcraft.htmlRating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still short of the champion we are hoping for in video-game adaptations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as the movie kicks-off, Warcraft wastes no time and plunges its viewers in a headfirst gryphon- ride into its mythical realm. This might be overwhelming for the uninitiated but for the devotees of the RPG, they will immediately embrace its world in the first minute. The orc world Draenor is on the brink of extinction and sinister orc/warlock Gul'dan (Daniel Wu) uses his soul-sucking magic to open a green portal that will send the orc horde to the human world, Azeroth. Chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan, Durotan (Toby Kebbell), questions the brutal ways of his clansmen and believes that co-existence without bloodshed is possible. On the other end of the spectrum, Knight Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), along with the Guardian of Tirisfal, Medivh (Ben Foster) and the young mage Khadgar (Ben Schetzner) have been sent on a collision course by King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) to stop the "plundering, dimension-hopping" orcs. This conflict leaves the half-orc, half-human slave Garona (Paula Patton) somewhere in the middle, torn which side to choose.What elevates Warcraft from a typical fantasy film is that it offers something refreshing with its plot: the blurred sides of good and evil. Just like the game you will find yourself rooting for either race ? the humans or the orcs, based on what morals you personally believe in. Of course notwithstanding that there is a main antagonist, these two battling races are essentially just beings fighting for their survival whom the evils of war find a way to corrupt.Director Jones is tasked with balancing the lore and the soul of the film. It is clear how much love Jones has for this universe and his team's visual effects do an incredible job in translating this love on-screen: from the primitive textures of the orc world to the glowing whoosh of magical spells. This attention-to-detail is impressive especially with the orcs: from their freakishly huge hands, hulky robust physiques, up to the rings attached to their tusks (yes, there are). Blended with a pulse-pounding musical score from Ramin Djawadi (Game of Thrones musical composer), Warcraft is easily one of this year's biggest films that established aficionados will be more than willing to pay for.At times though, the source material may be just too rich that it becomes a disadvantage in effectively telling its story. For the first installment, Jones wrestles with so many characters, locations and subplots which result in fast-paced story-telling, offering no breathing room and ample time to fully- develop most of the characters. (Think of a one full season of GOT jammed into a two-hour film.) While there are a lot of scenes with exposition and minor characters are also used as plot-devices to get us emotionally invested, they all seem not enough as they are merely short backstories and fragments of characterizations. Hence, by the third act when some of these characters are lost, the emotional punch is weaker than how it should have been.Warcraft ultimately feels like a sequel where audiences are expected to do their homework on the world's history rather than a franchise-starter that effectively builds up characters for the next film. This movie would have been better served if it was thirty minutes longer (hoping for a director's cut) or best, it's depth could have been better highlighted as a well-funded TV series. With all the things it aspires to be in such a short run time, the end product comes out as a boisterous and flashy piece largely stripped of poetry compared to LoTR and GoT. Impressively staged yet disengaged, Warcraft is still short of the champion we are hoping for in video-game adaptations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How old were you when you watched Star Wars for the first time? Exactly. Had you played the video game a hundred times before seeing it? Exactly. Right there are the two reasons people outside GB and U.S. don't rate Warcraft, but do globally. In between we had Lord of the Rings. This was based on a book for adults, and was a movie for adults, or teenagers at least. It was heavy. Warcraft has all the ingredients Star Wars has. Great music. The yin and yang, poetically, of the alliance again but this time versus a not so pure evil. Spectacular, uncharted lands and heroes everyone warms too whilst the bad guys really are bad, scary bad. Above all, like Star Wars, this movie is for imaginative kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie! GO SEE IT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I never ever wrote review for a movie, but for Warcraft i just feel like i have to because of all negative critics and people bashing it.First of all I am huge Warcraft fan (not Blizzard fan, but Warcraft fan!), played all games from Warcraft II on PS1 up to WC3 TFT, which I still play. I also played WoW until they merged with Activision and for me completely killed the game.Now about movie, I saw it at pre-premiere in my country, and the moment it ended I wanted to see it again. I was so happy that I could finally see Warcraft story on big screen. I remember when they announced it back in 2006, since that day I couldn't wait to watch it.I am one of those who will argue that movie was too short, for me it was. I would prefer it to be 3 hours long at least, but lets be honest, story that they were telling is so big they probably wouldn't be able to fit it in 15 hours of movie, and that is just beginning of it. Its both good and bad that it lasts around 2 hours.There are some thing that aren't simply in line with lore (like Dalaran which shouldn't be in air at the time of first war), but I respect Duncan's vision of it. I think he aimed in pleasing not only fans of Warcraft but also other moviegoers that are new to lore, and he did it GREAT. Moment I saw Stormwind, Goldshire and other well known places from lore, I felt like I am home (even though I was Horde and I don't really like Alliance). I was so happy, nostalgic about these landscapes, I almost started crying.Warcraft has everything that is needed for a wonderful movie, and I say wonderful for reason. Its not some serious movie with "hard" story, it is pure entertainment and fun, and it is supposed to be like that! Entire movie never gets boring, from moment it start till the end. CGI is done so amazingly, at same time its good, but its not that overkill that you see in so much new movies. It feels like games, just "a little bit" enhanced. Orcs were as real as they could get, and finally some magic. First time you see spell casted your jaw will drop, literally. I think that battles could be a little more graphic, but I guess its because kids, which I don't mind at all, just saying. Finally, there is "evil" and greater evil on one side and "good" on other side and there are also good values ? love, friendship, sacrifice, family, on both human and orc side. Final words: GO SEE WARCRAFT! And take your friends and family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dedicated to fans, made by fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me and my lady went to see this highly anticipated movie yesterday, and since i have been a hardcore gamer for the last 10-15 years, - which included games like warcraft 2, 3 and World of Warcraft, my expectations on this movie was enormous. My girlfriend however, who has played WoW but not really payed attention to the lore, didn't know what to expect and had little hopes for this one.And its also here the biggest problems for this movie is. The fans of the games will have a significant better understanding on the circumstances of the characters and the world in this movie than a regular movie-goer would.The movie is truthful to its source material, but the issue lies within the characters, some of them are just borderline flat because a regular person or any reviewer doesn't "read" the characters motivations, but "we" who are familiar to Warcraft, knows the intentions of Gul'Dan f.ex, is much more intricate than "just" invading a new world to conquer for the Horde, the Fel magic isn't just a type of magical resource, but it ties to a significant threat which is not the orcs but something completely different. Same goes for Medivh, his past does affect him and his action in this movie, but a regular person doesn't know this, which will make this characters non- important to them when it should be the opposite. Instead this movie is dedicated to Travis Fimmel's character Anduin Lothar, Ben "Schnitzel"'s Khadgar and Pattons Garona, although we get glimpses of their personalities, you wont feel any connection or any empathy for them, not as much as you wants to at least.The performances of the actors are... OK. Lothar and Khadgar have a strange chemistry which feels awkward. Lothars insults to Khadgar doesn't bring any reactions or any emotions, it feels like they are just reading the script loudly to each other in these cases.Patton's Garona on the other hand is the most interesting figure in this movie by far, a orc-human hybrid (at least that is what they want you to think) with a dark past. This is a persona i want to delve deeper into (not that i have much other choice when the movie ends). Besides being the only orc which isn't in mo-cap, she blends nicely in performing with the other orcs, with Kebbels Durotan, ("i am Durotan" sounded a lot like "i am ape" from another movie Kebbel was part of,) and Wu's Gul'Dan is excellent. Kazinskys Orgrim get little screen time, but gets to say more than Grommash Hellscream at least.All in all, its a very good movie, and i believe Warcraft could easily become a popular movie series, but peoples taste in movies are very different, and the fantasy genre isn't that appealing anymore, not when Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones have set the standard for this genre, with its high production quality and design.Im not saying the quality of the warcraft movie is any less, far from it, the CGI of the orcs and the landscapes are phenomenal, but the style is quite different. F.ex: LotR and GoT are gritty and more realistic compared to the more "colorful" nature of Warcraft, with over-the-top magical light effects and glow-eye-enchantments is very different from what we are used to see.After reading many negative reviews on this movie, i cant directly blame them, because they are right, they don't have any insight in Warcraft's lore, and those who know the games from before, praise it.I am huge warcraft fan, but i wanted this movie to be more appealing to those who isn't familiar with Warcraft and its rich lore and interesting characters.Im afraid this movie will flop majorly because this isn't anything but visual feast for the eyes with flat characters, and a OK enough war story.Duncan Jones might not be the right man for introducing the characters, but the direction of this movie was of similar quality to his other movies, which are fantastic!I would recommend this movie for everyone, its great, but the level of appreciation for this will undeniably favor those familiar to the universe by a lot!I would know, i spent about 2 hours after the movie to explain the lore to my girlfriend, all the way back to the dark titan Sargeras and the creation of the burning legion... which Isn't MENTIONED ONCE IN THIS MOVIE!It was a bold choice of Duncan Jones not to include Mannoroth, or Sargeras even, hopefully he will be given a second chance to correct this in a sequel.For a fan like me, it managed to capture the essence of the Warcraft universe, but the characters falls short and isn't properly introduced as i would like it to be.For a fan, 9/10, for a regular this is a 5-6/10, for me its a 7.Feel free to comment if you agree or disagree</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I must say that I am very easily swept off my feet when it comes to fantasy movies. I am also a long time Warcraft nerd and really wanted to love the movie.I have, like so many others, waited for this movie for several years with excitement. I went in with maybe too high expectations and left with an emptiness. Not because the movie was bad but because it didn't really move me.The movie sets off with the orcs on their journey to the new world. Only the fans of Warcraft lore will know why things are set in this direction, the others have to accept the terms and perhaps google afterwards. The orcs are big and ruthless. I liked how they weren't afraid to let the orcs crush a head or two.The first character that we got a really good look at was Durotan and I think his face up close is amazing, it gives out more emotions than most of the real actors during the movie. He is an interesting character but as the others, we don't really get to know him or where he comes from. That is a problem with all of them, there is no real story behind the characters and we don't get a chance to bond with them which later on leaves me wondering if I really care about them.The CGI is not very convincing, perhaps they tried to hard to remind us of the games. We get green screens everywhere and I wonder if they really tried at all to convince us that the buildings and environments are real. A lot of prop look like plastic toys.As a Travis Fimmel fan, or more Vikings maybe, I really liked to see him in this movie. It was nice to hear him talk without the Norwegian accent and he played his role well. He reminds me a lot about Ragnar in Vikings, if it is from lack of diversity between playing different roles I can't really tell. His so called relationship with half-orc/half-human Garona felt a bit pushed and sudden. I had a hard time with her not because of her acting but because of her teeth. Remember the plastic toys I mentioned? That's right.A character I was looking forward to see was Medivh but instead I found him rather boring and dull. I preferred younger mage Khadgar, who Schnetzer portrays well. Khadgar was also the one who gave me a smile here and there during the movie.This is a good story, and I think that if they just give it a little more effort the sequels can be great. There are several important characters and places I want to see. I also hope that the DVD version will be extended with more scenes regarding character development. I love the feeling of when a movie makes me think "Wow, this was amazing!", when sensational scenes give my spine a tingle and I just can't wait to see the movie again.

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to see the new film Warcraft, out of shear curiosity, I mean how could they possibly turn an MMORPG into a feature film? On one hand, the producers wanted to make an epic film like Lord of The Rings, so there are crazy sets, ridiculous customs, awesome special effects, and even a narrator, but they also wanted to make the WOW geeks happy too, so there are realms, clans, portals, kings, wizards, betrays, and if you've never played the game it's all very confusing and more than somewhat boring. The story is complicated, but to sum it up, an evil wizard has destroyed the Orcs home world, so he has opened a portal to the realm of the humans, where the Orcs think they'll have an easy time taking over, but didn't expect the humans to have a magic Guardian. It's a film of fighting, gibberish, and non-sense that I'm sure the gamers loved, but I didn't, I fell asleep. As for the cast, well, I guess the filmmakers spent all their money on the effects and costumes, cause there is really no one of name in this film, and some of these people honestly wouldn't have been cast in their high school plays. Some of the actors were so bad, I think they agreed to do this for free, just to have a major motion picture on their resume. The bottom line, I saw it for curiosity and I'm sure a lot of other people will too. The special effect were really cool and it looks terrific in 3-D, but the story is confusing, it's just one crazy fight after another and there really isn't much of a point to the whole thing. If you're going to see it, go see it in 3-D. It makes the effects look cooler and if you fall asleep, the people you are with won't notice and won't bother you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is it bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is going to be short, informative and honest. Let's get started!Screenplay is bad. Universe is not formed. Rushed and forced story. Human cast is horrible. Paula Patton deserved a Golden Raspberry Award. I wonder how she managed to not to crack while saying all those lines. Travis Fimmel is a good looking man but he clearly overacts. He behaves like a soccer player on a field, not like a mighty warrior. Casting Dominic Cooper as a King was a complete failure. No stars for this set of "stars" (kek). CGI could stand out. But it did not. It's all become unrealistic the moment the human characters are joining the set. Makeup is bad, requisite is cheap. You either do balance animated characters and humans or you remove someone to get a realistic picture. Let's talk about music, shall we? Oh, wait... There is no music! I mean, Blizzard, what happened? Even Warcraft TFT had a good music. Diablo 2 had different and memorable score. Here you got nothing but clacking sounds.I see why this film had a warm reception in my trashy country (Russia) and other third-world countries. People with lack of intellect will indubitably love this. Conclusion: it has no cinematic value. Not worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantasy can be so much better. It's original players have grown up and Warcraft could have chosen to grow up too. It didn't. It is as childish and cliché as one might expect. You won't be disappointed. I went in hoping for a good story. I came out with a shattered brain. The effects are good, but wasted on this movie. It's a dwarf standing on the shoulder of giants (Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, Dungeons and Dragons in this case). It imitates all, but surpasses none and it is more like a family album full of rather lousy parties, than a gripping tale. Familiar faces and nothing more remains to be said. BTW: those orc teeth must hurt the lips.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was painful to watch from beginning to end. The writing was atrocious and the acting to match. I couldn't wait for this ridiculous, overproduced movie to end. I have actually never written a review on here but it was so bad that I felt compelled to share how awful it is from beginning to end. The most amazing thing is that the movie made money!! That can only mean that the poor people of earth will be subjected to the birth of another Warcraft movie. I felt like I had to shower and cleanse my body of the cheesy lines when I got home this movie was so bad. hahaIf this doesn't win Worst Picture at the next Razzie Awards, I don't know what will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there were so many things wrong with this movie, that I told my buddy how embarrassed I was to be watching it without any of my own children. It turns out that this was a date movie for some and that quite a few people were interested in seeing this. I wonder if they saw what I saw. I didn't know that there would be some somewhat entertaining actors in this film, and good thing for IMDb for being able to search other work that they have done as well... but from what I saw...it wasn't too different from a dinosaur movie that came out not too long ago where the triceratops bros....fight. This does happen to be a little more mature and is even better than the Jungle book...which I know that I definitely should not take any children to see. The generic film is obvious...the theatre and quality of FILM changes multiple times...scenes with JUST THREE people on screen, one dude with a blue towel wrapped around him...etcetera. there's this scene where the KING intimately tells a woman ork to do something...and THOUGH she does it, no one else had had the opportunity to KNOW that that conversation happened amongst them....THEREFORE and ultimately creating a scenario of THEM against YOU with out any explanations...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Not The Game, Obviously. You are not prepared...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well ACTUALLY, I suppose you are prepared. The film was highly done in cg, and not always well considering its not the 90's. Still it was nice and I was expecting to see it as I first began playing WoW ( World of Warcraft for anyone clueless).The Dwarfs looked kinda sad, and were hardly in the film AT ALL! Which sucks because they are one of my favorite fantasy races.The elves were pre Night Elf, as this is an earlier story in the mythos from a time before the Horde became an official faction, as of WoW. But hardly featured. This seems to take place more before the video games themselves even began in the mid 90's. Still a few alterations here and there, though only noticeable to a fan/ game player , the movie was not terrible.I honestly felt at times however that I was watching the Viking television show, as Travis Fimmel played Lothar. Which could be good or bad as that show kicks ass! The acting on the part of the characters, whether Cg or not, felt too effortless, and I don't mean natural talent effortless. Facial expressions were always a little too puzzled or bland. But then there were a few mentions of a locale in the game world or the sight of a murloc calling to its kin. *shrugs *At the very least it painted a quick picture of what lead to the world in the games as it has become. Leave it to Blizzard to capitalize on a franchise at the last minute, like a hoarder( not horde :P) selling food and water in a crisis AFTER people have died already. Not only will this be the FIRST in a series of films, but with the advent of the latest expansion for Wolrd of Warcraft in August, I just gotta shake my head at the brashness of the company.As if they have not already made a ridiculous amount of of the franchise as a whole, let alone all of its properties and titles.So have a drink, or smoke, or whatever and see it, fore twas a fair to decent film.There's a storm coming, nay... a blizzard, and I shudder to think of all the money being drawn out of people by the cold hearted villains of this storm in years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but needs some clarifications(minimal spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'm not a Warcraft fan so haven't played the games... Here's my honest opinion:The good: The CGI is beyond awesome, and I can honestly say that is better than Avatar of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, but just like these two movies, it has it's cartoonish moments, but that didn't disturb me... Next, the story's core, or the way the story would have looked like is very nice, simple, rehashed, but very nice introduced on screen. The fights were extraordinary, very well choreographed and very intense. The characters are very nice, especially Durotan(who was my favourite), but it was hard for me at times to get familiar with so many names and characters, but they all fit in very good.The bad: There isn't any story to show us how the Orcs world was dying, and maybe show some of Gul'dan's fault. Maybe a 5-10 minutes intro like LOTR would have don it nicely. And that's why some people and the critics especially will find this movie bad for, the incomplete story, but that's not the big problem. For me the biggest problem is how Durotan figures out that Gul'dan was the problem for which their worlds were dying. It is literally a 3 minutes scene where something happens and then a cliff talk and that's how Durotan figures it out. How I said earlier, it would have made sense a 5-10 minutes story of the orcs, that would hint some things pointing towards Gul'dan's fault. The last problem is the lack of character development. The characters literally are shown in cut scenes just so the plot can go further, but there isn't really any development of them, maybe a longer runtime, and a more focused approach could have solved this.So is the video game to movie curse broken? In a way... but this movie has some aspects to improve upon, but what I enjoyed most about it was that it felt like LOTR, a fantasy movie, and a welcome into a big universe of potentially great future movies. So, I rate this movie with seven, of course the critics can only see this movie for what it's not, but I found it to be very entertaining, didn't made me sleep(like Ant-man did) so that's OK for me.It's worth it, and hope so that the sequel will be more developed.Cheers! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll like it if you're already familiar with the Lore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies based on video games tend to not be so good, Warcraft might be an exception. Nevertheless it seems to have gotten a lot of bad press. I noticed that most of the critics who gave the film negative reviews were people who have never played, or were were not familiar with the games.I've been a long-time fan of the Warcraft series since the second game came out in 1996. Since then I've played through all of the Warcraft RTS games, and was a World of Warcraft subscriber for several years. I was one of the few WoW players to earn the achievement "lore master" for completing all of the quests in the primary zones vanilla WoW (and the first few expansions). So I'm pretty well versed on the story.I did get kind of burned out on World of Warcraft after Wrath of the Lich King. I canceled my subscription soon after reaching the level cap. I would resubscribe for brief periods here and there just to see what's going on, but for the most part I was done with WoW. Still, I'm a fan of the game and lore, so I guess I'm probably the target demographic for this film.The film was pretty faithful to the lore of the games (and the lore of the games has, itself changed over time since the original warcraft ms-dos that came out in 1994). The film is basically about the first war from that first game Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, focusing on the characters from the first game: Garona, Lothar (probably the main characters), Medhiv, King Llane, and Blackhand. Now if they limited themselves to focusing on just these characters and limited themselves to sticking to just the story of the first game, the film, while being pretty simple, would have probably worked better for those new to the story of warcraft. There would have been fewer characters. Fewer simultaneous plots, and they would have been able to focus on developing the stories and characters and easing people into the fantasy via more relatable protagonists.But there's one major problem with doing it this way. The story of the first game was very human-centric. The POV of the orcs was told entirely from the half-orc, Garona in the instruction booklet that came with the first game, and it didn't portray the orcs in a very good light at all. On the contrary, it portrayed the orcs as evil warlike savages with almost no redeeming qualities. You actually don't get a deeper understanding of the orcs until Warcraft 2 when we are introduced Gul'Dan, Ogrim Doomhammer and Kil'Jaeden. And it's not until Warcraft 3 that we actually start to view the orcs in a more sympathetic light with the introduction of the orcs Gromm Hellscream and, of course, the warchief Thrall, son of Durotan, a character who was not introduced until World of Warcraft (and plays a major role in the most recent expansion). In the film, Durotan is, in fact, one of the main protagonists.So, to make a long story short, the problem with this film is exactly that, they're trying to make a long, complicated and lore rich story with a lot of characters, into a short two hour film. Perhaps if it was split into two films, one that told the story from the humans POV, and another that told the story from the Orcs POV it would have worked better, after all that's how the story was told in the original game. It split the story up into two separate narratives. And, in the end, isn't that always what war comes down to? Two opposing narratives competing for dominance. This movie tries to to be sympathetic to both sides of the conflict at the same time. And as result the audience can't get as invested in any of the characters or the conflicts they are engaged in. It loses the sense of urgency and drama. When you try to please everyone, you please no one.Well ... that's not true. The film did please me. I enjoyed seeing the lore I've grown up with over the passed 20 years come to life on the screen. I did enjoy the spectacle and the special effects as well. It was a cool movie all things considered. But I understand why people who weren't familiar with the games walked away from this one disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Fantasy film since Avatar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Warcraft. It really makes you think about the human condition, Take a look at the movie poster for this film;--it is fascinating, depicting the leaders of two warring factions, one with red war paint, and the other, with blue. The tag-line for the film is;-- "Two worlds; one home." So many films are centered around that whole "red vs. blue" thesis. And it seems like this trend has a real world gravitas to it, when you consider the fact that our civilization was always in a sort of civil war with itself.But not just politically. In a sense, I found that these two particular factions in the film, the "orcs," and the "humans," represented the duality of man. The Orcs, our animal side, and the Royal Blue side, is our left-brain analytical computer brain side. The ideological conflict that arises in this film is no different than what we have gone through on this planet, conflicted between 2 worlds, the natural and technological, and cycling through revelation. And during the time of Revelation, the two sides of human nature will result in a conflict. The world will be divided into two groups. One group, will deal with the world's pressing problems with their conditioned, conservative, pre-programmed responses of the past, and the other group, will be ready to embrace change and step into the unknown.The acting in this film was solid, Ben Foster stole the cake in my opinion. He's a fine actor that guy. I wish there was more make-up and set design in the film, but with CGI this good, It hardly irked me. The CGI and motion capture acting was some of the best I've ever seen! I look forward to a sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a fanboy.. it will be like watching someone play Warcraft on a big TV.. you'll love it.If you're not a fanboy.. avoid this horrible film at all costs.The actors cannot act with everything looking staged and mechanical (I AM talking about the acting not the CGI)The CGI is nearly as good as Avatar .. now, this isn't a compliment .. Avatar is 7 years old. The CGI is as 'clean' as avatar (or a cartoon..) doesn't look anyway 'weathered' to make things blendThe scenes with actors with 'real' plant-life looks like it was shot in a local garden centre with some bamboo stalks stuck into the ground as the mediocre actors read out a mediocre script putting on mediocre expressions on their faces as they turn mechanically around making it painfully obvious they're trying to avoid the camera or don't realise when people talk to each other they're not trying to bore holes into the other persons skull without blinking or looking away at and stage of their 'deep' conversation.I'd have thought acting 101 would have been a prerequisite for a the cast, but apparently not.I must admit, some of the acting did improve in the last 20 minutes .. it's amazing what 1.5hrs of (usable) work experience does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a WoW player, I didn't love this movie. :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a longtime World of Warcraft player, so I was thrilled to see the game world come to screen.I did like this movie. Alas, I did not love it :( The movie is an operatic story about Gul'Dan, Durotan, Medivh, and Wrynn, with lots of Garona and Lothar, and a little Thrall as baby Moses. The world-building visuals were splendid, and I am so grateful for how well the cinematography made my beloved MMORPG world come to visual life. But when it came to the emotional experience of this story, I was let down. I felt no connection to the characters. I was left feeling emotionally flat at the end, like I had just eaten a tub of buttered popcorn, but it still left me feeling hungry afterwards.Don't get me wrong: if you play WoW or Warcraft, you are absolutely obliged to see this eye-candy movie at least twice! Your chance to see widescreen murlocs, Karazhan, Redridge Mountains, Blasted Lands, Stormwind, Goldshire, Ironforge, Dalaran, and a mob getting sheeped: those scenes alone are worth the price of admission! But I recommend keeping your expectations low for the characterization of Lothar, Garona, Medivh, Llane, and Khadgar. Each of those characters comes across like a good-looking cardboard cutout.p.s. this show is not for young kids. While the camera stops just short of gory squirting intestines in melee combat, the violence is definitely adult. The orcs smashing humans could be disturbing to watch.p.p.s. I kept watching to see which characters were going to carry 32-slot bags x 4. No such luck :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looks like all the critics hate this movie.Well thats because critics nowadays want to advocate for the most massive audience. Don't blame them, they have to bring food to their families too and writing for the big audience is how they do it. But see, that big audience already destroyed the greatest sci-fi and fantasy TV shows there were, by not watching them. Even Game Of Thrones is probably gonna get cut before the great battle, because it will go unprofitable. That big audience has the attention lifespan of a cockroach and the desire to wait for the dragon fights doesn't occupy any braincells.I am just glad that someone pulled enough cash, to bring that amazing world in authentic way - WoW to life. Watching it makes me want to dive in again. And btw, even the horrible reviews wont shut this movie down. Even its terrible advertising wont. I am betting on its box office beating Deadpool and hoping for it, so I can watch some more...</fullReview>

It was a little bit confusing for friends to understand the story , despite it was the easy version of the lore, also there many changes of the story , I do not know now which is the right story. The movie was good , but for someone knew the lore , it will not be good enough, as for someone new to all of this, I think the movie will be great, I hope they will enhance things up on the second part , which I am looking forward to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have played Warcraft 1 &amp; 2 and always enjoyed it. I do not know much about War of Warcraft. This is to say that I am a fan. I might add I am a huge LotR fan. I have had great expectations for this movie ever since it was introduced in trailers last year. I was very interested in what the story will be about. I went to the cinema to see the movie today and and here is my take without hopefully any spoilers. First of all, the movie is beautifully done. The animation is great! The music, well, is fine, kind of what you'd expect from Warcraft, nothing touchy. There is a fair bit of magic in this movie. I wish there was more magic in LotR, this movie is packed with action and a fair deal of magic. All great points here! The plot, however, as expected from a movie based on a game, and it comes true, sadly. The plot is not profound and very weak. I am not going to reveal any of that here. Acting and cast. It's a mixed one here, but overall the acting is weak, or rather off. It's all in the Human side. The acting gives a very Millennial feel, not a historical one. The actor playing the king looks well but his voice is weak and his composure is not regal and majestic enough. In short, lots of action, plenty of magic. If you are into profound plots, you might be disappointed as there is a lot of stuff left unexplained. The acting might get to ya as well. Not necessarily by wrong casting, or actors' inabilities, but rather the director's poor choice of how he wanted them to act.Go and see the movie, not a waste of money, but this movie will not dwell on your mind too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as computer game movies go it's one of the better ones, but as most game movie are total sh1t that isn't saying much... I had very high hopes for this one as the director is no one less then Duncan Jones, director of gems like 'Moon' and 'Source Code'. Jones also claims to be a Warcraft fan and the meaty 160m$ budget should alow to visualize most they can think of without monetary constraints. Well, first the good things: the movie looks pretty awesome. The cinematography is great, the colors and production design are very consistent with the game and the CGI Orcs (courtesy of ILM) are almost photoreal and neatly integrated into the live action footage. So an A+ for eye candy. But that's where the good news stops. The movie plot is just to thin for a 123 minute movie and there are so many scenes where nothing is happening. Characters are just talking their face off but they aren't saying anything useful or aren't advancing the plot. The characters themselves are rather shallow. Sometimes when they die you won't care one bit. The Orc Durotan and Garona are fleshed out the best, but the humans are one sad cardboard bunch. This as you can imagine makes the movie a bit boring and quite slow at times. There seems very little at stake and almost not tension buildup. Has Duncan Jones actually seen his own previous movies? Jones said this is supposed to be a franchise but it should have gotten a better start to keep people interested. If they make a sequel it will be for the Chinese I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Adaptation! 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi guys, this is my first review and probably the only one on IMDb for another long time because this is the only movie I have been waiting really long to enjoy and to be honest, I'm really excited to share my opinion with you guys. To let you guys know and be genuine, I only either absolutely love or hate a film, so I will either gives it a ten (10) or a zero (0) score. To begin with, I'm a Warcraft III player and never play any other Blizzard products. Yet I did do a lot of "die hard" research on Warcraft I lore and love to see how it'd be transfered to the big screen, as if it had been similar to my imagination. It's not that big, not that long, not that complex to which my expectation based upon but in a different way, simpler. This make me stumbled during the experience but still satisfied somehow. The movie is very solid indeed. It can't be executed any better for me, if so it's just a different way to tell the story. Let's begin with the characters which deadly interested me. Most actors and actresses did their job fairly well portraying the characters, with CGI or not. Some characters really stand out as my favorite that really interests me only after watching the film, in particular Lothar, his son and Khadgar which i didn't care about pre-film and knew little of. They make every major characters very typical and characteristic for this fantasy flick, which is excellent. The characters are fine as they are according to what I have read in the original story. Along with the characters, the story as i said is very simple although it flows and paces sweetly and eventually focused on the main characters and Warcraft I story-line. It felt like if it does not tolerate the newbies to the Warcraft universe as they were dragged right into the atmosphere of the First War without any background. Still they would be virtually impressed by their eyes and ears because of the terrific visual and sound effects and should immediately immerse themselves with "The Beginning" of the epic Warcraft. The story moves fast from scenes to scenes at first as part of an easy encapsulated introduction to the warcraft universe. It then gives you some background checks, an alternate storytelling with additional cool scenes then builds up its characters relationship, their motives and the confrontation between orcs and humans together submerged within the epic battle scenes. Afterwards the story connected our emotion and push us up to a high level with multiple amazing emotional climaxes. There're a lot of alternatives to the lore but all finally concludes "The Beginning" with the simplest, most shocking, bad-ass and arousing way possible by and awesome cliffhanger. Overall the story has no twists at all and is a lot shorter than I expected, and that's apparently how "The Beginning" of Warcraft should be implemented. The filmography is just relevant for usual fantasy filming with great sceneries photographing in front of our eyes along with some sick battle sequences. About the battles, for me it's again short but sick and hell does it has a bunch of "warcraft"-ish feeling. I can't say much about the visual effects, the soundtrack or the setting with all those big buildings, plastic rusty equipments and huge landscape. For me personally, the effects and CGI are extremely smooth; the vast landscape seems just like Warcraft and the simple makeup as well as cartoonist gears and buildings and the soundtrack by the legendary Ramin Djawadi all together just put me on a fictional dream and basically do justice to the Warcraft universe . Thus I want to emphasize that this cool effortless Warcraft version of a film contradicts almost all of my expectations but nevertheless it drives me crazy in a positive direction for the movie itself and also its sequels. I just want to salute the director and the producers whoever they are for their audacious attempt to bring such a fantastic story to life. For me, there's one word to describe this work in a nutshell: "Solid" and I rate it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a little scared to post my review cause something tells me nobody is going to like it, but I got to be honesty, I'm getting a sense of what It must be like to gush over a Marvel Cinematic Universe Movies to non Fan Boys.Like every human on the planet I've herd of the game, but I never played it, so going into this movie I knew nothing and it was up to the filmmakers to tell a story to a blind slate. Warcraft is extremely overwhelming. A lot of things are going on all at once. Not that it's so hard to grasp the story but it was hard to get into.Everything just seem so chopped up and squeezed together. I never thought I would say this, but the movie actually moved too quickly, Something happens and than something else happens and the film gives you little time to process, but once again this may not be a problem for you Warcraft fans who are already familiar with the characters, but for the rest of us, the characters became so one dimensional from this process.One true high light, other than Paula Patton in that slave warrior outfit, was the war scenes of War Craft. the CGI was not that great but they did have some very energetic battles that looked really epic.Overall, like most Fantasy films, it looks like the first of an epic saga, that may be better if viewed as a whole trilogy or however many movies come out, but then again, the Fellowship of the Ring worked better on it's own for me than Warcraft.I would recommended playing the game before watching the movie in order to get some satisfaction out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inaccurate reviews on webpage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely disappointing, even worse than the 'Dragon Ball Evolution' and 'Mario' movie fiascoes.It's clear that Blizzard is greening off fans to post ridiculous reviews on here. Also exceedingly obvious that the simple Blizzard fanboys/girls are mobbing this webpage to try to breath life into a dead movie, it's quite cheap. This is why IMDb needs a better moderation system and actually professionally paid and experienced cinema experts to review movies. IMDb shouldn't allow ridiculous, laughable, and mediocre user reviews to go unchecked because they are very misleading. R.T. did a much better and non-biased job of reviewing this movie. Go to R.T. if you want to know the truth about 'Warcraft'. I've played Warcraft and World of Warcraft. Those games are fun, not the best but fun. This movie, however, was absolutely horrid and a waste of money. I regret paying to go see it. I want a refund, seriously. Poor character development, p$ss poor action, too much focus on CGI, weak plot at best, little to no background story. The acting was weak. I really hope this movie doesn't drag down Duncan Jones with it because he is a good director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you remember about the war between Orcs and humans? I don't. Maybe it took place when I was away on vacation, I had a long vacation on Khutungu, my own pink planet, I was not on Azeroth for a few years. And why they have fangs so big and ugly, no dentists there on their planet? OK, I'm just kidding, I'm an Orc myself and I was a stillborn too. And the great Chief-Wizard instilled in my navel the soul of a cockroach and the soul of a mouse, to bring me back to life, just to write you this review. First of all, I got to tell you that I was The Guardian of the S..t myself so, I can surely smell one, especially when it comes from the dark forces. The dark forces of the cinema, what did you thought? You'll do the right thing if you'll not watch this film but, if however you're stubborn to see it, take some precautions, make your lobotomy surgery first. One last thing, I used to ride a wolf myself when I was younger but, someday, I was terribly hungry and I ate that wolf. From that day, I only take the bus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film in itself was very good, good cgi, not too bad an acting and nice to see some well know faces in there. BUT... and now the big BUT. its a blizzard game, its a blizzard film, so WHY WHY WHY so many historic thing incorrect. The why the king dies is incorrect he never asked Garona to kill him he betrayed and cut our his heart, the fact his son Varian Wrynn (current king) wasn't there to see it was incorrect, Khadgar killed Medivh a different way. and go many other things wrong. so watch it and enjoy don't think its the correct history to the game and lore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant CGI Bad story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For God's sake can somebody tell me where is the story, dialogue, acting in this movie. I didn't give a damn if orcs invaded Azeroth, killed humans or not because the script didn't make me sympathize with any of the characters. The movie name is Warcraft and the fight sequences were terrible. Dominic Cooper such a waste of talent Im sure he must have signed this movie because it was a huge gaming franchise but the movie had nothing for him. To be true the movie had nothing for anybody. The CGI and 3D made the movie somewhat bearable else I would have walked out. It was blunder of a huge franchise. Totally disappointed. 6 stars for CGI and 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average,. but not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a World of Warcraft fan, never really played any of the games, nor read up about its lore, but was drawn to this movie due to its fantasy themes, so my review is from a non fan, as I assume many people who watch this movie will be the video game fans.This movie is no way near as bad as many critics are making it out to be, but then again, critics are fools, and only believe a film is good if it is going to nab that best Oscar. However, while not bad, this film is not good either. It is a mess.The good things about this film, is its visuals. It is visually stunning to look at, with almost perfect CGI, gorgeous art direction, set pieces, and costume design. The actions scenes were very well done in some scenes, and the magic in this film is spectacular to see. There have been many fantasy movies that have never displayed magic like this. The acting is also good in this film, with each main lead performing as best as they could with the average screenplay.The main villain in this film is ... OK. I understand that he 'is' a video game villain, but they could have make him a little more realistic, rather than the over-the top one we got. The characters are so boring, that the only one that even draws you in, is the main orc, but even then, he isn't actually in the film as much as he could have been. He is the only character that has any development, as the others are pushed aside.Now the bad. The faults here do not fall on the director, who does a great job at converting a video game into a movie, but with the screenplay. The story is all over the place, and is a wasted potential. This film could have rivalled that of Lord of the Rings, if it had been written better. The characters are bland and boring, and the pacing is dreadful. The editing was also very poor, with many scenes cut together, seeming very mismatched, and don't make much sense.One of the major issues I would personally say about this film, its the film not giving us more to explore. I wanted to see vast wilderness, more of the beautiful cities, maybe some oceans, villages and towns, give us more to look at, as the film is visually breathtaking. Other than that, this film is not bad, it has its flaws yes, but it is an entertainment. It is one of the better video game adaptations, but don't go into this film expecting a great movie, or a dreadful one. Expect to be entertained, but that's it.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't like this film that much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to watch this movie, I was expecting an action movie with some animated graphics, which it is. However,in the story line I did not find anything to catch my eyes and I was bored all the time I was in cinema. No excitement, nothing specific! Animations was not good but I think acts in this movie were acceptable in general. I think the shortcoming of such a movie is in the depiction of the new world it is describing. This world, is indeed an interesting thing and I liked the whole idea, but the story didn't let us to view more of it. The ideas were not mature enough and the movie could be much better than it is .It seems that it is not the last of Warcraft...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crafting the tools of War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review of Warcraft: The Beginning (spoiler free) *** (3 out of 5)Cast: Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster with Dominic Cooper and Toby Kebbell.Plot: The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilization faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonize another.2016 so far seems to have a few game adaptations like Angry Birds and now this both of which were better than they made out to be. Were as Angry Birds started off as a mobile game this one is completely different because it is based on well you know what World of Warcraft is.Director Duncan Jones surely challenged himself because this type of film isn't easy to make other than the fact it was done by CG. With a mostly unknown cast the film triumphs and is probably the best game adaptation ever.There are a quite a few game adaptations out there and most of them were disappointing like Resident Evil, Doom and Super bloody Mario Brothers, this one achieves the one thing that they are not that this is visually stunning and well good. It had the perfect director to make it because he knew what kind of challenge it would be and also he's a World of Warcraft nerd.This may not be the greatest movie of all time but certainly has it's perks here are some points as to why this prevails on it's genre: CGI: This movie is CGI based from start to finish but it has to be some of the best CG ever, and it makes for one hell epic ride through the world of Azeroth. The CGI makes it look so real it almost seems like a real place and you can just bet if you go then you'll most likely see orcs. Even the CG battle scenes are just beautiful to look at with something different happening every time.Origin: We all know how this started it started as a PC game and became ever so popular but because this is mainly CG based it couldn't have been done, personally I've never played the game but this is a truly epic ride into that world. Even though this is a fantasy game it has been done well and it is very fun to watch.The OK point: Action: The action has been very well to which there is something different happening every time, but the battle scenes get dull fairly that's not to say they are boring it's just the action is a key component and it just seems like it could've been better. Other than the that the film is very pretty and well action packed.The bad point: Plot: The movie doesn't follow the game to the point, because the plot is just non-existent it just makes it look like the director focused on making the movie look pretty and full of action, without actually having a plot. To make this movie it should have succeeded in all three points just mentioned instead of just two.Other than that the movie was enjoyable and completely bursting with action and it was just absolutely gorgeous to watch, ignoring the fact the plot wasn't there.Verdict: Entertaining, captivating and just beautiful this is another game based film that isn't disappointing, and definitely worth a watch.6/10 Good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Single non-fanboy review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today was the day. I trusted a 7,5 IMDb rating and got betrayed. I knew there was a game called "world of warcraft", I knew there is a huge fan base but I did not expect all of them to rate this movie with ten stars on IMDb.About the movie: A very thin story line, a lot of artificial dramaturgy, parallels to Tarzan and Pocahontas, sometimes extremely bad CGI, compared with sometimes average and sometimes really, really bad acting.After all I was really happy when the movie came to an end,I will definitely not watch any other parts. One more thing: Non-WOW Fanboys: Do not watch this piece of cringe-worthy piece of "art".And as a humble German: Sorry for my bad English.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a lover of the fantasy genre in general, but was disappointed by this, though not for the reasons you might think. I could never get into the game as much as others, but I still appreciate a good story, which at its core, this does have.What really turned me off this was some of the special effects, like the wizards magic, the watery blue effect looked awful and I cringed when I saw it. But what really done it was how fast it was cutting and changing location, making me realise we are never one place long enough to find out anything with much depth or heart, and this made me not care about every single character. It really didn't help that there was too much content to handle well in a two hour film, so it's not wrapped up so well, but that didn't bother me too much.Also, none of the acting was particularly good or noteworthy unfortunately.Lets hope the next is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairly bland fantasy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Thematic Spoilers below*First of all, I want to get my baggage out on the table here. I played WOW for years and it's the greatest video game ever made, bar none. In recent times I've stopped playing. The game has lost its way but given my history with the game there was no way I was going to miss this film. My girlfriend simply refused to watch it with me, so I had to sheepishly go to the cinema on my own. I could feel the judgement.Anyway, onto the film. I was never bored watching this film. I enjoyed it and think it is reasonably well made. The effects are outstanding, and it ambles along at a good pace. So why the rating of 6?Well, it's hard to really pin down what's wrong with this film. I think one of the primary problems is that one never really engages with the characters, any of them, and there are a lot. The grand thematic elements of the story that Duncan Jones had to tell aren't that great, so he had a difficult job on his hands to make this thing interesting.The great parts of this story are rooted in the characters and their relationships (forged over years in the lore of the game), so the characters had to be sculpted well, and we had to be made to love them. This is no mean feat in 2 hours. That's where the film just completely misses the mark. Through the film several main characters die, and I felt nothing on each occasion.I believe that the film just suffers from having too many characters that we barely know, whereas it should have 2 or 3 that we deeply understand, and come to love and root for. Then when they succeed or fall, we feel it.All in all, this is a decent film. WOW fans will enjoy it, but I don't think there's a huge amount there for anyone else. I really hope that the film does well enough to enable the follow up, which I hope is the story of Arthas. Sadly, I don't think that will happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilisation faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonise another. As a portal opens to connect the two worlds, one army faces destruction and the other faces extinction. From opposing sides, two heroes are set on a collision course that will decide the fate of their family, their people, and their home. Duncan Jones embraces Warcraft's world with commitment but when it comes to charging it with life, it is quite difficult. His adaptation of the online game has a sense of grandeur but also a strong fixation with CGI spectacle which makes the emotional core lifeless. Though it is clear that as a professed Warcraft fan, he clearly has put a lot of love and care into fleshing out a story. Warcraft is an expensive, high-fantasy epic reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings or Narnia. Newcomers - like myself - have a lot to get up to speed with here. As far as I understand all this, our home world is Azeroth, a Middle-Earth-like realm along the lines of Medieval Europe. The population is mostly human, mostly white, but there are also dwarfs, elves and various other mythical creatures in the fringes. There's a lot going on and yet we're never quite engaged with the storyline. In Lord of the Rings, we had the Shire, the Hobbit's idyllic pastoral realm, as an image of what everyone was fighting for. Here we barely see Azeroth, outside the Royal Castles, Wizard's towers or epic battlefields. There are much to admire in its ambitions and its design. Still, I don't know why I have this John Carter feeling about it. Like the 2012 Martian Disney flop, Warcraft is a complex, jargon-heavy, battle epic. This film occasionally manages to feel both rushed and dull, impressively staged and disengaging as well. Indeed, the heavy use of CGI and its awkward interactions with the live-action elements, distance the audience even more. Overall, this film feels incomplete and if Warcraft's fans want a sequel, every single one of the 12 million players - even their extended family and friends - is going to need to turn up to see this one, if they want this film to get past its first instalment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Severely disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected this movie to be blockbuster quality. Unfortunately it relied so much on trying to be a story of the warcraft game, that it didn't even feel like a movie. The scripts were average, the graphics although well designed were unrealistic, and the acting mediocre. Even Travis Fimmel, seemed like a less hardcore version of Ragnar Lothbrok. Definitions of words of magic were copy-pasted from in-game and the whole thing was more likely addressed to elementary school students. I wanted to see realistic sceneries, but it was like a high-res high-def quality of in-game depictions which was cartoonish at certain points. Nothing compared to LotR or even Hobbit trilogies. Maybe if I had fewer expectations, I would be less disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imbalance on several fronts, though the technical finesse and stronger characters carry "Warcraft" to the level of amicable journey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the opening scene tells the story of Orcs in grand fashion, the wait for a true great game based movie seems to be over. However, the momentum doesn't translate to the human side, which prances about from one city to the next with heavy jargon and too many pinches of random magic. The hope is not completely gone as some characters still manage to deliver good scenes when given spotlight, but majority of the movie is spent in drab narrative.The orc side is definitely better, the warring clan is immediately appreciable with incredible use of special effect marvel and simple yet effective motivation. Toby Kebbell as Durotan is a right choice for the leader role, this is a character whose charisma and personality audience would invest in the most.Human fares much worse. The focus towards complex magic is not an interesting direction, yet the movie spends nearly half of its runtime with characters babbling about prophecies and dark forces. It also, commendably, tries to give political sense to the whole thing, yet it barely establishes anything and those wanting elf or other races might have to content with much less.Travis Fimmel as Lothar does his best, and to be fair, he exhibits an enigmatic role as Ragnar from Vikings series. Lothar is another case, it's like forcing Jack Sparrow to be ordinary pirate, but Fimmel at least gives a signature poise to it. Paula Patton as the half orc Garona is perhaps the more intriguing female, she has the balance between frailty and a brave front for survival. These two carry the scenes momentarily.Fortunately, the special effect and fights are done with considerable effort, but its liberal use of blue magic is numbing. There's a few attempts for humor or fantasy troupes, and these often come across as generic or simply distracting. While the emotional weight seems sparse, the world looks dashing enough, at least for cosmetic purpose.As a portal to Azeroth, "Warcraft" is definitely flawed, although it's sufficiently presentable for a fantasy spectacle. It is, sadly, won't reach the greatness of Lord of the Rings, which it will be inevitably compared to, or the height the fans want.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality Check For Fanboys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh boy...where to begin? Well I think it's fair to say that the majority of the uninitiated to Warcraft didn't expect much from the film given mainly what we had seen in the trailers &amp; in general what kind of quality that game to film adaptations have in the past presented us with, unfortunately I have to report the despair has to go on.We're getting to the point now where we are hoping one game adaptation can prove all the critics wrong but the search still goes on, the main problem I had with it was I'm an uninitiated in respect to the game itself therefore I had no knowledge other than what's appeared in popular culture (so not a lot really for me) &amp; the film generally didn't help me out, lots of places are named, there are lots of characters to remember &amp; you've quickly got to get on board with their motivations &amp; goals &amp; the film generally didn't convey them to me well enough, I personally had a bit of a problem with the effects as well as some felt like they were merely just more polished up game cut scenes &amp; I couldn't get my mindset out of that, they didn't know the best way to present this vibrant world to us &amp; it ends up being a mishmash of neither completely convincing CGI nor top notch practical effects, also to say that the dialogue is generic would be to be kind, don't get me wrong it's not terribly written (*cough* *cough*...Jupiter Ascending) it's just that we've heard its kind before so therefore you give out unintentional groans as you hear it &amp; the worst offense a film as big as this can do to an audience is bore them &amp; I had moments where I was exactly that, this is really unfortunate for the director Duncan Jones (or is it? As he's also a credited writer) because his previous films have been greatly entertaining (Moon &amp; Source Code), certain scenes seemed weirdly edited as well, as if they suddenly remembered they were a lower certificate/rating, the film did pick up towards the final third of it &amp; the actual magic effects were pretty good.It really does sound like I thought it was an utter disaster doesn't it, but I did find humor in the film but in unintentional places (shiny eyed people anyone?) but I suppose it still makes it entertaining if for the wrong reasons, we've got to be honest though this is damn mediocre at best &amp; all the fans on here stating that it's as good as the Lord of the Rings in the fantasy stakes really do need to have a reality check &amp; I think I'll leave it there as I'm sure I'll feel their wrath, oh &amp; Hello to Jason Isaacs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another bad video game movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get right to the point. The Warcraft movie is bad. It's really bad. I wanted to like this movie but it's just not a good movie. The acting is beyond horrible. Especially the main human cast. The CG orcs act circles around the humans in this movie. The movie also does a horrible job of explaining the world to the audience. Thank God I actually know the lore of Warcraft and love the games otherwise I might have just walked out on the movie. The tone in the movie is all over the place too. On the orc side of things with Durotan it's fine but on the human side they try to insert some witty banter which just falls flat, a "romance" that is beyond forced, and finally some tragedy which they simply have not earned. The CG is really uneven. Sometimes it's damn impressive and other times it's flat out bad. All this makes for a pretty terrible movie experience. Sure, fans of Warcraft will probably enjoy it but that doesn't make Warcraft a good movie, just like Twilight fans enjoying the Twilight movies don't make those movies good movies. If you go into this movie as a Warcraft fan you'll probably enjoy yourself but if you're looking for a good fantasy movie, like Lord of The Rings, then stay far away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The feeling after watching this movie is one that you feel like you got betrayed, they screwed your dream and fantasy and memory of the game "World of Warcraft". They had a vast game universe. They had the budget. They uber failed. Better to watch instead of this movie all the intros of the game series. Also you can watch raids on YouTube or other sites for entertainment.Dialogues in the movie are crap, fighting is cheap and unrealistic also (for example you see one person standing doing nothing while the enemy is attacking him, he makes no move to defend himself!)Well one thing is for sure, you can expect Warcraft 2 the movie, maybe the second will be better than the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, I was disappointed, the movie was not what I expected. Think about it, you take a game universe spanning about 10 years and this extensive and compress it into a movie that last only 2 hours, it cannot be done. Let me just mention that i do NOT play WOW, the game never really interested me. No offense to the WOW players, but i expected more from this movie, a lot more, the anticipations to this movie were HUGE, and It did not do it.The CGI animation were spectacular, no doubt about that. The story was to incoherent, a lot of things happening, and not really a deeper understanding of what and why, it's a movie about "Orcs bad, humans Good", come on, I might as well play the Warcraft 3 game instead and get more satisfaction from that, then from this movie. This movie is just about senseless violence and Good vs Evil! I might as well read a comic book instead, and it will NOT be a WOW comic! The actors are misplaced in this movie. The actor playing Medivh is to young, I would have expected an older actor, at least an actor several decades older then Ben Foster, late 50'ties early 60'ties. Travis Fimmel seems misplaced in this movie, he doesn't have the right "spark" in this movie and he doesn't really fit in, though i will mention that Dominic Cooper and Ben Schnetzer are perfect for this movie, they both do a hell of a job and Schnetzer has a lot of presence in the movie. Ben Schnetzer's age is perfect in the movie, a kinda "Newbie" in the magic world, not to young, not to old.No doubt that there will be a sequel. whether it will be better or worse then this movie, only time will tell. I just wasted 2 hours of my life on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft, The Beginning: "You Have No Honour!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 6.7, OK Movie*Before the review I would like to point out I have never played the game World Of Warcraft, but I do play Hearthstone, regardless I shall judge the movie as the film alone.*Duncan Jone's Warcraft was announced in 2006 and was considered to be the most anticipated movie based off a video game, unfortunately it has followed the trend of video game movies. The journey though Warcraft feels like a rushed, character driven origin story filled with a large quantity of decent CGI. It had the potential to be the future of the fantasy genre, but ultimately fell into failure due to a lack of emotion and purpose.*Characters - Humans/Alliance:The human characters are rather boring and at time emotionless.- Anduin: Travis Fimmel tries to be the movies protagonist, but his dialog and behaviour are no equal to his strength in battle. His griffin on the other hand was awesome.- Medivh: Confusing and boring mage for an awesome title of the Guardian...- King Wrynn: Charming boy Dominic Cooper was a decent alliance king, however like most of his fellow characters, he lacks empathy.- Khadger: Simply put, a stupid, wizard wanna be who gives us a light show, whoa...- Garona: A decent hybrid of a character with interesting origins followed by a poor performance by Paula Patton.*Characters - Orcs/Horde: The orcs are no doubt the greatest characters in Warcraft. There motion capture design and interesting characters lift the movies down falls. They are truly awesome!- Durotan: Toby Kebbel plays an awesome Durotan as well as his Koba in Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes (8.7). He gave the audience a new perception of the Orcs and is the heart of the story, as he establishes that in "darkness there is light." His death however was too quick, damn it!- Gul'dan: Daniel Wu's Gul'dan is indeed a horrific antagonist with an equally horrific design. He summons an awesome fight between himself and Durotan, the highlight of the movie.- Blackhand: A predictable brute of a character who makes the action worth watching and provides us with a satisfying but unique death.- Orgrim: An interesting orc torn between two races and one world, unfortunately his actions lead to deadly consequences.- Drakka: Tough Mum...*Plot &amp; Design: The movies plot has a simple and focused story line however is does become foggy due to complicated characters. The dialog in this feature is also disappointing and rather cliché when surrounded by such a colourful world. Jones has advanced to fast in the tales of Warcraft just to jump in the action. The first two fight scenes are entertaining however the final act feels emotionless and just a boring animation with no soul or lust in the conflict.*Its a movie for the fans and players, so let them enjoy it. I myself was inspired by the movie in a way, to play Hearthstone... Overall its a very average and bland start to a Warcraft series but i do feel that Blizzard Entertainment will provide a more thrilling sequel where they can fix their mistakes in the World Of Warcraft.Please check out my lists and ratings at riyork2! I hope this review was a valuable source. For the Horde!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie so much. So, the thing is that this movie is not really Warcraft-virgins-friendly. You need to know at least a bit of the story. If you have read the books "Day of the Dragon", "Lord of the Clans" and "The Last Guardian" you know that the film is changing the story a bit to make it a little more understandable for the audience not really into the lore. You can kinda see that the creators are trying to put three books of lore in 2 hours, but they are doing it well. And overall the movie is great, the story is not changed as much as to make no sense, and the CGI and whole look of the film is EPIC. (BTW i put a spoiler warning just because I thought the books will give up the story)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rushed and Messy Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film adaptations of video games have, up to this point, been bad but there was hope for the gamer community that Warcraft could break through, but it was, in my opinion a disappointment. The potential impact of this film was obvious, gamers who are hungry for high quality film adaptations of their favorite games, are still waiting for a film to prove that it can be done. Warcraft is clichéd, poorly written, and not as entertaining or deep as it could and therefore should have been. I don't want people thinking I hated this movie, because it did some things well and plenty of people have said they enjoyed it, I simply didn't.The most painful thing about the movie was that it had a lot of good aspects, but as a whole the film felt a little weak. One major problem I had with this film was that it reminded me too much of Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit. Regardless of the agitation that statement will incur out of die hard fans, one prime example is the main antagonist of the film, the orcs, ride around on giant evil looking wolves, just like in Lord of the Rings. Above that the film as a whole looked too digitized, where in certain scenes, everything in the scene looked digitally created.The movie was directed by the immensely talented Duncan Jones, and to be honest the world he creates, is very intriguing. However, the script was a major weakness of this film, because inside this film is a cool story worth telling but it was overcrowded with weak characters and muddled storytelling. The film leaps around so much, trying very hard to tell a dense story, that it becomes very hard to follow, and almost impossible to care about any characters. From a technical standpoint it jumps around so much, that at times the film disregards explanation.The weak story, and rushed pacing make the film feel overcrowded, and hard to really enjoy. While some of the characters had very cool development, many of them flash through for momentary exposition and then disappear for 20 minutes. The orc villain is admittedly cool to look at, albeit a little one dimensional, but the overall evil force in the film is essentially an unexplained force. The film really never feels like it entertains or challenges like Jones' other films (Moon and The Source Code), it just trudges forward.It isn't a terrible film, and I'm guessing many will enjoy this film, if for no other reason than that it is a good 2 hour escape from reality. That being said for those who are looking for a entertaining, witty, original film this just isn't really that, as it never allows itself to delve deeply into any scene. The film features a great amount of potential, which only serves to make the muddled end result even more depressing, as the film clearly could have been better. All-in- all I think kids will like this film, but for those who want a great film, this just isn't quite that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honest opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, let's make one thing clear: I am a massive Warcraft fan. From the games to the lore, I've loved it from the beginning up until now, played all the games, read all the books. But after watching the film last night, I can't help but feel disappointed.Let's start with the cons, the movie was just way too fast paced, especially at the start. On moment we're here, 30 seconds later we've flown a gryphon and now we're over here. It's hard to keep up if you aren't familiar with the game locations, and so whilst watching I felt frustrated at the fact that the film was basically just fan servicing fans of the game, and to move the plot along in it's 2 hour span, use cringe-worthy dialogue to keep it going. That being said, visually, it is amazing. The emotion captured with the cgi orcs was impressive, and the fight scenes were intense as I had hoped. I was still disappointed with the quality of the script and screenplay, but since the director's cut is 40 mins longer (hopefully this will get released on bluray) perhaps the extra scenes will add meat to the incredibly fast paced spectacle..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as the plot goes, it wasn't the same plot as in the game. It was supposed to be Warlords of Draenor, not the original Warcraft. Too many Illuminati and evil Freemason symbols in the movie, aren't hard to notice.Warlordsof Draenor was 'interesting', to me but not worthy of a movie. If you want to make a good movie, they need to do Grand Theft Auto. I haven't played this game in a year, it's going down the tubes. The 'Legion' game that will be soon released will not be played by me until I hear people saying they really like it. An Orc being friends with a Human? Wouldn't happen on my server. And where were the Gnomes? I play a pink haired midget Gnome called Kickhere. They had Blood elves, but in the real game, those are Gay guys. Totally overrated review. Blizz needs to stop making movies, and try harder on making a better game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan and I know the lore. I have read the books, play the game, and even I, was totally lost in what they were trying to wrap up in this mess. The first hours and half is cut by multiple 12-20 seconds scene in which they introduce a new character, a new concept without explained it. It is fan service really badly made. They should have told this story from one perspective instead of constantly switching side. I know what they were trying to do, but somewhere in the process, someone should have put his foot down and said : 'this doesn't work, we should focus'... because that what is missing the most in the movie : FOCUS. I was with 3 friends and 2 of them didn't played the game. I had to told the story and explained to them what was happening in each scene. And sometimes I didn't have the answer.Save your money and wait for the DVD release. If the do sequel, i really hope they get some lessons from this one : DO NOT TRY TO PLEASE EVERYONE, you ended with total mess. I get it, they are horde AND alliance player in your game, but for a movie, this doesn't work. Not like that. Good try but no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never really played the game, but I bet the ones who did play the game are gonna find this good, probably gonna give this ten stars. The problem with this is that it never makes an attempt to be interesting, most of the human characters are so bland, like Travis Fimmel who looks like Paul Rudd, he is just one facial experience through out, looks like he just recovered from a hangover. Ben Foster does okay, he looks like a young Gandalf from Lord of The Rings.The two actors I really got infested into was Toby Kebbell who plays a good CGI Orc, and Paula Patton who plays a half human/half Orc, I really wanted to see more to her character. The CGI where pretty descent, but the fight scenes could have been better, they end before they ever really start. Dominic Cooper is alright has the king. If there is gonna a sequel, I must say I ain't really looking forward to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a hardcore Warcraft fan, my first RTS game was in fact Warcraft Orcs and Humans that i bought in my first visit to the US in 1998, followed by Warcraft 2 and all the other Warcraft games (including World of Warcraft), so this review is coming from someone who knows and appreciates the Warcraft world and lore.Now, i am not going to spoil anything nor am i going to bash the movie for going with something new (outside of the original lore, something you can see just by watching the trailers) i am going to speak of what i felt and experienced while watching the movie yesterday.The CGI and the effects were the pinnacle of the movie, never has magic been so well executed on screen, it was fantastic and at the same time not unrealistic at the point you could not accept its existence. The Orcs were very well done (except for Durotan, in my opinion, who was "humanized" too much) and you could actually believe they could be in the same frame as human actors.Unfortunately, taking aside what i just said in this review, the rest of the movie is very disappointing to say the least. The story goes so fast that it created a long list of cons. The first one is that i could not feel immersed in the movie, it felt that everything was going so fast with the plot that i never felt like i was captivated by it, everything felt so forced because it had to happen so fast. You know you are not immersed in a movie when you are aware and concerned while watching it of how late it is or how long has it been going for. Like for an instance, in the latest Captain America movie i was so connected to what was going on screen that i disconnected myself from reality during that time, i did not care how late it was or the time i would get home, all i cared about was the movie. The Warcraft movie never had that effect on me.Another flaw caused by how fast they advance the plot is that i could not feel connected or found myself caring about the characters. Their dilemmas, their problems, their hopes, their victories, it meant nothing to me. The characters have little to no background and become like fictional distant people who you can't care enough about what happens to them. Like when Gandalf falls in Moria at the first LOTR movie, i actually felt sorry for him and his friends, when Aragorn picked them up and the sadness was palpable. In Warcraft i couldn't care less about who lives or dies, you just don't get to know the characters well enough to care for them.Last but not least, i found the acting on some characters to be very poorly executed. For an instance, the Lothar character, i felt like i was watching Ragnar Lodbrok if he had been born in Azeroth. The actor acted exactly like he does on vikings and i, personally, don't feel that Lothar and Ragnar have the same type of character or act the same way. The other characters felt like they were gray, they had little to no personality. The ones that escape from that are Khadgar, Durotan, Draka, Gul'dan, Ogrim and Blackhand. The rest of the characters (and there are a lot of them, believe me), are all sub par, with mediocre acting at best.In conclusion, the movie have awesome CGI and it does a great job translating the magic and fantasy from the game to the screen but it does a terrible and awful job in telling the story, you feel like they did a 2 hour film containing 8 hours worth of information, like you are watching a movie been played with fast forward, with no room for character or plot development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good animation and sound, but as a movie very bad. Cinematics from the games cut together are better than this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame I can't give less than 1 star. I played every Warcraft title I like the overall story... but this movie, it sucks. Big time. It's more like a somewhat better cinematic from WoW (as such it would get 8,5/10). Sound is great, animations are not bad but everything a movie needs (A Storyline that grabs and holds my attention, good character development, believable characters, ...) is not in it. The movie has so many flaws I can't even keep track of them. Sure there are some moments where you might smile, but those moments are not worth the money. Hollywood and some Game Studios need to learn that looks are not everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zero 'craft'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the movie was (rambling) on, it seemed quite alright, though I would not say enjoyable. Effects seemed decent, acting seemed alright etc. 3D was also decently rendered, for most of the time. 1/2 characters were decent. Not their characterizations, though. Liked the aspect where the makers expected us to fill in the characters' backstories by diving right in. That showed some promise, that was not followed thru, ultimately.Overall, a mainstream/commercial Hollywood movie, for mass audiences only. Feel free to leave your brains home. Surprising, considering they got Duncan Jones to helm it. Michael Bay does action better, and hell, even the much-reviled Antoine Fuqua swords/sandals adaptation of 'King Arthur' did not suck this bad. 'Troy' and 'Kingdom of heaven' could also have been used as decent templates (not going near the fantastic 'Gladiator' for now, just citing lesser works, in the opinion of mass audiences, by virtue of their BO collections and reviews).But, imho, it also has quite a few flaws (to me, these flaws outweighed all the salient attributes the movie possesses):1. Very simplistic story. Players of the game might be disappointed (I did not play - friends used to). No 'craft'. Very little war. Even the 1-1 fight sequences, save a few moments, are completely disappointing. 2. Lord of the rings (3 movies, not including the 3 inferior 'Hobbit' spin- offs) should have taught this filmmaker few things. Nope. They did not. Happy Potter movies had better action/adventure sequences.3. Good actors like Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Ruth Negga, Toby Kebbell and Paula Patton have been wasted on lesser roles (to be fair, Patton's character seemed to have more layers than the rest). Travis 'Vikings' Kimmel, in almost an intro of sorts, acquitted himself well, but has a thankless 1-note character to play, almost like a Rajnikant-type, and could have been used for comedic effect a little more than they tried using him to achieve the same effect. 4. No soul in many departments of the filmmaking 'craft'. Editing, especially. Transitions are too abrupt, and action sequences seem to have been chopped off, resulting in continuity glitches, that, to be fair, an average commercial moviewatcher might not notice immediately. Makes similar glitches in Batman V Superman seem tame in comparison. 5. Blatant cash-grab for the sequels. Good movies are those which place the cliffhanger in their 2nd sequel, not the introductory movie itself. This one might have needed a screenplay re-write before finding its way to the screen, something that did not happen, imho, regrettably at that. Plus, there were 2 faux climaxes in spite of the sequelizing going on blatantly. That also seemed sad, and a result of bad writing. Duncan Jones has made better movies - 'Moon', and 'Source code'. Both of those were smaller in scale. Is this an indicator that he should go back to directing smaller movies? But Colin 'Safety not guaranteed' Trevorrow made 'Jurassic World', which was pretty OK, by any standards (and is gonna direct Episode IX of another 'small' franchise). What about Gareth 'Monster' Edwards going on to direct the decent 'Godzilla', which was also pretty decent?I regret watching this one, but cannot call it horribly bad either. Let down by Jones, and even Foster, who sometimes has the capability to elevate even the most mundane of characters - guess this one was only for the paycheck. Slumming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing but not awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warcraft had me hoping it would be the video game movie that would finally be decent if not great. Sadly this film left me more mixed then anything other film this year. Firstly to list the positives I can say this is a faithful adaptation of World of Warcraft so fans will find something to enjoy. The game has very much been brought to life with some impressive CGI work. Also i found some of the characters enjoyable albeit hardly too memorable Toby Kebbell's orc character in particular I very much enjoyed and for me was the highlight. The same however cannot be said for Travis Fimmel's human lead. I'm a fan of Fimmel's work in the show Vikings but here his character is uninteresting and Fimmel does a poor job making us care for him or sympathize for his plight. As I found out he himself didn't even know what World of Warcraft was before being cast and as his first blockbuster leading role maybe he was simply out of his element. The film's effects are commendable and sometimes breathtaking and the visuals were very appealing. I also want to praise this movie for not relying on senseless action and instead relied on its characters which is something video game movies have almost always failed on before. However I have several issues with the film. The first act was frankly a mess as I felt like I had somehow missed an hour of the film and was being dropped into it halfway. Places and characters fly past with no explanation and the story, while coherent enough, wasn't gripping in the least. It wasn't until the first human v orc fight I began to have fun with the movie and made myself more comfortable in getting to know these characters as the film began to slow down and let me absorb what was happening. For the majority of the film I was having fun but then I realized that this was simply setting up the first part in what I presume to be a series and so the film had zero closure leaving me more embittered by the end. Of course other fantasy films had done this in the past such as Lord of the Rings but unlike those films Warcraft gives us nothing to think on until the next film and with no characters to really care about there is little reason for me to get excited about the future of this series. Warcraft's sequel has the potential to be far better as Im now familiar with the world and characters but I seriously doubt this is a movie that will be revisited in the years to come. While this is a superior video game film it is sadly an average fantasy adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another disposable product</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHAT IS GOODThank You Blizzard for showing how Orks and Dwarfs should be done in the movie. Finally!!! Orcs are huge, much bigger then humans. Orcs can lift 500kg with ease. Seeing an orc throwing a horse was a brilliant detail. Dwarfs are almost as strong as Orcs are, with huge shoulders and arms. It was ridiculous (and offensive) to see Orcs and Dwarfs in Peter Jackson movies, but Blizzard nail it. I enjoyed watching every second of the movie with Orks and Dwarfs.It's great to see they didn't forget this movie should be fun to watch, so they add a dose of humor in it. Polymorph someone to sheep was a brilliant detail.Durotan is the most impressive digital character in movie history so far. His character is well built through the story, his acting is sincere, CGI is great, without uncanny valley effect. It looks more real and act more convincing than real actors.To make it short: ? and the Oscar for best VFX goes to Warcraft.WHAT IS BADThis movie was made as a disposable product. Main aim of the movie was to grab public attention and setup new movie franchise and all other isn't so important. I really hate to see somebody spends great time doing something disposable. It could be a great movie and still reach movie commercial goals. The main quality of some feature movie are characters. Audience should be interested for the story, should care for characters. Main concern for director should be to make characters convincing, to focus on this goal all cinematic tools (picture, motion, sound, story). Characters should build the story, not vice versa. With exception of Durotan, main characters aren't very good. This could be achieved with short extensions of main story, like in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012), which I really missed in Warcraft. I really missed situations in which all the main characters would show their true character and motivations.Two characters were ridiculously poorly thought out - King Llane and Kahdgar. During their performance I felt like watching a kindergarten school play. King Llane character setup and his sacrifice should be prepared through the movie. The war is horrible event. It's hard to put your life at risk and go to battle. And it's almost impossible to sacrifice yourself. Especially when you are the king and have all the army to die before you do. There aren't any real motivation behind this character.Kahdgar should be a talented wizard, a great hope for mankind. But this character setup and acting is also poorly performed. Blizzard have so many talented young people, they just needed to look around and see how this character should be built: highly competitive, passionate, reckless, hungry for opportunity to show how good he is. He should be a guy with great skills but without experience, with ideas which put him in situations over his head.Blizzard came this far as a company by making top products, so I'm hopping they can do the better job in the next movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warcraft is probably one of the most well know game of all time and one that actually has a huge influence on gaming community to date, with that in mind there's no doubt that this is the movie that fans has been waiting to see for years and years and one that hopefully will break the curse of "movie based from video games are bad" .first off, i want to clarify things and talk about the real quality of the movie without that gaming fan (which i am) in mind, Warcraft is not a bad movie but it is no doubt has a lot and lot of trouble especially with it's scale, Warcraft is a HUGE game there's tons and tons of things to talk about but this is not a game it's a movie which mean you have a limited amount of time to tell story and get things right with precision.Unfortunately Warcraft just want to do too much stuff without thinking how much resource they have and that makes everything feels rush because they want to fill as many characters as possible while progressing the story and with out real time to just sit and talk about background of all these characters it's just a mess, in the end i feel disconnect from the character and the story itself which is the worst thing you can possibly do.With that reason i can see why a lot of critics and audience who don't know about the game and didn't care about the game didn't like Warcraft because honestly it's just a mess and lots of things go wrong, i don't want to pinpoint the main reason here but maybe this Huge scale of movie (like lord of the rings scale) didn't fit with director Duncan Jones who did a amazing job at Moon (2009) and Source Code (2011) but the scale of these 3 movie is just too much to handle.Now for the gamer and fans point of view Warcraft is actually a pretty good experience just seeing your favorite characters, world or story in the movie makes you want to shed a tear or something it's just so beautiful and with fans that already know a lot of backstory of these characters these story they will have no problem understand what's going on in the movie at all which is something that a lot of people will have a problem with.In the end Warcraft is probably a middle-ground movie it's not a bad one but it's not good either it's a movie that depends a lot on your knowledge your nostalgia your love a lot to understand or even like it, gamer and fans will probably love the movie while others will scratching their head and wonder what's going on in the movie, i can't denied that Warcraft has a lot of miss-step even i'm a fans of the franchise but i still want to see it more, so if you're a fans you should watch it support the movie, if you're not a fan then maybe give it a try but keep in mind that you should not expect much from it.</fullReview>

I guess there are a lot of hard core WOW fanboys in China. Lucky for the backers of this movie as it is bombing here in the states. Summing up, Warcraft is a really poorly made boring video game movie that is on par with Street Fighter and Super Mario Bros.

It ping pongs between cities and races with 10-20 second "cut scenes" that leave you puzzled what you just saw. I wanted to leave 15 minutes in but I lasted 30-40 minutes before I left the theater. Every minute was pure torture. Apparently this appeals to some group of people but I'm at a completely loss as to how or why.If you watched this movie with someone who said they loved it you might want to reconsider your relationship with them.

Apparently Cooper wasn't sure if he had to play a king or a very bored weather forecast, while Schnetzer seemed to be simply not able to bring any depth into his acting.

		<fullReview>I have seen those euphemistic reviews about the movie on IMDb. And I have seen the ones from the "official" critics. I have one answer. Both are crap, no matter what side they are on. Either they are just blind and follow or adore the movie because their standards were set by the last Dragon Ball movie, or they just simply don't know nothing about Warcraft, the games and its lore and therefor can not keep up with its pace. If you don't like to read through all the trivial stuff, jump to the end and see my rating. That brings me to Duncan Jones and Blizzard. What were you thinking by changing major parts of the lore and cutting out 40 minutes? NOW you are telling us, that we will see the rest ONLY if the movie will be a success? Seems, the movie isn't selling as expected? Or are you just greedy like Activision? I would tell you why if IMDb would have a 1000 word cap...... I already had a 4 pages long essay about this movie. No biased, generalized or vague statements that you see on the net. No stupid meta-tomatoes or wannabe newspaper-critics. And CERTAINLY no fanboy crap, as seen everywhere on Youtube. I have even read the book to the movie (Warcraft: The Official Movie Novelization) which is even better then the movie itself. Far from good but better than the movie.So in total:No genuine Warcraft score -&gt; 6/10 No genuine characters -&gt; 6/10 (You know you messed up when the characters in your game trailers are more remember-able then the ones in the movie) Convincing CGI but missing the Wacraft touch -&gt; 7/10 (You should have made a pure CGI movie, Blizzard. Like the trailers. I would have payed double the cinema entrance fee to see it. I bet that even your trailers have more view-counts than your movie will have.) Too much drama and love story / Too fast story telling yet to boring conversations / often stupid dialog -&gt; 4/10Too quick cuts -&gt; 3 /10 (the eye cannot focus on anything during the action and enjoy what has cost so much money and effort to make by the 3D animators) 40 min (!) extended edition -&gt; 1/10 Go to hell, who ever approved of that idea. Warcraft: The Movie exists 10/10 (We were all desperately waiting for it for years) Final rating 5/ 10</fullReview>

And it has some incredible story twists too, like that more then "friend" love between two orc brothers (so if you kinda int such a thing between boys, or you like Warcraft online, you should go there with your partner). I really suggest you to go to theater and watch it. So even extra species relations also included, so not for children. Also like it very much as its now my favorite film of all times, it also looks great on wide screen. So my verdict it is 10 out of 10, you really should go to the theater and watch the movie and how orcs really treats their gryphons at their spare time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good visuals but stunningly bad screenplay and amateur acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in with zero expectations, knowing that most game-inspired movies do poorly, but still had hope since it's Blizzard after all - and they're known for some pretty decent, large games - they wouldn't entrust their brand to some amateur.And that's exactly what they've done. The screenplay is painfully bad: I'm imagining a bunch of guys sitting in a meeting room, brainstorming, and then shouting out random ideas and cliché phrases, and then compiling them haphazardly into an incoherent screenplay.The voice acting, I thought, was pretty well done for the most part. This went well with the pretty good CGI. The CGI was probably the best part of this movie. It didn't try to be too realistic and managed to preserve the "game" feel still melding the Warcraft world with the real world.The acting by the human characters was horrible. This mixed with the terrible screenplay and the movie was utterly painful to watch. Some of the acting was alright (think minor characters in Game of Thrones), but the rest was face-palm inducing.The overall idea and story is good, however. That's why I think this movie had so much potential, but sadly, all wasted due to crappy dialogue and crappy acting.There are hints of a sequel. If they do decide to make a sequel, they should fire the director, the screenwriter, and specially Ben Schnetzer who plays one of the main protagonists. His acting was atrocious. Even a total amateur could've done a better job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you true fan of the Warcraft games then most likely you will enjoy this movie. If you are not familiar with it, you are more likely to notice bad acting and non-logical script.CGI in the movie is amazing.Overall story is also interesting but since makers believed it was a first movie in the series, there is no ending in the movie. Only acting in the movie is done by fully animated creatures. Actors look like they could care less about movie. There are few heartbreaking scenes, but no emotion on actors faces, which totally ruins the moment. It can be a great movie for everyone if there was an actual ending and at least one professional actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warcraft on the big screen is a mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Warcraft fan. I've played every single Warcraft game except Warcraft 1.Warcraft's world is filled with magic, wars and super hero-like characters. The movie tries to adapt a big, convoluted story with ~10 main characters in movie with a run time of 2 hours. Clunky writing, bad pacing and no deep story lines makes Warcraft look more like Dungeons and Dragons than Lord of the Rings.The movie is pretty (granted, I watched it in 3D so my perception might be off), the orcs look great and so does the magic. One of the main developers of Warcraft once said that the "world" of Warcraft, is its strongest asset, so one big question is why they never explored it more. The movie overall takes place on a battlefield, in a city and a tower, with no hints of how big the world is, what other exotic races and beasts there are, what the humans and orcs traditions are like or how they generally live. Backstory to the two races and their kingdoms would've really helped.The biggest problem of the movie, is that it tries to make you care for a vast number of characters under such a short run time. Cutting the characters in half would've made the movie a good (or great) one, instead of a mediocre one. The viewer only gets to know one or two, the rest are very forgettable with no deep story lines attached to them. The problem with this is that the movie thinks you do care about the whole cast, so moments that could've been very emotional falls extremely flat.If the movie focused more on maybe 4 characters instead of 10, it would've worked a lot better and its my main gripe with the movie. None of the characters are fleshed out enough but it still plays on the fact that maybe you care about them, which you don't.Compare it to LoTR, the first movie really only focuses on Frodo, Sam and Gandalf, and somewhat Aragorn. It fleshes out 3 characters really well and when the events on the bridge of Khazad-D?m happens, you really feel for them - you might've even cried. Replace Gandalf with someones less fleshed out, maybe Galadriel. If she died on the Bridge, would anyone even care?In Warcraft, every single character is Galadriel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very possible the worst movie I have ever seen, including any Adam Sandler movie produced. First of all, the acting is atrocious. The magician has a mustache which wouldn't even make a 12 year old jealous and is as convincing as Kim Kardashian is a natural beauty. The main actor, who's best performance is being able to pull of looking like Leonardo DiCabrio in the Revenant, talks in an accent which makes my ears bleed. And any attempt of including romance is simply tragically funny. More CGI is used than in all Michael Bay movies combined, with the added eye sore of not even attempting to conceal the excessive use of green screens. Talking about green, one can clearly see that the make up of the half-Orc is removed steadily by her own sweating. Most likely because the actress is increasingly anxious that her future acting career will be pivotally affected by her abysmal performance in this movie. The plot is more confusing than quantum theory. I played the game for a while as well as a friend of mine. Both of us lost track of what was going on within 10 minutes. I guess when creatures start randomly hitting/stabbing/spell-casting each other without any apparent reason the only explanation can be found in the title: "WARCRAFT!". All in all, pretty unbelievable that post production didn't decide to destroy all evidence of this movie ever being made in order to save their own careers as well as those of the rest of the cast.</fullReview>

But please, next time cut the cheese, fast clips between scenes, and let blizzard do 100% animation instead. They haven't faild before, just now they took a turn to the worse.Conclusion:If you are narrow minded and a warcraft fan to the bones: SEE IT! WONT LET YOU DOWN!

		<fullReview>I really like Duncan Jones. I think he is a talented Director and Moon is one of my favorite Movies. I never played the World of Warcraft Games and I only went to see this movie because Duncan Jones directed it. I had hopes for it but in the end I was a bit disappointed. It is certainly not a bad movie. I think it is one of the best Video Game movies, which is obviously not saying much but you can really see that there was passion behind this project.Duncan Jones played World of Warcraft and a lot of the Actors and a lot of the Actors did to and you really can feel that this isn't a Uwe Boll movie or something. The acting was OK i guess nothing groundbreaking but it wasn't awful. The visuals weren't bad either although it was a little bit too much CGI. What I also like is that it was easy to understand and you didn't have to play the games to be able to follow the Story. My complaints with the movie are the Characters and the story. The Characters weren't that bad, but at no point in the movie did i really care for them and i didn't feel any emotions when some of them died. The Story was predictable and also at times not progressing so that I got a little bit bored. Also sometimes there was too much going on and it couldn't focus that well. All in all the movie isn't bad but it isn't good either. I think Fans of the Game will be able to enjoy it. I'm looking forward to Duncan's next movie and if you haven't seen Moon watch it is great.5.5/10</fullReview>

Much due too several "Easter eggs" and his background knowledge about places, weapons and magic. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of the fantasy genre, but this film did not convince me. The biggest issue for me was the basic story telling buildup, to many locations changes, to much magic and poor character performances. The best actors where the orcs. The main character is "Ragnar Lothbrok" from the "Vikings" series. He is playing the same character in this movie. just like Steven Seagal (who play the same role in all his films) The guess the current rating 8,2/10 is gonna drop. B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, so I'm a big fan of the Warcraft universe and it's rich lore. I immensely enjoyed the olden times before the story line was crapped on with silly plots like time travel etc. Even so, I have to admit that this is simply not a good movie. The fault lies mainly in the fact that this is a story written for video games like Starcraft, Warcraft 3 etc. It's structure is based on you experiencing most of the story through the narrative and the eyes of it's many heroes, that you also get to control from time to time. You invest a big amount of time and effort in helping them and assuring their safety, only to watch them being torn away or having to make huge sacrifices for the greater good. This works in games and also in books because you spend such a long time alongside them and part-take in their personal development. In the film they pop up, you see them for a relatively short amount of time and you really don't care too much about them. There are also too many of them. The movie bases almost entirely on the relationships people built to the characters in previous times. The fact that the story is the main protagonist and not really any of the characters on their own, also contributes to the failing of the Warcraft universe on the big screen. I fear this might have halted the performance of the actors, which was quite varying to say the least. I was also really puzzled by how easily some characters put their thrust in others without having any reasons for doing so. This is the fallacy of WoW, where the players gain trust quite easily from characters because it's how it needs to be to have progression contents. It doesn't work in a film. Even so I will admit that I enjoyed myself a lot of the time, getting to see many of the zones I've spend countless hours traveling and exploring. There are so many nods to the vanilla and TBC-times in WoW that people will be constantly giggling in their seats. The timing of this movie is perfect as WoW is seeing a steep decline in subscribers lately. The fact that it has a built-in audience of +-100 million people will surely help the franchise keep afloat for a while longer. There's also some elements of WoD in it, almost like they made the expansion to cater to the updated script of the film. Sadly this also gives a sour feeling that a lot of the development effort was put into the movie rather than the game, where it was badly needed. There are also more than enough nods towards the new Legion-expansion expected later this year. This will surely help Renew the passion for the Warcraft universe for at least a few months more.Should I watch this film if I enjoyed the Warcraft games? Most probably, even if it'll feel somewhat shallow at times.Should I watch this film if I didn't? No, this is pure fan-service.Will Warcraft make loads of $$$ even if it's not that good a movie? Yes. It'll probably be among the highest grossing movies with such a bad script.</fullReview>

Big name companies have been caught red handed for paying employees/customers for writing great reviews and have been fined for doing so (Google it).

		<fullReview>Don't take my review as a reason not to go see it honestly. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because while the movie itself is lacking the visuals are indeed incredible in my opinion.I gave it such a low rating because it's like playing Warlords of Draenor all over again, the hype far surpassed my expectations of what I would be receiving. In any case my biggest concerns for this movie were that it was extremely clunky, it's like the story couldn't follow a line and you jumped all over the place giving it a very...empty feeling. It's not to be said either that Blizzard can't tell a fascinating story. For any of you Blizzard fans who haven't check out the short series they've done for Overwatch characters, a stunning example of their capabilities in just a few 5-10min clips.I feel like most people are simply rating this high because they were simply impressed by the graphics and ignored all the other lacking features, because the battle scenes I have to admit were nice to watch. However I believe the biggest reason this is rated so high is because they've never actually played a game/know the lore.TL:DR If you've played the games at all, I feel you'll most likely be disappointed more than someone who's never played anything who would most likely give this 8-10stars. I did cry at the end though, not because of the movie for the fact I had to pay 60$ for me and my girl to go see it in I-max with snacks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Duncan Jones is best known for the films Moon and Source Code. Two very successful films! However, the director of Warcraft has acquired a lot larger project. It is a film adaptation of a very successful and well-known game. If this works out well, then we can assume that this man will work on more larger projects. I myself have never played the game so I won't compare this movie with the game. I consider this film as a film that brings a new fantasy story, a genre that is quite interesting because of the many things you can do with it.Warcraft is set in a fantasy world in which man is threatened by Orcs. We know them already from for example the Lord of the Rings. The orcs' world is dying so they need to find a new world. The world where the people live. These two worlds are connected to each other by a portal, and this is how the orcs try to take over the world of the people.A fantasy film is a good film when the story draws in the world in, you can empathize with the characters and you get to see lots of novelties. Unfortunately, this film has too little of these elements. The story is pretty standard; good vs evil, so there must be something extra to make it interesting. The characters unfortunately aren't. This is mainly due to the actors and the frequent (say almost full-time) use of a green screen. The effects look way too inadequate to take you into this world. The orcs look very unrealistic, because it is all generated by computer. The humans are played by real actors, but aren't convincing. The acting is very moderate. Therefor it was impossible for me to be sucked into this world. So much money was involved, but we don't see it on the screen. It looks close to awful at most.Love is blind, they say sometimes. I therefore believe that only the true fans of the game can enjoy this film. They will probably take the shortcomings for granted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subpar Action and Convoluted Narrative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not difficult to guess where the tension and dramatic build up are going in WARCRAFT: The New Beginning, the big screen adaptation of the global RPG hit, World of Warcraft. There is an incredible display of flair and build up in the early minutes, all pointing to a riveting dramatic heft that the rest of this another attempt to transpire a phenomenal video game into a massive box office franchise, seemingly tries to unload. And it does hit that point, but it crumbles right away as it gives way to numerous subplots it doesn't seem able to fully get across. Much of this film is funny when it tries to be serious, and it is too serious (and dark) most of the time, but ends up being funny, anyway. But this isn't the fun that even most game fanatics would probably root for. At its helm, director Duncan Jones tries to juggle all the worlds and realms, all their mythical creatures, and their substories, together. There is a readily perceived effort to get to narrative and visual success, but the victory can't be claimed by both. Even where its better, the glory can only be half- baked at best, and it deteriorates toward the rest of this ambitious saga, as it aspires for reaches it doesn't seem capable to make. The ensuing result plummets past mediocrity.Much of this film follows the epic battle between the defensive human race and an invasive other- worldly Orc species. When Draenor reaches a brink of collapse, its Orc inhabitors must flee the planet and search for a new home in another. A portal connecting to the Earth- like Azeroth is opened, and begins a brutal battle between the two races. But a spark of hope emerges from both sides when Durotan (Toby Kebell), an orc soldier, questions the savage measures of his clansmen, and insists that a peaceful mediation must be pursued, a campaign which human knight, Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) also proposes to his king and queen. But this motion could might as well trigger an in-house hostility within both sides, and the resulting chaos may be even more disastrous than both races can ever foresee.If its visual grandeur could compensate for its narrative shortcomings, this oncsreen attempt might have actually delivered an at least tolerable presentation. Much of this technical prestige comes in excess, but often still unable to blend with the tension of the sequences it is meant to enforce. A sizable chunk of this failure also emanates from its utter inability to efficiently utilize its characters, whose being overly underwritten, makes rooting for them extremely hard for the audience. This mistake plagues some of the central characters like Ben Foster's Medivh and Paula Datton's Ditto Garona, whose either boring demeanor or laughable appearance can make them struggle for chuckle or affection. Where it stands, it's not hard to see how earnest Warcraft's motivations are. The narrative itself holds some sentimental weight, but unless they're not employed at right places, any attempt to go a step higher could only ensue a staggering fall. There are some hints of genuine efforts to this, most of which, heartfelt, but ones horrendously not enough to compete with the film's aesthetic ambitions. There is a screaming hint of sequel that protrudes out of this convoluted complexity, but we might be wishing for the enmity between the two factions to immediately cease, before that said follow-up gets realized.</fullReview>

I don't know if it will, but the film is mediocre at best. The effects are top notch, but that's about all that's top notch in this film filled with clichés and fantasy tropes. The action sequences are meh, the acting is bland and the music is generic. The plot for this film is supposed to be based in Warcraft, but they've changed much of the story to fit what they'd prefer to do(or make things look cooler). That's usually mistake #1 in these processes, but I'll go ahead and blame those thought Warcraft should be made into a film in the first place. The lore itself was always extremely hack and essentially stolen from other sources(with a few twists so they didn't get sued). Then you add in the people that they cast so they could spend on CGI and it was a recipe for disaster from the start. What Blizzard should have done is made straight to Netflix CGI movies using high quality VO talent. Instead they made a mediocre fantasy movie that never really works.Only see this movie if you absolutely have to have a fantasy fix that week and haven't seen any good fantasy movies... ever.</fullReview>
