		<shortDescription>A fascinating look at Philippe Petit's dream and a beautiful tribute to the Twin Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Zemeckis continue's to be of the best director's in Hollywood. He has made a beautiful movie and even though you know what happens, he keeps you gripping your armrests and holding your breath until the very end. Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines in this role along with the rest of the cast.I suppose this review is also for the people who were in New York during 9/11. As a survivor of 9/11, I couldn't help but cry at the end of the movie. Seeing the Twin Towers rising in all their glory, basking in the sunset and reminding us of their beauty that so many of us took for granted, brought back so many emotions for me. They were like old friends saying hello and goodbye one last time.Thank you Zemeckis for telling a great story, making a beautiful movie and bringing back old friends to life!If possible, go see it in IMAX! You won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intensely Captivating Experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk is a visual masterpiece with a captivating story and superb acting. It was intense, thrilling, and emotional. The cinematography was top notch and the CGI was impeccable. This was truly an amazing cinematic experience that was made for IMAX 3D. The basic story of The Walk is this: a French street performer becomes obsessed with hanging a high wire between the two Twin Towers and walking on it. He flies to New York, recruits a few people to help him, and after weeks of of planning, is ready to perform an impossible stunt that will be remembered forever. The script is very well written and the story comes across very nicely to the viewer. It focuses on all the right moments for the right amount of time, which means the pacing is generally good. My only problem arises in the beginning as I felt it was a little rushed. Character development is also not the finest, but it is enough to make the viewer care about the characters. Other than that the story was told in a very captivating way that left viewer on the edge of their seat.The Walk is a visual treat, specifically the last part of the film. There are magnificent, swooping camera shots showing off the beautiful Twin Towers in all their glory and with IMAX 3D, the viewer feels like they are thousands of feet in the air on the high wire. There were multiple times in this movie where vertigo kicked in due to the crazy heights portrayed in the film. The cinematography really helps the viewer become immersed in the experience as there are so many memorable shots of the Twin Towers and views of New York City. The CGI used to create this wonderful experience looks insanely real and really makes one appreciate the beauty and height of the Twin Towers. When Philippe Petit is on the high wire, wind and distant traffic noises are added to the incredible CGI to enhance the feeling of being 110 stories up in the air and with moving camera angles, the experience is beautiful and realistic. The acting in this movie is superb. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is amazing as Philippe Petit and really does a good job showing how insane Petit really was. Charlotte Le Bon also does a fine job portraying Petit's girlfriend, and Ben Kingsley gives a good performance as Petit's mentor. All the supporting cast give great performances as well.Robert Zemeckis does an amazing job making this movie as intense and thrilling as possible. His direction really made this movie what it is; and it is visual spectacle told within a great story. In the end, The Walk is a visually thrilling and intensely told masterpiece. It boast beautiful cinematography, flawless CGI, great acting and direction, and a captivating story. This is truly a movie to behold in IMAX 3D and one will come out of the theater feeling immensely satisfied with the experience. The Twin Towers were beautifully portrayed in this movie and made one appreciate their existence even more. I am proud to say that this is one of the best and most satisfying movie experiences of this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best 3D experience ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk is a true story about high-wire artist, Philippe Petit(Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Ever since he was a boy, Philippe has always been fascinated by the art of tightrope walking. After mastering the art of tightrope walking, Philippe will now attempt to achieve the impossible. With the help of a small crew, Philippe will pull off a coup, as he calls it, &amp; use his high-wire to walk the massive distance between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. This is Philippe Petit's ultimate dream. The Walk is a masterpiece. It is an extremely realistic &amp; immersive theater experience. Director Robert Zemeckis has done a wonderful job in recreating the actual events of Petit's life. The last 40 minutes of the film, is worth the ticket price alone. The Walk is my all time favorite 3D movie. Right from the first scene, till the last scene, the 3D provides both immense depth &amp; many eye-popping moments. The cinematography is wonderful. Both Paris &amp; New York City in the 1970s, have been portrayed beautifully. When Petit takes that climactic walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center the 3D definitely adds to the thrill of the experience. If you have a fear of heights or even otherwise, you will be on the edge of your seat as Philippe Petit embarks on one of the most dangerous feats ever attempted, in the history of mankind. You will be hoping against hope that Philippe Petit successfully completes his life changing walk. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is outstanding as Philippe Petit. The fact that Gordon-Levitt learned the art of tightrope walking &amp; speaks in an authentic French accent is commendable. Charlotte Le Bon is great as Annie. Ben Kingsley is superb as Papa Rudy. Clement Sibony is brilliant as Jean-Louis. Cesar Domboy is amazing as Jeff/Jean-Francois. Steve Valentine is good as Barry Greenhouse. James Badge Dale is awesome as Jean-Pierre/J.P. Ben Schwartz &amp; Benedict Samuel are impressive as Albert &amp; David respectively. The Walk is a must watch. If you're not a movie buff but, you want to watch one movie in the theater this year, make it The Walk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The walk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Zemeckis is a filmmaker that can make a masterpiece out of a single subject as walking over a wire from point A to Point B, He is the mastermind behind such films like Forrest Gump, Back to the future, Cast away and flight, the last two films are IMO subjects filmed out of a simple difficult thing but extraordinary as being a castaway or an Airline pilot. The walk is one of the best films of the year, i do not think Levitt will get any Oscar nomination or but the technicality of the film will sure do, Zemeckis is one of Cinema's prodigy sons and a master of camera-work and the film looks really amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joseph Gordon-Levitt struts with style and aspiration every step of the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first scene Joseph Gordon-Levitt dons the all black persona and talks about his passion, I'm hooked. This monologue heavy delivery requires that caliber of performance from the lead, also reminds me of Ewan McGregor on Big Fish. It takes the audience on a bizarre yet fascinating adventure and makes us feel like a part of the character's larger-than-life endeavor.This is the story of Philippe Petit, a performer with the idea of wire-walking across the World Trade Center towers. While it may sound simple, the journey there is a captivating one. The presentation is almost magical with circus act and flamboyant atmosphere, although there are plenty of realistic details and intricate planning involved, at times it almost feels like a funny heist movie.Visual is breathtaking, the cinematography takes full advantages of the vistas, let it be small village or big city. The way the scenes are shot gives the movie a much more surreal ambiance. It's an enhanced realism, and although it's not as refined, there's a spirit of Hugo lingering here. It makes great use of 3D with timely panoramic shots and even stuff-thrown-at-your-face antic, but for this movie I wouldn't mind.The same goes with its jazz influenced soundtracks, occasional slow ballad or alternate take on popular songs. The production value just oozes gorgeousness. All the technical aspects aside, the best attraction is definitely Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He is utterly remarkable, youthful and charming. This is the kind of acting prowess that can captivate audience with sheer passion, it's a true homage to the real life counterpart.The Walk is nothing short of a breathtaking tale. Its charismatic protagonist and masterful visual invite the audience to not only walk alongside, but in a sense glide freely through such an inspiring story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Walk" isn't a thrill-a-minute, but it is thrilling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best measures of a good movie based on a true story is the tension that it manages to create in the audience. Whatever the main conflict in the film's story, if audience members know the ending, keeping their attention and interest and keeping them emotionally invested in the story's outcome is a challenge for any filmmaker. A movie with a great script in the hands of a great director with a great cinematographer and editor and a great cast can meet such a challenge, but when it happens, it's still an impressive accomplishment. Two examples from recent cinematic history come to mind. In 2013, director Paul Greengrass turned the well-known incident of Somali pirates seizing the Maersk Alabama into the thrilling and suspenseful "Captain Phillips". The film was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and earned acting nominations for star Tom Hanks and Somali actor Barkhad Abdi (in his film debut), both of whom were also nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards, which both won. Earlier, in 2006, Greengrass was also the director of "United 93", which chronicled the 9/11 terrorist attacks, focusing on the flight which passengers attempted to retake from the terrorists. As the film neared its tragic foregone conclusion, as a moviegoer who knew a lot about the events of 9/11, I still found myself hoping against hope that the story would end differently than it did in real life. Creating movies like that take a tremendous amount of skill. (Don't even get me started on the fact that Paul Greengrass has yet to be win a Best Director Oscar.) 2015 has legendary director Robert Zemeckis trying his hand at creating tension in a story with a well-known ending in his docudrama "The Walk" (PG, 2:03).Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Philippe Petite, the French high-wire artist who decided to string his wire between the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center and walk it. But, of course, no one would attempt something like that on a whim. Philippe became entranced with wire walkers the first time he saw one in the circus back home in France. As the boy grew into a young man, he taught himself to walk on ropes between trees in his backyard, he got better and better and started walking actual wires. He becomes very comfortable on his wire, but it's "Papa Rudy" (Ben Kingsley), the local patriarch of a family of wire walkers, who teaches Philippe what it means to walk the wire safely and as performance art.Philippe isn't interested in the scripted performances of the circus, but is very interested in performing ? and challenging himself to bigger and better performances. After repeatedly clashing with his father about his passion for walking the wire, Philippe leaves home and moves to Paris. There he finds larger crowds to see his performances and more places to hang his wire. He also finds a girlfriend in a fellow street performer, a guitar player and singer named Annie (Charlotte Le Bon). She encourages him in his wire walking, even when he illegally strings and walks his wire between the two towers of Notre Dame Cathedral. By this time, Philippe has started gathering a group of co-conspirators (as he calls them), like photographer Jean-Louis (Clément Sibony) and Jean-Louis' friend, Jean-François (César Domboy), who wants to help, but is also afraid of heights. That's okay. Philippe needs all the help he can get.Philippe has decided to walk a wire between the two tallest buildings in the world, a goal which he calls "the coup". After talking through the details and working out some of the problems with Papa Rudy and the co-conspirators, it's time for some on-site reconnaissance. Philippe, Annie and their friends travel to New York, where Philippe dresses as a construction worker to blend in with those still working on the interior of the new World Trade Center. He also meets and recruits some New Yorkers, including French expatriate Jean-Pierre (James Badge Dale) and Barry Greenhouse (Steve Valentine), a fan of Philippe, who witnessed the Notre Dame performance and happens to work in the Twin Towers. This disparate group of people (plus some late additions), each have a role to play in Philippe's grand plan."The Walk" isn't a thrill a minute, but it is thrilling. The story is fascinating and the acting is strong, especially from Gordon-Levitt, who learned French for the role and studied wire walking from Petite himself. The script tells the story well, although the scenes in which Gordon-Levitt narrates by talking to the camera are kind of hokey, mostly because of how they're shot. The rest of the cinematography is spectacular ? especially the movie's climactic wire-walking scene which turns out to be much more exciting than you'd expect from an incident which is so well-documented.

		<shortDescription>"The Walk" is stylish and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Zemeckis' signature visual style and proclivity for bio-pics seemed perfect for a movie like The Walk, a film that manages to boast an interesting and entertaining story and dizzying cinematography. The Walk is based on the story of the real-life high wire artist Philippe Petit in 1974. Inspired by a circus he saw at a young age, Philippe begins planning an incredibly ambitious -- and highly illegal -- show in which he hangs a wire across the Twin Towers and walks across them. A majority of the story is dedicated to Petit gathering accomplices to help with the coup, practicing for the extreme conditions and planning how they will rig the wire. The clever writing allows you to connect with every character and understand why they're trying to attempt this impossible dream. The last 45 minutes or so is where "the walk" actually happens. The scenes of Petit and co rigging the wire are just as tense as the wire-walking scenes, which are accented by some of the best cinematography of the year. The cinematography is really the star of the movie here. The shots panning down towards the ground make the towers almost look endless, and it adds so much tension to the walking scenes. The Walk is a stylish and entertaining look at one of the biggest artistic feats of the last century, and you need to watch it in IMAX 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling and Realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This live action feature film directed by Robert Zemeckis is phenomenal! There is nothing about it that I don't like. The Walk is set in 1974 and is about a high-wire artist named Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who lives in Paris. He sees a photo in a magazine about the construction of the Twin Towers in NYC and gets the inspiration to walk a tight rope connecting the two buildings. This is highly illegal and very dangerous. He meets up with a girl named Annie Allix (Charlotte Le Bon) who falls in love with him and supports him with his dream. He finds a mentor and father figure in Pappa Rudy (Ben Kingsley), and five other accomplices who support him in this life or death adventure. The Walk is a true story.The Walk is a drama/thriller with a spice of romance and comedy. Because it is based on a true story, it makes this movie even cooler and much more intense! This is also an educational movie because I didn't know much about high-wire artists until this movie. I learned that there is a lot of science and math about how the wire is secured to provide safety for the walker.My favorite character is Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) because he is just flat-out amazing and super believable! My favorite scene is when Philippe is facing his biggest dream of tightrope walking between the twin towers. They were 140 feet apart and 110 stories high! This scene is so realistic and exhilarating that my palms were sweaty and other audience members were squirming in their seats. Philippe says that high-wire artists are never supposed to look down when tightrope walking. Does he heed his own advice?The Walk has jaw-dropping special effects. The opening scenes in Paris are completely in black and white except for an occasional pop of color, which sets a nostalgic mood. The Twin Towers were already gone when this movie was filmed, so how did they make this so realistic? This part is truly fantastic! Watching it in 3D made it so lifelike and totally added to the intensity of the viewing experience.I recommend The Walk for ages 11 to 18 due to the suspense and mild language. Hands down I give this movie a 5 out of 5 stars because it is so amazing! The special effects can't be beat and the acting is super strong! I loved this movie and it is definitely on my favorites list! Reviewed by Lainey A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best biopics in American film history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What did you expect from the director of Back to the Future and Forrest Gump? Robert Zameckis has another thoroughly enjoyable film, The Walk, about Philippe Petit's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) high-wire walk between the World trade Center's twin towers in 1974. It's as romantic as Gump and addictive as Future with the added interest of a biopic that is true to its history.From the first moment we meet Petit talking to us from the top of the Statue of Liberty, and this story is about freedom if nothing else, we know we are in the presence of a man who has followed his dream and achieved it. To co-writers Zameckis and Christopher Browne must go praise for giving the Frenchmen poetic English in small doses, just enough to elevate the proceedings from nuts and bolts to heady ambition.Those 15 minutes on the wire are as suspenseful as possible?a mark of the true auteur, who can make us worry for our hero even though we know he will survive (he does narrate after all, and some audience will remember Man on a Wire, the excellent doc from 2008). Because Zameckis knows his special effects, I was mesmerized by the shots from atop the towers to the street below. Although I don't like heights anyway, I had to look down every time in wonder at the scope of the danger to Petit.While the Walk is about this extraordinary man, it is also a romantic eulogy to the towers, which arguably became favorites of New Yorkers after Petit's stunt. The "forever" pass to the top of the towers he receives as a reward from the city is painfully ironic considering 9/11. Because his feat was once in a lifetime, perhaps the passing of the towers reminds us that nothing lasts "forever."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rififi in the Sky with Diamonds...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts out as a Disney fantasy, morphs into a heist film, and ends as a miracle.From the torch of the Statue of Liberty, Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon- Levitt) narrates the tale of his 1974 walk between the Twin Towers. He asks us to "remember" 1974, so the narration is taking place some time in the future. But Petit looks the same as he does during the story and the Towers are still standing. Perhaps the narration is from some moment outside of time and space, where the Towers stand and M. Petit is forever young.After a brief retelling of Petit's early life and how as a young street performer he became enthralled with the dream of walking between the Towers, the film details the gathering of accomplices to enable Petit to carry out this thoroughly illegal enterprise. It's the sort of thing done in caper classics like "The Sting" and "Rififi" as well as lighter fare like "Ed Wood." All of this was done as well in the documentary version of this tale, "Man on Wire."But after all the preparation, there is the payoff which the documentary could not offer, the recreation of Petit's feat. This breath-taking, suspenseful, and ultimately exhilarating sequence will become iconic in cinema history, among peers like Chaplin's dance of the dinner rolls, the breakfast montage in "Citizen Kane," the 20-minute robbery in "Rififi," the musical space shuttle sequence in "2001," the D-Day landing in "Saving Private Ryan," and any other you care to include. Director Robert Zemeckis is an old hand at this sort of thing. No living director, including Mr.Spielberg, could have combined beauty and suspense in so perfect a blend that a viewer is thrilled and scared to death at the same time to the point of praying for the tension to end.The acting is all-around excellent, with Mr. Gordon-Levitt declaiming in French quite competently. Needless to say, the CGI and the 3D effects are state of the art. The recreation of NYC is almost perfect. (I don't think the Z train existed in the early 1970's.)This film is not perfect, as the script is a bit trite, but on the whole, "The Walk" is a masterpiece of its kind. Given the trend of the Academy in recent years, Mr. Zemeckis should clear a spot in his trophy case near his Oscar for "Forrest Gump." By early next year it's going to have company.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To learn about and understand the life of French high-wire artist Philippe Petit, who illegally performed a high-wire walk between the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in 1974, one might be better off with the 2008 James Marsh-directed documentary "Man on Wire". However, "The Walk" is a worthy experience about a dreamer who risked everything to achieve the impossible, and gave the people something beautiful, pure and hopeful.The film is interspersed with scenes of Phillippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) talking directly to the audience, narrating his life story and the events that led up to his high-wire stunt, or as he calls it ? "le coup". This certainly takes away the potential emotional and cinematic impact longer, narration-free scenes would've had on audiences but it served the purpose of moving the story forward swiftly. The first half feels crammed even though it is pretty much by-the-books: we skim through Petit's life leading up to the event without going in-depth. Which is understandable for a reasonable running time as there is a lot of ground to cover.The unbearably intense second half surely makes up for this. It's taut with thrills and sequences boasting miraculous visual effects. The 30-minute finale is a immersive, transporting and even physical (as evidenced by my sweaty palms) experience that's one-of-a-kind. In fact, I would go so far as to say that there's no point watching the film anywhere else other than at a cinema.Levitt's passionate performance is commendable and definitely contributes to a sufficiently emotionally satisfying third act. The film also makes it clear that this wasn't a one-man-show by highlighting Petit and his allies' team spirit. With "The Walk", Robert Zemeckis has given us another crowd-pleasing piece of popcorn entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is so exciting and optimistic, and for some reason i can't believe that this is really happened but it's true, let's say that there is something weird because it's not easy to find someone working inside the building in the elevator and he recognize you and not just that he even gets in your plan so easily, it's weird that when you were buying your tools the seller turns out to be a French and not just that he has no problem to get in your plan and offer some people to help.Robert Zemeckis is a wonderful director, and he made a very good work here, direction is the best part about this movie i couldn't close my eyes for a second he made every scene in this movie worth watching with his high paced way to tell the story, i like Joseph Gordon-Levitt he is a talented actor and he did very good acting but i would prefer a French actor for such a French character like Philippe Petit.this movie is well written too but i would have liked a character who doesn't believe in Philippe's dream and think that he is crazy and maybe try to stop him i guess that maybe would add some more different drama.I enjoyed my time watching "The Walk" and i think you will too7-10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So frantic that it kept me on tenterhooks as if I were on the tightrope myself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the beginning of The Walk is an entertaining biographical journey exploring the pursuits and initial exploits of Philippe Petit, the film commences to weave its magic when he arrives in New York resolutely determined to walk the gap between the Twin Towers on a tightrope. Although I am not afraid of heights and didn't happen to watch the film on 3D, which surely would have heightened the vertiginous sights surrounding the rope scenes, I must say that I had never squirmed in my seat as much as I did with this film. I had the curious sensation that I was on the rope myself and I wriggled with every step this courageous man took. Even though I was vaguely aware of this historic great achievement, little did I know that this he had walked back and forth on the rope for eight consecutive times, remaining on it for 45 minutes. After all the trepidation and the nervous psychological state that his first successful walk had put me in, it seemed that this was not enough and back he went again, more than willing to walk the rope in a deliberate attempt to exacerbate my restlessness even more. I barely wish to recall how on edge I felt when the police arrived at the scene showing sheer lack of respect by shouting at a poor man who was trespassing and risking his own life. Worse still was when the police helicopter started flying in circles far too close to him. That actually gives you the heebie-jeebies and you fidget uncontrollably wanting it to stop. It goes without saying that he could have lost his concentration and therefore his balance and would have perished there and then because of the little consideration that they showed towards him. However he managed to take it on the chin and walked off the rope completely and miraculously unscathed. Another excellent thing that the film has is its special effects which make you revisit the former Twin Towers for those like me who never had the pleasure of visiting them or even being on its upper floors. They depicted them so well in such a memorable trip back in time that it felt as if they were still here for us to behold and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heart-Stopping Spectacular; A Fantasy-Like Tale of a Breathtaking Real-Life Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.8/5 starsRife with nerve-wracking tension, and keeps you on the edge of your seat (particularly during those high-wire walking scenes) ? "The Walk" attempts a tricky balancing act between thrilling visuals and fact-based drama, and like its wire-walking protagonist, pulls it off with impressive élan. It's a dream-like yet hyper-real film, simultaneously beautiful and terrifying, lovely and scary all at once. It takes the audience on a ride of emotions that ends on the wire, allowing us to feel and experiment vertigo, fear, angst, and at the same time inspires us with the true story of a man who had the confidence, craziness, drive, grit, and tenacity to never gave up on his dream. But, most importantly, "The Walk" succeeds in being a daring film about the passion and beauty of an amazing stunt remembered to this day. It's amazing to see what Robert Zemeckis, like James Cameron and Steven Spielberg can do to with special effects and CGI to tell a story, along with his incredible effects team, he makes you feel like you're walking on that wire. It's been so long since we've seen the Robert Zemeckis who was a consummate craftsman of pop entertainment, and it's heartening to see him come roaring back to form.In 1968, Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a struggling juggler, mime, magician, and tightrope walker decided to elevate his game, literally, by stringing his tightrope between the tops of the Twin Towers. The World Trade Center was yet to be erected, which gave the Parisian street performer half a dozen years to plan and practice for his death-defying feat. Finally, on the morning of August 7, 1974, he pulled off the eye-popping stunt with the help of a few friends sworn to secrecy. They'd agreed to help rig the high wire, despite breaking the law in the process. You see, Philippe hadn't bothered to ask the authorities for permission, figuring it'd never be approved. And for 40 minutes, he put on a heart-stopping show, during which he danced a jig, saluted the crowd below, and even lay down on the wire to take a brief respite. Written and directed by Oscar-winner Zemeckis, "The Walk" recounts the events surrounding Philippe's bold and historic stroll.While "The Walk" uses the latest digital tricks and technology, it's also a satisfyingly old-fashioned picture. 1974 never looked so good, so happy, so innocent ? and isn't it nice to remember it that way? As if to counter the sad fact that most people, including an entire generation of millennials, automatically associate the New York's Twin Towers with their destruction during the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Zemeckis takes us back to that innocent point in their infancy when their sky-skewering scale inspired a budding French tightrope walker to conquer them. Structured much like a heist movie ? as was the wonderful Oscar- winning 2008 documentary about the venture, "Man on Wire" ? Philippe Petit gathers his crew, including a crusty circus manager (Ben Kingsley), and heads to the Big Apple to plan and execute his death- defying stunt.Whimsically told, the story has the feel of a modern fairytale, and it's clearly an affectionate tribute to the daredevil artist at its center. Having digitally rebuilt the city with astonishing historical accuracy, Zemeckis stages Petit's 40 minutes on the cable, 1,600 feet above the street, as one of the most lovely, terrifying, suspenseful, and joyous sequences in movie history. Some have complained that the 123-minute movie is a slow starter, but Levitt's feverish, dedicated, charming, passionate performance energizes the first half before the screenplay metamorphoses into full caper-mold in the second half. He puts forth such an easy charm crossed with a fierce determination that it's impossible not to fall in love with Philippe Petit as he attempts what sounds utterly suicidal. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has indubitably delivered one of the year's five best leading performances from a male actor, and deserves an Academy Award nomination no less for his inspirational portrayal of an awe-inspiring individual.This is the kind of unbelievable true story that you couldn't make up if you tried, and it's ultimately what makes "The Walk" such an enjoyable, gripping experience. It's only when the giddiness passes that you realize you've witnessed not only an incredible true story but a fitting tribute to an unforgettable landmark. "The Walk" truly deserves to be experienced on the biggest screen possible in glorious 3D format, and it won't fail to impress and maybe even invigorate. It provides a film-going experience unlike anything I've seen this year. You feel every storey of those awesome erections, and that sense of awe only primes you for the eponymous climax ? a set piece that for once is not oversold. By the end of the film, you'll be engulfed with genuine admiration as well as respect for Levitt, Zemeckis, and most of all for Philippe Petit and his daring crew on that fateful day back in 1974.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing and Spectacular Biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I keep getting enlightened or informational when ever I saw a biopic or film on a true event, especially when they were made by Hollywood technicians. Frankly to say I am not so good at general knowledge or remembering history. Sometimes when I read about a historical person I may not get interested much, perhaps video or documentary on him/her will seriously create curiosity inside me to watch it. But suddenly why am I telling all this funda to you ? It is all because a month ago, I have witnessed the spectacular trailer of the film "The Walk". This is a biopic on French high-wire artist Philippe Petit. After this I got hooked onto his wiki page and read a lot about him and since then, I have been waiting for its release. Brief description about his story, I think twelve people have walked on the moon, but on 7th Aug 1974 only one man in the world - Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt acted in his role) - has ever, or will ever, walk in the immense void between the World Trade Center towers. Robert Zemeckis, the director of such marvels as Forrest Gump, Cast Away, Polar Express Real steel and Flight, again uses his brilliance with such an emotional and character-driven story. Basically he also took references from the documentary "Man on a wire" and book "To reach the clouds", this book was actually written by Philippe petit himself. Needless to say the cinematography, CG works and 3D effects are state of the art. I was mesmerized by the camera angles from the top of the towers to the streets below. Joseph as French wire artist having little English accent, just nailed in his role. In the film, he himself narrates the tale from the top of the statue of liberty. Ben Kingsley as Joseph's mentor does a fantastic job. Charlotte looking damn cute but her role doesn't have much significance. Film starts off as a Disney fantasy and ends as a miracle. There are few odd or unnecessary scenes in the film but that doesn't matter when the major part of the film is so engaging and captivating. The walk between the World Trade Centers is also called as "Artistic crime of the century" or "Once in a lifetime" event in the American history and this part was amazingly picturised by Robert. The sensational and multi-angled finale part will leave your jaw opened. Climax was shot so realistic and lively.Movie has true- gripping story line, great acting and bit of romance &amp; comedy too."The Walk" is just a simple stylish and inspirational film. Do experience this in 3D only. It's worth the walk !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Icons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk is not just a marvellous retelling of the story of Phillipe Petit's "coup" of a tightrope walk across the void between the twin towers of the World Trade Centre, it's a warmhearted tribute to those beautiful icons.I actually felt a kind of emptiness inside me when I looked upon their majestic beauty on the glorious IMAX 3D screen. Petits' wonder at the immenseness of them was palpable. Robert Zemekis has bought them back to life so well it was nearly impossible to believe that they are actually gone. The slow build up covering Petit's early life and first steps on a high wire made the last 45 minutes of the film all the more poignant. Even though I knew of his audacious plan and it's outcome through the documentary "Man On Wire", the heart stopping moments of his near discovery and the culmination of the actual walk had my palms sweating.The unbelievable vistas and vertigo inducing shots of the towers and New York created by Zemekis are just beautiful, Joseph Gordon Levitt (dodgy accent moments aside) does a great job of bringing Petits' "joie de vivre" eccentricity and earnestness to the screen.The supporting cast of team members do a fine job especially Charlotte Le Bon, though Ben Kingsley can do roles like mentor Papa Rudy in his sleep.See this in 3D and IMAX if you can. It's worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anarchy in the USA: The coup at the WTC NYC.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a small boy, this reviewer read with excitement about the exploits of the great French 19th century tight-rope walker Charles Blondin who crossed the 1,100ft Niagara Gorge, many times in fact. Growing up, I followed the exploits of the eponymous Lt. Theo Kojak patrolling the mean streets of Manhattan South in the 1970's TV cop series. In the late-1990s I was able to visit New York City.There is much romance surrounding the Empire State building. In 1957 it was the setting for the romantic film 'An Affair to Remember' starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. The 1993 film 'Sleepless in Seattle' starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, is in truth, really little more than a reworking of that older film. Getting to the top of the building is hard work and takes a long time, and that is with using the series of lifts to get you there. At the top you discover that even a famous horse was there too.By contrast the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center seemed a let down. Sure, they were an iconic sight, briefly seen in many movies such as 'Working Girl' (1988), and even functioning as a prop in 'Escape from New York' (1981). But the large, fast, and functional lifts, shot you up to the top of the building in no time at all. This all changed for me on Tuesday 11th September 2001. Watching live on the TV, I found the scenes almost impossible to believe. For many months it was difficult to accept the reality of what had happened. Now I am always happy to see a shot of the towers, such as in the opening sequence of HBO's TV series 'The Sopranos' (1999-2007), and would have preferred it to have been retained.In this new film, 'The Walk' (2015), Director Robert Zemeckis, has penned a screenplay from the book 'To Reach the Clouds', that tells a true story of the early days of the Twin Towers. The story could be considered unbelievable, but this film is in fact a true representation of this astonishing story.The film is narrated, thus giving us the audience the needed exposition. The early part of the film is set in Paris, France, and is cleverly filmed in a distinctive French-style. Innovative use is made of black-and white photography, subtitles and French-mime to help tell the story of a young street performer working the streets of Paris who uses mime and his juggling skills. His name is Philippe Petit, and in this film he is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The era is the late-sixties, and this is shown well. Philippe himself is a self-proclaimed anarchist. He also has an ambitious dream which is accurately and authentically captured in this film. In 1968, at the age of 17, he reads about the building of the Twin Towers and resolves to walk from one tower to another on a tightrope stretched across the top of the towers.Before that though we have a nice romance between Philippe and Annie, played by Charlotte Le Bon. We have too, in this film, Ben Kingsley playing the role of an old high-wire performer, teaching his protégé the ropes. We get believable and thoughtful performances from the star and the supporting actors. Philippe, in 1971, walks between the towers of the cathedral of Notre Dame, shown in this film, and in 1973, did a walk at the Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia, though this is not in the film.Now Philippe resolves to carry out his ambition at the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City in the USA. This is where the rest of the film is located. Philippe recruits his supporters and they plan their coup. There is a time-element here, as the Towers are nearing completion. Detailed planning is also required and equipment is needed too. It is determined that a 450LB cable will be required as well as a specially made 55LB 26ft balancing pole. The gap between the towers was 200ft, the height above ground 1,368ft. The coup was planned for 7th of August 1974, one week before Philippe's 25th birthday.While the acting is good, and the contrast between Paris and New York is shown authentically, and cleverly, by the different styles of filming, it is the special-effects that make this film. This reviewer saw the 3D version of this film. It was one of the main draws of the film and it must be doubted that this film could have been made as authentically before now. The camera shoots up and down the Twin Towers as well as across the wire. It looks down at the wire, and then swoops down to the ground. The effect is truly breathtaking. The tension is there throughout the latter part of the film. There too, are you, on the wire, looking up, and down.It is clear how dangerous and foolhardy was this coup that Philippe Petit attempted. Nowadays, he would be declared an adrenalin junkie. No doubt he was that. This attempt can now never be replicated. I had thought that the WTC should not have been built on. I was wrong. It is right that something bigger and better should be built. The human spirit should always strive to go onwards and upwards.The Twin Towers of the World Trade Center remain, always, an iconic vision of New York City, as well as the indomitable symbol of soaring ambition, vision, and the spirit of humanity throughout the world. Now Philippe Petit and Robert Zemeckis have given it it's own magic and romance too.Breathtaking! 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I struggled between 6 and 7 for the score here because "The Walk" isn't much for set-up, the character-development overall is weak, and the love story inept, but the last 45 minutes is edge of your seat stuff that looks great.Not sure if this is gonna fall in my top-25 for 2015 list now, but I'm sure it wouldn't stay there either way so I may just go ahead and throw it on the just-missed list.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great here. A few minor breaks in his accent, but overall it's great. The supporting cast is basically a bunch of no-names with the exception of Ben Kingsley, and to tell you the truth, he too is a bit under-utilized here.Basically the whole film falls short, but is completely made-up-for by finale'. THe documentary "Man on WIre" is a much better film overall. This is a 6.5, and Man on Wire is about an 8.5. It's grand looking and Levitt's charm and that look give this otherwise average film a passing grade.Check it out. THe bigger the screen the better. Hope it helps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The coup has begun. My life is no longer in my control." Philippe Petit (Gordon-Levitt) is a tight rope walker who doesn't do anything small. After being told he can't do something he makes it his goal to accomplish the feat. He begins my showing his skills in the streets of France, then to the Notre Dame cathedral. When he sees a picture his life, and the world is changed. Philippe enlists a group of men to help him accomplish his dream, to hang a wire between the twin towers in New York and walk across it. This is not a typical biopic if that's what you are looking for. This deals with a specific event in someones life. The most amazing thing about this movie is that it doesn't have to embellish the actual events because there is enough drama on its own. If you don't think a movie about a man walking on a tight rope can be tense and exciting I challenge you to say that after watching this. The movie itself is really good and I liked it, but this is one of the most visually striking movies I think I have ever seen. The way the movie is filmed it really makes it easy to feel what he is feeling and you really get the sense of the danger he is up against. I was looking forward to watching this and was not disappointed, I just wish I would have saw it on the big screen. Overall, tense and visually appealing, the type of of movie 3D was made for. I give this a B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do you risk death?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The walk centers around the famous story of Philippe Petit, a french high wire artist who walked between the New York towers of the World Trade Center.The Walk is presented in a way where the vast majority of the movie is a patient build up to the final stunt. Zemeckis knows that this is what most viewers would come for and carefully prolongs the suspense, with an attempt to knock us down during the glorious finale. As a result, parts of the movie seem simply unnecessary. Too much time is devoted to meticulously showing the preparations, arguments and weird psychological tensions between the characters; and too little time is devoted to exploring who Philippe Petit really is and what drives and motivates him. Zemeckis painted Philippe in an overly simplistic way, underplaying the mysterious and human aspects of the character, that come of so well in the original documentary. The walk is 120 minutes long and it is narrated throughout, which hugely distracts from being able to fully embrace and enjoy the actual experience. Not only is Philippe narrating, but the camera constantly switches to show him talking, whilst sitting on the top of the Statue of Liberty.The underlying story in it's nature is so beautiful, inspiring and surreal that it should not require any guidance. This is something one has to simply see, analyze and drive conclusions from. Admittedly, the 'Art Stunt of The Century' was the actual walk between the towers and Zemeckis conveys that part masterfully. The extremely emotional, vertigo- induced, multi-angled final scene will leave your jaw opened and your palms sweaty. Nevertheless this story should not require a climax, suspenseful finale, but rather simple, continuous observation and exploration, to really give the viewer time to sync the scale in. Much like Zemeckis did with Cast Away. Philippe Petit and his adventures on the high wire, to this day, has been one of the most memorable stories and characters I have ever encountered. Philippe's story includes everything - his start in the circus, The walk between the Notre Dame, the Sydney Harbour bridge, the Towers, as well as who Philippe really is, a question that would be more interesting to answer then 'What did it take to do it'?The walk is a beautifully shot and very well acted film, that does an exceptional job in documenting the struggles of Philippe's final journey as well as righteously glorifying the act. At the same time however The Walk fails to truly explore the gripping story and character of Philippe Petit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that I've never seen better 3-D in a live action film and that is crucial to the impact this film delivers. As everyone knows, the film tells the story of Philippe Petit's wire walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. To anyone who has read the book on which this film is based (and the documentary Man On Wire) the events leading up to that spectacle are well-known and fairly accurately portrayed. BTW, I'm old enough to remember the real event. Others will discuss the acting (Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Petit is particularly good) the writing, cinematography and all the other aspects of what goes into a motion picture. I just want to discuss the walk itself, as Zemeckis presents it. I am terrified of heights and was worried I might not be able to watch Petit's high wire performance. In fact, I was cringing far more during the scenes of the characters scurrying around on the edges of the tops of the two towers while preparing the wire. Once Petit actually started his walk, though, Zemeckis and Gordon-Levitt were able to actually communicate (at least to this viewer) the serenity that Petit says he feels on the wire. I left the theatre shaking, and two hours later I got a text from a friend who saw the film with me: "I'm still reeling!" Me too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary and hugely entertaining spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of absolutely nowhere, Robert Zemeckis' 'The Walk' is one of the best films of this year! It's a biographical drama with a lot of heart and a lot humour, as well as spectacular visuals, brilliant performances and a hugely captivating plot that both thrills and tells a fascinating true story.It's hard to believe it, given the sheer audacity of it all, but this whole story really is true. The 2008 documentary Man On Wire tells the tale in more factual detail, but The Walk is a far more engrossing and enjoyable viewing experience.In the role of the high-wire performer Philippe Petit, Joseph Gordon-Levitt does an excellent job. Not only does he pull of the French accent and actual French-language dialogue superbly, but his portrayal of Petit makes him a character that, despite being completely mad, is infectiously likable, what with a wide smile and a wonderful sense of adventure to make his dreams become a reality.The story in itself is centred around the famous high-wire performance across the Twin Towers, but the first two-thirds of the movie actually look more at Petit's life in France, and his relationships with the various people that he recruits on his way to realising this feat.In classic Robert Zemeckis style, that part of the story is full of brilliant heart and a positive atmosphere that makes it impossible not to enjoy, in similar fashion to Zemeckis' acclaimed Forrest Gump. What's more is that the directing and cinematography presents France as an almost enchanted land, full of vibrant colours and quirky personalities, something else that contributes hugely to the enjoyability factor of the first two-thirds of the film.In the latter stages, we see the actual high-wire act undertaken at the World Trade Centre, and my goodness is it worth the wait.Firstly, the story begins to take on the structure and feel of a heist movie as Petit and his accomplices attempt to dodge the authorities to set up the wire atop the skyscrapers, and that is hugely exciting, tense, and again simply fun to watch all the time, adding another different level to this uniquely entertaining story.And then, the actual event is simply astonishing to watch. I felt totally and utterly entranced by the entire spectacle as Petit makes his steps out over the terrifying void between the towers. Here, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's acting is beautifully serene as he shows Petit finally achieving his dream, whilst the visuals are absolutely stunning.On the one hand, there are the vertigo-inducing shots of the deep void below the wire that make your legs turn to jelly (even in 2D), but also, Zemeckis presents the atmosphere surrounding Petit on the wire as a serene, dreamlike place to represent the delight he feels having accomplished this feat, and it is by far one of the most pleasant and beautiful cinematic sequences we've seen in a long time.So, overall, The Walk is not only a hugely entertaining and upbeat film, but it also features a brilliant central performance, sublime directing, a fascinating story, and some extraordinary visuals that all come together to make a wonderfully enjoyable and captivating movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is truly underrated. I loved every minute and thought it was very inspirational and upbeat. There also aren't too many movies like The Walk, so it's unique and refreshing to watch. It tells the story of how Philippe got started with his high wire act, right up to the big event at the twin towers. The 3D effects are spectacular, so I highly recommend watching it in 3D (if possible) and on the biggest screen you can find.Robert did a great job showing the World Trade Towers in all their glory. My dad actually thought they used the real towers in the film (he asked me "how did they get that footage!?"), so it goes without saying the CGI is really well done. But I must admit, it was hard to not get a little emotional seeing the towers again.Easily a solid 10/10 and great family movie night experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mesmerizing &amp; a'ccentric experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The walk is a movie about a wire walker born in France, set out to New York, to fulfill his dream of covering a distance between the towers on his wire. His dream was seeded long time before even when the towers were not constructed completely. His journey of meeting associates accompanying him, leaving him, his close partner, the risks involved, his guide, the process, the audience all that comes into play while pursuing his dream are shown in this movie.When the trailer first came out, I was not very intimidated. The movie was released in 3d mostly and somehow I dint like the visuals too much. After watching the movie this part stayed unaltered. The true essence of the movie is the details that take place and are described in social life of Philippe Petit. The experience was mesmerizing. There is a saying in India 'Rather than cooking same rice-Dal every day, one should occasionally cook biryani'. The tongue of the actors soothes so much, I mean hearing English from French People. The same experience one has in changing accent.The coziness that is present between his (Philippe Petit) guide and him is great, his work going undisturbed inside a circle, his failure as in his first show -adds to the charm. There is also a lot of thrill involved, when he risks at being on height hiding from authorities with an associate who fears height, he gets on that wire and shows various tricks. Everything adds to the entertaining experience. Being an alpha, and supporting associates in overcoming the impossible always adds to the experience.Rating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

The technique, cinematography, music, ... are all top notch. Most of us already know the story, and some of us saw other movies about the same man, but this one definitely has the highest production values. What I like most about "The Walk" is what I think differentiates it from the other movies, you feel the importance and grandeur of the twin towers, for a moment there you feel they are the stars of the movie, an integral part of the story that Robert Zemeckis did a great job capturing their character and presence. I felt this movie was more of a tribute to the towers than of Philip's, it sheds a different light on the walk that will give you a warm feeling by the end. You realize that they weren't just any two buildings, they attracted a young man from across the Atlantic and changed his life forever.</fullReview>

Flaws? Not a real one: Joseph Gordon-Levitt may be is a little overexposed (he has to take the lead in every single scene and if you don't really love him, you can get a bit tired of this) and Ben Kingsley plays a part (thing that he does perfectly) that you could feel belonging to Alan Arkin, who actually invented that kind of character (I guess that you have seen 'Little Miss Sunshine' or 'Million Dollar Arm').Minor flaws, however, (if any) that you'll forget completely when you'll get to those incredible 45 final minutes that will take your breath away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling Drama, Feels Like Walking on Wire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This biographical drama about high-wire artist Philippe Petit is presented in a surprising and classical narration from the beginning till the end which turns out very successful thanks to its well balanced visual effects and fact adaptations. The plot is layered into several structures perfectly, its progression from dream, plannings, challenges, actions, consequences until memories are developed in an acceptable pace. Main actor Joseph-Gordon Levitt's efforts in practicing high-wire experience and learning French are fruitful which his charming performance and immersion in portraying Philippe manages to attract the audiences to fall in love and to follow the fierce determination to achieve a "suicidal ambition". Director Zemeckis' ingenious camera work, CGI, SFX as well as the beautiful scores have brought this chilling and insane lifetime experience to a feeling like walking on the wire in real life. Most importantly, despite keeping the audiences on the edge of their seats and terrifying height, it delivers the messages of not giving up your own dream even the others might see it as an insane imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>overwhelmingly satisfying, mesmerizing, and heart-warming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I made a good investment in watching "The Walk" in IMAX 3D. Anything less than that format and perhaps the magic will not be the same. The return on investment was absolutely overwhelmingly satisfying, mesmerizing, and heart-warming. It comes with a caveat for those who fear great heights or suffer from vertigo. This movie is a tribute to the French high-wire artiste Philippe Petit - he dared in 1974 to walk (illegally) without any personal safety gears on a high-wire guyed between the top of 110 storeys tall the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre, New York City - as much as the Towers themselves that now lie flat at ground zero. The two towers are not just two inanimate objects as they stand tall in their magnificent glory speaking louder than words and breathing life into the movie. The make-believe is so powerful that it will be almost impossible to rein in your visceral gut-churning and palm-sweating reflexes when the camera pans between the two towers and gazes into the gaping chasm of abysmal depth. It is in its heart a biopic but works like a charm of any heist thriller. Joseph Gordon-Levitt lives it and exudes the passion, the madness and the resoluteness of the character with an arresting charm and the French accent. Robert Zemeckis as always knits a taut drama just like the high-wire itself without pace getting slackened. Technical team gets my special standing ovation for recreating the World Trade Centre of 1970s and its contemporary ambiance. The film has my thundering applause. Anything less than 10/10 will be very unjust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is breathing-taking, it is enthralling, mind-blowing, has those heart-stopping moments and with it all, it is amazingly sweet. This film takes you to a ride most mad, crazy, stupid, risky and yet compelling from every angle.I can't recall too many better 3D experiences than this. A thing about films made on biographical accounts is that they really demand a lot of hard-work from the film-maker to prevent them from becoming boring, because as it is, events occurring in a person's real life and a film are two completely different things. So thumbs up to them for making a film that carries great pace even before the real deal begins.Coming now to the "Real deal", the walk on the rope, the film becomes spectacular from that point. I attended a circus session this summer and the look, the smile and that mesmerised look that I had on my face seeing that, this is exactly the feeling and the look on my face that I wore watching this film in the cinema. I almost felt like clapping the moment he did all his tricks on the rope.To top it all, this is not even inspirational in a sense as other biopics may inspire you to do or achieve something in life, since this strictly should not be repeated. It is madness to the extreme, and yet I bow down to the genius! I salute him!As a side note, having watched the film now the 9/11 tragedy makes me so much more sad. It makes me think from Philippe's point of view and the memories and the emotional attachment that he must be having with the Twin Towers and what he must have gone through when they collapsed. Sad really.And oh', an adjective that I forgot to add, it was very "emotional" as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE WALK is carefully constructed to show us that "the Void" . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . is Man's greatest Enemy on Earth. Tightrope walker Philippe Petit makes his career in focusing people's attention on the Void, exemplified by THE WALK between the tops of New York City's Twin Towers (1974-2001). Anthropologists suggest that Humanity has been around for at least 3 million years, but has nothing to show for it until the last 50 centuries or so (less than 0.2% of our total time; the first 99.8% plus is a total Void). Now, there are One Billion plus self-appointed "Guardians of the Void," who are becoming increasingly successful with their brazen efforts of reestablish Earth's Pre-Human Void. About 15 years ago they blasted the World's tallest ancient statues in Afghanistan. No one was punished. Then these Voiders erased Petit's Twin Towers. There was no movement to outlaw the Cult of the Void. Even five-story buildings are not safe, as evidenced by the leveling of a large segment of the Pentagon (headquarters for the Guardians of Civilization). Just this year they demolished the 2,000-year-old Roman City of Palmyra. Egypt's Great Pyradmids will be next, maybe followed by your home! That is, unless you decide to Fight the Void, as Petit did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Walk Is Taut, Riveting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although there is definitely humor in this film, all in all it's an intense, terrorizing, real-life picture ? especially in 3D. If you are the least bit afraid of heights, this one will surely get to you. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in the role of Philippe Petit is amazing in this movie. He is perfect for the part and does it justice from start to finish. Ben Kingsley, as Papa Rudy who was Petit's mentor, is wonderful. This movie will get to you on many levels. Not only the audacity, the power of positive thinking, and sheer confidence in one's ability that was shown by Petit, to achieve his never to be able to be repeated walk between those two enormously tall buildings, but because of the terror attack involving the Twin Towers in New York, there is no way not to think of the horror of that day. No way on earth to see the picture of the Twin Towers at the end without the thought of 9/11 coming to your mind. This is a tremendously entertaining and thought-provoking movie, one that left me thinking about it on all levels much after I left the building, in fact I'm still thinking about scenes from this picture. Amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE WALK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new biopic drama flick, from director Robert Zemeckis; and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The film tells the story of French high-wire artist Philippe Petit; and his daring walk between the Twin Towers, of the World Trade Center, on August 7, 1974. It was written by Zemeckis and Christopher Browne; and it's based on the book 'To Reach the Clouds', by Petit himself. The movie costars Charlotte Le Bon, James Badge Dale and Ben Kingsley. I found it to be thrilling, breathtakingly beautiful and inspiring; in a truly heartfelt way!Philippe Petit (Gordon-Levitt) narrates the film; beginning in 1973, atop the Statue of Liberty. He tells how he started out a struggling street performer, on the streets of France, and became fascinated with the idea, of walking a tightrope between the two Twin Towers. He meets several people who help him achieve this dream; including a veteran circus tightrope performer, named Papa Rudy (Kingsley), and another street performer, named Annie (Le Bon). The movie details his plan; from it's conception, to it's conclusion.Gordon-Levitt gives another great performance, in the lead; he also trained with Petit himself, and gained some tightrope walking skills, as well as learned fluent French. Robert Zemeckis does a more than decent job directing the film (yet again) and the visuals are spectacular (especially in 3D). The movie does a great job of balancing an involving character study, with stunning thrills (as well). It's also extremely inspiring; for any truly rebellious artist, who dreams of accomplishing great things!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/uU2Z04j5ZzE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually Compelling and a engaging real life story on screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A visually compelling and well enacted biographical drama by Director Robert Zemeckis (the forest gump, Back to the future fame). After going through many biographical movies which comes with a tagline based on a true story I understood one general principle it gives us the real feel through the realistic screenplay but on the other hand there will be moments where the movie will face the problems like a sag in the pace of the story. But this principle doesn't go with "The Walk" this 2 hour film was a truly engaging from start to end. For those who would have heard of phillipe Petit who is known for staging high wire walks usually without permission. This movie is an ode to his passion. Now this movie focuses his dream to walk between the two towers of world trade centre without permission with the help of his accomplices. The story ambitiously starts with the narration of Joseph Gordon Levitt who portrays Petit (buzzed to be trained by real petit for the movie) and he takes us through his hardships rather an interesting life adventure ride for the next two hours what we see is the magnificently enacted play. He is well supported by a strong supporting cast which includes the veteran actor Ben Kingsley as Papa Rudy who is Petit's mentor and Charlotte Le Bon (French actress) as Annie who plays as a street singer and to an extent the love interest of Petit not to forget her beautiful Parisian accent aided the charm to the backdrop of the story. First thing I was awe struck was the amazing recreations of the WTC towers during its almost opening times (1974). The VFX and integration 3D technology was top notch. Another thing I loved about the movie is its nativity in the accent where we see the lead players of the story are not non native English speakers basically from French origin. So the way they speak was so nice and slow which I enjoyed throughout the movie. PS: Watch this movie definitely in big screens and with 3D. If possible watch it in original IMAX Laser screens like I did where you will engage in the accelerating world of 3D where the movie world meets the real world and I am pretty sure you will get goose bumps during the climax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is no Why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a bit intimidated to go to this movie, since I had seen the documentary "Man on Wire" about Philippe Petit in 2008. I was scared that I would be disappointed, since I had so loved the first movie. But my fears were misplaced. I loved this movie as well, it added a whole new depth of meaning to the story and filled in huge gaps about the various "accomplices" that were so necessary for the successful completion of the walk. Every moment is carefully scripted and you can see how Philippe learns from each experience. They say there are no accidents in life and that fortune favours the brave. This is very true here and just the right people seem to come along at the right time to aid in the final mission. They succeed despite all their shortcomings. The joy and serenity of doing the impossible really is transmitted. The final shots show the sun setting on the twin towers, what a wonderful way to remember them as part of such an uplifting event.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE WALK : Absolutely enthralling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A word of caution : People with vertigo or acrophobia should really think twice before watching this movie.For the rest, let me tell you that this is of the most thrilling and satiating movie-watching experiences of this year! Based on the real story of the French high-wire walker Philippe Petit who walked between the twin towers of the World Trade Center on 7 August 1974 , at an incredible height of over 400 meters,The Walk directed by Robert Zemeckis ( of Forrest Gump,Cast Away fame)starts off with a predictable element when we see that the protagonist deftly played by Joseph Gordon Levitt narrates his experience of the rare feat achieved.We know that he accomplished the act successfully, but its the beauty of the narrative and the sheer magical energy which keeps us invested for two hours.Through the nicely crafted sets, it transports us to the early 70s and the French milieu where we wee the the young Phillippe performing jugglery on the streets , and yet holding a passion to do something extraordinary.He doesn't want to get cornered as a mere circus clown but aspires to be a revered artist.Phillipe is driven by a rare streak of insanity , and when he discloses the idea of walking between the twin towers without life support to his mentor,circus man Papa Rudy(Ben Kingsley), it is met with a strong disapproval.The initial portions of the film focuses on his journey from Paris to New York , his romantic indulgence with Annie(Charlotte Le Bon)and how he gathers his accomplices for the coup. Zemeckis instills some subtle dopes of humor into the proceedings while all the planning before the D-Day almost shape up like a heist movie.It provides an amazing IMAX experience which works because of the immersive cinematography and the lucid execution by Zemeckis.There is a superlative interplay of technical wizardry and visual ecstasy as Zemeckis infuses a soul into the void space between the twin towers.Watching the last twenty minutes when the real act is performed , with the clouds playing razzmatazz over the sunrise is deeply compelling.Joseph Gordon Levitt does a phenomenal job playing Philipppe and exudes unbridled enthusiasm,irresistible charm and innate bashfulness inherent to the character.He does complete justice enacting the man who became a living epitome of strong will,determination and triumph of human spirit.He is ably supported by the talented Ben Kingsley, Charlotte Le Bon and his group of accomplices.Kudos to Zemeckis for prudently balancing the breath-taking visuals and the fact-based drama and creating an absolute masterpiece.Rating : 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Visually Impressive Movie in Forever - Spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen only three or four movies in IMAX, which - candidly - is usually a waste of money. 'The Walk', however, absolutely must be seen in IMAX and 3D. In the almost spectacularly luminous finale, Zemeckis and the technology absolutely 'get' the sheer vertiginous scale of Petit's feat and fearlessness. The vista stretches away to forever; wispy clouds get in the way; the scale is almost dizzying. I don't know when I've seen anything as breathtaking in film. (I saw and appreciated the 2008 documentary 'Man on Wire' - but the real time footage was taken from too great a distance to give any impression of what it would be like to walk out on a tight rope wire at that height. This movie wallows in that missing element, and does it magnificently).The rest of the movie isn't bad at all, kind of a fun caper set up. Critics who are badmouthing it seem to me the type who have to find something negative, or sacrifice some subjective notion of their credibility. But the reality is that the set-up is rather interesting, not at all slow, and certainly no insult to the intelligence. That said, it's also not particularly memorable. It's only the wowser finale that makes the picture one of the best in a decade or so, simply because of its visual appeal.Joseph Gordon-Leavitt is very, very good in a role that is not that challenging. Zemeckis is a solid technician, but also a quality director. He does know how to create dramatic tension, sometimes with very simple devices. As the finale begins, Gordon-Leavitt puts his foot on the wire, with the whole city spread out beneath him, and reflects on what he is about to do. The tension becomes almost unbearable - don't do it! - even though every member of the audience knows the outcome.That was one spoiler. The second and last is a rejoinder to those who see any chauvinism in the movie. The nod to the history of the WTC is very subtle. The Petit character notes that many New Yorkers did not like the Towers before his feat, that it was that that humanized them and 'brought them to life'. The implicit reference to the event that destroyed them is obvious. He also notes he received a pass to the WTC, normally a 24 hour thing, with the notation 'forever' - again, the obvious implication. Finally, the last shot of the movie is of the Towers glowing gold in the sunset, in some earlier year.That's it for chauvinism, which does not seem all that bad to me. Recommended without qualification. A magnificent achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful love letter to the Twin Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have ambivalent feelings about this film, in the fact that most people who want to see it in the form that it was designed for ,IMAX in 3-D , will never be able to afford it . This format is truly the best way to see this film. It is fantastic, most definitely worth the 19.00 bucks a ticket , but for a family of four you're looking at 80 bucks. Those who can't afford it , will not see the true film on a regular screen. The gut wrenching over the side shots and even the 3-d immersion is beyond any experience to date. The camera work combined with the photographic effects give us a film that truly is more about the towers than the man who walked between them. Yes it is Petit's story, but that is slowly and endearingly faded into the experience of the set up ( the break in ) on the towers itself. When the walk does come, it is beautifully portrayed. Levitt is grand and the rest of the cast are equally great in their roles. The film was careful not to show Petit's narcissistic side along with his underlying desire to be a celebrity , Levitt accomplishes a strong portrait of Petit's charms and his vibrant personality showing the audience how he was able to keep his troupe together, long enough for him to accomplish his feat. What I found to be the greatest part of this film is the way that Zemeckis payed tribute to the two buildings and the people that worked in them and on them. He also communicates effectively the way New Yorkers initially despised the structures but eventually grew to love them ,excepting them as the soul of the city. Zemeckis brilliantly ends the film in an understated yet poetic sequence that will bring a tear to the eye of even the most hardened of viewers. The film is strong enough to stand in greatness without seeing it in IMAX 3-D, but it should only be seen in that format for the full effect, and that is truly the only negative aspect of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The protoganist captures the heart of not only all the fine ladies but the heart of all the viewer's inside the theatre. The protoganist voice over narrative of his story catches us by his charismaThis story has to do a lot on the philosophy 'pursue your dreams'&nbsp; cos when asked the protoganist "why do you risk death by walkig on wire?" He answers saying "for me this is life".The construction&nbsp; process of the twin tower buit in 1973 shown , touches us to a deep level as it is 'no more with us" At the climax when the protoganist&nbsp; says he has a visiting pass issued at the 70s to vist the Top of the twin towers forever, makes us&nbsp; cry in pain as we have no twin towers today.Tough his first public wire walk in a park fails his second public walk across the notredam makes us leap out of the chair , especially to those who have been personally to the notredam .His mentor ' papa roudy' begging him to use a safety belt for the final walk,&nbsp; and papa roudy&nbsp; going the extreme saying ,that papa roudy would ask his sons to do so ,&nbsp; melts our soul . A mentor turning to&nbsp; a father who loves his sons and his protégé is what we see.The coffin&nbsp; box that protagonist calls, an ordinary&nbsp; box&nbsp; that&nbsp; he has to use as&nbsp; bait to get to the top floor is a symbolic representative of his fear of failing in his endeavour. His nervousness at the day before the night is beautifully expressed by him wakeing up the troop at mid night .He fixes the cable and begins his walk in-spite of him loosing his costume. The accomplishment of the main need of the protoganist is so well taken that you find yourself commenting various kinds of remarks till he does what his only ambition was.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE WALK (2015) **** Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ben Kingsley, Charlotte Le Bon, Clement Sibony, Cesar Domboy, Steve Valentine, James Badge Dale, Ben Schwartz, Benedict Samuel. Filmmaker Robert Zemeckis'epic take on the incredible true account of French artiste Philippe Petit's astounding coup : walking a tightrope across the cavernous World Trade Center Towers in 1974. Told with brio and a caffeinated turn by Gordon-Levitt as Petit (spot on) whose vision and at-times obnoxious confidence is only superseded by the event itself: extraordinary to say the least. The amazing visual effects employed to recreate the Towers and the grande event unfolding is dizzyingly jaw-dropping and a truly beautiful, spiritual triumph.

		<shortDescription>A True Nail-Biter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk is a visually gorgeous, terrifically acted, biopic that is bail-bitingly good. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Philippe Petit, a real life man who walked a hang wire between the two towers, extremely well. Often times when an actor has to fake an accent, it comes off as corny, but Gordon-Levitt pulls off the French accent. The entire cast was good, but the movie is a chance for Gordon-Levitt to shine. The film uses a lot of visual effects, and most of them are nearly seamless. It's always great to see New York from far above, but this may be one time it's not as much fun. Zemeckis, and Gordon-Levitt succeed in making you care about this character, so that in the end when he's standing 110 stories up, all you can feel is fear. Granted if you've seen Man on Wire then you already know the story, and the film doesn't offer many surprises, because it's loyal to the truth, but if you haven't you may find yourself biting your nails, and rooting for this guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastically told story, done using amazing visual effects worth the IMAX Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer to this movie long ago, I did not think director Robert Zemeckis would be able to pull off an IMAX exclusive film about a guy who walked a tight rope over the World Trade Center. I'm excited to say how wrong I was about that. In was incredible! I'm not into narrative movies that are narrated, but the way Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the voice of high wire expert, Philippe Petit narrated the story added to me feeling the motivation of this man and the dedication to his goal.Another element that increased the amazing story telling was the visual effects. From 2 feet off the ground to 140 feet off the ground the effects brought nothing but excitement to this tale.It felt so real. I'm not a fan of heights and I felt completely uneasy watching these guys on top of the Towers, that no longer exists, so I'm floored that they were able to make it feel so real, and that's the key word, I felt the height and I felt the rush.The best part of this movie is that it's not just a story about a high-wire artist who accomplished something no one else has ever done, it was just as easy a movie biopic about the World Trade Center itself. The movie made the twin towers a personality like any other actor in the movie, and it felt good to see someone make a period piece that features them, and they are front and center.Not since Hugo have I seen such a worthy 3D movie in an IMAX theater. It's worth The Walk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Walk (2015) *** (out of 4) The incredible true story of high-wire walker Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who got to live his dream of crossing the Twin Towers in 1974.THE WALK was first brought to the screen in the Oscar-winning documentary MAN ON WIRE but obviously director Robert Zemeckis saw something in the story that made him want to turn it into a feature. THE WALK was released to Luke warm reviews and it ended up dying a rather painful death at the box office but I'm going to guess that it won't be forgotten but instead fine a good cult audience somewhere down the road.The story itself is something of complete wonder and there's no question that the documentary did a much better job at telling it. With that said, even thought the documentary is the better of the two films, this feature still offers up some impressive visuals and performances that makes it worth seeing. I didn't get to see the film in 3D so I can't comment on that but I thought Zemeckis did a wonderful job at making the viewer see and feel how high up Petit was.The scenes certainly have a very claustrophobic feel to them and you can't help but panic yourself just wondering what you would do in a situation like that. Just reading or hearing about the story will make you wonder how a human could do it but this film gives you a great feel and idea of the terror that it would cause in most people. Gordon-Levitt gives a very good performance in the role of Petit and I especially liked how the movie didn't back down from him at times not being so likable. I thought the actor did a remarkable job getting into the role and you had no problem believing that he was the real guy.THE WALK does contain some flaws and that includes it running on a bit too much. Everyone going into the movie knows the story so there's a rush to get to the actual walk in the movie. I thought the early stuff dragged on a bit too much and I think some editing probably would have helped things. However, once we actually get to the walk itself there's no question that the magic takes over and that alone makes the film worth sitting through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Walk is just such an incredible piece of cinema! Joseph Gordon Levitt is great in the lead of Phillipe, he really does represent the real life character well! The other members of the cast worked very well together as well. The script and the dialogue between the characters is very well written and I was impressed by it. The visuals of course are incredible, they have to be with a film like this! I love the energy that this movie encapsulates! The electric energy here is profound. This movie is truly underrated, not many people talked about it, I really don't think it got the attention and praise that it deserved. The nudity kinda caught me off guard lol, but it was needed, since it is based off a true story. I loved the build up and the development of the characters, they definitely were NOT one dimensional at all. Well, this is for sure one of the absolute best of the year 2015.

		<shortDescription>Exciting and bold work of R. Zemeckis.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After several film stumbles in which the good director Zemeckis gambled it all for technical innovations and the third dimension, finally triumphs with a movie that allows you to have a perfect balance between visual appeal and an interesting story with feeling.With the use of voice-over and narratively, the director tells the story of Philippe Petit, a man who since childhood has felt a fascination balancing on the rope and already in adulthood, after knowing the yet finished twin towers in New York, decides that his dream is to cross them through a cable at a height of more than 110 floors.Zemeckis style has always been characterized by its optimistic tone full of sentimentality, and this film is no exception. Starts telling anecdotes key to the evolution of the protagonist, always taking care of the humor, drama and role play supporting characters.During the second act, with great narrative pulse and suspense, the audience is involved in the film while the plan to enter the towers takes shape. However fascinating it is during the third act, the culmination of the journey, realizing the dream of Phillippe, when the movie reaches great heights in every way.The photograph maintained throughout the film is responsible for devising perfect sequences to show bold three-dimensional, real film reaches a climax as few films achieve.This film is breathtaking to the viewer, not only by the excitement of its history, but for its proper performance, the charisma of Gordon Levitt and visual creativity which shows that the third dimension is a resource that, used wisely, can carry more beyond the experience of watching a movie in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't compete with Man on Wire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rare type of film that comes around with both pedigree and a want to be loved but struggles to make a case for why it even came around in the first place, famed director Robert Zemeckis ? the man responsible for such gems as Forrest Gump and Cast Away, has with The Walk developed a handsomely crafted and sporadically affecting retelling of much more interesting true story of wire walker Phillipe Petit.The main reason that bewilders me and seemingly many others about The Walk's very inception is that in 2008 documentary filmmaker turned feature length director James Marsh delivered one of cinemas great documentaries with the stunning and heartfelt Man on Wire, that not only spoke in depth about the life of Petit and more importantly his breathtaking wire walk across the distance between the then still standing Twin Towers of New York but also re-enacted the events that transpired as good as any feature film incarnation was going to do.Zemeckis has also been a highly assured filmmaker and a director that can do heart to coincide with spectacle but where Man on Wire acts as a tense and emotionally strong telling of this unbelievable true story, The Walk just doesn't have the thrills that doco provided and even the best efforts of Joseph Gordon Levitt can't save the film from an overall sense of mundanity.Always a likable presence on the big screen, Levitt had big shoes to fill in portraying the larger than life Petit and while he tries his hardest he never fully functions as a death-defying Frenchman. The other point The Walk tries it's hardest on is in the titular walk and it sure does look fantastic in a slightly forgettable type of way but it's not enough to sell the whole movie on and its quite clear now in the aftermath of the films lacking box office performance and almost no showing at awards shows that neither critics or audiences felt overly attached or wowed to this heist film with a difference.With Man on Wire readily available for viewers to find an enjoy, The Walk feels like a rather unnecessary film and while it's by no means horrible, it certainly doesn't do enough to stand alongside it's much better documentary forefather and you can't help but escape the feeling this was a real non-eventful retelling of a highly eventful moment in artistic history.2 ? sore feet out of 5</fullReview>

A special mention to the director for his work.I have watched other movies of this director like Forrest Gump,What Lies Beneath and A Christmas Carol and all of these are good movies but this was special.Movie shows journey of a wire walk artist from starting to end and it was perfectly done.There is thrill,emotions,good background music,fantastic special effects and of course good acting and direction in this movie.Film is intriguing and last half an hour is the best as it shows emotions of the artist when he achieve his dream as well as special effects and cinematography was mind blowing.I was so attached with the movie that it feels like I was walking on the wire and there was nothing but silence for some time and the experience was amazing.Movie can be watched with your family and it may inspire you to achieve your dream.This movie is highly recommended for drama-thriller genre fans.Overall I give this movie 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising story, inappropriately served in Ameli Poulen style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story with great potential, ruined by awful directing - that's what this movie is. There is a complete lack of deepness in building characters, relations and even the maturing of the idea of walking a high wire and organizing the coup was pith-less and unconvincing. Not to mention the overacting by J.G.Levitt through the whole movie that results in perceiving the protagonist as a dull, arrogant and unpleasant character.In the same time, there is not enough action to compensate the viewer for the hollow script and make the watching entertaining. With a proper direction and without the comedy style representation of the story this could be much more worthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie is Plain, Not Very Exciting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is shallow. The plot is boring; conversations between characters are very loud. Acting was not good; the acting was focused on changing accent. Cut away the noise from the conversations, the movie is plain. This should not be made into a movie, but a documentary.Philippe Petit is a trained professional, so there is not too much drama about the whole thing. He had a great idea of walking across the twin tower building, but that's about as exciting as it gets. Yes, this movie is for family, but I would rather see a documentary about the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best use of CGI ever for a movie in a long time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk is probably the best use of CGI or 3D in the history of the world it's amazing how a film that didn't make a lot of money or isn't the big blockbuster of the year has much better cgi than most superhero films or TV series have. Also the cast and the acting is superb Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ben Kingsley were by far the 2 best characters in the film and the direction was amazing too Robert Zemeckis did an excellent job with the camera. My favorite scene was when the cops tried to catch him and he was going back and forth to the wire and he was doing all this crazy things and his feet was bleeding definitely an amazing film and it's not that big surprise that it got some very excellent reviews it deserved it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uplifting Homage to the Human Spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Prime Example of Film as an Inspirational and Uplifting Artform to Counterbalance the Slings and Arrows that Hollywood Endures Routinely concerning its Decadence and Contribution to the Decline of Western Civilization.There's always room for This Type of Homage to the Angels of Light that reside and are often Overshadowed by the "Sons of Darkness" that appear on the Nightly News. It's a Refreshing Reminder what We are capable of and what can be Accomplished defying all known Laws of Humanity and the Universe.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is so well Grounded in this Role of the Real-Life Phillipe that the Performance is as Wonderful as the SFX and that's Saying Something. The Film is an Innocent Family Entertainment that Bridges Cultures and Races, Connects Souls from Everywhere, and is a Welcome Piece of Art that Unifies Language and Religious Differences because the Backdrop is Nothing less than the Middle Ground between Man and the Heavens.When Philippe Petit is "On the Wire" there is no Language, Religion, Borders, or Conflicts of any kind as He says Simply..."It was peaceful." That's what this Movie is...A Peaceful Entertainment about a Real Life Man in a Surreal Situation. Training His Mind and Body to Venture where "No Man had gone before."An Audience Friendly Homage to a Remarkable Man and Two Twin Icons that Tragically now Only Exist in the Human Spirit, but will Live there "Forever".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining -- be prepared to be drawn in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review will be very short. I loved the telling of the story of the wire walker. Why he walks, and his experiences with people along the way that make him so. I liked all the characters and the actors were all very believable. Papa Rudy was very likable, and Annie was very charming. Then came the films scenes of the walk itself.... never in my life have the palms of my hands sweated while watching a film. After all it's just a movie, right? Be that as it may I had to pause this film, and get a handkerchief, take calming breaths before restarting the walking sequence. Captivated, and clutching the handkerchief with my hand also covering my gaping mouth I un-paused the walking sequence of this film. I can only remember one other time being that drawn into a movie moment. That time came in Star Wars on the big screen 1977 when Luke flew into the canyon around the Death Star.Interestingly enough after such a build up to a mountainous thrill, the movie seems to end on a melancholy note. (IMHO)All in All very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nostalgia on a wire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film works on several levels, all of which, except one, work because of things external to the filmmaking itself.-the story is so unbelievable that it would sound simply silly if it hadn't really happened. You get into it because it resonates as a fabricated movie reality like, say, 007 falling off a bridge into a waterfall after getting shot in a shoulder and showing up a couple of scenes later having a drink in some tropical beach. But than, you feel amazed because before you went to see the film you probably knew already that the story actually happened, more or less as it is told. Watching the documentary about the real story, that came out some years ago will help frame this story;-the story is as clear and pure as a wire stretched over a void between 2 skyscrapers. Walking on the wire stands for overcoming one's limitations, fulfilling a dream, achieving something. Transgression as the necessary means to an end. The sense of going all the way, to get to your goals;-what works on a deeply cinematic level is the deepness of the space, and how the 3D enhances the whole thing. This is one of the best uses of 3D i've ever experienced. The feeling of walking on a wire at a 300m height is amazing, and i know it because Zemeckis showed it to me. I thank him, this really broke ground regarding what can be done, now that so many films come out in 3D versions just for the sake of it;-and of course we know what happened later... 9/11 inevitably frames all the narratives regarding the twin towers that you can possibly think of, regardless of whether they were conceived before or after 2001. Even films like "three days of the condor" can no longer be watched without the narrative of the attacks (nostalgic or political, whatever serves you best) in the background. Who made this movie knew it, and used it to a great power and effect, without mentioning it.4/5</fullReview>

But does this make the movie in any way bad? I say, this movie gets a 10/10! It is well made, with good actors, suspense, a story told in a interesting way. And you know what: Even if the end of the movie is clear, when you see it your emotions go into overdrive. It's amazing! A guy wants to walk on a wire between tower 1 and 2 of the world trade center. Sounds simple, doesn't it?! This guy did something that made him live more than 99,999999% of the other people. Nobody is really free in this world, we are all bound to something or somebody. But you can feel free, you can feel connected. And Philippe Petit felt more free for a moment than most people will ever do in their safety net lifes...Anyway, this movie did a great job painting a picture of Philippe Petit's story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's a movie that carried by director and screenwriters, this movie will take the cake. They appreciated the power of a good storytelling, and I'm in awe! Many Screenwriters and Director always fail to see this and build the tension out of nowhere without decent build up story. The man from The U.N.C.L.E is the prime example. This drama will be boring start at the first act to second act, if not handle properly. But this writers and particularly this director is just so genius and know exactly how to build a narrative and connect the the second act to the last without random intensity for the sake of intensity without purpose to the plot. It's just well executed. If there is something I critics, I wish they build Philipe's Petit desire to walk across between two tower more slowly, so it will be more believable and more relatable, You would thing despite his background, He was insane to think that. But thanks to first act, I can relate to his desire because there is people that has talent to do something and has drive / desire to challenge himself more, they tend to think a crazy think. It's well executed movie, and if there is someone who called it boring, they don't know how a good story-telling is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Walk is a movie that I recommend everyone should watch. It is a movie which doesn't rely on theatrics but the story itself is the main factor which intrigues the audience. The way it is told through the eyes of the main character and allows you to see his perspective makes the story even more captivating. It allows the audience to believe that anything is possible if you put your mind to it and that dreams do come true. The tag that its based on a true story may seem like a publicity stunt to increase appeal but this movie does actually have a truth behind it and a story to which it does full justice to.The movie is based on the story of Philipe Petit a high wire artist who wanted to achieve his dream of walking between the void of the twin towers. The journey that we are shown just draws us in and make his dream your own. We want him to achieve his goal no matter what and overcome the obstacles he faces. The relationships he forms along the way are commendable and play a big part in his 'mission'. It shows the reality of true life and that everyone needs people they can rely on and trust in their life.When Philipe is about to reach his goal and faces the hurdles of attaching his wire there is that moment when you wish that he fixes it and that you could be there to help. Finally the moment arrives when he steps on the wire and it is not only breathtaking but it brings a tear to your eye. You feel proud of the ability of people.There is a bit of humour when Philipe is trying to evade the police but even then you see the determination within him and how he earns the respect of everyone and makes a place for himself in history.This movie takes you on an emotional ride hut in the end leaves you with happiness and makes you ponder on your own dreams and develop faith that you can achieve them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Astonishing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk is a masterpiece with a captivating story and brilliant acting by Joseph-Gordon Levitt who plays Phillipe Petit in the movie. Robert Zemeckis who has given outstanding movies like Forrest Gump, Cast away, Flight and many has again been successful in creating a movie that's kind of heroic tale. Directing a movie based on someone's life is very difficult to make however thanks to Zemeckis direction, Levitt's strong performance and brilliantly used CG effects. It feels like heaven when I watched the movie. The walk may be in the run for Oscars for 2015 with beautiful crafted masterpiece. Its great by Zemeckis to bring to the world the impossible made possible by a common person. Fantastic job Zemeckis. I am rating 9/10 for this movie which was one of the best movies of 2015.</fullReview>

Special effects of the walk itself are amazing - you can truly feel yourself up there, as close as it is possible. The movie itself is highly entertaining, and although i have seen superb documentary "Man of Wire" i still was intrigued by the this movie. It is expertly paced, very well acted by all involved, beautifully photographed and as i have mentioned, the walk itself looks stunning. Overall, "The Walk" is a highly entertaining "good feel" movie. This is superbly made movie for whole family even for the youngest. Absolutely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will stronger than steel wire - a movie that every person with a calling should watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without any beating around the bush: The Walk was one of the best movies I've seen this year, and considering the titles of 2015, that is as good a compliment as it gets. I have to admit, I am not a biography kind of person, but occasionally I make exceptions, and this time it was a wise decision. The movie: we're trying to avoid spoilers, so let's just say, there are more than enough reasons to watch this title. First and foremost the script was written based on the life and biggest performance of a man so incredible that his real life story was even crazier than the movie.Second, the script, the shots, the music, the characters are all fantastic. Mr. Zemeckis and all the people working on this movie did an excellent job. Other than a few (as in very few) less than ideal CG effects, I had absolutely no complaint whatsoever. The modeling of the WTC, the scenery, everything is fantastic. They took so much care when modeling the towers, even the then still visible I-beams on the top are the same as on the original photos of Monsieur Petit's performance. I could go on for a few thousand more characters about what's great in this movie, let's just say: it's a must watch, go and see for yourself, it'll be worth your time!The actors: Mr. Gordon-Levitt - I have to admit, I've been a fan of this young gentleman for a long time now. From excellent supporting roles (The Dark Knight Rises, Inception, Lincoln) to great leads (Looper, a very underrated movie in my opinion; 50/50, A Dame to Kill for, Brick) the ever growing résumé of this talented young man has its new crown jewel in my humble opinion. The French accent he learned is worth an Oscar in itself. His acting in this movie was impeccable. Mr. Badge Dale - I must mention Mr. Dale. He's been performing in supporting roles for quite some time now, and I really feel like he deserves to finally play a lead role in a great movie. I loved him in The Pacific as Peaches, one of the most memorable characters through the series, and he appeared in numerous well known movies and TV episodes (The Departed, Shame, World War Z, Iron Man 3, 24). He also did a great job in The Walk.Final thoughts: I must admit, this was a surprise movie for me. When I first saw the trailer, it immediately spurred my interest (Levitt's fantastic French accent and the visuals of the Towers did the trick for sure), but didn't expect it to be this good. This was a really moving film for me, and I can only recommend you go and watch it. Most of the audience was crying towards the end, even men. In my opinion, one of the tell-tale signs of a great movie is you never know when it is goingto end. The Walk is just like this. It's a biography movie, but it's as exciting as any fictional story (thanks to Monsieur Petit's crazy life), the acting is fantastic, and the excellent music makes it all work like a charm. Even if you just want an exciting movie that entertains without too much depth, you'll like it, but the real magic of this movie is Petit's mentality. This movie shows the importance of having a goal we are ready to sacrifice anything for, even our life. We, humans were meant to experience this feeling, this kind of devotion, the selflessness it gives us, and that is what Petit was searching for. This movie shows it beautifully. Go and watch it! A suggestion: watch it in 3D, this movie was meant to be watched like this. Also, as mentioned above, Levitt's accent and French speaking parts are marvelous. If you are not a native English speaker, I'd highly recommend watching this movie with subtitles, dubbed versions would ruin it. Enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zemeckis scores again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his 3-D animation "trilogy" of Polar Express, Beowulf, and A Christmas Carol I thought Robert Zemeckis had lost a step and wasn't the same great director he was before. I didn't mind Polar Express but Beowulf was underwhelming and A Christmas Carol was a Jim Carrey movie not made in the 20th century so enough said. Then that opinion was completely erased with Flight. Zemeckis churned out another multi-Oscar nominated movie with a good story and awesome acting to compliment the top of the line special effects.And then he did it again with The Walk. If you read up on anything at all about Phillipe Petit or Joseph Gordon-Levitt's studying with him then you must know that Petit does not fall to his death in this film. But just like Flight, you knew the character would survive but the scene was so perfectly executed you were on the edge of your seat with tension.The story of Petit is focused on his early days as a Parisian street performer and how he accidentally, perhaps it was fate, stumbles upon a photo of the soon to be completed World Trade Center towers. This inspires him to hang a high wire between them and walk it. Helping him along this journey is a very good supporting cast highlighted by Charlotte Lebon as Petit's lover, Annie, and the always excellent Sir Ben Kingsley as his mentor Papa Rudy.The first two acts of the movie cover Petit's insatiable thirst to create this work of art or "coup" as it is commonly referred to in the film. His drive to accomplish this feat often leaves his accomplices and lover left in the dust as far he's concerned. But this drive is what made this man pull off one of the greatest stunts in history.Because this was a highly illegal feat, the planning of this stunt made the movie feel like a classic heist movie. But instead of robbing a bank or a casino, they steal a piece of the sky. One thing that has always bothered me as a moviegoer is when two people who's native tongue is not English speak English to each other whilst alone. This movie does a great job of erasing that annoyance of mine.Then we get to the actual walk. I admit with no shame that I am deathly afraid of heights so when I heard people were getting nauseous at screenings I was hesitant to see this in IMAX 3-D. Boy was I glad I went anyway. For obvious reasons, we know this walk wasn't shot on location with practical effects but the CGI was so good you would think they rebuilt the towers for this movie. The aerial shots were scary as hell, they got my heart pounding but thankfully my acrophobia was held in check.The 15 minutes we get with Petit on the wire are some of the most intense minutes ever put on film. This is the moment where you realize that only Zemeckis and a handful of other directors could pull this off. Petit wrote a book about this, a great documentary was released about it, and Gordon-Levitt studied with him, he lives. But there are moments that make you think Petit might actually fall to his death and suffer the consequences of his own hubris. And it's all thanks to Robert Zemeckis.If you have an IMAX theater near you, this IS one of those movies where it's completely worth the $15+ ticket price. It's a great family film about a man who won't quit on his dream no matter how impossible it might seem. Almost every movie made after 9/11 referencing the WTC towers has tried to play on the tragedy of their destruction, this film does not do that. This film showcases the beauty of these buildings and how Petit's walk turned the opinion on them from "ugly filing cabinets" to "a New York icon." This, like almost all of Zemeckis' live action movies, can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone and everyone. A great movie-going experience.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only really bad thing that comes to mind when thinking about The Walk is the narration. It's overdone to say the least. Rather than showing and letting us feel the events the movie tries to hold the audiences hand by over-describing everything. As if the makers were scared we wouldn't get it and it takes away from the magic of the film.Joseph Gordon-Levitt's accent was silly and over the top. I don't understand why they just didn't get a French guy if they wanted things to be authentic. However it doesn't take from the movie much and somewhat fits with the mood of the film.Other than those things The Walk was very enjoyable and fun. What immediately struck me was how vivid and colourful it is. In an era of the grim and gritty it's a welcome difference.The Walk is a funny film and at times seems like a straight up comedy. So much that you sometimes begin to question is this really based on true events, though that's not really saying anything bad about it. It works for what it is.At times The Walk is almost like a heist film and the setup for the whole thing is very engaging. It is definitely a film that left me with positive emotions and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zemeckis is such an underrated filmmaker, he never gets into the conversation of all-time greats and every time I see a film of his I am reminded how wrong is that. This is not to say that "The Walk" is a perfect movie, but it living proof of how intelligent Zemeckis' filmaking is, how smart his decisions are and ultimately how creative he is.Many have discounted this film saying: just see the documentary (Man on Wire 2008), and whilst I see where those arguments are coming from it is a way too easy and cheap conversation to be had because with its two hours this film earns its place as a feature.Now I should interrupt the party I am having and acknowledge that there are elements which don't work: firstly the narration is just out of place. After some time you think you got used to it, but then it comes back reminding you how weird it is. It simply messes with the flow and criminally speaks every emotion that is going through leaving almost no space for conveying the emotions through cinema and performance. This also leaves out space for a lot of the supporting cast, which is really given not much to do and just hangs around. Moreover the first half, more or less, just does not know what it is. Its tone is all over the place, there are constant weird switches that keep making it really noticeably uneven.Yet, even with all of that, Zemeckis is just too charming of a director. He know how to keep his audience interested, how to build tension and how to stick with the characters even if they don't have the uttermost depth. So we end up with a second half that manages to figure out its tone and from there it is simply fascinating up until the end. The tension is always palpable and I was truly on the edge of my seat multiple times.Joseph Godron-Levitt, one of my personal heroes, delivers another good performance even if it might not be up to standard with some of his other amazing work. We are also treated do remarkable visuals that nail the setting. The sound is impeccable and the music continues the streak of great soundtracks we have had this year. Of course the most important element is conveying the height and the filmmakers really nail it. The blend of CGI and practical is breathtaking and didn't fail in almost any shot.This is simply another very good Zemeckis flick, that is always a reminder of the joy of going to the cinema even though it does not have much fascination for a re-watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zemeckis capturing the human spirit once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"People ask me "Why do you risk death?". For me, this is life."I could've probably decided to spend my Back to the Future Day yesterday watching Robert Zemeckis's classic Blockbuster film, but instead I decided to catch up with his latest movie: The Walk. Zemeckis is one of those directors who is always ahead of the curve when it comes to technology and innovation in the film industry although his risks don't always pay off. A Christmas Carol, Beowulf, and The Polar Express are examples of this, although I was pleased to finally seeing him take a more conservative approach with Flight. It did take me by surprise because it ended up being a completely different movie from what I was expecting, but it worked. The Walk combines some of his innovative techniques delivering some impressive images at the height of the twin towers, but it also is a conventional biopic. If you've seen the fabulous 2008 documentary, Man on Wire, directed by James Marsh then you basically know the narrative of this film because both screenplays are based on the same book "To Reach the Clouds," written by Philippe Petit himself. Petit is played here by the talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt and if you were unaware of who this man was in real life then you might think he is exaggerating the character because he is such a vibrant and effusive person. But thankfully after seeing Man on Wire I can honestly say that he nailed the role because that's exactly how he sounded all the time as he passionately spoke about his dream of crossing the void between the two World Trade Center towers on a high wire. Zemeckis follows his story closely and delivers a film about a man who would stop at nothing to achieve his goal. Perhaps we may not identify with this man's passion, but it is still inspiring nonetheless and it makes for an entertaining watch.The trailer for The Walk is probably the only one that I've seen that focuses on the climax of the story. The selling point for this movie is the fantastic visuals of Philippe walking through the clouds on a thin wire, but I actually found the build up for it much more entertaining. Getting to experience Philippe's conception of his dream and then following the recruiting process as these characters who enter his life also become passionate about his crazy dream is the highlight of the film for me. Even the actual operation to get to the top of the building is a much more fascinating watch then simply watching the spectacle in the air, so I must admit that the trailers don't give away the most important aspect of this film which is celebrating this man's passion. The Walk is an inspirational and uplifting film, while at the same time it's also a love letter to New York and the World Trade Center. It seems that many people are still not ready to watch films centering on the towers, but this might be the best way to commemorate them and what they represented. The Walk is a conventional biopic, but at the same time it manages to incorporate elements of a heist movie because everything had to be perfectly orchestrated in order for Philippe and his men to attach the wires through both towers. It has its moments of suspense and even comedy because the relationship between these characters is solid. They somehow all realize that it's worth risking their freedom in order to help this friend achieve his goal. Philippe is a mad man, but he is so convincing at the same time that it's hard to say no to. The supporting performances in this film from Ben Kingsley (who plays Philippe's mentor, Papa Rudy), Charlotte Le Bon, Clement Sibony, Cesar Domboy, and James Badge Dale are all fascinating, but it is Joseph Gordon-Levitt who carries this film along with the breathtaking visuals from Zemeckis. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspirational and fun to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Zemeckis's The Walk is a fun and entertaining film. The low box office does not do it justice, this movie could make it in my top ten for the year. I was not familiar with the story and had not seen the documentary Man on Wire, but I figured the act would be completed or this wouldn't have inspired so many. I don't know the accuracy of the details but the story was not clouded by over explanation. Despite my foreknowledge and the voice-over, I thought the tension was compelling. I wanted to see this in the theater and in 3D because I figured the visuals would be breathtaking and I was not disappointed. I would recommend seeing this on a big screen but even if not, this movie is great as a story. The biggest flaw, and not that big of one, was the French accent of Joseph Gordon- Levitt. It could have been a lot worse and wasn't grating but I often think they should hire an actual French actor so the accent doesn't feel so forced. As I mentioned, there was a voice-over so this accent kept popping up in the most intense moments when it might have been better to leave it to the visuals. One thing that struck me from this movie was how inspirational the Twin Towers were when they were first built and throughout their existence. They were not just a symbol for New York or America but a symbol for humanity and though the tragedy can not be anymore terrible, watching this feat play out was a grim reminder of the tragic past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Walk is actually a marathon of inspiring emotions and dreams! ..so He actually did hang a high-wire between the two tallest building of the world &amp; had a majestic walk on it!"The Walk" is actually a marathon of inspiring emotions and dream in one's soul &amp; body. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is just wonderful in this one, he has portrayed Philippe Petit's image with an ease. He do looks professional high-wire walker and a Frenchman. This real story is all about if one have faith in himself and the guts to achieve his dream, he can surely accomplish it with his consistent efforts. The film justifies the definition of a dreamer.I, just found the narration lil sloppy, like it was that easy to come to the final act. I'm sure many more hurdles than what shown have came across Philippe Petit's journey to his walk. The narrative part was not in a maturity level, what it would have deserved. Nevertheless, it is still a Technical Achievement. The last final act of the wall is really what one would've never experienced. And, if you are well connected with the character, you find your eyes been slightly wet. I did find mine during last 20 minutes. Robert Zemeckis created some magic there as soon as Joseph's puts his first step on that wire. Mesmerizing.In the end, I would say give your salute to Philippe Petit's &amp; the makers. And, Get Inspired!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Walk is a 2015 American 3D biographical drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Christopher Browne and Zemeckis. It is based on the story of French high-wire artist Philippe Petit's walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on August 7, 1974.A must watch for all movie lovers. Joseph Gordon Levitt does a phenomenal job playing Philipppe and exudes unbridled enthusiasm,irresistible charm and innate bashfulness inherent to the character. Mind blowing direction and cinematography.Director Robert Zemeckis has done a wonderful job in recreating the actual events of Petit's life.Ben Kingsley add to the story immensely, including completing the angles for the romance and comedy little inserts which further enrich this movie's experience. Last 1 hour of the movie is worth every penny spending for this movie.Inspiring enough for anybody who has any kind of fear.</fullReview>

My favorite character is Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) because he is just flat-out amazing and super believable!My favorite scene is when Philippe is facing his biggest dream of tightrope walking between the twin towers. They were 140 feet apart and 110 stories high! This scene is so realistic and exhilarating that my palms were sweaty and other audience members were squirming in their seats.Philippe says that high-wire artists are never supposed to look down when tightrope walking. Does he heed his own advice?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A okay watch until the last 30 min when The Walk takes it up 100 notches, and the film just takes your breath away...Literally!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most of the runtime while watching The Walk one is left a little underwhelmed, one waits for that one moment that was seen in the trailer to "wow" you. Well The Walk is one film that is a lead up to the last 30 min of the film, and let me tell you those last 30 min, get your heart pounding, you feel dizzy as though you not Philipe Petit is was walking across the the world trade centre, on just a metal rope. Its one of the best 30 mins you will see in a film this year. But unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't have such a impact as those 30 mins do, but more on that later. What Philipe Petit teaches us through this film is something one should cherish forever, that dreams do come true, doesn't matter how crazy they are, because what can be more crazy than, being on rope for 45 min, which is across the twins towers,100 floors up. The Walk is based on the true story of how Philipe Petit walked across the newly built twin towers in New York on August,6 1974. The film is narrated throughout by Philipe, and one sees how as a kid watching the circus influenced him to become a tight rope walker. How when he grew older, after his dad kicked Philipe out of the house (because he thought he was circus monkey)he performs circus acts on the streets of Paris to fulfill his artistic needs. One day at the dentists office he sees the picture of Twin Towers that are being built in New York, which are the tallest buildings in the world, and says I will walk across the towers, and show every who I am, that I can do the impossible. Filled with his crazy ambition with the help of his accomplices, he starts saving money, and training to do the impossible walk across the twin towers.Acting wise the film stand on Joseph Gordon-Levitt's shoulders and he gives his career best performance. He get all the nuances of a tight rope walker right, his french is superb, and he fits into the role like a glove. He shadows the whole film, and not much scope is given to the others to perform. His hard works pays off, he is just outstanding.The Walk, does many things exceedingly well, the VFX are top notch, nothing feels fake, one can compare these effects to the best of the films made in Hollywood. The twin tower sequence felt so real, and amazing. The casting especially that of making JSL into Philipe was perfect. But the film still falters a lot until the last 30-40 mins. While the film is very engaging at many instances, its funny etc,there are times the film drags, and one is left disinterested.The whole planning of doing the twin tower walk is interesting at first but later it just drags.His whole growing up phase is only good for awhile too.At times things happen so easily in the film that one feels like something is missing, like the director left out something in the edit. However the last 30 mins make up for any minuses in the film, the twiner tower walk is something that captivates your mind. It one of the best sequences seen in any film in awhile, its something you have to watch to believe. Its a breathtaking sequence?Literally it is.Overall people thought Philipe Petit was down right crazy, but he did the impossible, he is a hero, and to salute this hero, one should watch The Walk, because even though the film is not perfect, you will leave the theatre inspired. The film's last 30 mins is worth the ticket price alone.And please do yourself a favour and too fully experience the film watch it in IMAX 3D.3.5/5* or 7/10</fullReview>

And if it is true that the technology nowadays allows us a vivid and immersive experience (thanks IMAX 3D), and that together with the good acting by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ben Kingsley they bring this film to a 7, it still falls way too short of what such a story can bring, as it was brilliantly done at Man on Wire. Mind you, it is still a good reason to go to the cinema, but if you can only pick one film about Philippe Petit, go for Man on Wire. That one is a hell of a piece of storytelling!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie this year since Inside out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is a story based on a documentary called "Man on wire". I've always loved the story of Phillipe, ever since I heard about it in a sweet and simple picture book. I even watched the documentary, which was nice, but it felt like it was too much of back-round information. Now that we have my introduction, lets go into detail.Now this story is a drama about a true story about a French boy who's always has the wildest dream that always gets him in trouble: Tight rope walking. He hears about 2 towers in New York city that are super tall and plans to walk between them on a cable. The story is very detailed, but the problem is that the back story showing the boy as an 8 year old is pretty rushed and focuses on the main subject more. Its not that fast paced, or slow paced either. Its just right.The special effects are really beautiful for its $35 million dollar budget. Sure it doesn't have any actual locations, but then again, that's OK. It's spectacular and it really kicks in at the scene where he's (spoiler) walking the towers. I mean, let's look at the Maze runner movie. It doesn't have a big budget, but it's visuals are amazing. This film is no different.A for the characters, the main character is very 3-dimesoinal and it strongly shows his thoughts along with his girl friend Annie. His accomplices for his mission don't really develop, but that's OK. As for the man that Phillipe asks for help, he's grumpy at first but then starts appreciating him, making him a developed character. So there is a lot to offer with these characters.This may've bombed at the box office, but it really doesn't deserve it. The walk is a fantastic movie you should walk to the theater to. I highly recommend it. It is fantastic. I wonder if the upcoming peanuts movie can top this one, and I hope it gets at least on par. I hope this box office failure becomes a classic like the 1999 Iron giant movie that failed at the box office as well. I hope it gets nominated for best picture at the Oscars along with Inside out. I recommend this to over 10-11 due to mild language/brief nudity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phillippe Petit narrates his story of his 1974 wire-walking between the World Trade Center twin towers. He starts from when he found wire- walking as a kid in France when the circus comes to town featuring the Omankowski wire-walkers. Phillippe learned by himself until he grew bigger. Once he sneaked in the wire-walk tent to practice, and got caught by Papa Rudy, the Omankowski's leader. Phillppe showed his talents at juggling so Papa Rudy lets him in on learning wire-walking techniques. When Phillippe waited at a dentist, he found a magazine article about the WTC towers to be erected, which would be the highest in the world. From then his dream was to wire-walk between them. His father threw him out of the house so he lived by juggling on the street, illegally hanging his wire rope on Parisian street posts. He met a street musician Annie as they squabble about stolen audiences. Phillippe took her to dinner and promised he'd have the street as long as she's not playing. He shared his dream and she was willing to support him.Annie showed him a place to freely hang his wire and practice. There he met an adventurous photographer Jean Louis. Phillippe goes back to Papa Rudy for detailed technicalities; knots, wire varieties, strength and so on. Papa Rudy charges him from his juggling money. But eventually he returns all the money saying the secret is theirs now. Phillippe got a legal gig to wire-walk on a lake, but he botched it and felt awful because the audience didn't care about him. He finds the cathedral Notre-Damme's twin towers for his next illegal gig. He, Annie, and Jean Louis staged the wire and Phillippe walked his wire as the first tourists come. Of course Phillippe got arrested after that, but as he's freed Annie showed him a newspaper with an article about his Notre-Damme feat and another article of the WTC towers being almost completed. He saw this as a sign. Phillippe and Annie went to New York to survey the spot. He got discouraged as he found it hard to get access. But he struck his luck seeing an opened door a worker left behind. He found his way up to the roof and lifted back his spirit up.Back in France, they staged a mock-up training spot. Phillippe visited Papa Rudy for advice but he suggested that Phillippe wears a safety line, to which he rejected. Jean Louis came with Jean Francois or Jeff. They flied back to NYC and Phillippe went to WTC everyday, spying on it. He accidentally met his inside man Barry Greenhouse. Barry works on the 82nd floor of the North tower. He saw the Notre-Damme gig. They met another American to help, JP, who recommended two others; Albert and David. The night before the feat, Phillippe got nervous and went a little crazy, but Annie calmed him down. As the day came, Phillippe, David and Jeff got to the South Tower, and Jean Louis and Albert to the North Tower. Phillippe and Jeff got stranded, balancing on an I beam, hiding from a guard. But eventually they passed the guard and rigged the wire and support cables.As morning dawned Phillippe started his walk, even after losing his costume and not having time to recheck the rigging. Annie and JP down below sees him and grabbed pedestrians' attention. Phillippe crossed the void between the towers but soon went back on the wire. He stayed there as police arrived on the roof, and practically toyed with them. He took his time to salute his audience and even looked down to them. Eventually he goes off his wire, braving the wobble on his last three steps. He got arrested but the judge sentenced him to entertain kids in Central Park. Jean Louis and Annie went back to France, Phillippe stayed in NYC, and he got a special pass from the towers' architect to the roof. The story nicely dramatizes the true story. This is quite a feat because unlike other true stories being brought to the movies, Philippe's story had been publicized more than once, particularly in his own book, and the 2008 documentary Man on Wire. I personally enjoyed Man on Wire, and had a little doubt of how this movie can play more to the story. But it turns out to be good as this movie added the scope of the story to include Phillippe's childhood, thus gave it more emotional content.Cinematography-wise I see many reference in visualization to the earlier Man on Wire, especially the Parisian street performance and the French training spot scenes. I really like how the movie's drama really enrich the real attraction of the twin tower wire-walk itself. The emotional content and sense anxiety for of achievement are really strong in this movie.Acting wise, I like how Phillippe's story gets told in this way. I must say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt was indeed a great choice. Although he is facially a far fetch from the real Phillippe Petit, but his totality in acting has really reached a lot, including the masterful impersonation of Petit, from his speech accents, mannerisms, and the spirit which Phillippe narrates with. Everyone who had watched Man on Wire can speedily see the real Phillippe in Gordn-Levitt's portrayal. Charlotte Le Bon and Ben Kingsley add to the story immensely, including completing the angles for the romance and comedy little inserts which further enrich this movie's experience.My say for The Walk (2015) is a definite 8 out of 10 score, and a recommendation to go see it in the cinemas. I didn't had the luxury of seeing it in 3D or IMAX, but I'm sure it will definitely worth your money if you do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the age of 8, when he first witnessed tightrope artists in a circus, Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) was destined to become a wire-walker. As a teenager, after seeing a photograph of the World Trade Center towers in New York, he sets his sights on wire-walking between the two monumental structures. From humble beginnings in Paris as a street performer (and a constant target for arrest by police, as he doesn't believe in permits), to leaving home to pursue his interests, to picking up advice and instruction from Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley), one of the greatest acrobats in the field, to tackling the public display of walking between the towers of the Notre-Dame cathedral, Petit prepares himself for the daredevil waltz across the tallest buildings in the world.To perform the artistic ? and illegal ? "coup of the century," Petit recruits his girlfriend Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) and his photographer pal Jean-Louis (Clement Sibony), as well as a young math teacher called Jeff (Cesar Domboy), to journey to the United States, where they will need additional accomplices to conduct research and observation on the towers - one of which is still undergoing construction. After months of practice, spying on workers and shifts, figuring out how to elude security guards and to stay in the building after hours (aided by inside man Barry, played by Steve Valentine), arranging for ropes and wires to be passed back and forth between the skyscrapers, and calculating the necessary stabilizing lines, anchor points, and cavelletti for properly securing the steel cable, Petit is finally ready for the main event. And, on August 6th, 1974, he finally has his chance to tackle the most daring of all wire-walking stunts.At first, the film presents a rather abrasive narration, breaking the fourth wall to have Levitt spout a distracting French accent. But, just like a few pacing problems resulting from devising a backstory and various relationships, the grand build to the climax helps viewers to forget everything beforehand. Director Robert Zemeckis also goes overboard with artistic embellishments, such as blaring music, still photography, slow-motion, and flashbacks within flashbacks. With plenty of special effects at his disposal, he never refrains from utilizing them all, though none of the gimmicks can best the awe of the recreations of the Twin Towers and the vertiginous aerial shots of the central stunt itself."The Walk" does possess a certain verve, an energy that succeeds in transforming this single, newsworthy occurrence into a cinematic entity, quite suitable for a feature-length dramatization of true events. Gobs of melodramatic characters are added to give the story extra heart ? including a father figure, a best friend, and a love interest ? while plenty of comedy works its way into the script. And, in the last half-hour, the suspense is exhausting, boasting a "Mission: Impossible"-styled series of hair-raising near-misses and looming interferences that threaten Petit's endeavor. Interestingly, the possibility of death or injury is never as menacing as the potential of getting caught by the police. Though the conclusion - conceived to wrap up personal relationships and pay tribute to the World Trade Center - loses steam, the headlining stunt is exhilaratingly triumphant, saving the picture from any earlier creative and technical troubles.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will preface this with two things: 1) I only do reviews for the "common man"; I'm not a film critic and I don't dive deep into technical aspects with my rating; my rating is based on if the film is worth the money, and how much I enjoyed it. 2) I don't normally write reviews but I had to throw my hat in the ring since the only other review right now is a 5/10 from some critic who doesn't know how to enjoy a movie.That being said, I thought this film was great! I had a screening for it and had absolutely no expectations going in, I avoid trailers, so I hadn't even seen that. It turns out I live under a big rock, because I didn't know how the movie was going to end even though it portrays a real life event, and even has a documentary that came out a few years ago (Man on a Wire).The movie begins with JGL speaking into the camera, with a french accent, as the narrator and telling us what is going on. At first it took me a second to adjust to JGL with a french accent, and also the way they tell the story with JGL seemingly breaking the fourth wall was kind of weird, but I very quickly adjusted to it as the story completely wrapped me up into Philippe Petit's world.The bottom line is this: Robert Zemeckis is a great storyteller and he completely sucked me in; I felt like I was an inside man watching the team try to pull off the "artistic con of the century." The movie has heart, it made me care about Philippe Petit and his striving for the impossible. I highly recommend seeing it in IMAX as the visuals are spectacular and seriously will make sit on the edge of your seat as they give you first person shots of what Petit would be seeing.</fullReview>

Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays a joy that one can only imagine, being that high up in command of the earth and the sky. After the film, I had to go online to see photos of the actual event, and indeed, there is a shot of Phillipe on the wire, all of NYC laid out below, with a broad smile on his face. Go see The Walk.

		<shortDescription>The Walk Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philippe Petit: "People always ask me "why do you risk death"? For me, this is life".The Walk is based on a true story of Philippe Petit, a French high- wire artist, and his group of friends, who staged an unauthorized attempt to cross the World Trade Center Twin Towers in 1974.Robert Zemeckis is very well known now for using groundbreaking technology as a style of film making. It make's every scene in he's films look absolutely jaw dropping and visually stunning. That's why Robert Zeneckis always wanted to make this movie so badly, so he can take that stunning visual style that he has and put it to the big screen. Zemeckis has said in an interview that "His Entire Career Has Been Preparation for The Walk", so that right there shows Zeneckis strong interest on the story and how he can easily adapted a story like this into a film. We already know he can do it, I mean this is the same director who made Forrest Gump for crying out loud, so him failing seems impossible at this point. But I needed to see the film myself to judge and while knowing the film has positive reviews, I need to judge myself.After seeing "The Walk", I can safely say that Zemeckis nailed it once again as this movie was great.Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a solid job playing Philippe Petit. Gordon- Levitt really got into his character, because he actually learned wire walking and how to do it correctly by Philippe Petit himself. I know a lot of people have been talking about Joseph Gordon-Levitt french accent in the movie and how out of place it can be, and yes I do admit it did take me off guard a bit, but I got use to it after awhile. But here's the thing; Philippe Petit doesn't have an normal french accent and I think Gordon-Levitt did a great job emulating that. I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt did the best performance he could have done and I got to give him credit for that and I'm standing by that.Robert Zemeckis directed this movie and as I said before; Zemeckis knows how to push the boundaries of CGI technology with the movie he made such as: Back to the Future, Who framed Roger Rabbit and Forrest Gump. And Zemeckis once again did an excellent job telling an interesting story and the use of CGI bleeding in perfectly with the environment that the movie is set in. Robert Zemeckis is the man for the job when it comes to film making like this and he did such an amazing job directing this movie. Nicely done Zemeckis.The second act of the movie where he starts to walk across the wire between the twin towers was absolutely amazing and also terrifying, because I have this thing with heights and I can go vertigo easily. I sawed the movie in IMAX 3D and my god the 3D in this movie worked so incredibly well that I literally felt like I was up there with Gordon-Levitt. My hands were sweating, my heart was pumping and the sequence itself was truly spectacular.The visual effect's in this movie are so perfectly executed and so beautiful to look at. I would go this far and call it flawless CGI as it's truly stunning.Now for the problems: The first half of the movie felt a little underwhelming and a bit slow for me. It felt a bit dragged out with some of the scenes and it made the pasting seem a little slow.Overall The Walk may have a slow first half, but the second act of the film is so perfectly executed and it's absolutely worth seeing in IMAX. The acting is great, the directing is fantastic, the visual effect's are stunning and the 3D is worth the price of a ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phillipe Petit shocked the entire world when he was seen walking on a high-wire cable, secured between the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in New York City during its construction. Over one-hundred stories above ground, walking on a wire barely an inch wide, Phillipe could've lost his balanced and plunged to his death at any second. However, that didn't seem to be the story that spilled its way into the public; the focus was more on this unassuming Frenchman and his love for risking his life and facing his potential fate in a head-on, fearless manner. Petit believed, in a sense, that risking your life was the only way to know and feel that you were indeed alive.Petit's story has become widely known and discussed thank to "Man on Wire," a fantastic 2008 documentary that outlines in detail the how and why of his fearless act. Robert Zemeckis's "The Walk," however, is a well-made, thematically significant account of the events, told within the boundaries of a biopic that takes an introspective, fourth-wall-breaking look at how Petit accomplished what he did.Petit is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who stands atop The Statue of Liberty whilst telling this unfathomable story. From the first scene, showcasing Petit on the statue, one will immediately detect a strangeness in Gordon-Levitt's French accent. The man who we recently saw proudly boasting and owning a full-bloodied Italian accent has now adopted a rather hammy French accent that occasionally treads the line of self-parody. This is the film's first, and really only, obstacle; if you can get past this, your enjoyment of the film will likely be pretty high. If you can't overlook this, I wish you the best one-hundred and twenty minutes.The film follows Petit's humble beginnings on the streets of France as a young troubadour, from performing as a street-mime and meeting Annie (Charlotte Le Bon), a singer who performs in the streets as well, who will eventually be an accomplice to his high-wire act in New York City, to becoming an ambitious wire-walker. He enlists in the help of Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley), a famous tightrope walker in the circus, who agrees to help him accomplish his dreams, albeit reluctantly so. The remainder of the latter half of the film concerns the extensive planning and development of Petit's plan to walk the rope between the Twin Towers and subsequently carrying out his actions.Audiences sold by the film's series of daring and ambitious trailers may be shocked to note how much goes into the exposition of the buildup and around-the-clock planning of the walk itself. By the hour mark, I was beginning to question why Zemeckis, a known "visualist" in Hollywood, responsible for gems like "Back to the Future" and "The Polar Express," was chosen to direct a film that was so narrative-driven. But then, as quickly as the film began, the scenes atop the World Trade Center did, and in a way, allowed the real film to finally start as a result. When one sees how magnificent and captivating the scenes surrounding Petit's walk is when they'll see Zemeckis's artistic vision; it was an event so unspeakably tranquil yet suspenseful that I couldn't help but feel my palms sweat. The way Zemeckis and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski - who intently focuses on clouds and atmospheric naturalism during the walk - wrap the audience up in the awe-inspiring risk and inherent danger that comes with this event makes the film transcend fiction in a way that has the ability to give audiences a real experience. So few films do that that it becomes petty to complain about something like the weakness of Gordon-Levitt's accent.On a thematic note, however, "The Walk" is a fascinating look at the ideas of optimism and courage that have ostensibly become interwoven in the fabric of American society of the years. The Twin Towers, in the film and in real-life, represented financial stability and international connectedness, and Zemeckis works to emphasize it in a way that spells out loving respect more-so than it does imminent disaster. The towers are viewed as a simple of untold bravery, much like Petit, and "The Walk" reminds us of a time period that still had the remainder of the world looking to America as a place of impossible achievement.Zemeckis does a wonderful job at blending drama with visuals here, much like he did in his last film "Flight," a brilliant drama that came unfairly branded as both a disaster film and a courtroom drama. With "The Walk," Zemeckis takes empathy-inspiring visuals and themes of American exceptionalism and makes them function in a manner that is germane to the film's inherent aura of wonder. If you want it broken down in a simplistic manner, however, its delightful cinematic qualities and breathtaking visuals justify the ticket-price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the movie, The Walk, directed by Robert Zemekis; the screen comes alive from beginning to end. The script and acting itself made up for the whole movie. Middle to End was fast paced and exciting, one event after another made me sit up in my seat and the walk, was definitely the best part. I didn't know the whole story before I saw the movie so I was freaking out and hoping he wasn't going to fall. Anyways, the movie was great but definitely unappreciated, there were only five people, myself included on opening night. No actual sign or poster for the movie, just a piece of paper that told the times. People should definitely go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Petit himself, this film was just stuffed full of giddiness, eccentricities, and wonder? which is made all the more impressive because this whole rather unbelievable tale is based on actual events! I really have to start by commending the film's co-writer and director Robert Zemeckis for accomplishing this wonderful tone. If you look at his larger body of work? whether it's Romancing the Stone, Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump, or even Cast Away, Zemeckis' wide eyed joy over life and for making movies is constantly spilling out of the screen. As crazy as we may have initially found Peti, if the film has done its job correctly, we will walk out of the theater having tasted some of the thrill, beauty, and life found in what he accomplished.

		<fullReview>The walk is directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Charlotte Le Bon, Ben Kingsley. First off if your afraid of heights, this movie isn't for you. Back to the movie. The Walk was amazing not just Visuals but also the acting was great by everyone. Joseph Gordon-Levit Was fantastic but it focused on him for almost the entire movie so Ben Kingsley didn't get a lot of screen time but when he did he was great. The point of seeing this movie in 3D is for the actual walk and when it came to that, it delivered. Not being afraid of heights, when that scene happened I felt it, I felt like I was all the way up there. Robert Zemeckis did that scene fantastic. He should be nominated for an Oscar. Overall The Walk was a fantastic movie with a good and great acting. Defiantly needs to be seen in 3D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On August 7, 1974, Petit is ready for the high-wire artist of the World Trade Center. Guy Tozzoli was in the car to drive work in the morning and calling on the phone by the police officer. Petit is lying down on the tight rope. He's watching the sky above. All the people and the police are on the World Trade Center buildings. It was awesome for the high-wire act. Petit walked back to the police and arrested himself to the jail or the station. Tozzoli and Petit are quite as a very good friends for all these years. Petit did made it up in New York City. When Papa Rudy told Petit is going to die on the high-wire. Nothing is impossible. It was wonderful movie. Very wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Cast Away) it would be an understatement to say that I was anticipated this movie. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary about the same topic, Man on Wire, I was interested in how the story would play out as a feature film.For those of you who haven't seen Man on Wire, I'll summarize this man's story for you. Philippe Petit, portrayed magnificently here by Joseph Gordon Levitt, had a dream of walking across the Twin Towers from the moment he saw them for the first time in a picture. That's the story in a nutshell. The Walk is as much a character study about Petit and his fascination with walking on high wires as it is a fact based drama about his dream of walking the World Trade Center.With Philippe Petit (JGL) doing a voice-over throughout the entire movie, The Walk is allowed to really dig deep into Petit's character and illustrates to the audience what drove this man to achieve his impossible dream. While sometimes off-putting, the narration is never unwelcome. Also, I must add, The Walk finds a great way to justify its constant switches in languages between French and English. While the first half is just interesting enough to hold the audience's attention, the final hour is where The Walk and Zemeckis really catch their strides. Elements of heist movies are thrown in to keep the audience on the edge of their seats and when the titular walk occurs, it doesn't disappoint. I suggest seeing it in IMAX 3D as I did because the film made you feel as though you were walking beside Petit's character. Overall, Zemeckis continues to prove why he's one of the best directors working today. The Walk exceeds in its fascinating story and characters, as well as its breathtaking visuals to bring Philippe Petit's dream to life."The carrots are cooked"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1974, the French street juggler and equilibrist Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) decides to cross the towers of the World Trade Center walking on a tightrope. He travels from France to the USA with his girlfriend Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) and their friend and photographer Jean-Louis (Clément Sibony). They team-up with a small group of residents and plot a scheme to take their equipment to the roof of the building. Will Philippe make his dream come true? "The Walk" is a highly entertaining adventure based on a true story. The performances are great but the special effect of the crossing of Philippe is amazing.

		<shortDescription>High above the rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, from the outset, aims to be a documentary. It has the feel of a documentary, has narration like a documentary, in fact in all intense and purposes it is a documentary. I mean after all, there is no video documented evidence of the feet itself. This may be due to the cost or even the size of the recording of such an event by the "coup". The film is just over two hours in length, and for the first time in a while, the film didn't feel that long. It was able to keep my attention throughout with a mixture of great script work and breath taking special effects. I write this after seeing the movie in IMAX 3D which may have helped give it a bit more welly shall we say. But you can't help but feel that when you look down, you are actually there looking down. The only thing that was missing in the cinema was a wind machine.The special effects are a marvel and you almost forget that, sadly, the twin towers are no longer there. At no point did I feel the images that were produced on screen had anything to do with CGI and this is a credit to there special effects team (Especially when you compare this to the effects in San Andreas). Sir Ben Kingsley's performance is one that delivers almost flawlessly as the teacher to the young rope walker, even if his accent often goes amiss. As for the lead actor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Philippe Petit) and actress (Charlotte Le Bon - Annie), the on screen chemistry as easily felt and very believable. The ending is a bit sad with lots of symbolism and a hint of reality. *Spoilers*The mix of loss of his love and the gift of a ticket for the towers brings the film to its conclusion. When Annie says goodbye to Phillipe to go back to Paris to find out what her own dream is, is one of shock to the audience who only a few moments before in the film is declaring her love for him. However, this loss doesn't seem to effect Philippe as much as it did me as I sit in the auditorium thinking how I would feel should by better half suddenly decide to leave me if she had followed me half way around the world. But this is only the first moment that makes you think that nothing is forever. The second is in the closing speech from Philippe where he explains that he was given a ticket for the observation tower. This ticket and the ticket he receives for the observation deck for one of the Twin Towers. Philippe's ticket however has the expiry date crossed off and replaced with "forever". This sadly brings back memories of the fateful day on September 11th and how the Towers are no longer there standing. There is no where for Philippe to hang his rope. The loss of his partner showing how relationships are so delicate as well as things that when we first look at them believe will stand the test of time, even when built out of steel and concrete bring the realisation at the end of the film that nothing lasts forever. *Spoiler Ends*In conclusion this was a brilliant film providing the audience with great insight into what it must have been like to stand on the edge and look down. Although I think this film would be lost in 2D, in 3D it does add, excuse the pun, a different dimension. I would highly recommend this film if you enjoy just sitting back and relaxing.The Average Joe Film Review Rating: 8/10 (http://tajfr.blogspot.co.uk)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall: This movie is incredible and is truly the best movie, that I hadn't already watched, I've seen in quite a while. Please do yourself a favour and witness this magical piece of art.Good: Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance was golden as was the peculiar choice of storytelling which was through Joseph posing as Phillipe Petit on the statue of Liberty reminiscing of his life. Some people didn't like this style but personally I really enjoyed it. The movie focuses on a lesser known event which has had one or two movies in the past but is still unknown to many. The music and cinematography were incredibly well done. The sheer amount of time, money and effort that went into making this movie look like it does should be applauded and marveled at. It is truly an artistic achievement recreating the World Trade Center to such scope and detail.Bad: Some events felt over exaggerated to make the movie more interesting which could have been left out. Some of the supporting cast performances felt less than good but above bad. They did their job and absolutely nothing above. Very minor gripe but why do they need 20 police men to intercept him on either end. He's a high-walker not a ninja.Best Part: The deadly yet Jaw Dropping game he plays with the police whilst on his wire.10/10 GO WATCH THIS MOVIE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly powerful given the subject matter!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you seen the documentary 'Man on Wire' (2008)? If so, a great amount of 'The Walk' will feel very familiar. Robert Zemeckis' film actually borrows some lines from the documentary and repeats them verbatim. I therefore spent the first twenty minutes of viewing this film with a slight restlessness, probably muttering how "I've already seen him do/say that!" a few times. As the film progressed, though, the screenwriters' touch became more confident, and this take on the Philippe Petit story, whilst probably embellished in places, was thoroughly pleasant to watch unfold. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was probably a few dramatic scenes away from receiving his first Oscar nomination. He captures the complexity and endearing egotism of wire-walker Philippe Petit excellently, and I believe it to be his finest performance yet. We may have still been given 'The Walk' if September 11th hadn't happened, but the role of the Twin Towers would likely have been very different. I remember reading how Martin Scorsese intended 'Gangs of New York' to be a tribute to the people who made New York, in the wake of an attack by those who wished to destroy it. 'The Walk' pursues a similar narrative. Through Petit's words and the camera's gaze, one cannot help but feel that, at times, the World Trade Center is the real star of the story (which is natural, of course, as the titular walk could not have happened without it). Interpretation aside, this is, at its core, a strong film. The romance, comedy, stunning (and occasionally dizzying!) cinematography are called upon in perfect balance. For a film about a man who spends his time walking along wires, it was one of the year's most memorable narrative experiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't give a synopsis of this movie as other reviewers have done so more effectively than I could, and we all know the story. I'll just rave about it for a fair few lines! This film is just so well done, it's quirky, amusing, emotional and jaw- dropping. The acting is superb, Joseph Gordon-Levitt in particular is utterly believable as Petit, and delivers a charmingly compelling performance. The way the film is shot is extremely effective, I saw this on the small screen and felt my stomach turn a few times so I can only imagine how amazing this film looks in 3D. Although you know how the story goes it's still nail-biting stuff.The ending is very touching. As others have said, this film is as much a tribute to the Twin Towers as it is to Petit's achievement. I'm not American and have never been to New York but I had a tear in my eye at the end. It's beautifully done.I highly recommend this - in a world of mediocre movie making it's a rare gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a walk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1974, Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) with his accomplices stage a 'coup' to walk a high wire strung between the almost complete World Trade Towers. Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) is his mentor. Annie Allix (Charlotte Le Bon) is his girlfriend. Jean-Louis is his anarchist photographer. Barry Greenhouse (Steve Valentine) is his inside man with an office in the North Tower. Jean-Pierre is a Frenchman in NY who brings along two locals. The small group pulls off the impossible.Robert Zemeckis delivers a straight timeline telling of this fascinating man's obsession. I would like a more imaginative use of a split timeline structure. The most compelling part of the walk is the caper to get in and the walk itself. It would be better to have that as the main timeline and flashback when needed. Joseph Gordon-Levitt along with everybody else do the french accent. It might bother some people. The wire walk can also bother people with vertigo. Nevertheless, the simple story is well told. The acting is solid. It has a bit of fun and plenty of excitement.</fullReview>

I was in high school when Philippe performed this and I barely remember it.There have been many people throughout history that performed death- defying acts, whether intentional or not. This one has to rate at the very top, pun intended. Sure, man has walked on the moon, but that was a collaboration of many thousands of people when you think about it. This performance was one man with a handful of collaborators. And the one man was over a thousand feet in the sky with no safety net or cable, literally his life was in his own hands.I can't believe this movie didn't make any money.

		<fullReview>A docudrama can either be informative or entertaining: THE WALK is based the book by Philippe Petit's of a true event in 1974 and as written for the screen by Christopher Brown and director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Cast Away, Back to the Future, Polar Express and Flight) it is both and more. It not only shows in detail a terrifyingly dangerous high wire walk but it also shares the passion and bravery and commitment of a very unique man. And it celebrates the camaraderie of friends who support a young man's dream.The synopsis distills the main aspects of the story (two other films have been made about this event - Man on Wire (2008and High Wire (1984), and yet few people know the discipline and all the facts about daring action. 'Twelve people have walked on the moon, but only one man - Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - has ever, or will ever, walk in the immense void between the World Trade Center towers. Guided by his real-life mentor, Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley), and aided by an unlikely band of international recruits, Petit and his gang overcome long odds, betrayals, dissension and countless close calls to conceive and execute their mad plan.'Joseph Gordon-Levitt incorporates a very fine French accent for the film and he is very well supported by not only Ben Kingsley but also by the supporting cast including Ben Schwartz, James Badge Dale, Steve Valentine, César Domboy, Benedict Samuel, Charlotte Le Bon among others. Gordon-Levitt as Philippe narrates the entire film, offering some very fine lines to remember, such as 'I find myself in the middle of the wire. And I feel the void. And although a wire-walker should never look down... I do. And it was... It was beautiful. It was calm and beautiful, and serene, and "not-dangerous.'The cinematography is brilliant using innovative photorealistic techniques and IMAX 3D wizardry by Dariusz Wolski and as the promo states, this film is truly a love story to Paris and New York of the 1970s. It is very difficult to see the World Center Twin Towers, knowing the terrorist destruction that was to dissolve them. But the film strikes all the right cords ? even the painful memory of 9/11 ? and allows us to celebrate man's courage and our own grief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Family Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk follows Philippe Petit, a tightrope walker who dreams of, and eventually does, tightrope between the twin towers. The plot is good. I haven't seen or heard of a lot of tightrope movies, and considering the circumstances of how this all happened it's pretty interesting to see. For the most part it's presented well. Before the first hour of the movie it's already getting to the climax, which I wasn't particularly fond of, as the character development wasn't as good as it could have been. The last hour is setting up for the walk itself, however, which was the most interesting part of the movie, but it wouldn't have hurt it to have a bit more character development. The characters could have been better, like I already mentioned. It felt like a lot of them were thrown in as quickly as possible without much reason. The development of them was decent, but they weren't substantial. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's exaggerated French accent was a little annoying at first, but I got used to it. Overall The Walk is good. Half the movie is just okay, while the other half is pretty interesting. For the most part it's fun, and very much a family movie, which isn't a bad thing. In the end I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sentimental mind rape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you truly want to enjoy the art of cinema, the first thing you have to teach yourself is the ability to immerse into a film's reality. Without that, a film is just a set of moving frames, and the magic of the emotional connection between you and the world it depicts remains unreachable. That magic is a double-edge weapon though, for some images may appear too disturbing. That's one of the reasons I personally can't handle horror films, because they intentionally shatter your emotional state, and some scenes from the films I've seen as a child still haunt me after decades. Still, it's the price you have to pay to obtain that key to the beauty of the cinematographic art.The Walk, a true story of a person who walked the wire between the World Trade Center towers, is one of the films whose beauty really takes its toll. Because just like those huge buildings were once looming over the city, this film may be anything - from a romantic melodrama to a comedic approach to a heist genre - but it's still overshadowed by the great fear most of us can't help feeling. A fear of height and of death that might come out of it. And the greater the height, the greater the fear. It's no use convincing yourself that it's just rendered pixels and that nobody's actually crossing that abyss between the now ephemeral buildings. Once you look down, your palms start sweating - and that shiver lasts for quite a while after the show is over.The Walk is not intended to be a horror flick, it actually tries to show you the beauty of an act most of us would consider a pure madness. Unfortunately, even Joseph Gordon-Levitt's charming fake French accent fails to make you truly embrace Philippe Petit's vision that brought him that high in the first place. It is said that the fear of height is an evolutional heritage of our brachiator ancestors, for whom dealing with heights was not a matter of excitement or spiritual search but of survival itself. So while some of us are devoid of that primordial fear and see the beauty of the void, the rest can't shake off that visceral sensation of a free fall. And there's nothing beautiful about it, just your guts wrenching.However, if we try putting our own physical nature aside, the beauty of the act The Walk tells us about becomes more tangible. It may be sentimentally overloaded in the way of "The Mission" episode of Stephen Spielberg "Amazing Stories", but at least The Walk is a true story of a real person for whom visiting that void - not conquering but paying respect to it - was actually a dream and a life inspiration. Some things we may not understand, but they remain beautiful nonetheless. And the final scene of the film that turns into a postmortem homage to the Twin Towers themselves, adds a pinch of nostalgic sadness to the protagonist's moment of glory. Which only intensifies your emotional palate, just like the fear of death brings on a true joie de vivre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to walk you through my high punwire review act of "The Walk". The movie is wired up by infamous Writer-Director Robert Zemeckis. "The Walk" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as real-life French high-wire artist Phillippe Petit who in 1974 realized his dream by highwiring a walk from one tower to another tower of The Twin Towers. Of course, this wasn't legal, so Petit recruited a group of accomplices both in France and New York to help "talk the talk" so he can "walk the walk". Zemeckis' does a credible job in both directing and co- writing the picture, especially in his technical directorial mastery of the actual walk. Mr. Z did get a bit strung up with the planning of the highwire act, but shined in exhibiting Petit's never-let-die passion in pursuing his dream. Gordon-Levitt rose big as Petit, and his French accent was as perfect I have ever heard from an American actor. The always great Ben Kingsley also kept the thespian balance right with his work as Petit's highwire mentor &amp; teacher Papa Rudy. The rest of the cast was also quite steady. But this was Gordon-Levitt's sky- scraping acting show. So therefore, walk your way to "The Walk". **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Philippee Petit, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a notorious French daredevil that did the impossible. Petit had a passion for walking across a tightrope. He was introduced to the act from a circus he had seen as a child. That first tightrope act that he witnessed would forever influence for the stunt of a lifetime.Petit would always think of new places to anchor his rope to. He would do small street shows between two light posts or two tall trees. But that was not enough. Petit wanted something bigger to redefine the art of walking across a tightrope. He had come across an article about the construction of the World Trade Center Twin Towers. The moment he saw that he knew that was where he was going to do the stunt.There was a good balance in the movie showing Petit developing as tightrope walker, and his journey to come to New York in order to complete the greatest of all daredevil challenges. Every time the camera angle was above him looking down to the ground, it will send chills down one's back. That height is unreal, and considering the fact that he did not use any type of safety harness or parachute, it added to the fearful suspense of failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well Orchestrated Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the background of the story, you may expect this will be another movie about a human fulfill his/ her dream. A dream boosted by passion that drive a will and fueled with persistance and strong outer bond to make it all happen.But eventually this movie offers more than that. We are introduced to Philippe Petit with strong and hard headed character to do what he loves, and like typical "make your dream comes true" movie, the world conspires to help him achieve it, but before half of the movie ended, We have been brought to the attempt of his biggest achievement, the core of the story, efficient yet effective without losing the importances. The second half tells the details of the Twin Tower crossing, we can tell and feel the passion Philippe has, against all odds and doubts. The crossing becomes the peak of the whole orchestra, with audiences, music, view, and brilliant acting of JGL. We are not astonished only by the achievement itself, but by the fact that human can relate with nature, become his true self, utilize his full potential with heart, it is when the movie not just become an inspirational one, but also artistic and beautiful at the same time.Robert Zemeckis simply gives soul to the movie, in a well orchestrated manner. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable and well made film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched a review of this film on BBC Film 2015 and the basic conclusion of the assembled "brains" was an over elaborate film. I can see their point - to a degree, but you need to take any OTT moments as a tongue in cheek and not too literally.As someone who was privileged enough to see and to ascend the twin towers before their demise (and was captivated at their beauty) I can say that the CGI of them was absolutely brilliant, so accurate in marking out the shape and design of the stainless steel skin and in so many other minute ways.The CGI was immense as was the colour over black and white in some early scenes. On a handful of scenes the CGI verges on too much - at points, just overstepping the mark.The acting is somewhat OTT in parts, which, to be fair, fits in well with the fast paced and fun tone of the film. It's hard to knock the actors' excitement and exuberance, especially the lead.The minutes rolled by as I watched the film and the end came too soon, even with 40 minutes left I wondered "how can they fill this time remaining"; the story is run...yet the direction filled every minute to near perfection.The near 2 hours was over in swift rush of fun and excitement.Well worth viewing, a really fun film. Maybe not exactly accurate to the true story, but taken in context it is a must see.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In 1 word: Inspiring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not but this is one of the few movies I regret not seeing in the theaters and even though I despise most 3D movies I think this would've been amazing in 3D. For some among us who have specific movie tastes NO it's not a Hollywood big action blockbuster; however it is an inspiring drama based on a true story. It's a bit different than most movies so please have an open mind when you watch it. So let us all take a step on the high wire and chase our dreams.As stated before this movie is based on a true story. A story about a French guy named Philippe Petit and his lifelong dream to walk a high wire between the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in 1974. The story focuses on how he found his dream and his ambition and the drive to achieve it at all cost. So why is this a good movie? Well you all know that I hate the statement good or bad movie. But the reason why this movie has held my attention to write a review is because it knows where to put its focus and emphasis throughout the story. It doesn't have pointless drama like certain films. (BUT!!! Henny that isn't pointless drama it's called CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!! Well, be quiet and let me explain!!).Yes the movie has, to some degree, been romanticized and yes it may not be a perfect portrayal of the real Philippe Petit, I don't know the guy so I wouldn't know. However, I would like to believe that the director has captured the spirit of Philippe, by conveying his feelings and thoughts in the movie.So what about drama for the sake of character development? Yes sometimes a little bit of drama is necessary to develop a character. Especially when it is intended to enrich the character. For example: by putting them in a situation to discover what kind of person he or she may be. I'm not saying that this type of storytelling is BAD, "on the contrary I welcome it" (Yes you fellow cinephiles you know the movie where this is quoted from :P ). However, there has been a time where movies have used this tool to add, unnecessary side plots that doesn't lead to anything and in addition it distracts the attention of the audience from the main story. While other movies would have hammered on a possible love story or hatred within the group, this movie tackles these problems in a subtle way. It spends time on some side plots, but it never detracts from the main story.The credit for this movie truly goes to the director, the always GREAT Robert Zemeckis (from movies like, Forrest Gump, back to the future, contact). Robert is a director who knows how to capture a moment and how to communicate his thoughts to the actors. It's a shame that he hasn't directed many movies; however that could also be a blessing since we won't get saturated with his work.The actors did a fine job. The main protagonist is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and he did a good job portraying a French guy, however for some reason I thought he had a strange French accent. The supporting characters were all fine and you can never go wrong with Ben Kingsley. I can't really say much about the supporting cast since the movie mostly revolved around the protagonist. You could even call this movie a character study.The cinematography was alright, however I thought it was a little too gritty for my taste. It could've used a little bit more color. The music was beautiful especially at the end when he was performing. I've always loved Alan Silvestri's work since Back to The Future and even though he has had some bad scores over the years, it is good to hear him coming back.So the basics: The movie has a funny beginning, serious middle, and strong ending. It is well cut with a runtime of circa 2 hours, from which they could've cut 15 min to improve the pacing.Sorry everyone, I always try to keep my reviews as short as possible but there is always a lot to talk about. So should you watch this movie? Personally I would say yes. It checks all the boxes and provides a good warm feeling at the end. It inspires us to find a dream and work hard for it and most importantly never lose sight of it.I give this movie a 7, go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting life, boring movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I normally never write comments. For this movie I felt I should leave a short note, for the following reasons. This movie is based on a spectacular life of one. But movie wise it's quite a simple, boring story.. Watched it because of the actor and the good rates and comments. But it disappointed in every sort of manner. The french accent was more annoying than charming. The characters didn't come out as you would have expect. The fact that the "walker" himself tells the story, again in the accent, make it a strange format. It's hard to put the movie in one category. It's not fully biographical, not an emotional movie and for an "easy-watch" it's too slow and too serious. I would truly recommend to not watch this movie. My score: 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Walk" is a Work of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Walk" is an engrossing, captivating picture (as to be expected from a Robert Zemeckis film) about Phillipe Petit, a man who would stop at nothing to walk on a tightrope across the Twin Towers. He was addicted to them, had a "love affair" with them. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers an outstanding performance as the insane yet driven Petit, who, as a result of his dream, seems to lose all common sense while planning his "coup". He assembles a team to help him perform the illegal task, and thoroughly plans it out.THE GOOD: "The Walk" is a cinematic work-of-art, skillfully directed, written, and as thoroughly planned out as the coup itself. Robert Zemeckis and Christopher Browne add in a surprising touch of humor, sprinkled throughout the film, sometimes veering toward slapstick, but not overdone in the least. The cinematography is remarkable, and the acting near-perfect, even without a lot of well-known faces. Ben Kingsley does a wonderful job as Petit's mentor, Charlotte Le Bon as his girlfriend and most avid supporter (being a performer herself), and Gordon-Levitt leads the group extraordinarily well.THE BAD: Phillipe Petit's breaking-the-fourth-wall narration is slightly overdone at times, sometimes telling the viewer things we can very obviously see, and can also break up the movie's flow. When pulling off the coup, some conveniently lucky things happen to keep them from being found out.92/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is about Philippe Petit reaching his dream to becoming of becoming the first person to walk the immense void between the World Trade Center towers. The movie really captures all of the problems and hardships that can happen while reaching your dream, and it teaches you to not give up. The story was fine, but the even though the film was 2 hours long it felt way-way shorter, because of that we were not able to get the chance to know the characters, maybe some back story Let's take Papa Rudy, for example, the film shows really almost no bond between the main character and him, only that he teaches tricks for money and gives some tips later on. I know this is supposed to be a some sort like a Biography, but still.The french-English accent sounded really fake for me with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the others were fine.Since I have watched this film on my personal computer, and in the cinema 3D I can really tell you that watching in the cinema 3D is really more enjoyable.Also, I really wasn't expecting a scene of a man walking on a wire can be so intense and interesting.Overall the film was good, didn't give me any kind of emotional attachment, but I liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking on a wire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-The Walk is a 2015 American 3D biographical drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Christopher Browne and Zemeckis. It is based on the story of French high-wire artist Philippe Petit's walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on August 7, 1974. The film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ben Kingsley, Charlotte Le Bon, James Badge Dale, Ben Schwartz, and Steve Valentine. The film was released by TriStar Pictures on September 30, 2015, in the United States in IMAX 3D, and on October 9 in regular 2D and 3D. The film was dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001.--Critical response:-The Walk received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Gordon-Levitt's performance, Zemeckis' direction, and the visual effects, particularly during the wire walk scene. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 85%, based on 217 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. -The site's critical consensus reads, "The Walk attempts a tricky balancing act between thrilling visuals and fact-based drama ? and like its wire-walking protagonist, pulls it off with impressive élan." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 70 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of "A-" on an A+ to F scale. -John Lasser of IGN gave the film an 8.6 out of 10 'great' score, saying, _The Walk is an amazing film, and is so on multiple levels. Joseph Gordon-Levitt puts forth such an easy charm crossed with a fierce determination that it is impossible not to fall in love with Philippe Petit as he attempts what sounds utterly suicidal. The planning and set up of the caper are as fun as any heist movie. And, even though everyone watching knows exactly what the film is building towards, the climactic sequence delivers everything you want and more._ ??????????????????????????.. -Well drawn up and accrued film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was scared shitless ... but then again I've got no head for heights .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For me, to walk on the wire, this is life." I hope it's not the intention to make a film about every bizarre human achievement. Otherwise we'll be looking at a whole series of movies. Besides the shown dazzling images, I thought it was just a soporific spectacle. Halfway the movie I dozed off. Fortunately that didn't happen to Philippe Petit while he was swinging on that steel cord between the Twin Towers. However, there are two things about this film that stand out. First of all, the used camera technique. I myself suffer from fear of heights and "The Walk" gave me often anxiety attacks and a spinning sensation. It managed to get me as far as holding my hands in front of my eyes. You won't see me do that even during the most terrifying horror. And then there's Joseph "Looper" Gordon-Levitt talking with a French accent. Although he could have made a caricature out of Petit easily, he managed to play the driven, passionate Frenchman with gusto.Already from the opening scene you know what you can expect. Philippe speaks to the public from the top of the Statue of Liberty and introduces this true story. The way he tells the story with enthusiasm and emotion, ensures that your curiosity is aroused. Did he succeed in this dangerous undertaking? Or is he speaking to us from heaven, after he smashed to bits and ended up as a human pizza between the two majestic towers? Those who know the real story, know the outcome of course. And furthermore Phillippe also reveals the ultimate goal early on in the film. So we can't speak of a surprise element anymore.The first part is about Philippe working as a street artist in Paris. It's there that his passion for walking the wire started. With the help of the circus owner Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley), whose family practiced tightrope walking for years, he learns the tricks of the trade. And when he reads an article about the construction of the Twin Towers, he only has one goal in his life and that's to cross the yawning depth between the two towers while walking that rope. What follows is a kind of "Ocean Eleven", to make sure this stunt will be a success. The moment Philippe decides to fulfill this dream, the preparations begin. Figuring out how to achieve it and what equipment is required. Assembling a group of accomplices and create a detailed plan so that nothing would go wrong the day Philippe tries his luck. The second part is about the implementation of this plan. Of course you can expect some setbacks and unexpected obstacles during the attempt, so that it becomes more intense and exciting.Gordon-Levitt played his role with bravura and with conviction, although the forced sounding accent bothered me at the beginning. All the time I was wondering why they hadn't chosen an authentic French actor. But as the film progressed, I thought it was an admirable performance off him. Kingsley's part was extremely funny. But for me the two helping hands from the United States, summoned by a shop owner, were really amusing. Charlotte Le Bon is a lovable and frail appearance, but served merely as an attribute (such as the flexible stick Philippe uses during his tightrope walking) in a parallel storyline. All in all an entertaining and at times terribly intense film. But it didn't reach the same level as Philippe did during his famous act.PS. Finally I want to mention that I find it a huge achievement from the filmmakers they weren't tempted to make it a kind of tribute to the Twin Towers and avoided to use any reference to what ultimately happened with these towers.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of intensity and drama but a little too long! 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: Although this movie is about a truly amazing event, it really didn't have to be over 2 hours long. I got a bit fed up with watching the whole planning of the event after a while but I did enjoy the mixture of characters that were in the "coup". If it wasn't for the witty script and the great performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, I would have fallen asleep halfway through the film because there is way too much unnecessary material. Anyway, the film is set in 1973, were a French Street performer, Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is making a living juggling and wire walking on the streets. During a visit to the dentist, he sees a picture of the twin towers in a newspaper and comes up with the idea to wire walk between the two buildings. As Philippe isn't making a lot of money on the streets and his father isn't impressed with his choice of work, he throws him out of the family home and he returns to the circus, were he worked as a child. He practices wire walking when no one is around, but he is caught by Papa Rudy, (Ben Kingsley), who is impressed with his juggling skills. Whilst performing on the streets, Philippe meets a fellow street performer, Annie Allix (Charlotte Le Von) and they begin a romantic relationship. After explaining to her about his plans to walk across the Twin Towers, she gives him the perfect place to practice, at her music school. Whilst training, he meets a photographer called Jean-Louis (Clement Sibony), who becomes the second member of his crew, the "coup". He then turns to Papa Rudy for guidance on knot tying and rope rigging, which he gives him for a fee and then he attempts to cross a lake but the various distractions make it hard for him to concentrate, and he ends up falling in the water. He then attempts to wire walk across the Notre Dame cathedral, which is a success but he gets arrested in the process. Jean- Louis introduces him to another accomplice who gives him the idea to use a bow and arrow tied to a fishing rod to get the line across the Twin Towers. Philippe then travels to America with Annie to check out the Twin Towers by using various disguises to get past the security. Due to the weather conditions and the fact that the top of the buildings isn't finished yet, they plan to do the walk on the 6th of August, 1974 but Philippe steps on a nail whilst scouting the building, which puts doubts in his fellow members minds. He then bumps into an insurance salesman, in the lift of one of the twin towers, who is familiar with Philippe's wire walking work and when Philippe finds out that he works near the top of the tower, he recruits him as another member of the "coup", along with an electronics salesman, J.P. and his friends Albert and David. After going over the plans, time and time again, Philippe tells the crew that he must be on the wire before the construction team arrives at 07:00 in the morning. Whilst preparing for the walk, they come across many problems on the way and they end up 3 hours behind. When the guards on the premises finally disappear, they start setting up the equipment, but they drop the heavy cable, which they have to spend time retrieving. When everything is finally up and running, Philippe starts his amazing walk across the Twin Towers. J.P. and Annie gather a crowd below, who cheer on Philippe, who has found inner peace and is thankful for getting to this position. When he finally has achieved his goal, he decides to turn back and do the walk again and he kneels to the audience and even lays down. After a while, the police arrive and he continues to walk back and forth because he is enjoying this unique moment. He manages to walk the rope, 6 times before he gets arrested on site. The police and construction workers commend him for his amazing bravery but he still has to pay for the crime, along with his trusty accomplices. When they are released from jail, Annie goes back to Paris and Philippe stays in New York, were he is given a free pass to the observation decks of both towers. Its definitely a unique storyline and the fact that Philippe done all of the wire walking without any safety, really does prove that he was in a zone of his own. The only thing that stopped Philippe from walking any further is the fact that there was a storm coming and the police helicopters were drawing close, who were fretting to cut the cable. Its just amazing that nothing went wrong! Anyway, from an entertainment point of view, it's definitely full of intensity and drama and the director done well by making it look extremely real. It really does prove that anything is possible, if you truly believe in what you want to achieve and if you give it your full commitment. Enjoyable but a bit too long!&nbsp;Round-Up: This movie was directed by Robert Zemeckis, 64, who come from the Spielberg camp of film making and has made some top movies like the Back to the Future franchise, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the awful Death Becomes Her, Forrest Gump, Contact, Cast Away, Polar Express, Beowulf, a Christmas Carol and Flight with Denzel Washington. I personally think that he done a great job by bringing an unknown achievement to light and after the terrible destruction of the twin towers, it was good to see something so amazing happen while they were in operation.&nbsp;Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $59millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/biography/dramas starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ben Kingsley, Charlotte LeBon, and Martin Lefebvre. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Quease-Inducing Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On August 7, 1974, French tight rope artist Philippe Petit really did manage to string a wire between the North and South Towers of the World Trade Centre in New York City, and then spent about 45 minutes performing illegally a quarter of a mile above the earth. In all honesty I had never heard of Petit until I heard about this movie. It sounded like an amazing feat. Not just the tight rope walk between the towers - but how he was able to do it when it was illegal. Just something as obvious as how he would be able to get the wire in place without anyone knowing baffled me, so I had to watch this to find out. I'm glad I did. It's a superb movie in pretty much every respect.Petit is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I have to admit that I know Gordon-Levitt mostly from his teenage performance as Tommy in the TV series "3rd Rock From The Sun." I guess he's been busy enough since then, but he hasn't really appeared too much on my radar screen. Overall I was impressed by his turn as Petit. He seemed to get into the man's head, capturing this strange obsession Petit developed with walking between the Towers. As many have pointed out, his French accent was off, but that's a fairly minor point. Overall, he was quite good. With the exception of Ben Kingsley as Petit's mentor, the rest of the cast was basically unknown to me, but all did a fine job.There are essentially three parts to "The Walk." The movie starts with a look at Petit's early development as a tight rope walker in France. This part of the movie is largely driven by narration (with Gordon-Levitt narrating as Petit. It comes across largely as a series of vignettes about his early experiences, and the relationships he develops with "Papa Rudy" (Kingsley) and Annie (Charlotte Le Bon), who becomes his girlfriend. During this period, Petit comes across a story about the building of the Twin Towers in New York City and becomes obsessed with the possibility of walking across "the void" between them. The second part of the movie follows Petit and his accomplices as they set this up. It was fascinating actually to see how they did it, with a bit of a feel of a heist movie to it. It all leads up, of course, to the walk itself, which would be the third part of the movie.The walk is at one and the same time exhilarating and terrifying - and that's for the viewer, making me wonder how Petit reacted to it! I've never had a movie make me queasy, but this one almost did, and I understand that some who saw this in theatres actually did suffer vertigo from it. I can understand why. It's filmed beautifully, and the CGI created Twin Towers are astonishingly real. As Petit walks across, and then back, and then back again (in the real life event, he apparently crossed eight times!) you feel as if you're with him on the tight rope. It's hard not to feel a little bit queasy. It's brilliantly done.On the negative side, I wasn't sure about the amount of narration used, with Gordon-Levitt on the top of the Statue of Liberty with the Twin Towers in the background, as he talks to the audience in his fake French accent. That didn't really add anything much to the movie for me. There also seemed to be too much effort to add some comedy to this at times, which seemed a bit out of place. Minor points, though, in the overall scheme of things.If you're over 25 I doubt you can watch this without some feelings about September 11, 2001. Just seeing the Twin Towers (even if they're CGI generated) brings back memories, and I thought Robert Zemeckis found a good way to pay tribute without it being too in your face. One thing we discover as the movie approaches its conclusion is that the New York City Port Authority actually gave Petit a life pass to the Observation Deck. Gordon-Levitt's Petit makes the point in the movie that passes to the Observation Deck all had an expiry date - except his, which was crossed out. His pass was to last forever. And as the movie ends, the Twin Towers just slowly fade from the screen. Forever didn't last forever as it turned out.A truly good, interesting and exciting movie. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I personally wouldn't be crazy risking my life going on a wire walking between the world Trade Center but that was something that Phillippe petition dreamed of on August 6th 1974 as he envisioned himself being the one to walk across the towers on a tightrope. I will say that it was nice to see the twin towers on screen again and the cgi to create it was well done. While the film felt like a comedy at times and the French accent Joseph Gordon Levitt used was laughable. However the film shows anything can be possible when one believes in the impossible.

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a French high-wire artist who walks unannounced across the twin towers of World Trade Centre when the towers opened in 1974.I did not know about this walk before, but the film captivate me. When this film was in the cinemas, my friends dismissed it by questioning how they could drag the film to two hours. I had to say that I agreed with them in the beginning of the film when I watched it, as it was slow and winding. In the middle of the film, it became a heist of a different sort, which was thrilling and exciting. After Petit started walking the rope, it all became far too thrilling. My palms sweated continuously and I had to hold my breath many times. I was in awe of Petit's achievement.I am grateful that the film remakes what the view from the top of the towers is like. Visually it is very impressive to see the New York City from this angle, which eludes most people. "The Walk" is a thrilling adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anchored By Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Great Special Effects, The Walk Overcomes Being Too Sentimental To Be Fun Family Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having saw the trailer before the theatrical release, I actually wasn't too interested in seeing The Walk. It didn't grab me, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a good actor and Robert Zemeckis has directed some iconic films but seeing a French wire-walker try to walk between the World Trade Centre Towers didn't seem like a must see. Judging by the small box office take, many people felt the same way. In retrospect, that's too bad because although there are clear drawbacks, you can feel the energy radiating off the movie and it's hard not to get caught up in it.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Our narrator is our protagonist Phillipe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). He describes how he became a street performer, having started wire-walking as a kid. He is mentored by a famous wire-walker Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) whose entire family are circus performers/ wire-walkers. Rudy and Phillipe clash on how to perform but become fast friends and Phillipe learns the technical aspects of wire-walking from him. His family does not share his enthusiasm and he is kicked out by his father who cannot condone his son being a circus performer. In the city of Paris, while he's performing he meets his most important ally in Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) who is initially cold to him because he infringes on her territory as a rivalling street performer but he persists in speaking to her and she eventually warms to him. It is in Paris that due to a freak dental accident, he happens upon an article about the World Trade Centre in a magazine at a dental clinic and he gets his idea to walk between the World Trade Centre Towers.I want to address this early, this movie is going to irritate some people. It's very old-fashioned in how earnest it is. The music swells in the emotional moments, there are several scenes where Phillipe waxes poetic about how much he wants to attempt this feat. There are many romantic shots of the CGI recreated World Trade Centre. It borders on irritating after the 3rd or 4th time but luckily, the other major factors of the film are so well done, it didn't affect me too much. It did seem a little heavy handed though and I understand where the criticism comes from.At the same time, there is a lot of well done stuff in this movie and let's start with the special effects. I remember reading that The Walk was making people sick from the vertigo, even watching it at home I definitely still saw it. Every shot looking down from the high wire is dizzying and it helps emphasize the danger Petit is taking performing this stunt.The entire plot of The Walk is pretty much revealed in the trailer. What the trailer doesn't get across is that The Walk is setup like a heist movie. The parts with Phillipe and his friends investigating the building, what it would take to perform this stunt and coming up with a plan are a lot of fun. There's a decent mix of comedy and drama and it helps that the movie is fully aware of how bizarre Phillipe's plan is. But they romanticize it to bring you in. I would never do this but with seeing how passionate Phillipe is about it, it's hard not to get swept up in the film's charm.The most important thing that helped me get into The Walk is the performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Phillipe Petit. His accent is a little cartoonish but his performance has so much energy, you can't help but like him. He put this movie on his back and carries it almost by himself at points. He isn't helped by his dialogue either, which is kind of corny too. The supporting cast is good, there aren't many standout performances among them. James Badge Dale was more animated than I had seen him previously and Ben Kingsley is endearing as Phillipe's mentor, it's always nice to see him in a good project.I honestly didn't expect too much from The Walk and maybe the low expectations helped me enjoy it more than I normally would. It's not without problems, it can be heavy handed and there are small points where the movie is irritating because it is being so sentimental. But with the great use of CGI, a great leading performance and a pleasant family friendly vibe I would recommend The Walk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Life Purified Water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially, this review has nothing to do with Nestle commercially. XD. Anyway, we all like purified water, don't we? At least, nobody hates it. Similarly, some biography movies like the imitation and the walk to be reviewed today, to some degree, are kind of purified-water movies. Without exception, they can earn high ratings, around 8.0, and they are prone to be chosen as Oscar-nominated films. Personally, few people will fire criticism on these films due to the respect they have for the great and the efforts that the producers paid to record the life experiences of the great and show it to the public. They seemingly deserve relatively high ratings, while they can actually go far to do better and as an audience, I don't feel satisfied and frankly, I don't really enjoy watching the walk. In another word, the walk tastes like purified water.There are some plots in this movie that are misleading, as to me. First, the unreliable teammates. After Ocean's Twelve and The Fast and the Furious, it seems that every challenging plan requires a team. Yes, it does. And this very team must be composed of some very special guys who are nobody in other people's eyes, but they are really someone. Philippe also recruited some teammates. In effect, they didn't need to do much, did they? Or Mr. Zemeckis didn't offer them enough time to show their talents? Furthermore&#xff0c;how come a "sky walker" dare to permit a man with acrophobia to assist him, though Jean did matter a lot. It would be ridiculously risky. Second, Philippe's unstable and almost mad emotion. It's helpful to be mad, especially to an artist on the way to transcend and be remembered by history as a master. However, this madness should refer to a concentrated mind ever more than anxiousness for the achievement of a coup. There are three officially walks in this movie. The first one, the walk over a little lake, failed embarrassedly due to distractions. After that Philip aimed at the towers of Notre-Dame and he succeeded easily, then was the boss in NY. Do you realize something weird? Some laughers could defeat him so easily over the lake and he did nothing to conquer his distracted mind before the subsequently success of the two towers of Notre-Dame. Success is so easy to achieve! I believe the walk over the little lake is far more challenging than the walk between the World Trade Center towers. This is not a business of height. For a better understanding, I will take batman as an example. The batman's enemies are never those powerful bad men but the fears from himself. On that level, a small lake and the World Trade Center towers make no difference. In the walk, the biggest challenge is how to build the line between two towers. This is damn wrong, because audiences don't care the mechanical issues at all. It shouldn't be the key to success. It seems that as long as there was a steady and solid line between earth and moon, Philip won't let us down and won't let himself down&#xf04a;. Third, the wound. Feet are definitely the most important to a wire walker like Philip. With a ruined foot, Philip insisted performing the walk and he didn't fail unbelievably. All these three plots seem to be telling us Philip will fail and even die. I shrug. They are so deceptive logically.The way I would define a really good movie is whether something in the movie leave unforgettable marks in my mind. Despite all talked above, the walk doesn't make it. Did you get touched after watching the walk? If no, is it because it is a happy ending like conventional "live happily ever after" story? Maybe, partly. The walk is not a documentary film, so it should convey more apart from information. Audience are supposed to feel what Philip is feeling, facing the same challenges, following his footprints and praying for his coup. Maybe I require too much.In the end, the walk is just simply telling us a story and we are drinking water all the way along watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk on the wired side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to this film having watched the documentary "Man On The Wire" where the real Philippe Petit recounts the inside story of his jaw-dropping high-wire walk between the Twin Towers of New York, just before their construction was completed, in the summer of 1974. That was fascinating in itself, but in just using archive photography, couldn't in the end really deliver the actual physical experience of the walk that early August morning and that is what Robert Zemeckis, a director who knows a thing or two about creating the cinematic fantastic does here.The back up story of how Petit became a high-wire walker and planned his "coup" as he termed it, with his support team, I remembered from the earlier film and so I found myself impatiently hurrying these scenes along until the fateful moment when he sets out for his morning walk, suspended a mere quarter of a mile above the city. I must admit, it doesn't disappoint, the full scale of his vertiginous perambulation brought out with multiple viewpoint camera-work, taking the viewer up there with Petit as it happened.As the New York police arrive up on the roof of both buildings to call a halt to proceedings, it's all the viewer can do to stop shouting at them on the screen not to detract him from his walk as one slip of concentration could prove disastrous, even more so when they send a helicopter up above him, without thought of what the down-draft might do to him. Then incredibly, as in reality, Petit walks back and forth between the buildings, lying down halfway across and taking bows, remarkable as it may seem. I was reminded of those hair-raisingly famous black and white pictures of the workmen sitting astride the steel plates with their lunch canteens during the construction of the Emoire State Building in the 30's.Joseph-Gordon Levitt doesn't really have to do much (!) as Petit other than his enigmatic pieces to camera and accomplish the walks themselves but he convincingly succeeds in taking you into Petit's head, even down to speaking fluent French as the occasion demands. Ben Kingsley is effective as his mentor and teacher Papa Rudy, while the other major presences in the film are the Towers themselves and beyond them the city and people of New York itself.Reference is respectfully made at the end, as it must do, to the horrific events of September 11, but the film succeeds in ensuring that at least one other part of the Towers history celebrates the courage of one man during its construction as opposed to the cowardice of the many who plotted its destruction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I entered into the movie completely blank about the story or its background &amp; boy was i in for a treat of a lifetime!!The movie is like those roller coaster rides which slowly take you to the top, gradually building the excitement and expectations and then comes the top speed gut wrenching NOS propelled climax!!! And the fact that the story is based on true facts just adds to all the effect.The movie has a simple story of a normal guy with abnormal dreams to achieve in life. The journey from the point of inception of the dream to the exhilarating moment of its achievement is all the movie is about. But what makes the movie what it is the treatment of each and every scene, the camera angles, the characters and the lean &amp; mean story line, which never waivers from the central theme. The character builds up is just precisely handled. Just the right amount of details needed with no excruciating details. What keeps the movie smooth is the wittiness of its characters nicely removing the edges of the tensed journey.Overall its a must watch. Not one to b missed. Watch it Guys, u wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of fun to sit through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Walk' has such a terrific energy to it and is so much fun to watch that it effectively covers up its own flaws. You're enjoying yourself too much the whole time to think about any of the negative aspects the film may have going against it. The faults are there. The narration was often sloppily written and used too frequently for my liking, to the point where at one stage the narration cuts off actual dialogue the character himself is speaking to explain what he said in that moment - bizarre. Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the lead role is impressive but his very heavy French accent is rather tedious to listen to (and we spend a lot of the film listening to it). As mentioned though, these things are all forgivable because the film is just so damn entertaining.The introductory phase of the film (the first half) is done with a lot of style and class, but it's the second half of the film where it really comes into its own. I can't remember an hour of my life going by that quickly in a long time. The experience on the actual rope is directed with immense class by Robert Zemeckis. The average audience member is feeling pretty uncomfortable just watching what this man is doing and yet here he is on the screen looking as comfortable as if he's taking a stroll through the park, showing what a master of his art he was. The final piece of dialogue is also very well written and would have choked a lot of audience members up I'd imagine. A very enjoyable ride from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it slightly late but for all the hype around it. Felt it was a different subject and definitely gains a few brownie points. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has done an amazing job! The plot is catchy and gains more weight age with time. Felt the movie was slightly slow which was making it a bit of a struggle in the middle, but towards the end it was thrilling. Plot: Starts of with the passion for rope-walking; highlighting the passion and road to success in learning it.Expected the training part to be emphasized more especially where he pays to learn from his master. The parts of the movie shown in Paris gave a good start and firm foundation. They bring in the context of twin towers also well. Liked the way he makes disguises to hang around the twin towers and learn about the way to get to the rooftop. Emotional aspect with respect to his girl friend was too weak hardly emphasizing their importance. The desperation was well shown to make the event happen when they are facing troubles on the day of the act. Maybe there should have been a note about what happens to the actual artist since this is based on a true story</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid biographical drama+sorta heist movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk is a movie based on a true story about Philippe Petite, a high-wire artist, whose dream was to perform his art on the World Trade Center. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays the guy and he was pretty darn good at it. Add that with Zemeckis great direction and you were in his world. You felt his passion, his reasons, and his dedication. The movie is kinda a mixture of two genres. The first half is more of an origin story and biographical drama whereas the second half seems like a heist movie. The second half was splendid while the first half kinda stumbled. The first half builds the protagonist nicely but the romance kinda felt meh. It was great seeing him creating a team and planning the event and finally doing it in the second half though. Had all the goodness of a heist movie. Fun secondary characters, plan buildup and execution, tension in failure and improvisation etc. The cinematography in the movie was really great. The whole final sequence was JAW DROPPING. I actually felt like I was up there with Philippe and the height sent chills down my spine. People afraid of heights will probably get sick in this scene, it was that good. Beautifully handled and had right amount of breathing room. Plus, the use of CGI was great. The world trade towers looked amazing. One thing that really bugged me, especially in the start was Gordon Levitt's accent. It just felt odd and out of place, even if his acting was great. Also, the way movie handled his narration, with him standing on top of Statue of Liberty and directly talking to us didn't felt good. It took you out of the movie and the narration was sometimes too much where instead they should have just let the scenes do the talking. Since I had no idea about the story and how it happened, it was suspenseful watching it. And I would suggest everyone to not google the story if you plan on watching it. Going in blind is always the best way. 7.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Walk is directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the main role as Philippe Petit a wire man whose dream is to hang a wire in between the Two Towers in New York and walk on it. This movie is based on a true story,which I knew nothing about and honestly that made the experience much better considering that I did not know how it played out.The acting is magnificent,Joseph Gordon- Levitt has proved over and over again that he is an amazing actor.His accent in the movie I thought it would bother me when I heard it in the trailer but it actually did not.I got used to it very soon and by the end I even forgot that he was doing an accent at all. The movie does take its time to start though,as its very slow buildup in the beginning but the second half its astonishing and a wonderful achievement with stunning visual effects that make you feel as if you're actually there,and considering that I am afraid of heights it truly struck me and I loved it.It is also intense,interesting and above all inspiring.Seeing this guy do the impossible and make his dream come true that truly inspires me and everyone else who's seen it to go for our dream and try to do the impossible. I really enjoyed the movie,despite a very slow start and quiet honestly also a somewhat forced romance.Still this is a very well done movie with very good acting,great visuals and a very intense final act that will stay with you even after you see the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Walk": A new film directed by Robert Zemeckis about Philippe Petit, the man who walked on a wire between the twin towers in 1974. If you don't recognize the director's name then you'll probably recognize the titles of his filmography such as the "Back to the Future" trilogy, "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", "Forrest Gump", "Cast Away", and "Death Becomes Her" to name the bulk of his live action films. For a while between 2004 and 2009 he focused directly in animation with "The Polar Express", "Beowulf" and "A Christmas Carol"; they weren't bad by any means, but I will say that they were a low point, in my opinion, comparing it to his prior films. In 2012 he made a return to live action film making with "Flight" starring Denzel Washington, I haven't seen it yet but I really wanted to since it looked like it would be good. So for me, his return to making a really good film in live action is this right here. "The Walk" is a fun time that I wished to God that I could have seen in 3D because I could tell from the start that this was probably an impressive piece to see on an 3D IMAX screen. The cinematography and use of CGI is something that should be considered a new standard for the quality to be seen with a film like this where the gimmick is to feel like you're actually there. I saw it in 2D and I felt like I was going to fall 100 stories as it was. The narration was even a fun way to move the story along, it never felt pointless or treated the viewer as an idiot, but was pretty fun. The characters are a joy to watch; even Philippe who was played by Joseph Gordon- Levitt, as much of a jerk as he is I could still feel like I could route for this guy. He's arrogant, doesn't listen to anyone, he believes himself to be better than everyone, and I could even describe as an asshole? but he had such an optimism and energy to him that I couldn't help but get excited about whatever he was excited about. And the film acknowledged multiple times that he's a douche so at least I knew that it wasn't trying to trick me. One thing that I loved about this movie is that it was a love letter to the twin towers without bringing up 9/11 once. At any moment this movie could have gone the sappy route to make a cheap attempt to bring in the emotional factor to manipulate people, but it didn't. Like at the end, it could have flash forward to 2001 with a single tear dropping down on Philippe's cheek or a paragraph about how so many lost their lives and they'll always be remembered. Something that could have been an easy way to rake in the suckers to say "'MERICA!" and I'm so happy that they didn't. It was very respectful while still moving along its own story, which played out as a heist movie only about a guy wanting to walk on a wire. And when that scene happens?god, I just kept saying in my head, "Would you please get off that wire so I can breathe again!!!" Suspenseful and cringe worthy is the least I can say about the final act of the film. So if you haven't seen the movie, check it out because it's fun. If you ever get the chance I'm sure that it'll be worth seeing in 3D because it goes from atmospheric to very gimmicky 3D, even in 2D it was fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch The "Man On Wire" Documentary Instead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Forrest Gump, Cast Away &amp; Flight, The Walk is a sumptuously crafted, visually striking &amp; swiftly paced recreation of the historic event that took place on August 7, 1974 when a high-wire artist performed an illegal tight rope walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, and while this movie is a sappy melodrama for the most part, it is able to redeem itself to some extent with its gripping third act.Set in the 1970s, the story of The Walk follows French street performer Philippe Petit whose ultimate dream is to walk the immense void between the two towers of World Trade Center. The plot takes us through his earlier life, how he was introduced to the art of wire walking, the sudden realisation of his dream when he saw the image of WTC for the first time &amp; the preparation that went into pulling off "the artistic coup of the century" with his accomplices.Co-written &amp; directed by Robert Zemeckis, The Walk exaggerates the whole event a tad too excessively and is presented as a light-hearted comedy full of heart, warmth &amp; dreams. The movie is about the infamous walk but it also acts as a nostalgic tour of the New York skyline that looks a little different now. The screenplay adds in fictional elements to make its drama more evocative but not all manipulative moments work out in its favour and some of them weren't even required.Visual effects is truly spectacular for those Twin Towers are brought to life in splendid detail. Camera-work is also effective as Zemeckis keeps an eye for 3D photography which is at its finest during the climax and the camera relies on minimal movements to capture all those vertigo-inducing sequences. The editing could've fasten things up a bit for the whole movie is more of a wait till its final rope-walk, where some tension is expertly sustained for a while but the level of seriousness one expects in such a suicidal scene is missing.Coming to the performances, The Walk features a good cast in Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ben Kingsley, Charlotte Le Bon &amp; James Badge Dale, in which only Gordon-Levitt leaves any bit of an impression. To watch Gordon-Levitt speaking in French accent is definitely amusing but his performance is what keeps everything tied together and while his input is nowhere near to his career-best work, it's still a joyful performance. Kingsley does what's expected from him while both Le Bon &amp; Dale chip in with apt contributions in their supporting roles.On an overall scale, The Walk should've been what it was during the third act for the earlier two acts aren't as compelling as expected. Even the climax isn't as intense or nail-biting as I'd hoped and is handled quite playfully. This is one part where the film could've turned the whole event into a bone-chilling experience without deviating from what happened in reality. While there are promises seen in those little glimpses that illustrate the extreme danger of what this high-wire artist was doing, the movie fails to capitalise on such moments. A mediocre biopic at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow start leads to an Intense and Grippingly Realistic Finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things i hate the most happens to be heights/high falls..... This is the closest i'm going to get to facing that in real life. Anyway, to the review. 'The Walk' is a Drama Biopic about Philippe Pettit, the man who made it his mission, his dream, to walk on a wire between the World Trade Centre Towers in August 1974. This was a story that i had not heard about until this movie was announced, and when i heard of the premise, i thought it sounded very interesting and being directed by Robert Zemeckis only increased my intrigue. This movie looked really dramatic and suspenseful from the trailer, and was it? Well..... yes and no. The movie has a very slow burn, it started off quite flat and the entire first act was filled with introduction and setup that wasn't that interesting. The second act is where the film picks up and i started getting pretty interested in the story and just how Pettit was going to pull off this feat. But the third act is where the film hits its peak, the last 30 minutes or so was intense, edge-of-seat stuff that had me frozen with fear, but was it enough to make up for the slow build. Joseph Gordon-Levitt played Philippe Pettit and although i do like him as an actor, he really didn't work in this role. Some of his performance was definitely convincing and dramatic at the big moments in the film but at all other times his performance was just distracting. My biggest issue was with the French accent he tries to put on, lets be honest, it was not good, like at all. It bothered me in the trailer and at the beginning of the film but i hoped that as the film went on i would get used to it and it would become part of the character.... Nope, it was obviously fake and distracting at the beginning and it was obviously fake and distracting at the end. It would initially seem like a minor gripe but it did take me out of the film quite a bit, especially during the first two acts, so it was a disappointment. My other issue was with the decision to structure part of the film as a narration, where you have sections that are just showing Gordon-Levitt narrating the current situation or hinting at what will happen next. These scenes really were quite pointless, they break up any of the tension that the film is trying to build up and what is described in these scenes you could have understood from the scenes preceding it and following it. I guess Zemeckis was going for something a little different but the film would have benefited more without those scenes. Like i mentioned, the majority of the first act was rather flat; there wasn't really anything of interest going on. There were a few short moments focusing on his journey into the art of 'tightrope walking'(?) that i kinda liked and were alright scenes. The second act is where a lot of the build up was happening and it was feeling much like a heist film where you have intense planning stages and testing and where the stakes for later are introduced. I do like a good heist film, so this second act was very refreshing and definitely added to the big finale. And what a finale it was. It was grand, and tense and it really was a spectacle to see how it looked from the roof of the World Trade Centre. The visuals were incredible and you felt like you were hovering 110 floors above ground, sweaty palms and all. That final sequence was incredible and enhanced my overall experience watching this film. Also, the cinematography combined with the great visual effects made for a very visually beautiful film that was very cool to look at even when nothing really was going on.So in the end, 'The Walk' suffers mainly from a slow first act and a distracting French accent. But the heist-like second act and the intense jaw-dropping finale make up for the early woes and the result is a good film that was worth watching if you are at all interested in the story. - 7.3</fullReview>

I think this film is a wonderful, honorable tribute to the Twin Towers. For all the people who loved those towers, from the architect, to the citizens of New York. Now the Twin Towers are made infinite. I also love the way Art is a key role in this film. I think Joseph Gordon - Levitt also should receive many credits for his performance. He is the perfect actor for a comedy/action film like this one. Also Robert Zemickis does an excellent job on the techniques. The scenery is amazing and the towers look more beautiful than ever.

		<fullReview>I don't think The Walk is without its flaws. At points I really like the narration, and at others not that much. I do think that the screenplay also glosses over a lot of the psychological intrigue of the man in question, and instead opts for bigger thrills and more surface-level characterization. But even still, it's an engaging piece of work, beautifully directed and shot. Although the biggest strength is in its last thirty minutes (the film really does capture the sort of magic and awe that Petit felt) everything before that does a good job of setting up the characters. Joseph Gordon Levitt is really fantastic in the lead role, probably one of his finest performances in his career. He really captures a character that is both human and fantastical while still feeling grounded.</fullReview>

While under the guidance of his mentor known as Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley), the French daredevil hashes out a plan to walk across a tightrope attached between the north and south towers of the World Trade Center. With the help of his team of accomplices and against all odds, he attempts the seemingly insurmountable challenge back on Aug, 7, 1974.My original intention was to skip this one after seeing the trailer because I thought it was going to be bad. First, I thought Joseph Gordon-Levitt's french accent was bad and he just seemed out of place in the film. Second, I thought the whole 3D/IMAX thing was just going to be a gimmick and it was going to be nothing more than an excuse to charge more money for 3D/IMAX tickets and not add anything to the story. Luckily, I was only wrong about one of those thoughts. Now with the story, the majority does serve as a buildup to the aforementioned walk which is what the film is named after. For me, I found it did go a little too slowly during these moments, especially the moments where he was a kid and then a teen. Also I quite enjoyed the scenes between Philippe's younger self (also played by Gordon-Levitt) and Papa Rudy as the chemistry between the two made them entertaining. It was a shame that we didn't get to see too many of them as it is implied that most of his training happened offscreen or he learnt a lot of it on his own. From what I saw, either of those seem likely. They also tried to give Philippe a love interest in the film by introducing a beautiful singer named Annie (Charlotte Le Bon). I found she served no purpose in the film other than slightly advancing the plot at the beginning. Their scenes were not as good because they had little chemistry. I did not care so much for the other characters as the film did not bother to develop them. I thought the story started to get remotely interesting once all of the characters finally reached New York City. Despite being silly and a little cliché at times, the part of the story involving him and his team getting the walk together and ready was engaging. When we finally got to the infamous walk, it started off promising. This sequence, as shown in the trailers, really took advantage of the 3D/IMAX technology as you could feel how high up he was and how far he had to walk. Of course this happened a few times before as we saw him attempt the same feats as practice but never at the scale of this last walk. It is also a shame that it went on for around 15-20 minutes too long as the story started to get silly in order to justify this extra time. What happened afterwards was just as if not more silly. Now I probably would have gotten into the film a lot more if Joseph Gordon-Levitt's french accent wasn't bad and if he just seemed less out of place in the film. What I hated about the film were the shots of Philippe telling his story on screen and the narration because I did not find it necessary to the film as it kept saying things that were blatantly obvious or not important. Overall, the destination was pretty good but I just wished it matched the journey.Score: 7.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May be too simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie at the cinema near the place I am studying. I also bring my friend with me watching the movie, he was okay with it but he told me that the story might be too simple. For me, it was entertaining me in the cinema hall but I am not sure if it may give me the same feeling as I watched it in the cinema when I watch it again on television or else. The story line is going well and I admit the part or scene that entertained me the most was the final scene, walking on the electric-wire between of 2 world trade center buildings. Since it is based on the Philippe Petit's biography, most of the audiences or peoples could expect how was the ending would be (not all exactly know who is him). Lastly, it's worth for watching it in the cinema but for me, I seem to be agreeing with what my friend just has said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I doubt there's a review of The Walk that doesn't refer to 9/11. Ever since I saw the trailer, I was curious how a film about the man who walked a tightrope between the two towers would be successful in our post-9/11 era. Don't get me wrong: I'm not one of those 'Never Forget' people. My stake in this is purely an intellectual one. 9/11 is still such a touchy subject and The Walk treats the towers as a miraculous spectacle, so of course I couldn't help but wonder how director Zemeckis would pull this off, but pull this off he has.Petit stands on top of the statue of liberty and assumes the role of narrator. He tells us that when people ask him why he risks death, he says that to walk on the wire means precisely the opposite to him: life. We flashback to his childhood, his early fascination with wire-walking, how his father disapproved; you get the idea. He works as a street artist (emphasis on artist, Petit would say) and soon meets another fellow artist, a guitar player, Annie. They of course start seeing each other and he tells her his plan of walking between the towers. They travel to New York, gather a rag tag group of accomplices and start planning their coup.By far the film's greatest asset is its humorous and adventurous spirit. Zemeckis's influence is most felt here. The early scenes involving Petit's childhood and his Paris days are told with a humor and forward momentum that are quite infectious. All this is helped by Levitt's acting. I must admit I had some doubts when I saw his typically boyish face, cheeky eyes and heard his broken 'Frenglish' in the trailer, but he is very believable.Zemeckis's style extends to how The Walk treats the towers. You'd expect there to be some kind of sentimental wink and nod that refers to the obvious tragedy, but I found none, at least none that were oh so obvious. The Walk plays out as if the tragedy never took place and within the context of this film, I'd say that's the best strategy. The Walk is about Petit's fascination with tightrope walking, not a documentary on how jet fuel can't melt steel beams.Unfortunately, things aren't looking too good on the drama front. When the film's having fun with its zesty style, I'm having fun as well, but there are times when we're forced to trod through dramatic scenes that don't have a lasting impact. This is mostly felt in Petit and Annie's relationship which is never really fleshed out. What's worse is that she doesn't really do anything important and their relationship is not the focal point of the film, so it's extra hard to care about the outcome of their relationship.There's a part of me that finds The Walk a tad exploitative, mainly due to its use of 3D. A couple of years ago, a documentary on Petit was made. This story has basically already been told, but now Zemeckis, that trusty Hollywood magician, is going to recreate the same events...IN 3D!! I highly doubt Zemeckis would have made The Walk if 3D technology didn't exist. As for the 3D itself, it's impressive at times, but mostly functional. There's a few scenes that involve objects flung at the audience at high speed which has got to be the easiest trick in the book. Come on, Zemeckis. Did your film really need that? It doesn't add anything. It only makes me aware I'm sitting in a theater, when I'm supposed to be standing right next to Petit.Overall though, I'd say The Walk is a very enjoyable film hampered only by some poorly executed drama. Zemeckis must've been walking a tightrope himself when balancing the tone of his film, but I'm glad he went with what he knows: adventure. 9/11 wasn't an issue during Petit's stunt (obviously), so it shouldn't be an issue in The Walk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third 3D movie so far to be 3D for a reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk is a spectacle. The cinematography and the use of VFX and CGI are an inspiring example of how these sort of effects are meant to be used, not for the sake of using them, for the sake of creating something extraordinary, but for making something real. The visuals carry the story that has its handful of cheesy parts and corny meanderings but it all builds up to the spectacle in the clouds, and that really is a spectacle. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in my opinion, was not in his best form. Or rather, he was just fine, just like everybody else, but the American doing a French accent especially as light-heartedly as Zemeckis seems to like it, it just comes out comicy. Still, The Walk has some Forest Gump greatness in it. It has the inspiration and the inspiring cinematography to carry it. And for once (or actually for the third time since Life of Pi and The Immortals) 3D is actually working. Loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this film which is a truly offbeat story. The true tale of this french acrobat who realized the amazing, unbelievable performance to walk between the WTC Twin Towers on a wire string. The first half of the film looks like a minor french movie, or some kind of LE FABULEUX DESTIN D'AMELIE POULAIN stuff. In short, plenty of french touch, with a slight of poetry. This film is also a homage to friendship, companionship and dedication. Then, in the second part, the feature suddenly looks like a heist movie scheme, in the line of OCEAN'S ELEVEN. It's also a movie which brings much emotion, and not only because of the impressive void shots that may feel many audiences dizzy. Not only because of that. Don't expect a true happy ending here, not as you may wish, I mean. You may feel a bad taste in your mouth. Because if you really think deeply about this movie, you'll realize that is not only a documentary of what this guy made, but also a moving, poignant homage for the LATE Twin Towers. Twin Towers that don't exist anymore. ANYTHING is told in this film, but the Twin Towers are, for me, the real lead characters in this true poignant and touching feature. That's my point of view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Walk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1974, high-wire artist Philippe Petit recruits a team of people to help him realise his dream: to walk the immense void between the World Trade Center towers.The Walk is directed by Robert Zemeckis, stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and is based on a true story. I won't spoil you what happens because I didn't know when I went to the movie and it was suspenseful. I loved it. You may say what you will about Joseph Gordon-Levitt's accent but he does earn points for commitment, going through the trouble of delivering a significant portion of his dialogue in French. Whatever you may think of his weird wig and contacts, the physical aspects of his performance do impress as he adapts the catlike moves of a professional funambulist. Levitt does the best performance he could have done with this character. However, I found myself not 100% invested with his character as in the first half it drags a bit. Robert Zemeckis has magician's ability to blend character and technology. Indeed Zemeckis re-creates the wild dream of this man as only cinema can, giving audiences a thrilling 3D all angles view of an experience that, until now, only one man on Earth could claim to have lived. This film is visually miraculous. Engaging incredible CGI. This is something Zemeckis is becoming very well-known for, using CGI among live action filmmaking and making it seem seen less. There are sequences in this film that are absolutely jaw-dropping. The last half of the movie focuses up completely. Philippe Petit performance may be victimless crimes, but they are crimes nonetheless, and the fact that he and his crew must plan the World Trade Center coup in secret lends in much of its suspense. After all they're defying not only gravity, but the laws as well. How long can you hold your breath? Because the 17-minutes wire-walking sequence is the most majestic simulation of a real event since the ship sinking in Titanic: a triumph of photo realistic digital effects. Finally, Zemeckis did such a great job because when he's up there you feel like you are up there with him, these towers are here and it's 1974, we are all up on a freaking wire. Overall the script simply tells rather than explore but the visuals are amazing, the CGI is flawless and really beautiful to look at. The 3D is genuinely breath-taking and acting is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the Man on a Wire doco (2008) I didn't know what to expect - would this be too similar and therefore not so interesting? No, it was worth the watch, the 3D was well used and the story ambled along nicely but with enough tension at times to actually make my palms sweat (probably why I gave it 8/10 rather than a more realistic 7).The start was worrying - in the opening scene the leading actors' French accent was disappointing and made me cringe - a fake French accent has to be very good to NOT remind me of Peter Sellars - but before long I was forgetting that and enjoying a pleasant story. The simple fact is that attempting to walk a wire between the twin towers was bloody amazing and Petit went for it independently - not sponsored (as far as I know), against the law and with his own misfit team of dreamers. You have to the admire such spirit and marvel at what the human mind and body, at best, are capable of. The Young Petit succeeds where many humans fail in the single-minded pursuit of the dream to it's conclusion. To this end the script takes you as reasonably close to the heart and mind of the man as you need to go, and when Petit steps onto the wire you are with him.There is the obligatory love interest, good cinematography and solid support from Ben Kingsley. For Americans the recreation of the Twin Towers might add poignancy. Watch uncritically - and see if your palms sweat.</fullReview>

You know he is going to walk on the rope between the twin towers, by seeing the posters, trailer or the earlier documentary, but the struggle of the Central character was missing. Seems Like Zemeckis was inspired by Life of Pie rather than of his own movie Forrest gump.You can watch walk, not only for the adrenaline effects, but for the twin towers. The movie looks like the character of The Stranger who appears just before the Final Act, for reason UNKNOWN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With an incredible synergy between the consistent work of the cast and dazzling visual effects, The Walk turns out to be a quite charming and inspiring movie but also knows how to put you on the edge of your seat. It's inspired by the true story of Philippe Petit's pursuit to fulfill his dream although many think that it was dangerous and practically impossible. The scenes on the wire are simply breathtaking. The immersion is amazing and the walk is so beautiful and tense, during it, you feel a weightlessness combined with some symmetry making it appear that Philippe is dancing on the wire. To add to the grandeur of these scenes there is an impressive work in the setting, creating compelling scenarios that allied with realistic visual effects gave to the audience a feeling of actually be witnessing something real. Something that caught my attention was the explanation of even though most of the characters have french origin, they still speak most of the time English. Much has claimed from the lack of cohesiveness of this aspect in other films, but The Walk manages to give a clever explanation. This may not be as relevant in the story, but it makes the movie more coherent.Philippe Petit is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, his commitment with the role was so hard that he learned how to really walk on the wire. The performance along with the charisma put in the character gave to the public a pleasant person to be with and get to know. Another interesting aspect is that Philippe Petit is the movie narrator, and so, he breaks the fourth wall, bringing him to much closer to the audience. Let's not forget about the supporting cast, as without them, Philippe wouldn't even have installed the wire. They manage to create characters that even if every one has a different personality, their love to each other unites them to help Philippe accomplish his dream, so the bond between them is very perceptible as the strength of their friendship. Making feel like they're a family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Love Letter To The Twin Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor/Vague SpoilersI've always been on the lookout for anything Joseph Gordon-Levitt (A.K.A. JGL) ever since "(500) Days of Summer (2009)" and his fantastic directorial debut "Don Jon (2013)". So, going into this movie I was anticipating him because his performances from his past films have always been a standout even going back to 10 Things I Hate About You (1999).The Walk is a biographical drama film directed and written by Robert Zemeckis based on the story of French high-wire artist Philippe Petit's walk between the Twin Towers, before being fully constructed, on August 7, 1974. Sadly, I wasn't able to get to a 3D version of the film as there weren't any showings at all and so I had to settle for standard 2D. Usually, I don't want to go and see a film in 3D but because of the climax of this film and that it wasn't converted from 2D to 3D it was actually filmed for the purpose of being 3D I was really excited to see one of my first 3D movies. So this review is solely from the perspective of a non-3D viewer. The CGI in the film was perfect and because it was made for 3D there were certainly parts where you could tell that would've been a great moment in 3D, not even including the finale, so it was almost heartbreaking to know that I was missing out on an even more impressive visual experience. Something I wasn't anticipating was the way the film would be narrated, which was by Gordon-Levitt as Philippe Petit on top of the Statue of Liberty with the Twin Towers in the background. At first I thought it was out of place and that it was a little jarring but as the film went on I found that it did fit the tone of the film so I ended up really enjoying the narration part of the film.Something around the first 90 minutes is an entire build up to the sequence that everyone wants to see. I really enjoyed the entire sequence of them setting up the wires on the Twin Towers and how they were able to set everything up. It actually reminded me, almost, of a heist film even though they weren't actually stealing anything. It was odd as well because the first, maybe, third of the film has a different storyline happening that is more of a love story where Petit and Annie, portrayed by Charlotte Le Bon, are living their lives and trying to get to New York. The performances, overall, were great and Gordon-Levitt's French accent never let up and I don't recall ever hearing even the slightest bit of an American accent. You see Petit's life as he started out as a street performer and the chemistry he and Le Bon had was great and you could tell this relationship was realistic. Other supporting cast members include Ben Schwartz, Ben Kingsley, James Badge Dale, and Steve Valentine and they all add to the humour of the film and carrying out? The walk?I, actually, had no idea of how this story played out other than that a man was on a wire and walked from one tower to the other. I haven't seen the documentary, Man on a Wire, so I was on the edge of my seat really anticipating that there was a possibility that he may fall off. It also seems to play like a love letter to the Twin Towers especially the final shot of the film and the way Petit speaks about the towers once he first sees them in a news photo. Finally, the climax of the film is spectacular. Some of the first person shots really put you on the edge of your seat. There are some shots that happen as you hear Gordon-Levitt's voice-over and he only sees the wire and then the scene transforms to us seeing what he is telling us. It adds to the film that we can get into his head and see what he sees, in a way. There was a moment where Petit did something on the wire and it made, not only me, but other people in the theatre let out a small yell of shock that we thought that what he did wasn't going to turn out so well. The finale was extremely well done and just that sequence was worth the price of admission into the cinema. Overall, it was a film that had many different elements to it and an epic finale where it all payed off to create a very visually impressive film that I would say is definitely needed to be seen on the big screen and in 3D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the sort of film the stereoscopic vision is made for! As someone who is terrified of heights, I made a point of seeing this precisely in 3D, to be able to experience something I'd never dare in real life. And it bloody worked! I don't know how it would pan out in common 2D screening, but here I found palms of my hands sweating during the whole half-an-hour sequence of Philippe Petit gently strolling over the abyss of the legendary WTC towers. Although I was well aware of the happy outcome of the accomplishment beforehand AND the fact that I was watching a well crafted reenactment, I couldn't help worrying that the guy would just fall off the wire. I guess that's what wire walking is all about. No matter how many times it's done successfully, the obvious thinness of the wire and fragility of the feat remind you that one wrong step could end in tragedy and the swarm of "What-Ifs" constantly bombard your brain.In other words, the main goal set out by the film crew worked marvelously. The film totally brings close what it would feel like to walk on a tight rope from one building to another. Another goal - to bring close what it meant to Philippe Petit, to show what was it like to be THAT man on THAT day between THOSE buildings - I'm afraid they accomplished that too. I'm afraid the cheesy narration, the irritating French accent and the cheap slapstick quality of flashback scenes in France, despite me resenting them - worked! They were cynical means to an end to show what is like to be a flamboyant, narcissistic persona of a tightrope genius that is Philippe Petit, someone who is otherwise pretty damn hard to relate to. Yes, the film is almost completely Petit's subjective, noncritical point of view, but it's probably the only way to fully grasp the gravity and meaning of what he has done. Otherwise, it would probably run risk of being just another run-of-the-mill biopic.I heartily recommend this to anyone, regardless of the attitude towards heights, tightrope walkers or piety to what was to become of the Twins twenty seven years after this event. I do have to take two marks off the perfect ten, though. One for glossing over other tremendous accomplishments Petit has done prior to that day (walk across Sydney Harbour bridge, for instance), and one for me, because I'm a sucker for run-of-the-mill biopics and I think I might still rather see a more all-encompassing view of the event that took place on 7th of August, 1974.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Walk is Mesmerising in a Stunning Third Act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk, which is the latest film from Robert Zemeckis, tells the story of Philippe Petit's incredible wire walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in 1974. It stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Petit in a performance that's hugely charismatic and physically impressive, although his French accent veers towards Allo Allo. But I believed him in the role and was quickly charmed by his narration to the audience from the top of the Statue of Liberty. This sets the tone of the movie and establishes a character who wants to impress. Petit is driven and determined -- first, merely to walk on a wire, then to entertain and play to an audience as he sets his sights higher and higher. Where The Walk stumbles is through a lack of character depth and lacking truly meaningful relationships, but it's well paced and makes good use of 3D within the narrative. Essentially, The Walk is a heist movie, as Petit and his accomplices plan every tiny aspect of his walk in detail. They must measure and chart every step, find inside men and sneak themselves and their equipment up both towers before Petit can actually make his walk. Then, he does it and something special happens. The awesome sight of Petit 110 stories high is brought to dizzying life in the most spectacular of ways. The 3D proving essential and actually working within the narrative; it's moving and wondrous. Brilliantly realised and incredibly involving. The Walk has its flaws, but the final act is one of the most exhilarating moments in all of modern cinema. See it on a huge screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How I wish I could unsee Man on Wire, winner of the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature in 2009. The documentary, which is almost like a police procedural, is simply outstanding, poised between artistry and madness. Its runtime is 95min and I held my breath for most of it. Robert Zemeckis' The Walk's runtime is 2 hours but I only held my breath for the final 45min.It is a shame that Zemeckis' Petit is impenetrable. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays him with panache and he does seem to have loads of fun with the character, but the movie just didn't manage to get under the skin of Philippe Petit. What makes him tick? Why does he want to tempt death? All the answers to these questions are never explored to satisfaction. The word "dream" was thrown around many times, but that is such a shallow reason. The only trait that shines brilliantly is his complete narcissism and that certainly doesn't endear us towards him. Personally, my wife and I didn't like the in-your-face narration which is cloying and tacky. Don't even get me talking about the rest of Petit's partners-in-crime because they are all peripherals. It is just a shame that the characters are not painted convincingly, or else I am pretty sure I won't be able to stop a tear from streaming down during the last dialogue which is actually a love letter to the Twin Towers.The movie only begins to hit its groove once it reaches the caper segment. It was enjoyable to see all the elements coming into place and there is a sleekness to the direction. But when the movie reaches the final act... Oh my goodness... You can almost forgive all the prior faults. I am never an advocate of technical stuff like Atmos, DTS-X, IMAX and 3D, because these technical stuff don't enhance the narrative. However, in the case of The Walk, the IMAX 3D absolutely serves the story and lets you feel what it is to step out into the void 412 metres above the hard concrete. This is "hand in your mouth" and "balls to the wall" stuff. I lost count of the number of times I flinched and swallowed back hard. My wife next to me was literally covering her face with her hands. The IMAX 3D is so amazing that I can tell you, without a shadow of a doubt that if you don't plan to see the movie in this format, you don't need to see this at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A technical masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story/Pacing: The film is very gimmicky throughout the whole piece making it reasonably fast paced. This is one of those films where the fourth wall is broken by having the main character speak to the audience about his exploits and it seems to work quite well. That being said however, the comedic beats aren't as funny as what the film believes they will be and sometimes only serve to make the film very arrogant. This took me out of the zone of the film on occasion. The characters are certainly not the works of an amateur writer but I felt many of them didn't actually go anywhere, nor did their relationships. The most frustrating was the teacher/student relationship which was set up to be very tense, funny and dramatic but it just wasn't explored enough and it left me feeling very disappointed. Otherwise, the film is reasonably funny and very exciting.Acting: Joseph Gordon-Levitt's acting is remarkable. Whether he nails the French accent or not, he is extremely convincing. Ben Kingsley was alright but I didn't really see anything amazing like I'd expect from an actor of his caliber. At the end of his sentences his real accent seems to slip out. To top it off he is actually not in it that much which was mildly disappointing. Everybody else was reasonably good except James Badge Dale who I thought was exceptional as a fast talking but caring semi-hustler.Technically: The film is a technical masterpiece. Firstly, a lot of the moving shots are very smooth and impressive. Each angle makes sense to the story and even though they can seem wanky they really highlight what film makers can do with the current technology at their disposal. The VFX were simply beautiful. The New York landscapes seemed to have being created with such care and precision that to the untrained eye it is very real. The twin towers were also gorgeous on the big screen. In 3D the look of the film is just magnificent. It is such a rush when you are watching from the top of the towers and the camera is moving around smoothly. I believe its the sense of realism that the CGI gives, which makes the film a technical masterpiece. Lastly, the colour palette is exuberant. There is a B&amp;W scene which has little things highlighted as their natural colors and something about it looks beautiful and natural. The rest of the film is lit and graded very nicely.Music: Works well with the images on the screen but it certainly doesn't feel original. It sounds a lot like the style of music that is in some of Sam Mendes' films. Very sombre and deep but lifts in moments tension. Not original but it works which is the main thing.Overall, the film is a technical masterpiece above all else. There is a decent, funny, dramatic and original story being told but the lack of character/relationship development and the beautiful imagery makes the viewer focus more on the look of the film and the adrenaline it provides rather than the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't need to be a full movie, but the titular walk is worth seeing on the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout The Walk, especially in its first half, I was struck by how much it felt like a Disney movie. The sunlight bathed colour pallet, the playful and soaring musical score and the beautiful country setting - I was half expecting rabbits to bound on screen and sing a four- part harmony while Joseph Gordon-Levitt walked the wire. You can absolutely feel touches of Forrest Gump and Back to the Future - Zemeckis' most colourful and fun films - throughout his handling of this film.The Walk opens with Joseph Gordon-Levitt narrating to us from the top of the Statue of Liberty's torch. Terrible artistic decision. The whole thing felt like an incredibly lame tourism commercial that you'd see in New York before you get on an elevator to climb the Empire State Building. Zemeckis refuses to "show don't tell" and insists on having Philippe either voice it over or stop the movie by cutting back to him on the torch and speaking to us. It felt like a play, and not in a good sense. Even worse is when Philippe narrates twice - in person, and as voice over. Whilst Gordon-Levitt's boundless energy and charm made it less grating, the film would never have missed it. The biggest thing that The Walk has going against it is that until Philippe ends up on the wire, the movie has very little story to tell. His background as a troubadour in Paris is cute and charming, but its no different to a story we've seen a million times and its certainly not remarkable enough to warrant two thirds of a 35 million dollar film. Gordon-Levitt is wonderful as Philippe, charming and funny whilst also showing (not telling) us that arrogance is essential for his profession, because to have self doubts is to die. Its a performance reminiscent of Jean Dujardin in OSS 117. His chemistry with Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) is sweet if far from noteworthy, which is an apt enough description of Le Bon herself now that I think of it. Ben Kingsley was completely wasted as a one-note mentor character, and his relationship with Philippe is exaggerated to the point of disbelief. He has multiple sons in the business, yet gives a family heirloom to a young vagabond who has a dream. Philippe's accomplices are extremely forgettable - especially a pair of losers played by Benedict Samuel and Ben Schwartz who bail at the first opportunity and we wonder why they were brought in in the first place. Every time Steve Valentine was on screen, I just stared at his moustache in disbelief. Sure there are a lot of things wrong with The Walk, but its extremely charming and even reverent at times. Once we get through Philippe's dream and how we are going to carry it out, we get into an almost heist movie layout. Philippe and his accomplices sneak their way up to the top of the building and prepare the wire. Save for one stupid scene where Philippe strips naked and flounders around to find a fishing wire (a sign that sometimes real life is too ridiculous to be put on screen), the whole thing is so much more exciting. Zemeckis and his cinematography and visual effects team do an absolutely unreal job of creating the Twin Towers and aerial shots of New York. There's one cringeworthy shot of the wire collapsing during set up which was shot only for the purpose of 3D and nothing else, but other than that I was extremely impressed. I was suffering some serious vertigo when he first stepped on that wire, and I didn't doubt for a second what Philippe had told us - I just don't know if I could take that first step. As Philippe playfully strolls back and forth along the wire in mockery of the police calling him down, my jaw was on the floor at how believable the whole thing looked. I can't capture it in words, but it earns a whole star just for that.The Walk peters out pretty quickly after the titular act, as you'd probably expect. This didn't need to be a whole movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is very good in the role and the visual recreation of the walk is a thing of wonder, and that makes it worth seeing alone.Also, there's a scene where a French guy says "My name is Jeff."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie to be watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in high expectations for watching this movie. And yes, I liked the movie very much. It is basically about a man named Phileppe attempting to walk on a wire between the Twin Towers. It is based upon an actual life event. To be more specific , from the book ' Reaching The Sky 'I loved Joseph Gordon-Levitt's acting. He also had to ' fake ' the French accent. It was quite convincing . Hats off to his ' Accent Acting ' . His sense of humor was quite sarcastic . The suspenseful events managed to keep everyone on their feet. Towards the end, things turned quite drastic and kept the audience clinched. The IMAX 3D Effect was superb ! I also felt that sometimes, the scriptwriters had dragged the story here and there. Nonetheless, they did a very good job. Director was good too.Verdict : It's a very enthralling film. If you're planning to watch a movie with your family or friends, this is definitely a movie to be watched . Keep in mind, this stunt has actually been performed by an actual person.My Rating:- 8.3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating but Offers Nothing New</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to see The Walk in IMAX 3D last weekend. In the past I have been a fan of a lot of the works of Robert Zemeckis including Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, and Flight. Without a doubt my favorite of his films is Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Going into this film I had a good idea about what movie I was about to see. I was familiar with the 2008 documentary, Man on Wire, so unless Zemeckis took some huge creative liberties with the story, I knew what I was getting into with film. I was not expecting any surprises due to my familiarity to both the original story and the stylistic sensibilities of Robert Zemeckis. Although this film is, at moments, extremely captivating and thrilling it fails to capture the imagination in the same way that the documentary does. Although some believe that The Walk shouldn't be compared to Man on Wire, I believe it should because they both tell the same story with almost identical beats throughout each film and attempt to accomplish the same thing. Man on Wire seems to imprint the thought of stepping on that wire and the actual insanity in it all with more enthusiasm and greater weight. While The Wire didn't astonish me, the film still had some great qualities. The performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt down the line were powerful and captivating and displayed characters with a blend of realism with a fantasy-like quality. The cinematography throughout the film is all around amazing and make the true spectacle of all of the events that occur throughout the story realized with some astonishing visual elements. While the film will have you leaning forward in anticipation at times it also drags in the middle and has a climax that feel somewhat unfulfilledThe film has its pros and cons but I would recommend this film to any person who has no interest in watching a documentary but is still interested in seeing the visualization of an amazing true story. Not to take away from the accomplishments of this film, but this story overall is better expressed and displayed in the documentary Man on Wire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drips with that typical Zemeckis schmaltz, but isn't sunk by it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Robert Zemeckis has produced some of America's most beloved films. Works like "Back to the Future" (1985) and "Forrest Gump" (1994) are the favorites of many. But even when viewing the world from 1,362 feet in the air, Zemeckis' latest work, "The Walk", doesn't reach the heights set by its predecessors."The Walk" follows the incredible true story of Philippe Petit (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a tightrope walker from France who dreams of walking the distance between the Twin Towers in New York City just after their construction in 1974. After years of training, Petit assembles a team to assist him in executing his highly dangerous and illegal plan. From the start, this film has been at a disadvantage because of its Oscar-winning counterpart, "Man on Wire" (2008), a documentary that also details Petit's unbelievable feat. Because the world is already well aware of this story, especially given how recently the documentary was released, there was little "The Walk" offered me in terms of revelation. I already knew the tale the film was going to tell me, so the challenge for Zemeckis was to fill in the gaps the documentary left behind and to do so as engagingly as possible. However, unlike many biopics of recent memory, "The Walk" didn't take the gritty, tell-all approach to its subject's life, which is strange given the fact that Zemeckis' last film, "Flight" (2012) took that exact approach. Although the film isn't actually a true story, "Flight" has no reservations about its main character and never shies away from telling it like it is. "The Walk", on the other hand, feels sugarcoated and glossy. This is perhaps due to the fact that the film has a PG rating and targets the broadest audience possible, hoping to cash in on the Zemeckis fan boys that fell in love with "Forrest Gump" and "Cast Away" (2000). But, unlike those films, I walked away from Zemeckis' latest not knowing any more about Petit than when I had bought my ticket. This is in part due to the film's impatience with its story. It seemed just as eager as I was to reach its centerpiece scene: the walk itself. The film breezes through Petit's journey up to that point, introducing characters without ever developing them and moving from place to place as quickly as each is mentioned. "The Walk" never actually sits down with Petit and gets into his head. Instead, all we get are statements of grandeur about how ridiculous the stunt will be and how crazy Petit must be to even think of doing such a thing; declarations that surely millions of other people have said both before and after the act. But, to the film's credit, none of this takes away from the main event. Zemeckis' portrayal of Petit's walk between the two towers of the World Trade Center is spectacle incarnate. With seamless special effects and heights imposing enough to warrant vertigo, Zemeckis constructs the scene with a visual acumen not found in any other part of the film. The walk itself is so beautifully done, in fact, that it almost seems out of place. We learn the most about Petit from merely watching his walk, and as much of a compliment as that is for that one scene, it reflects poorly on the rest of the narrative. All things considered, this is a real shame for Gordon-Levitt, who's role in the film is one potentially worthy of an Oscar, but because Zemeckis took the broad approach, Gordon-Levitt wasn't given enough room to really break ground with the character. His performance ends up being one of exhibition, not depth. Perhaps "The Walk" isn't as good as it could've been because it tells a story that has already been told, or maybe it's all on Zemeckis. Had a different director handled the material, maybe it would've had the same gripping attributes as "Man on Wire". Either way, what we're left with is a decent film overall that does justice to the achievement, but not the man behind it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Walk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations before watching The Walk were quite low for three reasons. First: I generally like the films "based on true events" less when I have already seen some documentary about said events; in this case, it was the brilliant documentary Man on Wire. Second: I decided to watch the 3D version of The Walk, something I have done in very few occasions because I dislike the decrease of brightness and definition accompanied by the use of polarized lenses; besides, I have never felt that the 3D has improved a film. And third: The Walk was directed by Robert Zemeckis, who hasn't made any really good film in this century (no, I didn't even like Flight very much). Well, I'm glad to say that my expectations were wrong in every case. To start with, the 3D experience was totally justified to accentuate the vertigo of big heights, and it definitely improved the film... despite the previously mentioned problems of polarized lenses. But that's just an ornament. The most important thing is that the screenplay (based on the book To Reach the Clouds, written by Philippe Petit) doesn't seek the cold realism of a narration of the facts, but it adds quite a personality and imagination to Petit's feat, achieving a kind of "heist movie" full of humor, energy and inspiration. As for Zemeckis, he found a good equilibrium (no pun intended) between his obsession for 100% digital productions and the requirements of a good story shot on the traditional style. Well, not very traditional... for obvious reasons, The Walk is full of special effects, and I suspect that every scene includes some kind of "green screen". Some of these effects are invisible, and other ones, intentionally obvious, and the result is a visual flourish of big proportions; but I think that visual eccentricity suit well to a tale which might have seemed less "real" if it hadn't been told with such a creativity. Zemeckis' direction is fluid and energetic, always finding the camera angle or elegant composition to enhance every scene. On the negative side, I couldn't always swallow the interventions of a redundant narrator who expresses the obvious and describes what we are already watching; but "Petit"'s omnipresent voice adds reflexive and semi-philosophical details which enrich the narrative, and occasionally validate the presence of such an artificial and distractor dramatic instrument. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings another one of his brilliant performances, transmitting Petit's madness and determination without any difficulty, as well as his motivation to face such a crazy mission... but without making him seem a maniac disconnected from reality. Gordon-Levitt genuinely convinces us of the fact that Petit is an artist; that's all we need to know about the character. The supporting cast also makes a good work, highlighting Charlotte Le Bon, who doesn't only look like a younger (and even more adorable) version of Winona Ryder, but is also able to transmit many things just with her look; I have the feeling she's soon going to have her big break in Hollywood, like it happened to Alicia Vikander or Marion Cotillard. As for Petit's "big hit"... it would be unforgivable to reveal too much. Needless to say, they are historical facts, and 15 minutes in Wikipedia would be enough to know every single "spoiler", but I recommend not doing that. Petit's adventure is exciting in every sense, and Zemeckis made the "reality" justice, while adding touching levels of meaning, from a sincere tribute to Twin Towers to an idyllic vision of New York during the '70s. There are a few stumbles (no pun intended) in The Walk, such as the previously mentioned narrator and the fact that the beginning feels a bit diffuse. However, those complaints didn't avoid me from leaving the cinema satisfied, and I recommend The Walk as a very entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Walk Review: "The Walk is bigger than World Trade Center towers".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joseph Gordon- Levitt has become the bravest man in the world with this great character.In "The Walk" the most impressive is the story.I can not say the whole movie is perfect but the last thirty minutes are amazing . One of the most important aspects of the film is the excellent quality of 3D considering every detail to make us shudder in the seat.Another of the more salient factors it is the innovative way of narrating the movies style "Juno"(Jason Reitman) and "Shutter Island"(Martin Scorsese) giving credence to the story, his autobiography narrated by himself.It is intuitively careful, this movie have a precise makeup, a beautiful montage, the soundtrack is elastic and the classics are perfectly implemented every epic moment created.Its screenplay is usually good but with phrases or words straight out of Shakepare, It's totally deep, and Philippe Petit's every poetic word for his dream, all viewers recreate an image that everything is possible."The Walk"is wonderfully supported by TriStar Productions - ImageMovers - Sony Pictures Entertainment and distributed by TriStar Pictures and Sony Pictures, an endorsement that any movie want to have, raising its status each time more and more.Certainly one of the most exciting and memorable moments of this movie is when Petit is in World Trade Center and overcomes every obstacle in a very original way, because nobody prevents his dream (nor cops, nor communication, nor lack of accomplices, nor treachery, nor the weather, nor the spectators, nor strings, nor locker room, nobody and nothing)One of the most interesting points of the movie is the constant change of languages (French and English) giving a personal touch and unique, that make it stand out within this genre. Besides, It is obvious the incorporation of the French, Petit made his first act there and he was born in Nemours - Francia, It is logical.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ben Kingsley, Charlotte Le Bon show us and give us that each day more level increases of professional actors. These characters show us the values &#x200b;&#x200b;of friendship ,love ,loyalty, fraternity, strength and above all constancy and permanence to fulfill what they usually name "impossible".The first part of the film becomes a bit boring and monotonous for lack of emotion and speed but then when French Philippe Petit arrives in New York (World Trade Center) The story turns on engines and it carry us to a universe where there is only the rope, Petit, the World Trade Center and us; It achieving to lift the entire weight of the movie in just thirty minutes. In this period the film comes alive getting to convey emotion, adrenaline, vertigo and the most important the feeling and soul.However, there is an invisible discomfort in the movie that does not leave fully advance, interrupting its way to being a great movie, the great obstacle is named "development and execution", that is the main mess of the movie.Petit's the magnificent dance in the cable is synonymous of perfection and when he advances the vertigo in our heads increases causing a series of reactions ending in one act "praise this work".And it is true, ten men have walked on the moon, but only one man had the courage of walk the infinite void between World Trade Center for a thin wire (at a height of 417 meters) and without any protection, it's totally creepy."The Walk is a shocking work, that will make to twist in the seat, and you'll feel that your head explodes (especially in IMAX 3D). This film is chillingly impressive.""The Walk" brought us back to the time where originality existed. The formula "Inovation"works and will work for the rest of time. Through an incredible true story, Robert Zemeckis provides us a film of great proportions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of The Walk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his unique way of slipping into roles like some confident chameleon, you might as well belly up and call Joseph Gordon-Levitt a full-blown movie star. He can headline anything that an a-lister takes on. Whether he's imitating Bruce Willis (Looper), playing a likable muscle head (Don Jon), or just slinging high stakes at poker (Sin City: A Dame to Kill For), this once adorable child actor is now the real deal. Bring on Snowden even if it is in delayed release.Anyway, if you are afraid of heights, it might be difficult to watch certain portions or especially the last bit of his 2015 release, The Walk (my latest review). This film is based on the true story of Philippe Petit, a high-wire artist who caught the world's attention sauntering across the Twin Towers (of the World Trade Center). Directed by special effects maestro Robert Zemeckis, "Walk" has Petit (played with heavy discipline and a broad French accent by Gordon-Levitt) traveling 140 feet on a thick, heavy cable. It's a moment that you need to see to believe.Zemeckis nurturing the concept of 3D on his mind, shoots The Walk as if he's revisiting his own Forrest Gump (1994's Best Picture winner). Tom Hanks sat on a bench and narrated most of that epic in flashback. Here, Gordon-Levitt does the same thing but from high atop the Statue of Liberty. The difference between the two films is simple: "Gump" is more Homeric with storytelling that's not negligible. "Walk" isn't plot less yet not enough seems at stake. The trailer looked mighty compelling. The end result is breezy and almost comical in nature.Having its climatic gesture taking place in August of 1974 and its running time clocking in at just over two hours, The Walk chronicles Philippe's drive and passion, his relentless persona of being difficult to the people who work for him. You see he wants to be the greatest wirewalker known to man and while living in France, he injures his tooth (street performing). In the waiting room at the dentist office, he sees a picture of the World Trade Center's Twin Towers (mentioned earlier). Petit becomes obsessed. During "Walk's" next hour or so, he trains heavily with each wire becoming longer and longer in length and higher and higher off the ground. Eventually, he finds his way to New York City traveling with his cutesy girlfriend (Anne played by Charlotte Le Bon). They befriend a photographer, a life insurance salesman, a stoner, and various other accomplices. All these half-strangers help Philippe succeed in pulling off the ultimate, illegal stunt (I think you can figure out where things are headed). This gives The Walk a sort of caper feel. 2001 had Ocean's Eleven. Here we have Petit's seven.All in all, the three-dimensional space in "Walk" is sumptuous and avant garde. The look of it is salt and peppery, the sense of time and place is physically real, and the performances by all the actors are thoroughly impactful (especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Edited quickly yet overwhelmed by large amounts of buildup (is said French dude finally gonna be "Mr. Man On Wire" and cross over?), this thing still keeps you interested. Even the film score is Forrest Gumpian. My rating: 3 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Half is Just Good. The Second Half is Incredible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: Robert ZemeckisWriters: Robert Zemeckis and Christopher BrowneStarring: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ben Kingsley, Charlotte Le Bon, and James Badge DaleRelease Date: September 30, 2015MPAA Rating: PG for thematic elements involving perilous situations, and for some nudity, language, brief drug references and smokingRuntime: 2 hours 3 minutesStudio: TriStar PicturesI was really excited to see this film. One of the reasons why is because I think that Robert Zemeckis is a great director, specifically with the Back to the Future trilogy and Forrest Gump, mainly because they are the only films I've seen from him (I heard the rest of his films are pretty good (such as Flight). I also really like the cast, specifically Joseph Gordon- Levitt, who's one of my favorite actors, honestly. Now, I have seen the film now, and I will say that it is not one of Zemeckis's best, but The Walk is still a satisfying and great film.The plot of The Walk takes place in 1974. A man named Philippe Phetit, who is very fascinated with wire-walking, finds out about the twin towers (the two tallest towers of all time). So he decides to recruit many people, such as his friend, Annie Allix, to make a tightrope, so that he can walk the two towers.The first half of The Walk, I will admit is not great. I still liked it and was always interested, due to it's lead character's passion, but just like Chris Stuckmann (an internet movie reviewer) said, the film really gets great once the second half begins. You really feel the main character's passion in the second half,because of all he does to try to make it up to those two towers to walk them. I won't spoil it, but I will just say that he does some things that go against the law. I also really like the humor of this film, as it is timed well, so it never feels forced, nor does it ever overcrowd the dramatic tone of the film.Like I said before, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of my favorite actors, as in his other films, he can pull of charisma in his comedic roles, and he can do great with his action movie and drama roles. With this film, he carries a French accent, as he plays a French man. I'll be honest, I did take me a tad bit to get used to the accent, but after that "tad bit" I got used to it, and I can definitely call it a great lead performance, as he definitely the passion that his character has. I also like the supporting performances as well, such a Ben Kingsley as Papa Rudy, who is much like a mentor (sometimes father figure) to Petit, and Charlotte Le Bon, as Anne Allix, a close friend of his.Director Robert Zemeckis does a great job with this film, as the tightrope walking scenes are filled with lost of suspense, thanks to Zemeckis's direction. Visually, this film looks amazing. All of the places of the film, such as France and New York, are filled with lots of detail, and they look like they come from real life and the cinematography is just breathtaking. Also, I recommend that you see the movie in IMAX 3D, because the 3D is incredible (possibly the best 3D I've seen all year).Overall, The Walk may not be one of Robert Zemeckis's best, but it's still gets a recommendation from me. Although the first half might turn some viewers off, I still was engaged in ti, and the second half is just incredible. The film also carries great lead performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, incredible visuals, and fantastic direction from Robert Zemeckis.FINAL VERDICT: B+ (GREAT)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>things to highly recommend, and something that nearly sinks an inherently cinematic story of death-defying 'art'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk is a movie that is at odds with itself. I don't mean in any conscious way, at least that the director/co-writer Robert Zemeckis would fess up to. It's a film that features spectacular direction, the kind that makes me like going to Zemeckis movies - hell, even in 3D, which is a rarity for me (maybe once a year I go, and this was the one), but for this director he makes it worthwhile - and has a lead character who is charismatic as well as arrogant and presumptuous, but with Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a very human stubborn 'artiste' which makes it watchable and fun. But the writing is where it falters. Oh, my dear readers, it so so falters.I'll break this up into the good/really good, and the not-good. This is an inherently captivating story, and fitting for a cinematic treatment - keep in mind this is the medium that has its roots in figures who did feats of daring-do (think Harold Lloyd in Safety Last, or any given Buster Keaton flick) - as it revels in spectacle. This is about a man who loves to walk on a wire, and to take it into an artistic plane; it's not simply about defying physical odds (though I'm sure that's there, it has to be for a stuntman, which is what he is technically speaking), but about performance. He is basically an outcast clown, as he has the opportunity in this story to join a circus with a solid trainer (Ben Kingsley is the French/Czech mentor) and instead chooses his own path, and somehow the World Trade buildings catch his attention: so high off the ground, at a place where one can cross if they so do try.It's through this mission, this 'coup' (it sounds like that anyway how Philippe says it) that this Frenchman with this rugged determination decides to put a wire up between the twin towers just before the buildings are completely finished and open to the public. It's at heart a heist film, but the twist is that it's a crime all for the 'art' of the dare of performing. It still has that format though, and it's great fun seeing how Philippe and his friends come to New York with him to find "accomplices" - his word, not mine. And when it comes time to pull off this 'heist' of space and time, which is the only way I can describe it, it's nothing less than thrilling cinema.This story and this character, sometimes assholish, sometimes utterly whimsical and very, very French, is hard to resist if one is looking for a spectacle that prizes the simple but inherently thrilling sight of a man walking on a wire. It's also about in an absorbing, creative way the process to how Philippe learns how to trust the wire he walks on, learn when it works or doesn't, and how to concentrate like some kind of Zen master. It's nothing short of fascinating and leads up to a performance from Levitt as this man that's as funny as it is awe-inspiring (watch as he keeps walking, and walking, and going back again when he could stop, perhaps just to see if he can really do it). And the supporting cast is game, and Alan Silvestri's score does a good (if not all great) job of adding heft and dimension to the scenes that need them, including some Beethoven's 5th in the climactic walk itself. So much is excellent with the film that... it's a shame that there's a fatal flaw, so fatal that it almost makes me hesitant to recommend the film at all: narration. Useless goddamn narration.I can't tell you how much it takes me out of a scene to see this character, in the framing device of talking to the audience as he stands at the top of the Statue of Liberty and talks to the audience... and talks and talks and talks, telegraphing so many of his emotions and thoughts in the moment and/or after the fact, even when (especially when) Zemeckis is already showing these actions or close to it on screen. It's so strange to see Zemeckis fail at this so miserably when he used narration in a creative way in Forrest Gump; I wondered watching The Walk why it worked there and it doesn't here, and I think it's about what it tells about the character as well as the story - Forrest is giving us this long, sprawling, life-long journey and it's a unique, even satirical perspective. Philippe is not like that - many of his thoughts and such are at best unnecessary and at worse make him a bore of an 'artist', to a pretentious degree. We should be able to see, and often DO anyway, on the face of Levitt what he's thinking or feeling as he does this or that, and can see well enough what other characters are doing like Kingsley's guy. Narration is difficult to do in any movie, but here it's so terrible as to make one pine for the theatrical cut of Blade Runner.Again, the basic story of what this man did in 1974, what lead up to it and the little details leading up to the "steal", makes for a core plot that is fantastic and carries that true-but-escapist flair we like to go to big movies like this for. On the one hand the movie has a different take on how to achieve fame than we get to see in, say, the average sports movie, and yet it's also not a movie that uses heights to address peril in the way we usually see, and it's refreshing. On the other hand, when you have your main character telling you things that not only don't need to be said but are already SHOWN, it mucks with the cinematic form. It's A-grade filmmaking with a C minus grade script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1974, high-wire artist Philippe Petit recruits a team of people to help him realize his dream: to walk the immense void between the World Trade Center towers.The Walk is directed by Robert Zemeckis, a true legend in the film industry, with films like Cast Away, Forest Gump and Back to the future under his name. This serves as his 17th feature film.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the lead protagonist "Philippe Petit" a supremely talented man with an incredible dream to place his high-wire between the twin towers and walk across it, although Levitt's French accent may take a bit of getting use to, his performance as a whole is solid and he is a likable enough character to hold audience attention throughout. Zemeckis unleashes his true brilliance as a director in the spectacular walk between the towers scene. His camera moments and character perspective make you feel the scale of " Petit's" awe inspiring journey, this sequence induces suspense, beauty and laughter through genius visual storytelling and breathtaking cinematography.However, the first half of this film is quite lackluster to say the least, supporting characters are severely underwritten and ultimately forgettable, "Petit's" story is an intriguing one, but because of the films comedic tendencies we never see him as a proper fleshed out character. Petit's romance is also never fully realized or developed. Overall The Walk is worth seeing for the awe, inspiring scale of its climatic sequence. I am going to give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joe and Zemeckis nail it to perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a lovely movie!Being one of the biggest fans of RegularJoe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), I always walk in to watch his movies with high expectations and boy, he never fails to deliver. Knowing him through hitRecord has been fun. He seems to get his audience and always strikes the right nerve. So he does with 'The Walk'.Robert Zemeckis can't certainly be overlooked. His top-notch direction changes pace at crucial moments, and oscillates from grim to casual superbly. He knows which parts are important for the audience to connect. He nails each one of them with perfection. Also what was quite interesting to watch were literal similes that depicted things that crawled inside our protagonist's head. The music in the backdrop plays endearingly as our protagonist clumsily attempts to gather his accomplices. The screenplay of the flick is exceptional, at times poetic, which makes it sound music to the ears. There are brilliant lines that would tinkle your brains instantly.The theme of the movie is quite light, amiable and funny, and narrated by Joe working gorgeously under the skin of Philippe Petit. The entire movie finds the narrator at every juncture, not to mention his part has been brilliantly edited. The act was downright insane per se. So the crazy theme of the movie gets justified. There is no doubt Petit's dream was Herculean. To punch in a thought so crazy in your head was indeed commendable, dangerous, and at the same time beautiful. But what was even more beautiful to watch was the setup. What our protagonist went through in order to nail the final masterpiece. The horrendous things he had to go through to reach it have been depicted subtly. Another thing worth noticing was how Petit has a love-perspective for the two marvelous towers. It is sad how some people don't carry his vision.Looking at the downside to the tale, the theme of the movie clouds the actual terror beneath the act. The craziness depicted through fun light vibes hide the horrific truth of fear and death. The humour of the movie overshadows the formidable threat that it posed to Petit.But if you wish to have a peek inside the head of Petit, this movie is one absolutely stunning tribute to a guy with a crazy dream. A definite watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Walk is a dramatization of Philippe Petit achieving his dream to cross on a high wire between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Though there is already a documentary made which won an Academy Award, it makes sense if a movie recreates his daring act by letting the audience join in to the sky, and also since there were no actual footage and only photographs were recorded during his performance; and of course, no filmmaker could envision a moment as magnificent as this than Robert Zemeckis. Though, the storyline doesn't offer much subtlety or given these people some deeper characterization, the film still manages to be ultimately entertaining, until the last act that will blow you away, resulting sweat on your palms. The Walk may not be mind-blowing in retelling the story, but it's all about the experience.I believe it's clear that the movie is not digging into Petit as the whole person himself. The film is all about his optimism towards this dream that is meant to be insane for others; we are supposed to be more keen at understanding how walking in this high wire means a lot to him, even when some of his accomplices don't. It still explores his life story, but only when it involves his love to high wire performance; how he found out about it, how he trained, how he never gave up, how he became a professional, until he pushes himself to newer heights. People might suggest for a more subtle narrative. Most of the film has a narration from its main character and it doesn't always help. Some details are surely needed to be told, but it gets out of hand that there is nothing left to think.Unless of course, the walk on the wire would be amazingly, and obviously, it is. This is one of those movies where 3D makes sense, and even better would be seen in IMAX 3D. The film really takes you to the wire, keeping you apart from the safety zone; as it captures the height, the feet of the performer, how he balances himself and passes through some parts where you could doubt that would endure the stability of the wire. And as the characters describe it, it truly is a beautiful thing to witness. This is movie magic that could capture such moment, even though it gets too whimsical, but it's still amazing.The acting is magnificent as well. Joseph Gordon-Levitt made this role delightful as possible, making this man's supposed crazy pursuit seems like a whimsical adventure. Although the film isn't exploring much through this character other than his passion, Gordon-Levitt manages to gloss over those problems and made the role more engaging. The supporting cast is also pretty good; and notably, Ben Kingsley, even for a role that is smaller than the others, he gave it one of the most memorable connection with the lead actor.The Walk would have been an underwhelming biopic: one might point out that the supporting characters could be one noted and most of their moments with the main character often drives with melodrama or something and some potential themes aren't able to flourish and somehow forgotten, but by the craft and energy of its director, actors and the other filmmakers; they made these moments bearable and extremely entertaining. But of course, the movie is more upbeat, more comedic and definitely thrilling. The titular walk alone is definitely worth the price admission, it was a remarkable time that people back then were lucky to witness it, and this movie does an excellent job capturing that magic and more. It may not go beyond the man's ambition, but it's still all worth the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Walk is a film directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back To The Future trilogy, Forrest Gump) based on the true story of Philippe Petit, a French high-wire artist whom in 1974, walked a tightrope between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Having recently seen the documentary film "Man On Wire" about the real man, I was intrigued about a feature film adaptation of his story and for the most part, it succeeds in just about every way. It features one of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's best film performances to date. Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a street performer living in Paris who dreams of making it big as an entertainer, in particular, as a circus tightrope walker. His father disapproves of his son's seemingly impossible ambitions and as a result, is kicked out of his home. One day while visiting a dentist, he reads a magazine article about the Twin Towers being built in New York City. Deciding that this is where he wants to perform his next high-wire trick, Philippe assembles a group of people whom he calls his "accomplices" to help him to pull off this dangerous artistic act which he refers to as "le coup".The film has some of the best use of CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) I have ever seen in a film. You could almost swear that the film was shot on location and that the Twin Towers were never destroyed on 9/11. The 3D was utilized quite well too. It really feels like you are up there alongside Philippe as he walks the massive void between the Twin Towers. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was great as Philippe Petit and his French accent was surprisingly convincing as well. However, I should also mention that if you suffer from vertigo (a fear of heights), then I don't recommend you see this movie, as the feeling of being suspended that high up in the air feels very realistic at times.I rate it 8/10. I also recommend watching the documentary Man on Wire as a companion piece to this film, as it offers more detailed insight into Philippe Petit's real life persona.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Walk - A Review by Nathan Fischer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk is the new biopic by Robert Zemeckis. It tells the true story of Philippe Petit, a man whose life dream is to hang a wire in between the World Trade Center and walk across it. The concept sounds simple enough. But like any story, it's the journey to get there that really counts.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Philippe Petit. We open with him standing on the Statue of Liberty with the Twin Towers in the background. This is where he narrates his story to us, talking directly to the camera. I've always liked Gordon-Levitt, and in this role, he really turns on the charm for the audience. His French accent is quite convincing as well.Philippe tells us his life story from when he was a boy and saw his first high wire act, to when he meets his mentor Papa Rudy (played by Ben Kingsley). The story moves as a brisk pace for the first half of the film, jumping from flashback to flashback while Philippe tells his story. It's classic Zemeckis story telling in the light of Forrest Gump. Eventually Philippe meets his love, Annie (Charlette Le Bon) and she becomes his first of many accomplices. After we are caught up with Philippe's back story, the movie slows down a bit for the actual planning process. He forms a team and the plans to walk between the two towers. This is not an easy thing to do and takes great timing/planning, to which many things go wrong. I liked watching the planning process of the film, even if it did drag out just a bit. What interested me the most was the team he formed and what they were feeling. I mean, in theory, walking across the Twin Towers on a wire with no safety cable sounds amazing and exciting. But as the plan forms and the date gets closer, the team starts to wonder what exactly are they doing here? It is crazy. Is it all worth the effort or punishment if they get caught, just to realize someone else's dream? I wanted to root for Philippe and I did, but at the same time I was thinking, "This is rather selfish of him to risk so much for such a bizarre idea." But that is an underlining theme throughout the film, selfishness and appreciation.The final act is breath taking. It is impossible to not get vertigo. I was squirming in my seat before he even steps on the wire. It's just so high up. I did not see this in IMAX or 3D. I imagine that if I had, my stomach would have been turning twice as much. But the sequence is beautiful and totally worth the journey it takes you on. Philippe Petit had a dream, and nothing stopped him from accomplishing it, even if it was totally insane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ocean's 110. For 110 stories. And its a heist movie. It's a joke The Walk comes to us from the great Robert Zemeckis, who incorrectly predicted what the world would look like in 2015. This is a true story following Philippe Petit, who walked on a high wire between the two towers in the 70&#x2032;s. So is this another Zemeckis classic? Kind of, yeah.So I'll start by saying that the first 45 minutes or so of this movie aren't very good. I understand that it was there to help establish Petit's character, but I didn't find it interesting, and they could have cut some fluff out of that section. That being said, this movie kicks up the entertainment value once JGL and company arrive in New York. The pace speeds up quite a bit, and we have a full blow heist movie. The spying/heist portion of the film was flat out awesome. Pure fun, and it just leaves a smile on your face as you watch it. The chemistry of the crew, and the charisma of JGL are perfect and I wish they would have trimmed the beginning to add more time to this section.Then, there is the walk. Everyone's already talking about the stunning visuals and the overall captivating nature of this moment, but there is also so much humor and tension in these moments as well. Even though there is a ton going on around him, you feel as though you're just watching JGL alone on the wire, and his narration give insight into the mind of a lunatic like Petit. A truly aspiring event that deserved to be told to a new generation.Verdict:The Walk is really fun movie with captivating visuals that will fuel your imagination. The performances are well done, and other than the slow start, this movie doesn't have give too much to complain about.? JGL's French accent was actually pretty good@! Especially when speaking the language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad First Act; Immersive Second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half is pretty terrible, owing to a thin, dull and cornball screenplay (by director Robert Zemeckis and Christopher Browne) that makes virtually no attempt at character development and the awkward performances (with Joseph Gordon-Levitt as tightrope walker Philippe Petit and Ben Kingsley as his mentor adopting unconvincing European accents). In fact, the first half seems primed to rush the audience to the second, which features the Main Event: the preparation and execution of Petit's 1974 high wire walk between the World Trade Center towers. But if the first half is disappointing, the second more than makes up for it, primarily in the film's raison d'etre, the actual walk, which immerses the viewer in the disorienting, heart-pounding experience in all its glory. It's here that Zemeckis reasserts himself as one of Hollywood's premier showman whose ability to deliver oversized entertainments has few peers. And it's also here, particularly in the moving conclusion, that Zemeckis' artistry emerges as he makes Petit's story personal by introducing the great overarching theme, time and its relation to the individual, that has informed his greatest and most resonant films, "Cast Away" and "The Polar Express".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Walk (2015)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: Robert Zemeckis Cast: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ben Kingsley and Charlotte Le Bon Ratings: 3.7/5The Walk is a story of a wire walker whose dream is to hang a wire between the Twin Towers of World Trade Centre and walk on it. The Director Robert Zemeckis once again makes a piece of wire a lively thing that builds up an emotional connection with the audience in the movie. In his past movies like Tom Hanks starring Cast Away where Zemeckis showed the relationship between Hanks and a volleyball (Wilson) was surprisingly powerful and he is one of the best directors who puts the visuals of the story so strongly that it immediately creates a picture in the viewer's mind. Zemeckis is a master of visuals, graphics and motions all his movies have a fine combination of all these elements be it Who Framed Roger Rabbit or Back to the Future Trilogy which was again a game changer for the whole film industry.With each passing film Zemeckis raises the bar and The Walk is another epitome of his great works. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Philippe Petit in the movie plays a role of an ambitious wire walker who develops a passion for high wire walking since he was eight when circus comes to his town and featured one of the greatest wire- walking troupes in the world. The movie has lot of motional scenes which can even make you jump on your seats. The way Levitt walks on the wire to become a professional and the way he protects his sacred circle inside which he performs is awe-inspiring. The movie also tells the importance of the audience for an artist and how artists are nothing without their audience.Zemeckis has used some of the best visual effects and high concept with simple visual story-telling. Levitt looks like a real wire- walker and everything in the movie looks so realistic with seamless visual effects and fully realised characters. It seems like Zemeckis puts you on the top of the Twin Towers and makes you realise as if you're actually going to witness the Philippe's high wire-walking across the towers. Charlotte Le Bon as Annie plays a role of an artist who learns guitar in an art school and also performs on the streets like Philippe. The bond between the two artists has been showed beautifully in the movie. The way they both meet and fall for each other and how Annie leaves behind everything for fulfilling Philippe's dream to go to New York. The movie is incomplete without mentioning the work of Ben Kingsley as Papa Rudy a supreme wire-walker and an acrobat who trains Philippe by teaching him various skills and techniques of rigging a high wire. Papa Rudy is a fun character in the movie that lightens the mood of the audience at times. He becomes the true inspiration for Philippe when he says that you cannot lie to your audience as they know what is inside your heart. He is the most important accomplice of Philippe in the movie as without his techniques Philippe would not be able to live his dream.Clement Sibony as Jean-Louis and Cesar Domboy as Jeff also act well in the movie. They are the sole accomplice of Philippe who actually help him to action his dream on an imagery path between the two towers. The movie is absolutely phenomenal which would actually take you to the magnificent Twin Towers of New York and leave you stunned. If you are a hard core fan of graphics and effects then you must watch this movie plus Zemeckis added flavours would never disappoint you any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zemeckis is one of my favorite directors, if not my favorite, since "who framed Roger Rabbit" (that I was lucky enough to see in theater when it went out), therefore this review could be a little biased.I didn't know what to expect from The Walk. I didn't know Philip's story, I didn't watch the "Man on the wire" documentary (which, of course, contains a lot of spoilers). I couldn't imagine how a story about a walk on a highwire could have been told.All the doubts cleared after the first few minutes of the movie. The direction it was taking was clear and I loved every minute of it, right from the start.The walk itself was painful, totally distressing. I felt so tired that I couldn't even watch the whole sequence.Only movie to see in 3D this year. I prefer this to The Martian, which had the only problem to come after Cast Away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man On Wire - again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you knew nothing at all about this film, the low-key title would hardly attract you to it. But this is not a walk along the Appalachian Trail ("A Walk In The Woods") or even the Pacific Crest Trail ("Wild"), but something else entirely. On the morning of 7 August 1974, Frenchman Philippe Petit did the seemingly impossible: after six years of planning, for 45 minutes, he walked a tight rope slung between the two towers of the still-uncompleted World Trade Center, spanning the 140-foot (43 metres) gap at a height of 1,368 ft (417 metres). If we didn't know it had actually happened, it would be literally incredible.If you've seen the excellent 2008 documentary "Man On Wire" by James Marsh (as I have), you'll be thoroughly familiar with the thrilling operation and with the colourful character of Petit himself. What this movie does, however, is what the documentary could never do: provide a feel for what the walk itself felt like. This is done through some clever CGI and scary 3D that alone make this new account worth viewing.In an odd piece of casting, Petit is played by American actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt who does his best to sport a French accent. Also odd is the narrative framing device which has Petit talking to us from the torch on the Statute of Liberty. These oddities aside, this is a fine movie but, of course since 9/11, nobody can see a representation of the Twin Towers without being chilled by the memory of that awful morning and the last line of the movie makes an oblique reference to that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joseph Gordon-Levitt has gone from being a fine actor (Mysterious Skin, The Lookout, 500 Days of Summer) to an irritating distraction (Don Jon and this film.) His cutie-pie smirk and horrible French/English accent made me want to give up on The Walk 30 minutes in. Ben Kingsley was miscast. It seems Robert Zemeckis still can't direct a film that doesn't have visual effects and a script written to entertain the popcorn munching masses.The only things that kept me going were the excellent cinematography and eye-popping visual effects - I'll give the movie that. The Walk was nothing more than eye candy. I suggest watching Man on Wire if you want to truly experience Mr. Petite's amazing feat. The Walk was a major disappointment to me. On a scale of one to 10, it gets a five - and that's being generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When film makers run out of idea, history is their fall guy - when imagination fails, there's always an interesting glimpse of a past time that will leap on to our screen and transport us to a different place. Helmed by a man who has dealt with his own share of time travelling features, Robert Zemeckis takes us on a journey back to 1974 and into the mind of Philippe Petit prior to his timeless illegal high-rope walk atop the twin towers.From the cobbled streets of Paris to the concrete jungle of New York, this film has a more light-hearted approach to proceedings with an often melodramatic, Broadway feel to it. Don't worry, there's no musical version of 'Walk the Line' but the cutaway narration that sets the scene from the Statue of Liberty feels very theatrical when hand in hand with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's odd french accent.That being said it does feel as though the film blindly avoids the confrontation that must have occurred prior to the iconic final moments to protect the feel-good factor of the film as it leans more towards to the surreal shots of the thoughts that cloud Petit's mind. With someone as ambitious as our lead, it's undoubtable that there would have been more friction than what is displayed on screen and it would have fleshed out the mostly forgettable accomplices who fade into the set pieces.Although the first act stumbles in areas, it hits its stride in the second half to successfully balance both style and substance recreating the moment of grandeur. With a subtle blend of old and new, it re- tells the story of Petit to nail-biting effect pairing C.G.I and practical effects seamlessly. Not only does this film entertain, it gives us more insight in to both the means and the methods behind wire-treading with a surprising focus on the science behind the walk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High on Visuals Low on Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walk is the latest and most visually gratifying film based on work of Philip Petit - the French high wire artist. As a slightly acrophobic person I must reveal that even the 2D version had many visuals which agitated butterflies in my stomach. The portrayal of Petit by Gordon Levitt is splendid especially given the fact that Levitt had to learn French and wire-walking for his role. The imagery is stunning. The use green screen (chroma key composting) has been done marvelously. But apart from the remarkable optical gratification, I found the film running short on substance. Almost three-fourth of the 2 hour film is only about the twin-tower act. Yes, the movie is named after the act-'The Walk'- but I would certainly have loved to see more about the life of Petit- his childhood, his romance, the making of the artist, the famed European circus circuit etc. Insertion of Kingsley's character as a mentor is perfunctory and very 'Americanesque'- my personal euphemism for sanitized, glib and insubstantial treatment of a subject. This was not a Marvel's superhero but a real life story. I would have loved the treatment of Petit's story to be like that of Spielberg's 'Bridge of Spies'- a tightly knit story touching all dimensions of a character. As a young man I would also have loved to see more of beautiful Charlotte le Bon's character. Some details and images of the original walk of 1974 wouldn't have been out of place before the end credits- they were missing. At the end of 2 hours, 'The Walk' goes down in RAM and vanishes as the power is turned off. It doesn't touch the ROM or gets embedded in BIOS. Only some cookies - all visual- are left behind for the posterity. Yes, you know what I mean...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wire on which Philippe Petit crossed between the two buildings of the World Trade Center on the morning of August 7, 1974, was held up by the towers themselves, stabilised with guy lines lashed to carefully chosen points around their edges, and secured around wooden bulwarks on either side. But as you watch The Walk, you're struck by a strange feeling that the wire is somehow holding up the towers too.Robert Zemeckis's glimmering dream of a film takes two buildings that have become emblematic of everything that's frightening and uncertain about 21st century life in the West and redeems them. It turns Petit's stunt, which was one hundred percent illegal, and completed without a harness, into a kind of pre-emptive retort to the attacks of September 11, 2001 ? a reminder that beauty, fun and the irresistible human impulse to create are the stuff that dissolves terror on contact.As you watch Petit and his team of co-conspirators planning his self-styled "artistic coup", sneaking around the unfinished towers and surveilling them from every angle, the thought that constantly runs through your head is Well, they couldn't get away with this now ? and the destruction of the World Trade Center itself, of course, is exactly why they couldn't.But there's a bass note of intense physical precision to his performance. Even the most casual gesture feels scrupulously controlled, as befits a man who plans to walk along a steel cable 1,630 ft above the pavement without a safety net.The film is full of Petit's voice ? the screenplay was adapted by Zemeckis and Christopher Browne from his memoir, To Reach the Clouds ? and Gordon-Levitt delivers his lines in an, 'ow you say, vair prononced Franch acksong. It's over-the-top ? sometimes wildly and hilariously so ? and entirely of a piece with the film's antic showmanship.Paris 1973 is where Petit begins to plan his coup ? he sees an illustration of the as-yet unbuilt towers in a magazine in a dentist's waiting room, and decides on the spot what he has to do. Around this time he meets a love interest, Annie (Charlotte Le Bon), begins his training with "Papa" Rudy Omankowsky (Ben Kingsley), a tightrope- walker of indeterminate Eastern European extraction, and starts to amass his co-conspirators. Essentially, this is just preamble to the film's crowning set piece ? but it enjoyably sets out why it matters, and is carried off with the panache of a comic heist movie. (Alan Silvestri's superb score, which switches between pensive strings and antic jazz, brilliantly enhances both of the dominant moods.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best part of walk that it has an amazing director, a charismatic leading guy and a beautiful lady as his love interest. And not so amazing part, all three of them are not utilized to the best what they have.Well having said that, The Walk plays like an interesting fairy tale. We initially think that its lead character as he is narrator too lives till the end. But I guess Robert Zemeckis is best at twisting and playing with our feelings in the pay offs. Like he did in Flight (2012) and Contact (1997), this movie also comes to a point where we say this is it, and then he starts to unravel few more tricks up his sleeves.Joseph Gordon Levitt plays Philippe Petit, a famous real life tightrope artist who walked between the 140 feet on the roof of 100 Floor Twin Towers, the old World Trade Center. What a relief it was to see a movie with pleasant memory attached to those iconic towers. I guess the public in general and the movie makers are past 9/11 event and are able to see that it can be put aside for a while to tell a different story that are associated to those building. Philippe hustles his way through police and authorities to perform and earn money via street juggling and tricks in 70s in somewhat a Poetic Paris. Why I used a word poetic, because few shots matches with the black and white drawings of streets of Paris we use to see in children storybooks and poems books. Robert Zemeckis has a penchant for presenting how a place should look like and escaping a realistic view of what it actually looked like back then. While performing on the streets of Paris and searching for two places to hang his wire Philippe met Annie (played by Charlotte Le Bon), they fell in love and she joined the gang of accomplices who will helped him WALK.Ben Kingsely (as Papa Rudy), as always, a reliable supporting character player, becomes the teacher of Philippe. He is bit arrogant himself and dislikes it completely in Philippe as he understands the risk of not being humble while taking last 3 steps of the Tightrope Crossover. Along with Ben Kingsley the movie fills some colorful but not so memorable performances of other cast members that became his accomplices later during the movie. But eventually it is Joseph Gordon and Robert's Show all the way. For Philippe, he feels more alive while walking on the high rope. That point is narrated effectively throughout the movie and expressed visually in the magnificent last 30 minutes. There is no doubt the Robert Zemeckis is an effective story teller but he loses ground couple of times here. And he uses an unusual and light- hearted way to tell this account. Although I am sure that mental stress and discomfort among Philippe and the team members might have been much worse than shown in the movie. The movie doesn't bother and never slows down to thicken those bonds between the characters. The dazzling last sequence changes perspective a bit about the earlier part of the movie. I still think there could be more to Philippe's Character and his relationship with his master and his lover that could have made movie a little more worthy than just to sit all the way to enjoy last 30 minutes. In that last sequence Robert Zemeckis knew how to juggle with our senses. It is the first time I recommended someone to see a movie in 3D. Believe me it is worth your money to spend on large IMAX Screen.I needed to know more how much Philippe sweat to get to what he did. But I think Robert was in mode to make it look like tale of a legend, not a documentary which already came out for same account back in 2008. That also explains the complaint some might have with poorly shot CGI scene at Statue of Liberty where Joseph Gordon Levitt is hanging around and using lot of French Accent to speak English. For last 30 minutes it is still worth every penny to see it in large format wearing your 3D glasses. For me it was also the sparkling smile of Charlotte Le Bon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Man on a Wire Instead. This is a Ridiculously Bad Movie! Even the Last 30 Minutes is Nothing of Note!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a strange movie. The movie is narrated over by Joseph Gorden-Levitt as Philippe Petit, which is especially weird since a Documentary Man on A Wire was already exists that does this. Why not just do a dramatization of events rather than a documentary narrative style recreated? Which does not play out well. For one, Philippe Petit (the wire walker)is a very dramatic and expressive when telling the story, which is great for a documentary style when he's telling the story, but when you have an American actor doing an over dramatic French accent narrative to copy the real life guy, it comes across as a bad actor doing an over the top French accent (there's really no way you get it right as an actor). The dialogue style is one of the worst that I've ever seen, especially since it's based on real life events. It's the kind of movie if you were involved in it in anyway you ask to be permanently removed from the credits. One of the silliest moments is the cop scene on the roof.... I can't even put it into words. The dialogue and the acting style is very cartoonish and/or like something you would see on the Three Stooges. This style is prevalent throughout. I really have no idea what the director was going for. It's embarrassing! I'm embarrassed for any movie critic who gave this a positive review (they have no business being a movie critic). I understand that some will agree that it's a dreadful movie, but the visuals in the last 30 minutes make it worth it.... not really. The special effects/visuals are nothing to be admired and even if they were, it shouldn't have the power to carry such a ridiculously bad movie. Spoilers Of course they change things to make it more movie friendly which is fine, but how it actually ended is a bit different. Essentially this Philippe Petit dude instantly got a really big head upon completing the wire walk. He gets released from jail while two of his friends get extradited back to France (banned from the US forever) and Philippe gets cleared (which is fine). I believe it's the same day or the day after when he gets released, he's doing press conferences when some chick wants to give him a warm celebration so he goes off and does that while leaving his girlfriend and friends hanging and it doesn't stop there, he essentially permanently leaves all of his friends and people associated with the wire walk hanging. So all of his friends who made it possible for him to achieve this dream and who were there with him from the beginning, he dropped all of them like a bad habit the second he was done with his wire walk. He never spoke to his girlfriend or any of the many people involved with it ever again... not even a thank you. It's actually a very bitter sweet ending to the documentary, which is what you should watch and skip over this piece of garbage of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was exactly what you would expect from Robert Zameckis, Forrest Gump still his best output, the biopic of a French artist of dreams of walking on high wire across the Twin Towers.The movie is set in 1974 in France about Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). At a very young age he becomes fascinated by the local wire-walker Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) and tries to wire walk on his own backyard. He was repeatedly called the Circus Clown by his father who did not like what he did. Soon Philippe found he was very good at balancing and juggling, and started to practice and learn. This didn't go for long soon he was kicked from his home by his father. He didn't have any other job so he started performing on streets, he used to draw a circle and call it his void he didn't talk or let anyone inside his void because that is where he performs. Once going through a magazine he notices a magnificent work of art "The twin towers" and instantly promises and makes his life's dream to walk across the twin tower on high wire. There he meets Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) a fellow street artist and falls in love with her, tells him all about his dreams and practices with her at her art school.Then he starts looking for fellow mates to fulfill his dream of crossing twin towers, he finds Jean-Louis (Clément Sibony) and Jean- Louis' friend, Jean-François (César Domboy). He also learns everything from Papa Rudy and sets off to New York. From the very first day he starts to learn each and everything about the twin tower and plans begin to perform the coup. To perform this they had to find an inside man who came to person who saw him perform in Paris and was fascinated by his artistic skills. With his help and some fellow French mates living in NYC he begins his preparations for the final day.The day come and he is pumped with adrenaline, he performs the climatic walk in front of whole of NY and everyone embraces him and he becomes a legend in NY.Robert Zameckis has done a great job along with the fx guys great movie to watch in 3D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Walk' erupts right out the gate with an unexpected explosion of energy; an underlying jazz bass supplies the perfect pace for an army of snappy edits as an impossible flying camera (more on that later) soars us through Philippe's fascination of tightrope walking. The vitality seizes only briefly to introduce us to a handful of characters in the Frenchman's budding tightrope walking career, not least of which include Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) providing the voice of both mentor-ship and sanity, and Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) who redundantly motivates an already self-devoted Philippe. In fact, aside from an epiphany in a particular scene, coming off perhaps more humorous than intended, Annie and Philippe's relationship doesn't result in anything, and can best be summed up during a moment when Jean-Pierre, one of Philippe's helpers, asks Annie as she's peering through a pair of binoculars up at the Towers, "Does he even know you're here?" Which, I suppose, is better than the audience asking, "Why are you here at all?"FULL REVIEW HERE: http://indieadam.com/2015/10/06/the-walk-review-indieadam/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Walk is directed by Robert Zemeckis and it stars Joseph Gordon Levitt as a young man who has a dream of high wire walking from one of the twin towers to the other. I came into this movie knowing almost nothing about it, except it was another Zemeckis film and I wanted to watch it.I really enjoyed some parts of The Walk. The first half of the film, although definitely slower than the second half, was really interesting to me because we see Gordon's character grow in his art and wee see him develop himself in the thing he loves most. That was by far the most enjoyable thing in the film for me.Joseph Gordon Levitt brings a lot to this movie, he is a very likable guy and he makes his character likable and I can actually totally buy his fake french accent. The second half of the film is pretty intense and the CGI is very good, and they used some POV shots that really paid off as they added intensity to the film. The movie is pretty funny, as well.The main problem with the walk is the last 20 minutes of the film or so, feel stretched, as if the movie could have just ended a lot sooner, instead the intensity of the final act fades, and it honestly becomes pretty boring. The thing I really hated in the film was that by the end everything felt too perfect, it's like Zemeckis tied the film up in a pretty big bow and wanted to give it to the audience. It was too perfect, it didn't feel real.But overall, save for the last quarter of the film or so, I really enjoyed The Walk. It's mostly suspenseful and funny, although it falls into clichéd territory by the end of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE WALK provides an eye-opening experience for cinema-goers, to witness a mission-impossible which actually happened in real life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Zemeckis' biopic THE WALK is about Frenchman Philippe Petit's virtuoso escapade in 1974 when he managed a stealthy high-wire walking between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre, which stuns the world, the source material has already garnered an Oscar for James Marsh's documentary MAN ON WIRE (2008), freshly juxtaposes interview with the re- enactment of the stunt.Saw this picture in 3D/IMAX format, it opens with Petit (Gordon-Levitt) cheerfully breaks the fourth wall at the top of the Statue of Liberty (a tactic will soon run out of its charm due to its frequency and out of necessity), tells audience his greatest achievement and then routinely dissolves to flashbacks of his past in Paris, how he gets fascinated with the act and learns the nitty-gritty of the tightrope-walking from his tutor Papa Rudy (Kingsley), how he firstly sets on his dream goal on the Twin Towers, and his subsequent preparation with his accomplices Annie (Le Bon), also his girlfriend, Jean-Louis (Sibony) and Jean-Pierre (Domboy), who is extremely afraid of height.When in New York, they recruits several other partners-in-crime to facilitate his coup, after a few setbacks and delays, when the high time arrives, it will become the worst nightmare for the acrophobic (myself include), no doubt, Zemeckis' visual auteur status achieves a nice peak in this, the vertiginous effect is so vicarious, the breathtaking bird's-eye view shots are magnificent, so is the clouds scenes, Petit's every step on the wire is like salt sprinkling on an open wound, literally my palms were sweating the whole time of the stunt. Unabashedly, Philippe wilfully repeats his walks, improvises some daredevil conducts, even teases with the police officers who are trying to arrest him, to a certain extent it almost becomes a cheap trick to exploit on our primal fear of falling, we don't care whether or not Philippe will fall to his death, it is our own sense of dreadfulness being manipulated here.Physically speaking, the resemblance between JGL and Petit himself is scarcely credible, but being a feature film, verisimilitude should never be the ultimate goal, this is a role obviously demands him a great deal of endeavour, acquires the skill from Petit personally, perfects his French and embellishes his English with a French accent, which mysteriously disappears in certain scenes, and the most taxing task is to convey Petit's larger-than-life persona in a humane manner, as much as one should admire of his immense courage and superb prowess, it is not an act to be emulated or encouraged, we all know (including himself), Petit is a mad man, we still need sanity to keep our society running healthily, and in reality, not every dream can be fulfilled, especially with a suicidal tendency. Thus, from another perspective, the film doesn't jump out of the pigeonhole of hagiography, complementing the third act with the disturbance of a digitally-generated bird and musing on the meaning of life on the wire, looks a bit phoney, doesn't it?Still and all, THE WALK provides an eye-opening experience for cinema-goers, to witness a mission-impossible which actually happened in real life, at least can give ourselves some ego boost, also Zemeckis surges as a redoubtable competitor for the visual effect Oscar next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gordon-Leavitt's tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Zemekis' film in 3-D 'The Walk' has that immediacy of the old American TV series 'You Are There'. In a little more than two hours he manages to recreate the incredible feat of high-wire walker Phillipe Petit's breath-taking walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center, 110 stories above the mean streets of Wall Street. The documentary 'Man on the Wire' won an Oscar in 2008 and Petit's book sold well. But Zemekis has brought us closer to the planning and execution of Petit's dare devil performance on 6 Aug 1974, thanks to digital technology on one hand, and on the other, the protean talent of Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, ably assisted by a Franco-American cast. Gordon-Leavitt never does things half ways: he learned French that he speaks fairly well, took to the high wire under the masterly hand of Petit himself, learned riding the unicycle, some juggling tricks and so on. In appearance and accented English, he has entered into the fantasy of Petit's world. And the transformation is well earned: by sheer dint of talent and effort, we enter into the dream, the planning and finally the execution of the Walk. Ably assisted by co-conspirators Ben Kingsley, Charlotte Le Bon, Clement Sibony, Cesar Domboy, Ben Schwartz and James Dale Badge, 'the Walk' takes on the verismiltutde of that day during the sign of the dog of August. The wise use of 3-D heightens the tension of the walk between the two towers. Zemeckis' camera is deftly used in close ups, long shots, and recreating the minutiae of setting up the rigging of the wire. And within us, the emotional tension rises slowly and then more rapidly as Gordon-Leavitt with a Zen calmness walks many times back and forth with grace and shameless boldness. Many will turn their eyes away from the screen; others will fell a queasy feeling rising from the pit of the stomach; and still others a in voluntary touch of agrophobia and wet palms. 'The Walk' is a paean to human will to overcome the impossible because Petit succeeded. In another way, Zemeckis' film has a sweet smell of success, but more--the relief and purgation of emotions of classical Greek drama. In spite of the rip-off in the 3-D glasses fee, don't think twice about seeing 'The Walk'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Rating: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606; out of 4)This film is recommended. In brief: With some missteps aside, the film still entertains.GRADE: BIn 1974, a man named Philippe Petit, an French acrobat and street performer, made his longtime dream become a reality. He organized a group of friends to help him walk between the iconic twin towers of the World Trade Center. This stunt made him famous worldwide and is the basis for Robert Zemeckis' latest film, The Walk.&#xfffc;The story itself is a fascinating subject and the film tries for the most part to reconstruct this dangerous and foolhardy mission with much success. (Prior to this reincarnation was an Oscar winning documentary, Man on Wire, which is a far better and factual retelling on this true event and a better option if one wants to learn more about this incident.) This fictionalized version is still highly entertaining on the big screen.&#xfffc;Director Zemeckis is a talented craftsman and his earlier films (Forest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Flight) have combined live action and CGI to masterful results. This one, however, never reaches the heights (pun intended) due to two glaring, how do you say in French...ah yes, faux pas: the miscasting in the lead role and a conventional script that never develops its characters very well. While the film is technically proficient, especially in the scenes depicting the exciting logistics of the stunt, the flashback of Petit's life remain commonplace and cliché-ridden. (Special kudos to the prolific cinematographer, Dariusz Wolski and Alan Silvestri's moody film score.)&#xfffc;Playing Petit is Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The actor may have the physical movements of this man down pat, but his pseudo French vocal delivery keeps his character at arm's length. This may be this gifted actor's weakest performance to date. He tries valiantly, but he never quite walks the walk of this crazed showman. Faring better in their supporting roles are Charlotte Le Bon as his lover, Clément Sibony César Domboy, and James Badge Dale as his partners-in-crime, and Sir Ben Kingsley as his persnickety mentor. &#xfffc;At fault is the badly rote (wrote?) screenplay by Christopher Browne and the director which takes too many missteps in its execution. The film overly romanticizes this daredevil tale of a dreamer achieving his goal with a sentimental idealism which defeats the overall venture. Characters talk in hyperbole, never in conversations that seem natural. However, the aforementioned photography is stunning to behold and his creative use of 3D is groundbreaking with his skewed perspectives, dizzying highs and lows, and panoramic vistas. A technical triumph.Still, while most of the CGI effects were very well accomplished, others lacked authenticity. Particularly jarring were some of the far-away distant shots of Petit on the wire that looked artificial and unreal and an awkward appearance of a red-eyed symbolic white bird that was as phony as Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Pepe Le Pew awful-sounding French accent. The narrative scenes with Petit talking directly to the audience while atop the Statue Of Liberty had an off- putting effect too, only accentuating the contrived monologue that JGL is forced to deliver in the heaviest of accents that is, at times, unintentionally embarrassing and downright laughable. &#xfffc;The Walk does spin an interesting tale, but ultimately loses its footing along the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Walk" mostly depicts the events of a person named "Philippe Petit" and his mad idea of 'walk over a hanging wire across of the twin towers of the world' so hence the name "The Walk". Zemeckis is one of the few directors who can do a narrative style without sounding lame and at the same time, highly intense. Gordon- Levitt has portrayed the role as a mad french-man on an average level due to the lack of certain originalities in his french style. At times, its highly evident that its not a french man that we see in the film but Zemeckis has wisely over come the issue by making the characters sound like Americans and has stressed the point they are indeed doing all they can to behave like Americans. They almost insist twice that they use American English to adapt to native Americans. That's a neat move and a good style to hide their flaws.Kingsley, one of the most versatile actor has done a great job in giving life to the mentor of Philippe, "Papa Rudy" who acts as a proper french-man at least on a filmy level. The film kicks off with a narration from Gordon-Levitt and makes the viewers travel along the story line. It slowly makes the viewers aware of the character and his persistence in doing something mad or impossible and actually makes us adapts to his style. The first half of the film starts to grow around us making the characters strong and making the viewers aware of the character's strength and ability. I personally feel that for a biopic, this is very much vital which makes sense to a biopic. If you don't understand the character and come to know him at least partially then the whole point of a biopic is defied at that point. From that perspective, Zemeckis has done a wonderful job. "The Coup" as they call it in pulling off the impossible feat dominates the second half. The accomplices for this impossible feat are added to the "The Coup" as the film progresses and the whole journey of the finding accomplices has some humorous moments to it. "The Walk" is portrayed as something beautiful and the way Zemeckis has made the viewers feel the depth of the moment using the IMAX visual is astounding. Some films are meant to be seen in IMAX 3D and this film definitely comes under that list. There are lot of scenes where immature viewers will literally hang on to their seats due to the visuals experienced via IMAX. As an avid fan of Beethoven, the addition of Fur Elise at the moment of "The Walk" adds a feather to that scene. The intensity of the scene where the lead has finally achieved his dream and lives on it for a certain period of time is added with more goose bumps with Fur Elise. That would easily be added in the list of one of the best scenes featuring the Fur Elise. From my perspective, the final verdict for this film can be depicted in few words."The Walk" is a perfect example of a character who would achieve his dream no matter what. So my personal quote for this film would be "Chase your dreams but make sure you don't fall off the edge".This film should definitely be seen or experienced in IMAX 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is Life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was ever a worthy utilization of 3D on that prodigious silver screen, it's The Walk. The appearance of another studio film trying to capitalize on an incredible true story?one that was already satisfyingly revealed, no less, in the awe-inspiring 2008 documentary: Man on Wire? was certainly working against this production, only baiting the cynics in their preparation to deride the typical inaccuracies and manipulations. Surprisingly though, The Walk is truly laudable due to its utter respect for this legendary wire-walker named Philippe Petit?a man that gave us the show of a lifetime by daring to walk a tight wire from one of the twin towers to the other; actually, scratch that, maybe even two or three lifetimes.Joseph Gordon-Levitt inhabits this eccentric character with the utmost dedication and methodology, livening every element of the individual with a remarkable magnitude of authenticity whether it's the perfection of a thick French accent, or even his pronunciations when he's actually speaking the language for extended periods of time. He's clearly working with such a burden here, and at the same time, he's also infusing the maximum dose of charisma into this character. Pleasantly observe the totally natural French-like mannerisms he subtly permeates into his confrontational arguments with those around him?friends who're incessantly vexing him with their distrust in this insane stunt he's so eager to pull. Thanks to the support of an exceptional cast?including the lovable James Badge Dale; the great Ben Kingsley; an unfamiliar, refreshing actress in Charlotte Le Bon; as well as all the other cohorts and their comic relief next to them?strengthens Levitt's energy on the screen that much strongly.It's a gripping portrait of artistic obsession?that inability to admit defeat even in the face of impossible odds. Perhaps, sometimes,the more incensed and impatient side of this otherwise amiable guy might be exposed, but once he finally reaches the roof of the southern twin tower with mounds and mounds of imperative (daredevil) equipment, you want this for him almost as much as he does. Thus, it becomes an undeniably fun caper with a mischievous score that recalls the audacity of Ocean's crew. Subsequently, a beautiful, soaring score greets us as the vastness of the city and the romantic posture of the horizon comes into view on the roof; if Phillip falls, it would surely be a glorious death. Inevitably but understandably, some doubt the necessity of a documentary remake. In this case, what was frankly unclear throughout those interviews was lucidly visualized here. Vague descriptions and mappings could only take your imagination so far, which is why veteran director Robert Zemeckis prioritizes absolute audience involvement by implementing suspenseful excitement into sequences that see this group break in past security, maintaining feverish pacing in the process.But, of course, what we're really here for is the sheer potential of incredible thrills from the famous wire-walking. As I've hinted at previously, this is an absolute must-see in IMAX 3D just like Avatar and Gravity were. The beauty of Paris and New York City are greatly enhanced in all their lavish detail, and the depth in those daunting shots that look down from lofty heights makes the experience drastically more immersive. As the camera glides from the top of a tower down to the very streets of New York, you could almost feel that rush. The Walk finds every possible technical maneuver in amping up the audience's anxiety during these scenes?close-ups of Phillip's sweat or carefully- placed feet balancing on a slightly vibrating rope, followed by the camera's panning and circling around Petit's various tricks on the wire which only increase in difficulty.Essentially, this film has achieved an astonishing feat in wholly justifying a cinematic retelling of the true story. With that being said, there are details that're over-dramatized as can be expected from a Hollywood production in order to build superficial tension, or even those that're fictionally inserted to give a scene the fullest dramatic effect. Occasional moments remind us we're only watching a movie after all, whether it's some inspirational dialogue or the predictable action beats like someone tipping over at the worst time. Overall, its rare (live-action) PG rating allows the whole family to attend and enjoy the classic thrills, the frequent humor, and the ravishing vistas?what a charming feast!</fullReview>

Also, the effects screwed up the whole film.

The main character had an accent that i, from the trailers believed would hate. In the end, the movie was mind blowing. First, the accent was in fact pretty cool. Like it is cool now to have a french accent now. Lewitt managed to become into a cool kat with a cool accent. Second, this movie WAS made for 3D and IMAX in mind. The Twin towers in migrarous 3D and the biggest screen would bring you tears when you realize how the world lost such a beauty, but that is another subject. Through out the movie the director used 3D in a smart manner, and Not in a gimmicky one. Finally, the movie was packed with a whole bunch of extras that were not forced in or deviated the movie from the final scene. It was well paced.

		<shortDescription>Zemeckis' by-the-book family movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dramatization of Philippe Petit's high-wire walk between the World Trade Center's twin towers in 1974, previously told in the Oscar-winning documentary MAN ON A WIRE (2008).This movie is a straight by-the-book telling of a very simple story: A man who wants to perform a high-wire stunt. Breaking the fourth wall right from the start, Philippe Petit's character tells the viewer his own story, from his early days as a kid in France and up to a very detailed telling of the event itself. If you've seen the documentary or know the story, you won't find any surprises.The movie is extremely light and could be categorized as something between a comedy and a family movie.Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a good job in his role and the story is told in a fun and rather engaging way. All in a all, I'd say that this movie is a little more interesting than the documentary.Still, there is nothing special about this movie. Exactly 30 years after the release of BACK TO THE FUTURE (and one day after "celebrating" Back to the Future Day), this movie serves as an allegory to what happened to most of the talented directors in the last 15 years. While 30 years ago they were inventive, took risks and made some of the most interesting and iconic movies which are just as powerful today as they were so many years ago, today they stopped taking any risks and prefer to make mediocre films, usually retelling previously released material.Robert Zemeckis does a decent job with a paper-thin story, but this is not the Robert Zemeckis who made iconic movies such as the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy, FORREST GUMP, WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, CAST AWAT or even CONTACT. I guess I enjoyed this movie more than I enjoyed any of the movies he made in the last 10 years, but that doesn't really say much. I expect a lot more from a director like Robert Zemeckis.I'm also disappointed to see that Zemeckis chose to abuse 3D in this movie and put lots of cheap tricks, angles and camera movements throughout the entire movie, which are only meant to wow the 3D viewer. I was never against 3D, but the more I watch 3D movies, the less I enjoy them. AVATAR remains the best and only movie which really took my breath away and cleverly used this 3D technology.Visually speaking, it's hard to rate the effects. The recreation of the Twin Towers and the city is excellent and almost flawless. However, many of the shots which show Joseph Gordon-Levitt with the city behind/beneath him look fake and sometimes it's even obvious that the shots were made in a studio in front of a green screen. Again, something that would never have happened in Zemeckis' earlier films.I should also mention that the movie does feature some b-movie elements, notably the the cringe inducing pothead character which is taken straight from the book of clichés.All in all, this is an enjoyable movie. It's very light, family-friendly and would give you a fussy feeling at the end (minus the extremely- cheesy American ending). Hey, the audience liked it and even cheered more than once in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling celebration of human achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard that the first half (or so) of this movie was very flawed, but the second part made up for it. As I had seen Man on Wire (the documentary), I knew most of the story from beforehand, and with that in mind, the first part of the movie seemed a bit pointless. The documentary told that part of the story just as well. I didn't mind the stylized way of presenting, which I thought matched the personality of Petit. But that part of the story was not enough to warrant a movie on the subject.The last part of the movie though, the coup, was thrilling, and it suddenly made sense why they would make a movie about the subject. The city, the towers and Petit lends themselves perfectly for a great cinematic experience. Maybe it was the big screen, but at times the CGI felt a bit off - but not enough to spoil the experience. I caught an IMAX screening of this, and what a ride it was! Still not giving this movie more than a 7, as I don't think it will hold up as well watching it in other settings than a cinema. It's still well worth a watch, and while I (and many others) focus on the visuals and the thrills, the movie is more than that. It a celebration of human achievement, how people can do great things, etc.English is not my mother tongue, which might be why I didn't mind Gordon-Levitt's accent. I had a bit more trouble with Kingsly's, but maybe because I'm not familiar with the one he was going for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aside from the breathtaking segment, a little too vanilla, light and fluffy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some fantastic things about The Walk - the acting, music and special effects are terrific, no doubt about it. Its worth seeing just for the final segment, there is something very unique and cinematic about it. The rest of it though seemed a little "safe" and sterile for my liking. JGL sweeps his character along with a typical kind of french eccentricity, everything with an exclamation mark, all very amusing but not really capturing the nuance, depth or complexity of the real Petite (or any human for that matter). The rampant potential of suspense and tension is somehow diluted - Man On Wire was far more effective in this regard.The decision to continually puncture the story's progression and break the fourth wall with JGL's talking head atop the statue of liberty was a negative for me - it brought me out of the film, and continually reminded me that the whole thing is just a digital canvas. There were other little reminders too, using digital CGI to unnecessary transition between two scenes by zooming into and back out of something, or having a little CGI cable weave itself across space between the towers. These really are nitpicks, but in a story where complete immersion would really benefit the engagement with the final act, I didn't feel very immersed. I was always looking at it as a film, as a piece of digital craftsmanship.By the end the message and theme of the film seems to be far more steered towards the romance and tragedy of the Twin Towers, rather than determination, achieving goals, dreams etc. Which was probably wise, as I found it hard to ever truly empathise with the character because of the lack of immersion (but that might have just been me). Its a solid, very-family friendly film, the kind that would be good viewing at Christmas, and the last act is incredibly cinematic. I just couldn't help but feel that it could have been so much better, with a little more grit, immersion and naturalism. Should you see it in 3D? Everyone will say yes, because the final segment is truly breathtaking and looks incredible in 3D. However, I'm not sure I agree - the rest of the film looked shockingly dull and dark because of the 3D, and not particularly sharp. Quite a bit of conversion motion blur. It would have been much better being primarily in 2D, then requiring the glasses just for the actual walk segment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Philippe Petit is a French high-wire artist who gained fame in the year 1974 for his high-wire walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. "The Walk" revolves around his tentative beginning and his eventual love affair with the Twin Towers.A French accented Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Philippe Petit with earnest. With a well sketched out character at hand, he manages to resonate the emotions fittingly. His chemistry with Charlotte Le Bon (as Annie) was charming while his interaction with Ben Kingsley (as Papa Rudy) were brilliant. Kingsley as expected was a scene stealer while Charlotte Le Bon was rather substandard. Clément Sibony (as Jean-Louis) and César Domboy (as Jeff) was impeccably low-key in their supporting roles which played well in keeping the spotlight on the protagonist. James Badge Dale (as Jean- Pierre), Steve Valentine (as Barry Greenhouse) Ben Schwartz (as Albert) and Benedict Samuel (as David) played fundamental parts in keeping the humor alive as we reached the climax of the film."The Walk" is clearly designed with idea of enthralling the viewers in IMAX 3D. You'll find yourself wincing a couple of times and for anyone scared of heights; this film will get you a slightly anxious. The climax is spectacular and not for the faint hearted though the CGI in the wide scenes weren't up to the mark (shoestring budget I hear) as more often than not the images looked rather flat. Cinematography in general was enormously effective in immersing you into the set pieces while costume design were seamlessly complementary.With Robert Zemeckis at the helm, much is to be expected. This isn't his finest work but he manages to pull off a well knitted story without going over the hill with dramatic distractions (i.e. exaggerated Twin Towers eulogy). The film even though not fast paced doesn't fall into the realm of boredom though the narratives were a buzz kill for momentum and could have been completely avoided chopping a good 10 minutes off the 123 minute run time. Obviously the censored/cut scenes (one at a pivotal junction) didn't help either.If you've got an itch for IMAX; then this is the perfect film for you. It's flawed but you'll forget all of that as you find yourself on the edge of your seat during the breathtaking climax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have respect for people who walk on the wire with any kind of safety net. I don't really like the fact that if you fall you die, but it's part of what the wire is. - Philippe PetitWalking into the cinema... The World Trade Centre no longer exists. To tell Philippe Petit's story without the iconic twin towers could only be taken on by the king of new CGI technology, Academy Award Award winning director, Robert Zemeckis. Will the infamous 45 minute walk make for a compelling drama? Overall rating: 3.5 stars Cinematic value: 4 stars Big Questions value: 3 starsThe man who walked on a tight rope between the World Trade Centre towers may not be a familiar to all, but Philippe Petit's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) story is legendary. This tight-rope walk is the subject matter of books, films and even TED talks. The Walk is retold by director and writer, Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump), the master of all that is new in the realm of CGI technology. Which is a critical component to telling this magical tale, because he must reproduce the height and expanse of this illegal project that spans the World Trade Centre. A story that focuses on a rag-tag crew of risk takers who are led by Petit to undertake the impossible project of crossing the void between these man-made giants on a high wire. With the guidance of his mentor, Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley), the international crew members find creative ways of getting the wires across the two buildings and allowing for Petit to meet his goal and make the crossing without any safety nets or harnesses. This true-to-life story provides the drama, artistry and humour that builds to the needed intrigue and tension that can only come from watching a high-wire performer and provides a beautiful testament to The World Trade Centre and '70s New York City. The Walk is told in a fairy-tale manner which allows for mystical type character development and the necessary magic for a journey of this nature. The narrative provided by Joseph Gordon-Levitt feels cringe-worthy at first, because of his attempt at the French accent, but becomes appealing and believable, due to the narrator styling. He delivers a solid performance in the lead role. There may have been other French choices for the role of Petit, but this young actor fills the ballet-like shoes of the aerial performer quite well. The supporting cast rounds out the needed ensemble for the drama and humour. The players in this comical and compelling drama are portrayed in a caricature type format, which adds to the visual colour to make this a magical kaleidoscope adventure. The true brilliance of this film is found in the director. Robert Zemeckis' ability to provide ground breaking effects that pull the viewer into the story without a realisation that the effects even exist is masterful. The World Trade Centre towers no longer exist, but the director's skill and understanding of the value of good story is so captivating that it pulls you into believing that Gordon-Levitt is actually walking between the towers. Zemeckis portrays Petit's adventure as a testament to The World Trade Centre towers through great effects and creative direction which provide a beautiful cinematic experience. The Walk is a great story in the hands of a master storyteller.Philippe Petit is a dynamic character in real life and his story plays well on the big screen. The Walk tells Petit's bigger than life event, but this story and event would not have taken place without a team. A tight rope walker has all of the crowd's attention and it seems that the focus of the work is on only one person, but the film shows that all leaders need an effective crew to make things come together. Each person on Petit's team has a specific role to play and such is the case with life, too. Based on what we can know of God is that we all have a role to play in this life. Celebrating unique events like The Walk is understandable, but hopefully we will not forget the part that each player plays in the story. We all have our place and significance in this life. Each is significant, regardless of how much attention is given to each part.Leaving the cinema: It is not a perfect film, but Zemeckis provides an entertaining experience for all ages. Petit's story is compelling and inspiring, which is captured in this dramatic retelling. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What is the value of teamwork? (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10, 1 Corinthians 12:20-25) 2. Does the Bible say anything about risk taking? (Proverbs 3:5, Mark 8:36) 3. Does God care about my dreams?

		<fullReview>The Walk is basically a love story...Between Bob Zemeckis and the cinema..Between the main character and his girlfriend...between him and him friends..between him and his tightrope.....A film made just for the love of storytelling and movie making.The 1st thing I noticed was in the opening scene, which gave us a shot of him on the Statue Of Liberty...but with bad CGI...this was obviously intentional but I cannot fathom out why...this made me sit up and take note.I also noticed the 3d and effects,, while excellent,,were never overdone to take the edge of the story , which for me worked as I concentrated on the script..which was fantastic and used words we could understand.1st third is a small biopic...2nd third was a sort of heist movie..and 3rd was an edge of the seat drama.In short a movie made by a classic director who obviously loves and adores all things movie...marvelous way to spend a few hours.One more thing I should mention is after all the attention on Back To The Future and the 911 conspiracy..I found myself searching throughout the movie for more clues which made it all the more enjoyable ( if you have not seen the documentary on BTTF and 911 you should check it out before you go and see it)!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Walk, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Joseph Gordon- Levitt, is a true story of a french man, Philippe Petit, who had dreams of walking on a tightrope between the twin towers in 1970's New York City. In what is marketed as the IMAX event of the year, The Walk succeeds in all of its visual glory while being a formidable film otherwise.Dariusz Wolski does stunning work in the cinematography and the 3D is used surprisingly sparingly, though very effectively. Its based off of Petit's book as is the critically acclaimed documentary Man on Wire. I think in terms of an actual film, the documentary is probably superior. But The Walk does give us some of the best visuals of the year so far. In many ways the film is a love letter to the twin towers in its gorgeous recreation of 1970's NYC. The problem is that besides Petit, you don't really care about any of the supporting characters. There isn't much back story or depth to any of them with exception perhaps to Annie.Gordon-Levitt's french accent didn't bother me past the first few scenes. But I think the narration that JGL provides didn't add as much to the story as I thought it might. The documentary really captures the craziness of Petit and the movie does to a certain extent, but we still didn't get a good enough reason as to why he's doing what he's doing. Or why so many people are going out of their way to help him.Alan Silvestri once again did a beautiful job complementing a Zemeckis picture, which was probably my favorite part of the entire film. So there isn't a ton to love about The Walk, but not a ton to hate either. The way I look at it is, you either see the film in IMAX 3D or don't see it all. The film lives and dies with its gorgeous visuals and beautiful score. +Visuals+Score+Love letter to WTC-Supporting characters7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Walk", starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt-The Dark Knight Rises, G.I.Joe:The Rise of Cobra; Ben Kingsley-Night at the Museum:Secret of the Tomb, Iron Man 3; Charlotte Le Bon-The Hundred-Foot Journey, Mood Indigo and James Badge Dale-Iron Man 3, 24_tv.This movie is based on the book by Philippe Petit called 'To Reach the Clouds'. Philippe was a French tightrope walker that became famous for spreading a high wire between the two World Trade Center buildings in New York City in August of 1974 and walking back and forth, between the two buildings-No one had ever done it before him or after, especially now, since the towers are gone. The movie is directed by Robert Zemeckis, who directed Cast Away, Forest Gump, all 3 of the Back to the Future movies and Romancing the Stone. Joseph plays Philippe and the movie tells how he got interested in tightrope walking in France, as a little boy. As he got older, he met Ben, who headed a family of high wire walkers in a circus. He became a mentor to Joseph. Joseph was always looking for places to hang his wire to walk on and when he saw a picture of the newly constructed World Trade Center twin towers, he just knew that he had to walk between them. He headed to New York and began planning how the impossible feat could be done. Just getting the wire between the roofs of the two buildings was a nightmare, much less the actual walk itself-which was also totally illegal. Charlotte is a French girl that he falls for-figuratively-and brings along with him to New York for his adventure. James is an American in New York that Joseph meets and enlists to become one of his fellow conspirators. This movie is only in IMAX 3D in our area-it will open up in wider release in a few weeks-and not only is that how I saw it but that is how it should be seen. This movie was made to be viewed in IMAX. It's rated "PG" for perilous situations, brief nudity-one scene where Joseph takes off all of his clothes and is only seen from behind- language, drug references and smoking and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 3 minutes. I don't know how it will look on a regular sized TV but I enjoyed it enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is up in the order of my chart of most talented actor. I noticed him in Inception and from there let is be 'Dark Knight Rises' of 'Premium Rush' he is just so incredible. He is very much in the queue of being one of best actor of the century. 'The Walk' is a true story about Philippe Petit and his accomplices, who actually walked on a wire hanging in between the twin towers in the New York city back in 1974. the first half of the movie is bit slow as it was most about the introduction of Philippe and his friends and how they met. But the real delight breaks out in the last 30 mins of the movie. The predictable climax isn't so predictable. Charlotte Le Bon as Philippe's girlfriend Annie is real cute. Ben Kingsley played Papa Rudy flawlessly, the mentor. Clément Sibony, James Badge Dale and César Domboy played the loyal friends and accomplices and played them well. People who have Acrophobia or the fear of height may think twice before going in, but nonetheless in my list this one is a must. Don't miss it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's start by saying that this film, which really gives vertigo, is not up to the quality of the documentary "Man on Wire" which tells, without exaggeration, the same story in a more impressive and captivating way, and with an astonishing perfection (which earned him an Oscar for best documentary in 2008).That said, The Walk is more a visual stunt than a prowess of actors, make-up, scenario or even faithfulness to actual events. The film has nonetheless a captivating rhythm and dynamic, and is satisfactory as a whole. The visual effects are quite good and those who see it in 3D will have the chance to get a good time in the shoes of the main character, in moments that will play with the nerves of those of us who suffer from the fear of heights! Some of my friends did not feel anything, but I'm still recovering from the discomfort felt from the vertiginous heights of this insane funambule. I never had that much vertigo watching a movie! ... It was almost unpleasant ... and that's clearly what I'll remember more than anything else.</fullReview>

I love the cast, have of course loved many Robert Zemeckis movies in the past but this one had a lot of things that didn't work- First of all, your mileage may vary, but the french simply doesn't work. Hard to get into the movie when the French spoken is at best forced (Philippe's) and at worst so bad it can't be understood (JP - Jean Pierre). - May be linked but the actors all seemed to be pushing it? overdoing it? Didn't seem natural at all - The narration gets on your nerves quite fast. - The set up for "the walk" is basically a heist set up... that takes 75% of the movie and is not that interestingSo yeah, didn't really get into that one, even though I really wanted to. The final scene is cool - and must have looked incredible in 3D but other than that, can't say I want to watch it again.PS: Where did he get all the money to do this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zemeckis is behind some of the most enjoyable films in history. He's after all at the heart of "Back to the Future", though Michael J. Fox should get plenty of credit, and Tom Hanks made "Forrest Gump". Zemeckis also gave us the deadly "dead" eyes of "The Polar Express", and now in one of the most uninspiring films ever made about a remarkable event and a most special man.It all falters from the beginning when Lewitt has what must be the most horrific accent impersonation ever. Here we are in the middle of superb technical elements: cinematography, art direction, and the finest of audio and video effects, but the overall effect is some akin to boredom, with not much of a heartbeat and way too many distractions to get involved. Kingsley's weird amalgam of accents keeps haunting me.We had superb biographies before, and they didn't involve walking across a wire from the top of the tallest buildings in N.Y.C. to the other, a building with his own history, emotional significance, and a few other remarkable qualities of its own. It's particularly upsetting since Lewitt has been very good lately, and this will a while to forget.Earlier with the previews, we noticed something was off, when the best one could see was the camera zooming up the side of the building. It appeared as if technical had already overpowered substance. Just recently, I read a famous critic state that this movie was better than "Avatar", and it couldn't be further from the truth. "Avatar" soared, even with some of the fantastic creations who came to life, though we knew they were not real at all. We connected with the soul in beings that couldn't be more different from us, and here we can't seem to penetrate the dullness that surrounds the acting and the story.Audiences are staying away, and it has become clear to me why. There's not much to like here. There are some amazing films out there now, and even slight deviations in accents don't seem to bother the audience because the main focus is the story, the acting, and the drama, and whatever connection is universal in those themes is not present here. There's too much time showing us how different this character is. I could have certainly used less time "in his training" phase, and I'd rather have the actors speak plain English, rather than hearing his constant request for practice since I'm going to America line.I'm waiting for a real cinematic force to reawaken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard Fare Hollywood 'Walk'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only two good things about this movie. 1. It is a nice, if somewhat precious (and sometimes creepy), love letter to the WTC, and 2. I really was on the edge of my seat, heart racing, during the walk, and the outcome is no secret! I thought I remembered he had some trouble, so maybe that played into my anxiety. At any rate, that is a feat not all directors can pull off (with help from the fx guys of course). Those 2 items are where my 4 points come from. Otherwise it would be a rating of 0. The surrounding fluff is just horrid and without the 'walk', it would be even worse. But how cruel of Zemeckis to make us sit through all that just to get to the meat. I have to think there was more to the planning of the stunt, etc, than the movie shows, almost as if he is saying we are too stupid to understand the technical issues, or that his awful drama is better fare, but the technical things are probably already addressed in Man on Wire, so how to add value to a story that has already been told? Add content surrounding the walk, which in this case failed miserably, with laughable French accents and bad dubbing on occasion. I thought I was watching Commedia dell'Arte at times, esp re language and his 'coup' of minions, and this is a drama. Also, 'Phillipe' standing on top of the Statue of Liberty (irony not lost, as France gave it to the US) was just awful blue screen. I never believed it for a minute (no wind up there, eh?). If it was supposed to look hyper-real or surreal (no wind), well, it failed and just looked hyper-awful, and was distracting throughout the film. I think the best jaw-dropping fx were the background shots/matte paintings of NYC. Oh, another booboo: all of the pop music used was not of the time. It was on the radio at least 8-10 yrs earlier. I also find it very irritating that they keep reminding us in every introduction of a new character why they are French but speaking English. "Speak English please!" That got REAL old and repetitious; Zemeckis should know way better than that; it was a point that was of no importance. Oh, and Ben Kingsley, not one of his best performances, by a mile. In conclusion, and I hate to say it, but this movie was directed as if a grade schooler was at the helm. Save your time. Off to watch the Man on Wire doc...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The WalkIf you string rope between any two objects in NYC it will become a clothesline in minutes. That's why the tightrope walker in this drama is so secretive about his latest stunt.Tired of busking in Paris, street performer Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) sets his sights on New York's Twin Towers.With assistance from circus performer Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley), Petit learns proper wire set-up and the proper mindset for the feat.But securing the wire between the towers is only half the battle.Based on events from 1973, director Robert Zemeckis attempts to make a man walking on a wire interesting - a feat he only half accomplishes.While the final walk is heart pounding, the journey there not so much, thanks impart to Gordon- Levitt's authentic but annoying accent.Incidentally, in New York, even on the high wire, there's a good chance you could be hit by a cab.

		<shortDescription>'The Walk' is Half Visual Spectacle and Half Dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)Robert Zemeckis has created some of the best films of the last 30 years. "Forrest Gump" is one of cinema's finest masterpieces, "Back to the Future" revolutionized the time travel genre, and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" is a beautiful merge of animation and the real world. With his newest effort "The Walk," Zemeckis creates an apparent respect and adoration of New York City and the twin towers that haven't really been seen in film post-9/11 however, his narrative tones and setup are both uninspired and dull, all leading up to a grand finale that makes the film simply watchable. Helmed by a very determined Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the visual spectacle creates a real sense of height and wonder, portraying breathtaking effects. Though its only half passable, the film feels like an appropriate and perfect opener for the New York Film Festival."The Walk" tells the story of high-wire artist Philippe Petit, who in 1974, recruits a team of people to help him realize his dream: to walk the immense void between the World Trade Center towers.Written by Christopher Browne and Robert Zemeckis, "The Walk" is narrated by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, on top of the torch of the Statue of Liberty, with the World Trade Center towers in the background. He addresses the audience with every thought, which is heavily relied upon from the film's writing team. From the opening of Levitt's monologue, the entire set up looks like the beginning of a "Saturday Night Live" episode where Levitt himself, was hosting. Giggles were sprinkled among the audience as the first minutes passed but eventually Gordon- Levitt settles into his role. His accent was impressive, speaking fluent French, and to the untrained ear, he nails his lines. From an emotional perspective, Levitt leaves much to be desired. In his defense, the script does him no favors. Browne and Zemeckis inflects a wit and charm into Philippe that can come off annoying and unlikable.Co-star Charlotte Le Bon, who plays Annie, Philippe's girlfriend, is a sensitive addition, trying her very best to elevate the one- dimensional character that she's given. James Badge Dale is best- in-show, giving personality and spunk to a vastly underwritten role. Ben Kingsley is added as veteran acting wallpaper, just to show experience and dignity in a role that can be done in his sleep.IMAX 3D is put to fantastic use. The final hour is a sequence that stands as one of the year's best. To watch Petit set up for the death-defying stunt was totally engaging, and seeing him take his first steps on the wire was a fantastic spectacle. The natural thoughts go to the Oscar-winning "Man on Wire," but what Zemeckis focuses on is his time on the wire, walking back and forth, making daring moves, and utilizing 3D imagery to inflict real fear and anxiety into the audience. From a directorial standpoint, Zemeckis attempts to make his "Hugo," using 3D as something to progress and tell the story impeccably, placing the audience right there on the wire."The Walk" is an ambitious and respectable misstep. The Visual Effects are well worth the price of a ticket in an IMAX theater, and with the final sequence as long as it is, you should definitely seek it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Junk Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was said that people should avoid repeatedly looking at pictures of 9/11. It was thought that it would tend to be emotionally bad for you. I agree. This movie throws that advice out the window in the form of making a movie that revolves around something that took place to do with the twin towers-but not to do with 9/11. I still think its junk filmmaking in that it is relying on the sensationalist aspect of the mans feat which really doesn't amount to a great deal of anything in and of itself other than to prove that he suffers from a death wish. I would recommend that people avoid this movie. Besides, films are running at around 13 bucks per person at the big cinema complexes these days and they also charge almost five bucks for a small coke in those same places (if you add popcorn thats a clean ten bucks a head for a minimal "snack") so going to the cinema is easily around 50 bucks for two people-this rigmarole of a film isn't worth anything near that much to see. Same with The Martian-which looks like it was made to repopularize Matt Damon and the same for Black Mass which looks like it was made to repopularize Johnny Depp-both those actors-MD &amp; JD were not even suffering from 'fading from popularity.' They will be now-and the main actor in this movie can probably look forward to the same thing. Nobody likes movies based on bad premises. Nobody likes actors involved with movies based on bad as in just plain dumb premises either.</fullReview>
