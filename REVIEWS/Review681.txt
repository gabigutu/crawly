		<shortDescription>That's The Way To Handle Politics On Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what I really appreciated about this political story? The filmmakers went overboard NOT to paint the main character as either a Republican or Democrat, Conservative or Liberal. It winds up, then, being more a human-interest story. In other words, there was no political agenda....unlike most films, especially in the last 50 years. At any rate, Broderick Crawford does an outstanding job portraying the self- proclaimed "hick" Willie Starks, who rises from nothing to become governor of a state and then gets carried away with power and ego.Mercedes McCambridge is equally riveting as one of his aides. She was a great actress, one of the most intense females I've ever seen on film. I'm sorry she didn't achieve stardom and make more movies than she did. She certainly had the talent. In fact, she won an Academy Award for this performance.John Ireland also does very well here as another person helping "Willie." Add some good cinematography and you have a fascinating film start-to-finish. I look forward to viewing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't compare it to CITIZEN KANE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I admit that CITIZEN KANE portrays the corruption of power better than any motion picture ever made, let's also be fair, because any Hollywood movie will suffer when compared with it. A more appropriate comparison would be the recent docudrama of Huey Long, KINGFISH. While John Goodman is excellent as Long and the movie worthwhile, it reveals just how good a film ALL THE KING'S MEN is.Of course, Robert Rossen's picture has a drab look. It should. It suggests the drab appearance of most U.S. states (anyone who has visited Kansas will know why Dorothy and L. Frank Baum wanted to go over the rainbow) and the use of common townsfolk rather than Hollywood extras adds to this look, as do the drab locations (check out something like the Marlon Brando movie THE CHASE, a movie that should have a drab look, but instead looks like a glossy Hollywood backlot). Thank God Columbia, a studio that loved locations because it had no back lot, financed this movie! I wouldn't call this film realistic, but I've read the pulitzer prize winning novel, and I wouldn't call it realistic either. Every page brims with beautifully poetic language which the movie often incorporates and which Rossen makes sound more like natural conversation than it really is. Compared to the book, the film, I think, reveals its real weaknesses: it does simplify moral issues and also reduces some of the characters to the level of melodrama (Willie Stark, in the novel, resembles more someone like Andy Griffith's character in A FACE IN THE CROWD: a charming good ole boy you want to love, but who will knife you in the back the next minute). Broderick Crawford, with his Bronx accent, hardly suggests either a hayseed or, as he calls himself "a hick," but he has a bullying power that I think is brilliant for the role. Personally, I'm glad neither Spencer Tracy nor John Wayne (both of whom Rossen wanted) got the part.And I think this movie holds up very well, even in our post-Watergate era of cynical politics: like the novel, it shows how the populist leader can easily be a tyrant. This message is not in CITIZEN KANE: the lofty Kane was never one of the people; he just wanted to be one of the people. Considering how much Hollywood in the era of Harry Truman embraced the populist sentiment with the films of John Ford and Frank Capra, considering that dictators like a Hitler and a Stalin like to present themselves as one of the people and enjoyed popular support, considering how much Americans love politicians who are charming rather than substantial, I'd say Rossen's film hasn't dated at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Film, But Not The Real Life of Huey Long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Broderick Crawford always said that the greatest thing about winning the Oscar and the acclaim that goes with it for his performance of Willie Stark was that it broadened his casting potential. For a dozen years or so he played nothing but dumb henchmen and sidekicks to various star. He was quoted as saying he was not the world's greatest wit, but he hated always playing half a one. Though he eventually returned back to the ranks of featured performers, the Oscar for Best Actor in 1949 assured him better roles the rest of his life. Of course Crawford's Oscar was not the only one that the film got. It was also the Best Picture of 1949 and in her screen debut, Mercedes McCambridge got the Best Supporting Actress nod. McCambridge was maybe the toughest woman ever portrayed on film so far, a hard nosed political operative who's carrying an empress size torch for Crawford who can't see her in that way at all.As I said before All the King's Men though suggested by the life of Huey Long is not that life at all. Willie Stark is his own unique character. For one thing the unnamed state that All the King's Men took place in is not necessarily the American south. If it were you might see a black face or two in the film. Huey Long in his rise to power in Louisiana used economic populism in his rise to power. He did not like the race issue, felt it was not the future for the south. In that he was far seeing, but if he had to, Long could race bait with the best.Do you remember in Streetcar Named Desire, Tennessee Williams has Stanley Kowalski reference Huey Long by telling Stella and Blanche in no uncertain terms like Huey Long says, he's king in his own castle. Streetcar is set in New Orleans and Williams well knew the power of the Long name in Louisiana. Secondly, Stark's family consists of his wife, adopted son, and father who lives with them. Or rather lives on the old homestead as Stark decides that plain Jane Anne Seymour ain't quite what he needs for a first lady of the state. Although Huey Long was not a model husband to Rose McConnell Long, he never would have thought of divorcing her and leaving her with their three children for a nano-second. Long's family also consisted of a lot of brothers, eight in fact. Huey's brother Earl was three times Governor of Louisiana and his life story is told in the film Blaze with Paul Newman and Lolita Davidovitch. Huey's son Russell unlike being a crippled football hero as John Derek is here was elected at the age of 30 to the United States Senate in 1948 after World War II service with admittedly not any qualifications other than his name. But that name in Louisiana is to this day mighty potent and Russell Long had a distinguished career in the U.S. Senate for over 40 years. In fact when Huey was assassinated in 1935 and Rose McConnell Long received a temporary appointment to fill his seat, the Long family established a unique record of father, mother, and child to serve in the U.S. Senate. And a bunch of Long brothers and other relatives held various elective posts in Louisiana for generations.Like Long however Stark is a self made man with an all consuming passion to get ahead in life. He was born in the most humble of circumstances to a piney woods sharecropper family and lifted himself up to be Governor of his state with national ambitions. And like Long, Stark establishes a political machine in his state that bordered on fascism.Which is why the novel by Robert Penn Warren sold so well in 1947. Maybe it took a war with fascism to educate the American public as to exactly what Huey Long might have represented in the Thirties. Didn't matter in Louisiana though because Earl Long was elected in 1948 to one of his terms as governor as was Russell to the Senate.All the King's Men entertains us with a fascination for the characters created by Warren and brought to the screen so vividly by Director Robert Rossen. The whole film is narrated and seen through the eyes of John Ireland who as a reporter discovered Stark running for local office in his backwoods county. Ireland was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor in what was probably his career role, but lost to Dean Jagger for Twelve O'Clock High.At the time he was married to Joanne Dru who is also in the film and she was grateful to not be doing another western. She plays Ireland's love who later falls for Stark. As Henry Kissinger said about his romantic success, "power is the ultimate aphrodisiac" and I think Rossen was trying to prove it here. She got her career role here as did her brother Sheppard Strudwick who alone sees Stark for what he is.It will be interesting to see if the new version of All the King's Men measures up to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Power Corrupts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story of Willie Stark, who starts out running for an Assemblyman in the south up against the local political machine, who eventually rises to governor of his state supported by the machine and every interest, Stark originally set out to fight, in the meanwhile ruining the lives of his family &amp; associates. Crawford is very powerful in his role as Stark, delivering a very convincing performance. McCambridge is also excellent as Stark's conniving political aide (and mistress), Ireland effective as the reporter, from whom the story is viewed. Very good direction by Rossen, who turns the likeable Stark, into a despicable fink by the film's end. Sharp editing also by Clark. Nice moral play to watch. Rating, 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politicians corrupt? You're kidding!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are lots of movies about the rise of some obscure person into the celebrity life, and the person turns out to be an ambitious and unscrupulous phony. Some of them are pretty good -- "Citizen Kane," "All About Eve." Some are mediocre -- "Keeper of the Flame." This is one of the best.The acting honors generally go to Broderick Crawford and he's not bad. He's rather like a switch who can toggle either into thoughtful candor or blustering Hickhood. (He used the latter persona to good effect as a New Jersey junk man later.) He also had a third position, the incredibly dumb goof, which he never used after becoming a serious actor, but see, "Larceny, Incorporated" for an example of what I mean.If there's a problem with the script it's not his fault, although it involves his character. Hung over, still a bit drunk, Crawford steps on stage and instead of his usual boring "tax" speech he gives a redneck-rousing go-getter. And he never changes after that. Rather too quick a transition.The direction is very good. There's a scene in which Mercedes McCambridge enters the hotel room in which John Ireland has been cooped up for four days in a depressed state. "Whew, lots of smoke," she says. "And lots of whiskey." The scene is almost perfectly staged, with Ireland crumpled on the bed in the foreground and reaching for his liquor out of the frame, while McCambridge busies herself emptying ash trays in the background and staring at her face in the mirror. "Smallpox," she says. (She's not nearly as attractive as Crawford's new girl friend, JoAnne Dru, nee Joanne Letitia LaCock, a name that could have come straight out of Andy Warhol's Factory.) Everyone's acting is quite up to par. It's John Ireland's best role. He was never Hollwyood-handsome with those squished up eyes, that deep hole between them, and that protruding nose beneath.But the honors really should go to Mercedes McCambridge. Robert Rossen, the director, allows her a few seconds here and there to be unique. When Ireland slaps her face hard, she doesn't cry. She replies with a mixture of contempt and not entirely displeased surprise at having provoked him to violence. And that little speech about smallpox as she compares her face in the mirror to the glamorized portrait of Joanne Dru.I won't go on, I don't think. If you haven't seen this, you really ought to. So should everyone inside the Beltway. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. That's been attributed so often to Lord Acton that I'm beginning to believe he said it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Gutsy After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the King's Men was a gutsy film in its day, and wonder of wonders it still plays this way after all these years. It's probably, with the exception of Beat the Devil, the most ragged film to ever achieve classic status. Directed by Robert Rossen, adapted from a novel by Robert Penn Warren, and strikingly photographed in cinema verite style by Burnett Guffey, it tells the story of the rise and fall of a Huey Long-like politician who starts out as a good guy, if a bit of a bully, and winds up a very bad guy, and even more of a bully, as he takes political control of his state.There are dozens of things wrong with the movie. It feels rushed, as if edited down from a much longer film. The editing creates an uncomfortable, jarring effect that makes it difficult at times not only to watch the movie but to follow it. It has some dreadful acting among many of its major players, while several of the smaller roles are quite well cast with interesting faces, which creates a tantalizing effect, as if the good stuff, the interesting inside dope stuff that we really want to know about, is too hot for the movie to handle, so we have to settle for a glance, a gesture, a heavy overcoat, and draw our conclusions accordingly. There's a cheap look to the film, not only in scenes where things are supposed to look shabby, like ramshackle farmhouses, but in the mansions of the rich and the governor's office. Nor is there much specificity in the movie. In the novel the state was clearly Southern, while in the movie it could just as well be California or Illinois. And the frenetic pace of the film seems tied to the staccato delivery of Broderick Crawford in the leading role, as if Crawford himself had produced, directed and written the movie to fit his personal idiosyncrasies like a glove.As luck would have it, these 'wrong' things make All the King's Men work better than a smoother, fancier, more refined approach could ever have done. Its newsreel intensity makes it feel real. The bad performances by relatively unknown actors likewise gives their characters the effect of being actual people who, after all don't always behave or speak as they ought to. In the unattractive sets we see things that look like life rather than movie life, as rich men's homes are not always pleasing to behold, and state capitals and court houses often have a rundown look. Brod Crawford plays his role as a grade B heavy, with perhaps a scintilla more charm, and his bull-necked King Of Alcatraz style of acting suits his character well; and if one finds Crawford too typically a Hollywood bad guy I recommend the documentary film Point Of Order, in which Sen. Joe McCarthy, with no dramatic training whatsoever, could well be Crawford's soul-mate, or at the very least his brother.Why do these elements work so well in All the King's Men and not in other movies, where a mess is just a mess? I think the political nature of the film made it controversial from the get-go. It probably was severely edited to take out 'offensive' material (i.e. anything that might appear to reflect badly on an actual person). The quick, driving pace gives the film at times the sensibility of a tabloid, certainly not Rossen's intent, but luckily this let's-rip-the-lid-off-of-everything feeling that the movie just naturally has suggests perhaps an even deeper problem at the core of its story than just one crazy man's ambitions gone wild, and as a result the film is in many places suggestive, and seems profound when what lies behind this impression is perhaps a deliberate vagueness on the part of Rosson &amp; Co., which in turn forces the viewer to try to sort things out for himself, using the movie as a series of signposts, and what results is a more profound experience than the film itself: the film one plays in one's mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See? Now why did this need a remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I saw a pretty uninteresting movie, All the King's Men, starring Sean Penn, Jude Law, Anthony Hopkins, and Kate Winslet. I wasn't that impressed and I was embarrassed to see that it was actually a remake, I didn't realize there was another classic out there that had won best picture. But when I saw the remake, I was kinda scared to see this version due to the fact that maybe I was just not into the story, but it turned out to not only be a good film, but a great one that had no need to be a remake almost 60 years later.Willie Stark is a crooked lawyer who decides to run for senator, swearing up and down the people that he is just like them and making crazy promises, he gets elected and finds that it's harder than he realized to keep those promises. Things start to fall apart more and more when his son gets into some serious trouble causing bad press, the people are not satisfied with his duties, and his marriage begins to fall apart as well eventually leading up to a horrific ending to his term when he is threatened with impeachment.All the King's Men, the original, is a great movie that I would recommend for the classic lovers. The remake, trust me, it isn't worth watching, but in some sick way I am grateful for it, because I would have never had the opportunity to see this film. We have terrific performances and a great story that anyone could get into, not to mention the Oscar praise it got was well deserved. Sit back and enjoy the movie, the classics are always worth it.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Test of Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I viewed this film for the first time this past week. It was one of only a few "Best Picture" Oscar winners over the past fifty or sixty years that I had not previously seen. I have found most, but not all, of these films to be absorbing and/or entertaining with the majority deserving of the awards they received. I included this specific film in a personal test that I conducted recently. I initially viewed the current version of this film, which features an impressive cast headed up by Sean Penn, Jude Law, Kate Winslet and Anthony Hopkins. Then I rented this 1949 award winner to compare both versions.I am aware that when you first see a film or program that you find to be an excellent presentation and then you view a newer version of the same entity, the normal tendency is to find the new version not up to the standards of the original due to the unfairly high expectations. For the test conducted, I switched viewing order of the two versions. I anticipated finding the newer version more rewarding due to the more than half century difference in the two presentations and the fact that Sean Penn and Anthony Hopkins have each artistically created several roles which I have found to be top of the line performances. It did not work out that way in this case. I found the 1949 version withstood the test of time and in my opinion was the superior production. This had to do with several factors, the primary one being that the screen play of the older version seemed to be better paced and the presentation flowed more evenly. I believe this version more closely followed the novel and the depiction of the central character "Willie Stark". The novel loosely based this character on real life Louisiana politician "Huey Long". I concluded that the newer version tried to capture more of Longs' character along with his political successes and failures. In doing so it lost some of the novels flow and impact.Both versions have excellent casts and the performances given by both Sean Penn and Broderick Crawford (Oscar winning) as Willie Stark are first rate. I consider this version to be a top 25 all time political drama and gave it an 8 out of 10 IMDb rating, but I would recommend both versions for fans of semi-biographical political dramas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film with Two Spectacular Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every dog has his day. Broderick Crawford (sometimes remembered for the TV series "Highway Patrol") hit the zenith of his career with an Oscar winning performance. As Willie Stark he reeks of the abuse of power we have seen in the year's since. Never again does Crawford turn himself loose in a role that was really written for him. (In Highway Patrol all the chases were shot on private land - Crawford's driving license was revoked for numerous DUI infractions). You can't leave out Mercedes McCambridge. She is the perfect second lead. Her performance is filled with depth. Mercedes is the role model for today's woman. Tough yet filled with compassion. She and Crawford provide sensation entertainment without one frame of CGI. If you haven't seen this film, rent it, buy it or go to a retrospective. Your film going life is incomplete without a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Picture of 1950</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Rossen (The Hustler) had better luck with the story of Louisiana's Governor Huey Long as he managed to capture every Best Director award he was nominated for except the Oscar.The picture did win the Best Picture Award for my birth year, and the acting awards went to Broderick Crawford (Governor Stark/Long) and Mercedes McCambridge.The corruption of power, the sleaziness of the political process, the willingness of people to be used are all explored in this moving film. Again, as in the Hustler, Rossen uses the black and white medium to its full effectiveness as he presents a taut and moving study of the rise of Stark/Long and his downfall."Jack, there's something on everybody. Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption. He passes from the stink of the dydie to the stench of the shroud. There's ALWAYS something."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Still-Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe "All the King's Men" is a bit long in the tooth now, but until "The Godfather" and "Patton" it was the best film ever made!The selection of Broderick Crawford as Willie Stark was gutsy, since Crawford can -at best- have been considered "good". Somehow, though, Crawford did not play Willie Stark - he Was Willie! Much like George C. Scott did not play Patton - he Was Patton.The "you hicks" speech was great. Not until the "Patton" speech was there anything better on film.Essentially, the thing making the film great was watching Willie "grow up" in the sense of casting aside his idealism for power. Turning point is the cemetery scene, when one of the attendees seeks divine forgiveness for not having voted for Willie.The turning moment was not unlike Michael Corelone saying "I'm with you Pop" when the Godfather was in the hospital. Michael did not mean physical proximity, but that he then "bought into" the business.In both cases, the storyline is a reminder about Power and Corruption.Like most movies made from books, there were some changes that did detract from the story (no where in the movie do we learn that the Judge is Jack Burden's father - yet that is so important). Yet, correspondingly, no one can accuse the book of word economy. It is a powerful story, but overly descriptive.Crawford's change of expression - the beginnings of insight - are classic.Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great picture with lasting truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Power corrupts and politics is Power. That's the message of this film. Robert Penn Warren wrote the novel in the 30's, the movie was made in the 40's, and here it is 50 years later and the message is just as true then as it is now. Clinton selling pardons to raise money for his presidential library - and his long line of cheap floosies. Pick another politician, one you don't like, same story.However, this movie has another message, stated by the corrupt politician himself: out of evil comes good. That truth is the only thing that makes Democracy work. Even while Broderick Crawford's character was corrupt, Nixonian corruption ? selling out to protect his own power, he still kept his promises: roads, schools, hospitals. He strong armed and blackmailed but he got them built.Yeah, Democracy is ugly, but no uglier than the human clay it is made out of. As Churchill said, 'Democracy is the worst form of all governments ? except for everything else.' Sadly, 50 years from now someone could again watch this picture and still see their own society mirrored in its images. Thankfully, it will still be a great film with solid performances across the board, fast pacing and good writing. There's no wasted motion in this picture.Hopefully, 50 years from now, good will still come out of evil. However, there is one other truth: if there is too much evil??no good will come out of it. Let's hope there's never too much of it here in America......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although Flawed, This Noir-ish Political Film Is Still Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain subjects that films in general and Hollywood in particular never handled very well--and chief among them are politics. But even some fifty years after it first hit theatre screens, ALL THE KING'S MEN still has plenty of power. Filmed in a "noir" style and based on the famous novel which was in turn based loosely on the rise and fall of Louisiana's Huey P. Long, the film offers the story of Willie Stark, a small-town lawyer who is nominated for governor by a political party seeking to defeat their opponent by dividing the rural vote. When Willie gets wise to the plot he turns on his false benefactors and rockets to political power--but once in power the honest small-town-joe becomes even more corrupt than those who sought to manipulate him for their own gain.Broderick Crawford justly earned an Oscar for his performance as Willie Stark, whose ego and thirst for power grows to horrific proportions--and whose corruption gradually taints even the most honorable people around him. The supporting cast of John Ireland, Joanne Dru, Anne Seymour, and Walter Burke (to name but a few) is also quite good. But the real knockout here is actress Mercedes McCambridge as Willie Stark's hard-edged assistant and sometimes lover; it is an astonishing performance which, in spite of its supporting status, remains locked in mind long after the film ends, a role for which McCambridge won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress.The script doesn't really do full justice to Warren's novel, the film is a bit slow to start, and the story itself feels a bit dry in the telling--but the performances and numerous memorable scenes carry it through to tremendous effect. ALL THE KING'S MEN is so explicit in its portrait of how corrupt politicians manipulate the public that it should be required viewing for every one of voting age. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

Crawford played ( Willie Stark),"The Vulture",'67, who set out to become a governor and promised the working people everything that they ever wanted. Willie's big project was a hospital that would meet the needs of everyone that needed help and free of hospital fees. This film also has great character actors who went on to be come big names on the Silver Screen in Hollywood.

		<shortDescription>Smearing the American way of life my a--</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to what John Wayne claimed when he read the script, "All the King's Men" is not smearing the American way of life. What it's doing is showing the unfortunate reality of our political system, as idealistic lawyer Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford) runs for governor on a populist platform but falls prey to corruption once in office. Watching the movie, one can feel the tension between the various parties involved in the events portrayed, especially as Willie becomes just like the people whom he previously condemned, covering up misdeeds and granting favors to cronies.If this seems like it mirrors current events, it shouldn't be any surprise. Of course, these sorts of things are nothing new, as "ATKM" was based on the career of Huey Long. I would actually say that the president who most represents Willie Stark is Bill Clinton, who had good ideas but sold out.Anyway, this is a movie that I recommend. Also starring Joanne Dru, Mercedes McCambridge and John Derek. I as yet haven't seen last year's remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Rossen does a great job directing this movie. But he did an even better job in a literate and crisp screenplay that brings the characters springing to life even better than they jumped off the pages in Robert Penn Warren's book. Rossen captures the essence of each character adroitly with concise yet revealing dialogue. Beyond Rossen's heroic exploits, the most memorable aspect of the film is the wealth of memorable performances. Broderick Crawford deserved his Oscar and then some for his charismatic turn of the well-meaning-hick-turned megalomaniac governor. Anne Seymour is quietly perfect as his wife. And Mercedes McCambridge nearly steals the film, giving one of the best supporting actress performances --- EVER. John Ireland totally captures the sophistry and spinelessness of the erudite yet ineffective Jack Burden. Other excellent performances are turned in by Shepard Strudwick, Joanne Dru, John Derek, and Will Wright.All in all, this is a great piece of American filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willie Stark is an upstanding pillar of the community, when he is coaxed into standing in the local election he gets a first for politics. As he progresses thru the political ranks he loses sight of the very things that he first stood for, with him, and all those associated with him getting muddier by the day.Adapted by Robert Rossen {director and screenplay} from the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Robert Penn Warren, All The King's Men is the story about the rise and fall of a rotten politician. Almost certainly based on Louisiana Governor, Huey Pierce Long, it's a towering piece of work that is as politically cynical as it is ego centric-ally human. Not merely just another film about "when good guys go bad", this picture serves notice to the many things that drives politics on, for better or worse. The role of the press is under scrutiny for example, and just how come simple things such as rallies can be staged by some conniving aide sitting at the back? All roads in this gritty piece are paved with suspicious looking stones, the very foundations of which have been murkily formed.It's a testament to Rossen and his excellent cast that All The King's Men is still as potent today as it obviously was back at the tail end of the 40s. Every once in a while a similarly themed film will come our way, but few, if any, can boast the hard hitting realism that seams throughout Rossen's film. Helped by location shooting at run down Stockton in California, and boosted by a powerhouse performance from Broderick Crawford as Stark, this film most definitely is a hallmark in the political genre. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, it won three in the main categories, Best Actor {Crawford}, Best Picture {rightly} and Best Supporting Actress {Mercedes McCambridge with an incredible debut performance}. Excellent. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie and don't compare it to a more modern film. This was made in 1949! Movies are going to improve with time like most anything. But time doesn't have to impact dialogue. This was a very well written movie and it shows a more sophistication that today's flics. There is no security of special effects to rely on.Crawford was magnificent in this move...any other opinion is misguided. It was a perfect cast. I think the other credits were overplayed...they were good, but not Oscar worthy. Crawford was the main man here.I am amazed this was made in '49 and love to visit life way before I was born. People don't change and the heart remains the same, be it 2005 or 1949.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Broderick Crawford's performance as Willie Stark stands alone in my mind as the most powerful lead actor performance ever. His transformation and psyche are amazing. John Ireland is equally transfixing as his more intelligent but weak-backboned friend. Shepherd Strudwick, Anne Seymour, John Derek, Joanne Dru, and Will wright are also magnificent. But, Mercedes MacCambridge's discarded kingmaker is probably the most spellbinding of the bunch. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Multi-Oscar winner ahead of it's time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Robert Rossen filmed Robert Penn Warren's brilliant political drama back in 1949, he had no idea that how it would turn out. He had a cast of unknowns led by Broderick Crawford who prior to that was usually playing big blustery heavies on the screen. But Crawford, sensing this could be his watershed part , threw himself into the character of Willie Stark(based on real life Huey Long).What emerged was a full dimensional portrait of what began as an honest politician who rose up from itenerance and poverty to become a currupt political leader elected governor of his state and had it not been for an assassin's bullet, could have run for president.Crawford makes Stark's transition from country hick to Machine boss believable. He shines in a scene where he learns he is being used to split the hick vote, and instead of speaking the party line he gives an emotional rallyng cry. the rally gave Stark his stepping stone into the big arena.Similarly, the role of Willie Stark gave Crawford his jump to stardom. He richly deserved the best actor Oscar he won. While he was the focal point of the film(and an Oscar winner as well) he was supported by Mercedes McCambridge, herself an unknown who also won an Academy Award for best supporting Actress. Her interpertation of Sadie Burke the hard boiled assistant is right on the mark. John Ireland who never got credit for being as good an actor as he was made a good Jack Burden, a man trying to escape from his wealth but never succeeding. Ireland was nominated for an Oscar as well. Finally Joanne Dru, married to Ireland at the time , was Ann Stanton, the antithesis of Sadie, and one of the many illicit flings in Stark's life.While the success of "All The King's Men" was a major surprise, what has become even more amazing is the fact that a half a century later the story and plot is still topical.One has to wonder if the 1970s political thriller "All The President's Men" owes more than just it's titular resemblance to this film. In fact it is just a more sophisticated retelling of the story of a longtime incurable disease called Politics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City reporter John Ireland (as Jack Burden) is sent to cover an unusual small-town campaign for county treasurer. The underdog receiving media attention is populist candidate Broderick Crawford (as William "Willie" Stark), uncommonly known as an "honest politician." Upon arriving, Mr. Ireland finds corrupt local officials threatening to arrest Mr. Crawford, who draws crowds with his campaign speeches. They have Crawford's schoolteacher wife Anne Seymour (as Lucy) fired and beat up his handsome son John Derek (as Tom). Crawford's political career is a certainly a challenge. Ireland would rather be with pretty Joanne Dru (as Anne Stanton), but becomes attached to Crawford...Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1946 novel by Robert Penn Warren, "All the King's Men" has things to say about political corruption that are still relevant, today. The story is very skillfully adapted, by director Robert Rossen. He keeps the narrative flowing briskly and elicits great performances, all around. With many scenes involving multiple characters, the director keeps everyone in place. There are times when Mr. Rossen and crew covey much with three or four players and only a few seconds of silent screen time. Obvious artistic moments strengthen scenes without being too showy; for example, children at a carnival provide chaos as Broderick experiences the aftereffects of alcohol...Sexual and romantic relationships are telegraphed by studying the faces and manners of Ms. Seymour, Ms. Dru and Mercedes McCambridge (as Sadie Burke). You could turn down the sound and gather much information by watching the faces of "All the King's Women". In her first feature film appearance, Ms. McCambridge won most of the year's big "Supporting Actress" awards. She's marvelous, but the story should have had at least one "romantic" scene between McCambridge and Crawford; filmmakers may have felt the two would look unappealing together, and may have cut love scenes somewhere during the process. Crawford was clearly the year's consensus "Best Actor" winner...The often misplaced, but most coveted, "Academy Award" for Rossen was as "Best Picture" producer rather than director. "Oscar" nominated Ireland as "Supporting Actor" and he very likely outperformed that group, but he lost; it's just as well, Ireland is one of two leading, not supporting, performers in "All the King's Men". Others in the cast to keep an eye on include doctor Shepperd Strudwick (as Adam Stanton) and devoted Walter Burke (as Sugar Boy). The film makes a strong case for incorporating an "ensemble" acting award. To spite the strong effort and acting impressions, the characterizations are sketchy and secondary; the main characters are politics and corruption.********* All the King's Men (11/8/49) Robert Rossen ~ Broderick Crawford, John Ireland, Mercedes McCambridge, Joanne Dru</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terrific performances in gritty corrupt politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reporter Jack Burden is sent by his editor to Kanoma County to cover political newcomer Willie Stark. Stark is railing against corrupt officials and is arrested by the corrupt police. He is the overwhelming underdog and loses the race for treasurer. He studies law at night to become a lawyer. He rises in fame when he takes on the government for shoddy school construction that killed some children. The governor needs help to win and his handlers pick Stark to split the opposition hick vote. He starts off poorly but eventually becomes a populist who wins it all. In turn, Stark's idealism is corrupted by vanity and greed turning him into yet another corrupt politician.This is a terrific political drama. The acting is terrific from Broderick Crawford in the lead. Mercedes McCambridge is also terrific as political operator Sadie Burke. It takes a gritty dark look at the political system and its inherit corruption. It's also a character study of an idealistic man falling in love with his own persona. It is a long winding story which may be its only minor drawback. However Crawford's magnetic performance shines through.</fullReview>

John Ireland plays newspaper reporter Jack Burden, who is sent to cover Willie, and stays for his whole rise and fall from power. Mercedes MacCambridge(Academy Award winning best supporting actress) plays Sadie Burke, an acerbic woman if ever there was one! Willie at first does challenge the corrupt parties that tried to keep him out, but ends up falling into the same trap of preserving his own power, no matter the cost.Based on the real-life Huey Long, this well-acted and written film pulls few punches in its cynicism, making viewer wonder if politics is inherently corrupt, or it just attracts corrupt people. Story is predictable and obvious to a point, but still just as timely as ever.</fullReview>

No matter how much you want to say it is, and how many links you want to draw, it is not. (Because if it is, they told a completely different story from the reality.)What this actually is, is a story about corruption and power, plain and simple. It may not be true that "everybody wants to rule the world", but many people do. And many are willing to cut corners, take bribes and other dastardly things to help them succeed. Granted, as much as we dislike it, there is a certain amount of this that is politics as usual and may not ever be cleaned up. But then you have guys like Willie Stark who take it beyond the boundaries of good sense...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crawford Finds His Niche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A poor farmer rises to the governorship, but in the process, loses perspective.The movie's a cautionary tale of mixing ego with politics that holds up pretty well, thanks to Crawford's bravura performance. Actually the movie's the best and worst thing to happen to the pudgy actor. The best because it was the role of a lifetime and seemingly one he was born to play; the worst because being an actor of narrow range, he never got anything like it again. Here, however, he dominates the screen like few others in Hollywood annals.Sod-buster Stark's (Crawford) rise to power is convincingly outlined as we watch him huff and puff and bellow louder as the crowds grow. Meanwhile, his political success expands, reaching eventually into the state's old money establishment. What's not so clear is why the well-bred Anne (Dru) switches her affections to the off-putting Stark, especially when he's already married. In fact, the screenplay is spotty in a number of places, probably from having to adapt a large novel to the smaller screen. On the other hand, I can see why itinerant journalist Jack (Ireland) and plain-faced Sadie (McCambridge) are drawn to Stark's growing orbit of political power. Of course, there's the feeling that Jack never fully leaves his conscience behind.As a whole, the movie's a dramatic powerhouse despite the occasional script lapses. Director Rossen makes good use of ordinary folks to flesh out Willie's down home appeal. I guess it's not too surprising that Willie's downfall comes from crossing the state's establishment once too often. But then, what did old money ever do for the "hicks" of the state except allow conditions to deteriorate, giving Willie's populist appeal real impetus. The trouble is that he gets power mad such that state improvements are no longer improvements for the people but symbols of Stark's greater glory.Of course, the movie walked away with a number of Oscars in 1949. I'm not sure, however, that a statuette was the best thing to happen to Crawford's career. Nonetheless, the lesson of Willie Stark remains an enduring one for all levels of government.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willie Stark seems like a man of the people. He is, that is if those people suit his agenda. When first seen, he is running for County Treasurer, having discovered graft that causes a tragedy at an elementary school. When you're discovered to be right about corruption that caused the deaths of innocent children, you are sure to be labeled a hero. He decides to run for governor. But his opponents are ruthless. Then, so is Stark. When the next election comes up, Stark is a shoe-in, and he turns the state around with improvements that win him much popularity. How does he succeed? A little blackmail, a bit of bribery, and LOTS of bullying. That's how. What seemed to be for the good of the people now becomes a lot clearer to the people around him as well as his enemies. Those who oppose him are destroyed: financially, emotionally, brutally. There's rumors of murder, even a suicide. Someone has gotten too big for his britches! That's what this Oscar Winning film is all about-evil motives behind good intentions, and that leads to Dante's Inferno, of course. But before that happens, a lot of people have to suffer, and the people around Governor Stark don't see what their support of him is more destructive than they could possibly imagine. This is only my second viewing of this all-time classic, and my image of Broderick Crawford was as the outwardly bullying Harry Brock in 1950's "Born Yesterday", made right after this won him a deserving Oscar. The difference between Willie and Harry is that you know right from the beginning who Harry Brock is. Controlling, power-hungry, uncouth (to quote Judy Holliday in that movie), and downright brutish. But as Willie, he's a seemingly devoted husband and father, underneath it all, cheating on his wife and pushing his son onto greatness more than his son cares to be pushed. Willie Stark is the greatest liar politics has ever seen...on screen that is. But as they say, you can only fool some of the people some of the time, and it all comes out in the end.John Ireland is excellent as the reporter who leaves his job at the newspaper during Crawford's first run for governor to work for him. He will regret that decision for the remainder of his days as he sees the moral laws he will have to break. Joanne Dru is the sweet daughter of a judge opposed to Stark, but for some reason, she gets involved with him even though she was in love with Ireland. The most unforgettable performance, next to Crawford's, is Oscar Winning Mercedes McCambridge as a cold and calculating secretary to Crawford that is equally as ruthless as her boss. She's also envious, a fact she attributes to the small pox which left her face "hard", while Willie's long-suffering wife (Anne Seymour) has aged gracefully (with a conscience) and Dru is naturally beautiful. Among the smaller roles is Paul Ford in a dramatic part rare in his repertoire.Political dramas have dominated Hollywood history ever since cameras started turning, and the story of corruption, desperation for power over democracy and the destruction of one's own soul in order to get that power is a timeless theme that is as old as time itself. Perhaps people in office should be made to watch films like "All the King's Men", "State of the Union", "Advise and Consent" and "The Best Man" once a year simply to remind them of what their duties really are and to stop serving only those who give them the highest campaign contributions. The film's ending may be a drastic move in order to squelch political abuse, but it is a metaphor for what will happen to one's soul if they continue to follow the same paths as fictional politicians such as Willie Stark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Power doesn't just corrupt, it enables corruption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, although almost sixty years old now, is still interesting today mainly because human nature and thus the fundamentals of American politics haven't changed. What has changed is the average American's cynicism towards the political process, thus rendering this film possibly more interesting today than it was when it was first made. As others have mentioned, this film is based on a novel that was based on the life of Huey P. Long, governor of and then senator from Louisiana. The politician in this film is Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford), who starts out running for local office, but comes up against a corrupt local political machine that quickly shuts him down, even having his wife fired from her teaching job of many years. A few years later the same corrupt political machine is looking at their polling data and realizing that their candidate for governor will lose unless they can split the populist vote. They enlist Stark to run for office as governor, and his flattered pride doesn't allow him to see what their true motives are. Stark gives a few uninspired speeches until Sadie Burke (Mercedes McCambridge) explains to him what is really going on - that he is a patsy in a larger scheme. From that point forward he is a man transformed. He gives fiery speeches that rile up the people and almost actually wins the race. However, four years later he returns and does win. In order to do so, he has to "make some deals" with some moneyed interests. He starts out using power to help the common people of the state, but in the end he is helping the common people of the state just because he wants power, making sure that everything accomplished by his administration comes complete with a large landmark bearing his name to assure his legacy. His misdeeds in office - both professional and personal - escalate until they become even too large for him to cover up, leading to his ultimate downfall.The one character I found somewhat hard to understand was that of Jack Burden (John Ireland). He starts out covering Stark's story because he is assigned to do so by the newspaper for which he is working. He has such high ideals that he even quits the paper when his boss tells him that the state political machine no longer wants Stark's race covered. However, long after it is obvious what Stark has turned into, even after he knows that Stark has rewarded his friendship and loyalty by taking the girl he loves, Burden remains by his side. It takes Stark indirectly causing the death of Burden's long time mentor before he finally walks away.There have been plenty of movies made about how power corrupts otherwise good men, but in this film there is more than a hint that Stark was never actually a good man. He was just a man who wasn't in a position to be corrupt until power gave him an opportunity to do so. In the sixty years since this film was made we've seen offenses committed by Presidents of both parties that leave the average man wondering "What WERE they thinking?". However, in order to reach the top of the political heap, you probably need to possess a tendency for risk taking along with a great deal of self-confidence, just as Stark had, and these traits can be your enemies as well as your friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the King's Men (1949)The reference to Humpty Dumpty isn't lost here--the hero, a likable protagonist headed for a fall, is the egg, the egg who would be king. We, the people, are the king's men. And all of this is not fantasy, but a fantastical version of the real Huey Long story, the governor and then senator who didn't exactly fall to pieces, but who became a troubling despot of a democratic sort.Long was a come-from-nowhere governor of Louisiana just as the Depression began. His motto: every man a king. Widely admired and hated to this day, he makes natural movie material, and this 1949 version focuses on just that main thread of gutsy idealism and bald powermongering. And the connection between the two, which is a kind of megalomaniacal ego, a charisma borne of blindness (which people admire because it seems so honest), and raw energy. The later movie (2006) is painfully strained and full of itself, and I'd avoid it completely. This one is not a masterpiece, but it has a fast pace, a lot of great acting, and a slightly better sense of authenticity, enough to succeed.Key to its success is Broderick Crawford, whose acting lifts a mundane (if smart) kind of filming to a higher pitch. Director Robert Rossen is totally in control, however, and if there is little magic to the writing or the construction of the film, in film-making terms, the story is told with such compact force, all you notice is Crawford and the twisting turns of events.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When things go a certain way we often can only sit back and observe. Our senses take in History being made around us. We often have trouble believing what we see; yet cannot deny even the strangest of occurrences.It is human nature to seek explanations, to clear up any mystery and to make sense of the incomprehensible. When we've taken our logical and analytical processes along to the Nth degree, we begin to get to the suppositional hormones going in high gear. This leads, of course, to a multitude of sundry conjecture, theories, hypothesis, conjecture, supposition and downright speculatin'.This "what if" approach so often leads us along the road toward the real truth we seek. It is also the process that leads us to certain "biographical" film stories. Some good examples of biographies, heavy on the theory passing as fact are: Norman Jewison's THE HURRICANE (1999) starring Denzel Washington as Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter and Oliver Stone's star-studded blockbuster (and in this writer's opinion, "B.S. Fest Supreme) JFK (1991).The next step along the cinematically evolutionary line is that of fiction, which is not strict fiction. In it all the names have been changed, not to "protect the innocent"; but rather to "prevent the lawsuit." These most usually prominently display, in extra large print, the obligatory disclaimer of "This story is fictional. Any similarity to any persons, living or dead, is not intended nor should be inferred."* As examples of this, we see the obvious such as the Mini Series WASHINGTON: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS (Paramount TV / ABC TV Network, 1977) and Director Mike Nichols PRIMARY COLORS (1998) featuring John Travolta, Emma Thompson, et al, as a thinly disguised Bill, Hillary &amp; company.Of course, THE Greatest American, Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE (Mercury Theatre/RKO Radio Pictures, 1941) also fits into this, among other categories. Though Mr. Welles and RKO denied it was the story of Tycoon Newspaper Publisher, William Randolph Hearst, there were more than a few similarities.** This rather extended introduction now brings us down to (or 'up to' in the Southern Hemisphere) today's featured film review ALL THE KING'S MEN (Columbia Pictures, 1949).To start with, Director Robert Rossen had a very distinguished career as a Screen Writer and Director; having done John Garfield's starring vehicle, BODY AND SOUL (1947 director only) Dick Powell in the excellent Film Noir, JOHNNY O'CLOCK (1947 writer &amp; director) and writer/director of THE HUSTLER (1961) with Paul Newman, Piper Laurie, Jackie Gleason, George C. Scott, etc.Mr. Rossman took the Robert Penn Warren epic American Novel of the Governor Huey Long-like Willie Stark and transformed its dark, unpleasant aspects so well to the silver screen. (it was in b&amp;w, much like Columbia's 3 Stooges Comedies!) The story had become more and more familiar as it became required reading in both Civics and Literature Classes in both Prep Schools &amp; College levels. (I can personally testify to the veracity of this, as we had it assigned by Mr. Bamberger for Senior Civics at St. Rita High School in Chicago in '64; as well as in a Lit Class with Dr. Sauer at Chicago State University, '68.) OUR STORY??.Country Bumpkin, Willie Stark is tricked into running as an opposition candidate in a primary election. During a speaking engagement he suddenly realizes his candidacy has been an exploitation by Party Big Wigs; Stark explodes into a most captivating impromptu "Listen, Hick?.you're a hick and I'm a hick" speech. The next time out the big shots get him for real; fully realizing that Stark's ability as a demagogue could be most useful to the Party (in real life, Louisiana, it would be the Democrats, just as in my native Chicago.).The Political Bosses may have discovered Willie's talents in public speaking; but they surely underestimated his other abilities and, more importantly, his ambitions; as Willie Stark rises to the very top as Boss of all Political Bosses. After a term as Governor, he continued to gain power, running the State Legislature with an Iron Fist; gaining influence and out and out control through political dealing, intimidation and even blackmail.All the time, his pet projects were the road &amp; bridge construction, a super-hospital and the University (where his son (John Derek) excelled in football, until a drunken vehicular homicide of a female companion. This, and the Girl's father's murder, led to the impeachment of Governor Stark.Stark wins, by using intimidation of hoards of his "hick" supporters; who had encircled the State Capitol Building as his "Ace in the Hole". Almost immediately, Willie Stark is fatally shot by Adam Stanton (Shepperd Studwick) the Doctor in charge of the yet unbuilt hospital. THE END The story is propelled forward by Stark's rapid rise and his methods of drawing people into his circle of power, his Cabal, if you will. We see Anne Stanton (Joanne Dru) as the blue-blood Lady, who becomes Stark's mistress (Political Groupie), Jack Burden (John Ireland) as Newspaperman turned Press Secretary and Official Blackmailer, his footballer Son, Tom (John Derek), Sadie Burke (Mercedes McCambridge) another Political Bimbo, Tiny Duffy (Ralph Dumke) and Mrs.Lucy Stark (Anne Seymour).The Black &amp; White photography is put to good use in several ways. From crystal clear, to the dark, shadowy &amp; moody to the excellent effect of looking like the use of newsreel film edited in. The scenes of his "Army of Supporters" at first look like this, but extended close-up shots of supporters' bearing "Free Willie" signs prove otherwise.NOTE: * It seems that the greater the disclaimer, the more the story IS actually based on a real incident. NBC's "LAW &amp; ORDER" is my prime example. NOTE: ** As an additional protection, Mr. Welles and co-scripter, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, add a line of dialogue where the newsreel boss (Phillip Van Zandt) mentions that "the guy on the screen could have been several other real people", including "Hearst"!

		<shortDescription>Power Corrupts! Absolute Power corrupts Absolutely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willie Stark is a county politician. He starts his career as fierce anti-corruption, anti-establishment, pro-people kind of platform. As he climbs the ladder of success and power he keeps changing his face which his friends and well wishers cant recognize.The narration of the film is from the point of view a journalist, Jack Burden. Jack follows Willie from the county days politics and likes him for his principle and 'dare to fight' personality. Jack is a rebel from an affluent political family and so connects with Willie automatically . As Willie becomes more and more successful Jack distances himself from Willie's mainstream politics but he remains connected. I loved this angle of the film. All the characters in the film who even if starts disliking Willie don't severe their relationship with him. I think thats a very interesting aspect of success. Successful people are not that easy to get rid of. I have not read the novel but I think this movie sends the message home. This movie is based on a simple and bitter truth 'Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely'. This film reminds me of Stalin and Mao. Mao walked thousands of miles and nearly lost his life in the revolution and then became a dictator by the end of his career. Same goes for Stalin. Hiler broke his collar bone in a campaign and got jailed and nearly executed and ended up killing thousands of Germans(not Jews) to keep himself in power. I think that's what differentiates communism from democracy. Absolute power. Leaders like Gorbachev are hard to come by who in a way dissolve their powers. This movie is brilliant and handles the issue very intelligently. The film does not show Willie's state of mind. It shows the state of mind of the people around him. In a way its interesting and definitely enough to write a book on and make a film about. It is so fascinating to watch rise of an honest man only to be grabbed by corruption and crime. Although the genre of the film is 'film-noir' it still has a dramatic value to it which reminds you of Citizen Kane. I think this movie is better than Citizen Kane for two reasons. This is a better narration and Broderick Crawford is much better an actor than Welles. Though I must say end of the film was a little unreal. Broderick Crawford as Willie is definitely Oscar winner performer. He gave a terrific performance in 'IL Bidone' too. John Ireland is good. His mannerism changes from his first meeting with Willie until the end which I think is very difficult to do. This is one aspect of acting which mostly only great actors can maintain. Great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Story &amp; A Fine Performance By Crawford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good story and a fine performance by Broderick Crawford make "All the King's Men" one of the most worthwhile of American political movies. The story is interesting, and it also provides some pertinent observations about politics. Although it is loosely based on (or at least motivated by) the career of one particular politician, the story and the characters would be believable in almost any era.Crawford is a big part of why this works as well as it does. He is very believable at each stage of his character's career, and his portrayal of Willie Stark not only brings this particular character to life, but also says a lot about what political considerations can do to a person's character. The other characters are defined almost exclusively in terms of their relations with or responses to Willie, but each are used very well. Mercedes McCambridge and John Ireland deserve particular recognition for the way that they interact with Crawford. Their varying reactions to the changes in Willie and his methods again offer much to think about, without becoming heavy-handed the way that so many political movies do. All of it also makes for some interesting drama that is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Goes Beyond How Power Corrupts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shows very well how people are willing to overlook the bad as long as they are taken care of. The people kept Willie Stark in power because they were prospering. Willie built hospitals, schools, roads. People benefited. Therefore they tended (there are always a few who try to point out the problems) to ignore the corruption behind the prosperity. How often we still see that today. As long as "I don't suffer," as long as "I am doing OK," then morality can be ignored.How often we see that today. Yet in the end we pay a price-in the end Willie Stark paid a price.As long as we are prosperous few care about what is happening "behind the scenes." Ann Stanton paid a price, Judge Stanton paid a price. A very good movie with a very good, well written, tight story. A movie that is good on two levels, a story to enjoy and a story to learn from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A political drama ahead of its time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a film that is so prophetic and appropriate for our country's political situation right now, it is almost scary. It was released 50 years ago, and its has not lost a drop of impact. True, we've seen this kind of movie before, especially in recent times, depicting the rise and fall of a politician. I rank this movie alongside Oliver Stone's NIXON, as well as Mike Nichol's take on Bill Clinton, PRIMARY COLORS. Art definitely imitates life in this fictional account of a political fat-cat who becomes governor of an unnamed state, then destroys the lives of every person around him as his career slowly falls apart.Willie Stark, supposedly based on the real-life political antics of Huey Long, is the epitome of abuse of power. The first portion of the film shows Stark, played with authority by Oscar-Winner Broderick Crawford, being used as a guinea pig to take the "hick" vote from the opponent of the incumbent. Stark, in a drunken rage, speaks to the people at a gathering and reveals what is happening. He, in essence, wins the confidence of the "hicks", which then spreads throughout the state.The film takes off at this point. Ugly deals are made, people are bribed, enemies bumped off, and Stark is, you guessed it, a womanizer. His wife becomes a mere figure-head while Stark sows his oats. The supporting cast is fine in portraying the people he passes over and sells out for his own good. I'm quite sure this is true in modern-day Washington, as we are currently witnessing. No matter what you think of the Clinton administration, you can draw your own conclusions as to the significance of the movie. You can't help seeing the parallels between fiction and reality. Kennedy, Nixon, and Clinton's stories are weaved together BEFORE they happened, which makes the film all the more important.Crawford is very impressive as the booming and imposing Willie Stark and the film's look and pace is great. Director Robert Rossen, who would later direct THE HUSTLER, should have made have made more classics for us to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Convoluted And Very Talky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Oscar best picture leaves me wondering about the Academy's voters. There were several more deserving films than this."All The King's Men" is the convoluted story of Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford), a man who starts out in politics with good intentions, but who later becomes corrupted by power. The story shows how a populist leader can morph into a dictator. The film is humorless, cynical, and very, very talky.With his New York accent, Crawford is not at all convincing as a political hero for backwoods, hick Americans. And who would vote for someone so lacking in charisma and charm? But then none of the characters in this bleak film are sympathetic. Everything about it is spiritless, cheerless, pungent, and mocking.The story spans a long period of time. That's okay, but it makes for shallow characterizations of secondary characters. The film's plotting has a jerky, discordant quality consistent with a film that has been extensively edited.Acting is average, and not at all inspiring. John Ireland is so lifeless he seems to be sleepwalking through his role.The B&amp;W cinematography is not bad. But there's nothing special in the visuals, which are largely overridden by a script that is dialogue driven.The film's only strength is the story's theme: voters are gullible and easily manipulated. That, in the sixty years since this film was made, is a message that would seem to be timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Political drama about corruption in politics...but did it deserve Best Picture Oscar???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ALL THE KING'S MEN is certainly a well acted political melodrama from a novel by Robert Penn Warren and BRODERICK CRAWFORD is an ideal candidate for the role of Willy Stark (based vaguely on Huey Long), but I never thought it deserved to win the Oscar for Best Film of the Year. In my opinion, that award should have gone to William Wyler's masterpiece, THE HEIRESS, a film whose reputation increased over the years while ATKM's has diminished.But putting personal preferences aside, ALL THE KING'S MEN is a riveting drama peppered with some fine performances, including JOHN IRELAND who serves as onlooker and narrator of the tale and MERCEDES McCAMBRIDGE as the cynical Sadie who won a Best Actress Supporting Role Oscar for her work.Stories of political corruption are nothing new--such material having been handled previously in stories like STATE OF THE UNION and bios like "Wilson" and "Tennessee Johnson", but never with such searing intensity. It begins with an awareness that Willy Stark is a man who wants the truth to be told in a world of dirty politics. John Ireland is the crusading reporter who is on his side in the belief that the man seeking office is an honest man. Ireland also takes time out for a brief romance with JOANNE DRU while the saga of Willie gets put aside for a brief time, but Dru later becomes Stark's mistress.Willie evolves from a green campaigner to a man who starts making deals and learns the rules of the game. After a couple of failed campaigns, he becomes a winner and presents himself as the champion of the people.But as times goes, and montage after montage shows us Willie's progress as a champion of the mob, we hear John Ireland's narration saying: "His little black book was a record of sin and corruption." In other words, there's nothing subtle about this tale. It's laid out in pretty direct terms for the viewers to deal with with no particular insight into the power of corruption.Technically speaking there are problems with the editing. Scenes are cut abruptly short with quick fade-outs as though someone censored parts of the story, and motivations of the quirky McCambridge character are not clearly spelled out at all nor is the romantic relationship with Joanne Dru. Both are glossed over by the script and only hinted at. As a matter of fact, none of the supporting roles--including SHEPPERD STRUDWICK as the man who never trusted Willie from the beginning, are really fleshed out in the script. His involvement in the ending comes as somewhat of a surprise.Summing up: Intriguing drama with some technical deficiencies including some choppy editing, but it probably got the award because of its "social significance", at a time when Hollywood was intent on producing such serious, almost documentary films. As for Broderick Crawford, I've liked him much better in other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blustery Oscar Winning Performance from Broderick Crawford with support from John Ireland and Mercedes Cambridge (also an Oscar), and garnering the Best Oscar of all, the Best Picture winner, Robert Rossen's Cutting-Edge Political Expose still Cuts it Today.It's a definitive Classic that Transcends Time and its Message is the same, only the Suits have Changed, and the Media. The Movie is Powerful in its display of the Human Condition with the Emphasis on a Flawed System with Flawed People who seem Powerless by the Corrupting Influence.It's Arguable whether this is the Norm or the Acception to the rule, and History can make a Case for both. What is given here is the Dark Side and it is so Dark that some have called this a Film-Noir.The Pace is Frantic and the Characters are Engrossing. The Seedy and Sleazy Story pulls few Punches and Stretches the Limits of the Motion Picture Code. It's Mesmerizing the way the Film Crams the Frame with many People with much Loud and Searing Dialog. The Viewer is Caught Up in the Whirlwind of Leadership Shenanigans, shining the People on while delivering Roads, Hospitals (with free health care, "Not Charity but a Right"), Schools and other Governmental "Gifts" to the People."I'm going to soak the Rich and spread it thin.", says Willie Stark. Overall, a Movie Ahead of its Time and an Acclaimed Picture all around. Disturbing, Downbeat, and all too Real. The few Dated aspects might be hard to Overlook, but Not that hard Considering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Best Picture winner, but a little too light on its feet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All The King's Men won Best Picture back in 1949 and it kind of sums up the format of the distilled half-rousing political Oscar bait type movies we still get today. It's a pretty good film, as are many of the films that followed it, but it's one that could have been great with a bit more boldness and focus. It's a cramped film, and that's a blessing and a curse. It gives it atmosphere, but there's no depth. The frame is always cramped, the film is constantly bombarding you with engaging sequences and the ensemble is bloated. Each are quite entertaining and interesting on their own but its whiplash pace makes something that should hold more weight feel light instead. The ferocious performances from its Oscar winning leads make up for it though and ideally facilitate the melodrama, if not add any dimensions to the characters. Unfortunately the empty lead was a complete waste of space. I'm not sure if he was even necessary. But otherwise, All The King's Men is a very good film about the folly of power, but you can find better in more ambitious and timely classics such as Citizen Kane and Network.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Man's "Citizen Kane"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For any movie buff, the simple thought of putting "All the King's Men" on the same level than "Citizen Kane" is a blasphemy but I'm not afraid to say it: once you see both movies, you realize how much they have in common and how sometimes the humblest "All the King's Men" slightly beats Orson Welles' masterpiece in its portrayal of power's corruptive effect. So, the title might sound derogatory but it's not meant that way."Citizen Kane" was about a man with guts and vision, who got so alienated by his obsession to be the voice of people that he ultimately lost his touch with people and ended up miserably with no connection whatsoever with his cherished past. He was misunderstood, but he had it coming. "All the King's Men" is a character study chronicling the same psychological process but rhyming this time with success, it's about a Southern politician named Willie Stark who never forgot where he came from and never lost his touch, which made him even more dangerous.The story is adapted from a Pulitzer-prize winning novel of the same title written by Robert Penn Warren, and based on the rise and fall of the legendary populist politician Huey Long. The ascension of Willie Stark, played by a mesmerizing Broderick Crawford, is a fictionalization of Long's life and one of the most powerful political movies ever made, for the simple reason that it hasn't lost any of its relevance, as long as politics exist, there will be men like Stark. Yesterday, France was shaken by the victory of French Populist Party in the European elections, politicians acted surprised while they could have seen it coming. Basically, the winners spoke the people's language.It's as simple as that, you've got to put yourself in people's shoes and it's not any politician who can accomplish it. Some see their vocations as something that elevated them above the crowd, they're not leaders but prophets allowing people to embrace their own visions, but men like Willie Stark are within the crowd, not above it. The pivotal moment occurs when after failing attempts to seduce people by talking about fiscal measures and other non-inspirational stuff, good old honest Willie Stark, understands he was the puppet of his own detractors, gets drunk, tears up his paper and enraged by his own anger, gives one of these great roaring speeches tailor-made for the big screen.And the film, directed by Robert Rossen, features the kind of editing the genre requires, crowd close-ups, big headlines, and an unforgettable gallery of flawed characters, starting with the protagonist himself, Willie Stark, who starts out as a nice and honest fellow, struggling to raise his voice, a man of the people, and undeniably for the people, a man revered by the journalist played by John Ireland, but whose rise to power's collateral damage will be a decline of honesty. Power would plant the seeds of a cynical mind. "All the King's Men" starts like a Capra film but ends in a film-noir mood. After World War II, world turned out to be more disillusioned and cynical for "Mr Smith" figures, and it's only voices like Willie Stark's that can be heard.Indeed, good old Ma Joad said 'we're the people', but in 1949, only Stark could make this statement audible, embodying in his huge body and larger-than-life personal those "Grapes of Wrath". And once Stark realized he had a natural charisma and capability to move the crowds, it's like Forrest Gump's braces breaking, the repressed ego finally implodes to the face of the political scene and from respect, the eyes and hearts are fueled with admiration and fear, starring with his titular inner circle, Mercedes McCambridge plays a sort of Jean Hagen-like character, going from antagonist to main counselor, she delivers her first and greatest (rightfully Oscar-winning) performance as a little woman with the toughest heart, venting her lack of seducing appeal in her infatuation with Stark.The rest of the cast includes Joanne Dru as Ireland's girlfriend, she's literally blown away by Stark's appeal and although her performance might be the one aspect of the film I disliked (God, how many times she had to turn her head theatrically!) the twist in her character ?in all the meanings of the words- was quite gutsy and politically incorrect for its time. And there's Broderick Crawford as Stark, in the role of a lifetime, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor. My other favorite performance from him is in Fellini's "Il Bidone" and it's quite ironic and befitting that he played a swindler in the film, while Rossen would also direct another classic and favorite of mine "The Hustler", after all, isn't a politician a kind of hustler with power as the pay-off?But I'm still puzzled with Stark's character (this is how fascinating he is): did he turn into a bad guy or was he prone to corruption from the very beginning, it's hard to tell, but some of his insightful thoughts say a lot about his vision of politics: "good comes from evil" "but, who defines evil?" retorts one of the film's reasonable minds. Stark doesn't care, as long as he builds roads, schools, hospitals, as long as he puts his state on the maps, and allow people to stop seeing themselves as hicks, he'll believe in anything he says and does. Tyranny? Dictatorship? Well, we live in a Macchiavellian world where ends justify the means, but as the narrative progresses, we're in the eye of the tornado and can't see if power is an end or a mean for Stark.And maybe this is the power of "All the King's Men", Best Picture winner in 1950, a powerful film about power ? even more because it has the kind of straight-forward appeal as if it deliberately embraced the simplicity of the very people targeted by Stark... hence my title as the poor man's "Citizen Kane".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an entertaining political soap opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Academy Awards choice for Best Film of 1949 follows naive backwoods reformer Willie Stark (a thickly fictionalized senator Huey Long), picked by a rival candidate for State Governor to "split the hick vote". But when he realizes how he's been used, Stark doesn't just get mad; he gets even, organizing a ruthless political machine that eventually consumes him. Watching Oscar winner Broderick Crawford transform the character from honest do-gooder to populist demagogue is electrifying, but it's a shame this adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize winning novel had to lean so hard on pulp fiction melodrama, beginning with the familiar crutch of voice-over commentary, and from a rather bland protagonist: journalist John Ireland, trapped on the Willie Stark bandwagon. The point is well made and worth repeating: politicians can't use bad money for good deeds without being strangled by all the strings attached, but the message is lost between all the juicy plot twists: a suicide, an assassination, an auto accident crippling the Governor's star quarterback son, so forth and so on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How power and politics corrupts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning by Robert Penn Warren, All the King's Men has a lot going for it. For anyone who is interested in politics and governing then you will like this film, but there is also the themes about how power and wanting power corrupts and whether a bad man can do good.Jack Burden (John Ireland) is a reporter assigned to cover the election for county treasurer in the rural south (Louisiana in all but name), particularly focused on Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford). Willie is a honest man campaigning to against local corruption but harassed by the local establishment. When he is proved right after a tragic school accident Willie becomes a political powerful and Jack helps his campaign for Governor, from being a patsy to independent candidate and winning the election. But Willie ends up making deals with the people who he campaigned against and becomes more like the people he hated, running campaigns of intimidation and looking for absolute power. But he also invests in the state, building roads, schools and hospitals for the people.As stated the main theme of the film is that power corrupts with how a idealistic man becomes a part of a system, being no different to the previous people. Robert Rossen sets to show this with his direction and writing both the personal drama of how Willie changes and his quest for power and relationships with people to the affects of his policies have a positive affect on the people of the state. Rossen shows how corrupt people effective subvert democracy and freedom of the press at all levels, in what is meant to be the most democratic country in the world, how people or elites who have power are not willing to give it up. All the King's Men not only shows how politics and it's corrupting affects, Rossen shows the person relations, particularly Jack's idealistic believe in Willie having seen him in his early days and see believing in him even when he see what he has done.The acting is excellent throughout the film, with Crawford being the best as the idealistic politician. He spoke with real charisma and was believable, giving real conviction of the role, from being a good man to being a corrupt individual. His voice reminded me of Sam Douglas as Scott Shelby in Heavy Rain. Ireland too is very good, playing a man who wants to believe in something, who has a hostile relationship with his step-dad and hate his own background. Many of the supporting characters well rounded and ably performed.Rossen was a very competent, technical director, giving the audience some good set pieces, from the winning speech and the car clash, to wide shots and few cuts being used which was common for the time. With the amount of material in the film Rossen was able to tell it in a entertaining, fast-paced, tort film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"All the King's Men" is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name by Robert Penn Warren. The story was adapted by the film's director, Robert Rossen, who is perhaps best known today for "The Hustler".The story focuses on the rise of a politician in the U.S. South; a man whose ambition drives him to corruption while his continued appeal keeps him safe from contenders. However, with each new enemy he makes he edges closer to losing it all. It should be noted that the screenplay was nominated for an Oscar.The cast is pretty admirable. Broderick Crawford, in the lead role, took home an Oscar for his performance. Mercedes McCambridge won a supporting Oscar while John Ireland was nominated as well. The rest of the fairly large cast deliver effective, if unspectacular, performances.Robert Rossen's directorial efforts garnered an Oscar nomination but the most notable visual element for me is the Oscar-nominated editing. The film also sports cinematography from two-time Oscar winner Burnett Guffey. However, I didn't take much notice of that, like the score, which I can recall nothing about.Overall, the film is well made but I would hesitate to rank it among the all-time greats. Nevertheless, of the three Best Picture-nominated films that I've seen ("Twelve O'Clock High" &amp; "Battleground" are the others) I think that this is the best of the lot, so the Best Picture win seems justified.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a story - Terrific. As a movie - fading into obscurity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this movie many times over the past forty years and with changing opinion each time. There are some wonderful scenes that are tightly written, well-staged, and wonderfully acted, and they add tremendous color and life to the cinematization of a Great American Novel, but as years go by, my respect for the movie as art has diminished. Perhaps in its day, ATKM was a spectacular accomplishment, but I find it nowadays stiff and somewhat disjointed. The problem with trying to make a great book into a movie is that just cobbling the great parts out of the book together doesn't make the movie great. The Robert Penn Warren novel was extraordinarily complex and carefully paced to followed a dumb hick from the cotton fields to the pinnacle (and abuse) of power, but the movie tries to cram the entire story into the standard Hollywood two hours, and to do that, it has to lurch from high point to high point, like climbing all the Colorado Rocky Mountains by trying to hop from one fourteener to another. It just doesn't work. It's tough making a movie from a great book because lovers of the book like me will criticize it because it doesn't meet our expectations of the novel. "All The King's Men" as a book has aged like oak-casked whiskey; as a movie, the cork has leaked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Should really have been called "All The Kingfish's Men" so close does this searing political drama sail to the life of populist messiah / corrupt nepotist Huey Kingfish Long, just as Cagney's near contemporary "A Lion Is In The Streets" also did. I've seen both now and there's no doubt in my mind that Robert Rossen's Oscar winning feature takes the laurels.A little knowledge of Long's eventful life and death certainly informs some of the action but the film's allegorical points transcend time and place - corruption and nepotism are as alive and well in the present day political world as they ever were 60 years ago - just think of the recent MP expenses scandal in the UK for this year's model.The movie shares its narrative structure with "Citizen Kane" (if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best!), using an investigative newsman Jack Burden (John Ireland) to shed light on the rise and fall of "everyman" Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford), only from a contemporary rather than retrospective viewpoint. This gives the film added urgency as we await the next, usually sordid, plot development as Stark's rise up the greasy pole sees him simultaneously plumb the depths of corruption and indeed barbarity (at its worst, taking in the murder of the father of a young girl who was killed in a car driven drunkenly by Stark's stepson played by a young John Derek).Crawford is superb as the hick from the sticks who once he learns law and the tricks of the political game, rises meteorically on the wave of his populist appeal to be State Governor, only at that point to fall victim to the temptations of power and turn into a tyrannical despot, womanising adulterer, bullying father, devious blackmailer, murdering overlord and an alcoholic to boot. All this however is contrasted with Stark's "achievements" to show just how he kept the electorate on-side for so long, but even as he's building schools, hospitals and roads (all with his imprimatur) it's obvious that beneath his light suit beats a dark heart. The companion story of John Ireland's aptly-named reporter Burden's involvement with Stark does seem a little contrived particularly given his connections to people that Stark will later use, abuse and destroy and occasionally gets a little in the way of juggernaut Stark's story, which is the real deal here. I do feel therefore that the film could have done without the device of Burden's viewpoint being the primary one utilised, although Ireland plays his part as the ultimately disaffected hero-worshipper with pathos and skill. There's no question though that this is Crawford's film as he traces his character's relentless development with absolute conviction. Thus Stark's parabolic curve from country dreamer to town-hall schemer is rendered at all times believable. In the background are other fine performances particularly Meredith McCambridge as what we'd now call a spin doctor who crosses the house to join forces with the coming man but who gets burned up in the great man's womanising orbit. I was also impressed with the actor (uncredited, from what I can see) in a small but crucial role as the grieving father mentioned above, who with nothing left to lose, tells Stark the unvarnished truth about himself and sums up the loss of faith in Stark as "man of the people".The movie moves to a dramatic conclusion taking in along the way, murder, suicide, adultery, blackmail and assassination, yet telescoped all together into the narrative never overpower the reality of what we're witnessing. Director Rossen keeps the narrative always moving forward, handling the crowd scenes expertly and cleverly inserting a number of montage sequences to highlight the contemporary newsreel feel of the whole movie.Rightly celebrated as one of the best ever political thrillers to come out of Hollywood, its achievement is all the more remarkable given the background in Tinseltown of the Hollywood Blacklist threat - no wonder John Wayne reportedly returned the script to Rossen in disgust at this all too believable desecration of the American Dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the 2008 Presidential election turning out the way it has, I think this movie has more in common with America's current mindset than any other. Here we have a public servant elected for his spiel and jargon-filled rhetoric whereby he associates himself with "the people," who becomes disenchanted with politics quickly, and allows himself to become corrupted by power, influence, and financial freedoms he had otherwise never experienced.We now have a president who was elected under the same terms, associated in the same way, and who has never done anything even remotely similar to running our country.That not withstanding, I found the lovely performances to be riveting, especially that of John Ireland as Jack Burden and Mercedes McCambridge as Sadie Burke. This movie succeeds in demonstrating adequately how quickly and thoroughly even the most bright-eyed idealist can become disenfranchised with those high ideals, and sucked into the moral vacuum that is Washington's underground.It rates a 7.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 2/22/2008, 6 out of 10(Dir-Robert Rossen): Well played political drama about a southern man, played by Broderick Crawford, who decides that he is going to speak for the common folk(called "the Hicks" initially). He starts stirring up crowds by telling them the wrongs that are being done with the current administration and that he wants to clean it up for everyone while he is running for Treasurer in his local area. The state papers get word of this man's stirrings and sends a reporter, played by John Ireland, in to find out more. This reporter gets attached to the politician, likes his ideas and eventually leaves his job to be his aide. The reporter's family provides a lot in the area of political tradition for the state, but Crawford's character is posed to stir things up and the break the norm, which causes some interesting conflicts. He initially loses his political battles in the elections, but increasingly gains followers to the point of being elected to the Governship. He learns that he has to play dirty to win, including having his aide put together a black book with issues surrounding current politicians and it becomes his aide's agenda to bring down those in power that don't follow his ideals. When the aides family becomes the target, the aides loyalty starts to squeue and he begins questioning the Governor's tactics. The movie is played skillfully by all involved and the subject, although dated, hits at the heart of corruption and it's affects. This was the Oscar winning picture in 1949, which included awards for Crawford and a supporting actress award for Mercedes McCambridge, who is an in-and-out aide for Crawford's character. The good story and the acting keeps the audience interested to the very end, which usually is enough for me to recommend a movie, so this is what I've done. There is enough here that even makes me want to watch it again, so that's a plus as well in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great story about how power corrupts. Broderick Crawford gives a powerhouse performance of a bully politician whose ends always justify the means. He calls upon the 'power of the people" as his justifier, all the while caring only of himself.Another review here notes the raggedness of the film. It jumps around in time and space, person to person, event to event. Perhaps that's intentional, but it does give the feeling a lot was given out.I was particularly struck with parallels to the man in the White House today, rallying "the people" then promising them everything. The huge hospital where "the best care free as a right" echoes with Obamacare, particularly when it is noted that the people's health didn't improve once it was built. Sorry, but it couldn't be missed.Two other main actors though really detracted from the story. John Ireland was far too wimpy to be Willy Stark's "hatchet man". Maybe he was another good guy gone bad, but he was simply too passive - particularly when it came to actor (actress) #2 Joanne Dru as his girlfriend and then later Willy's mistress. How she fell for Willy and her boyfriend just letting it happen was a WTH moment. She simply wasn't believable when it all fell apart in the end. (And Ireland's suits never fit him. What's up with that?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Always Nail The Fat Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is very much a period piece. Robert Rosen directs &amp; his direction here is not quite where he was when he would do " The Hustler " later but this is still a solid film. This is Broderick Crawford playing a fictional version of Huey Long known as Willie Stark.While his intentions of getting into politics are good, he winds up selling himself out to accomplish good in the same way everyone who gets elected still does. His one line about nailing the fat guys in a speech is very much reflective of the Obama line of paying all our governments bills by "taxing the rich" which people still bought hook line &amp; sinker in our last election.In this movie, we even find out that even when a politician is a true outsider, once they get inside they become the rich. That is why no matter how much someone calls for "change we can believe in" things never change. In the case of Huey Long, the book this is based upon was obviously not written by one of his biggest fans.Still, this is a worthwhile picture though a bit dated. It has been redone recently with Jude Law in the cast. Guess if I run into that one, I will look at it. Politics don't seem to change, no one is ever all knowledgeable about what is really going down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interested in American Politics? You gotta see this one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not read Robert Penn Warren's novel so my only knowledge is this film that I first saw several years ago and then recently saw again on VHS. In my view, it's good and holds your attention and makes sense. But you'll probably have to find domestic American politics interesting to enjoy it. The old-style movie-making and the side-romances won't be enough to sustain interest otherwise. If you know who Huey Long was - or better George Wallace - or best of all, you know Broderick Crawford's nose and intense voice, then this film will be a gem.I liked the cars in this movie, and the scenes around tables, and the portrayal of ordinary hicks. The politicos always seemed to be taking a swig out of a flask. More seriously, the role of Sadie was more striking than the roles of women in most films today. Find me, in a modern film, a cynical woman who is not self-absorbed.With a different, more sophisticated take on ambiguity, 'Primary Colors' covers similar territory. (The author of Primary Colors clearly copied Warren.) But I appreciated the post-war moral clarity of 'All the King's Men'. Incidentally, the film 'Blaze' with Paul Newman as Earl Long is worth a peek too for fun. Finally, Woodstein's book "All the President's Men" derives its title from this book and film. Curious now? Well, rent, watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good case study of a man and the system</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the kings men was a good case study in how politics often works in today's world, rightly or wrongly. Willie Stark was your average rural Joe in a southern state who didn't like the way that politicians lied to the people. Willie thought that there must be a way to hold political office without all the lies and scandals that go with it. Willie Stark ending up becoming what he had originally campaigned against. This 1949 film shows how little has changed in politics over the last 50 years. It does a good job with the character changes in Willie Stark over time and with the people around him. A pretty good film to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's one thing to come up with a great title and quite another to write a novel that lives up to it and Robert Penn Warren more than succeeded with his Pulitzer Prize winner All The King's Men; it's possible that not too many people in England were aware that Huey Pierce Long was also known as the 'Kingfish' and that one of his most potent slogans was 'every man a king' but even so the notion of a Humpty Dumpty figure falling from a great height and being unmendable was still a great metaphor bearing in mind that the 'men' in question were Long's close circle of powerful friends. Robert Rossen was able to extract the juice of this great novel albeit condensing its richness and he was well served by an exceptional cast from Brod Crawford down; Bilko fans, for example, will relish Paul Ford, albeit uncredited, in a 'straight' role and mediocre actors like John Ireland, Shepherd Strudwick and Joanne Dru (Mrs John Ireland) all did their best work here but ultimately it is Crawford's charismatic role that carries all before it. Don't even consider the trashy remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There was one great film made in the 1940s about American politics: this isn't it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so self-satisfied and intellectually inept that it has to trumpet its quality: 'based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel'; 'written for the screen by'. It is the pretension that is seriously injurious to the film's aims. One wants to love a film from Hollywood's Golden Age that deals with the relationship between American politics and fascism; that has no pleasant or identifiable characters; no redemptive love story; indeed little redemption full stop. But one can't.For a start, the film is visually flat - there is no attempt to describe the film's theme through imagery or film form, just words, words, words. This might seem appropriate in a film profoundly mistrustful of words, but we are given no critical apparatus that would allow us to judge, and the film's meaning is all on the surface. And this is because the film's meaning is trite and cliched.Its insights may have been startling in 1949, but seem obvious today, and have therefore lost their power to shock. Modern audiences can't be expected to sympathise with a work, just because it was new. It has to be the best, and there have been much subtler analyses of power and fascism in America since, especially TOUCH OF EVIL.The film completely lacks the terror of, say, Nabokov's contemporary Bend Sinister, a thinly veiled attack on Soviet oppression, which persistantly challenges, through form, the totalitarian world of the book. The reader is never allowed to passively accept well-meaning homilies, but must struggle for meaning and freedom.This film has given no thought to form at all, so that we get very little real sense of what a fascist America might be like - the characters and plot are too implausible. Twitty fascist-struck Ivy-Leaguers might be fooled, but that's not necessarily everyone. The film borrows a misogyny from DH Lawrence in suggesting that it is especially women who fall heavily for the lure of fascists.The movie it most resembles is CITIZEN KANE. Like all movies, it can only look threadbare in comparison. KANE manages to say more about US politics in five minutes, than this film manages as a whole. It's often forgotten, as we are enthralled by Kane's tragedy, that Boss Jim Gettys, a low-minded, corrupt fascist, gets away with his civic crimes, and is elected to commit new ones. This is a disturbing insight - that fascism is more acceptable than perceived immorality; and that it is impossible in America to raise an alternative to fascism (once liberalism tries to fight the right on its own ground, making use of its bombast and lies, it can only replicate and become the evil) - seemingly throwaway, that ALL THE KING'S MEN can't accept. Although it's named by Humpty Dumpty, it can't give its thesis the full Carrolian spiralling into madness and terror.KANE was made by a man who resembled and understood Kane, who could find within himself Kane's wild extremes of decency and tyranny. ALL THE KING'S MEN is made by a man whose altar ego is a gullible, feckless, upper-class idiot, unable to grasp the nature of the extremes he's supposed to be guiding us through, just veering goldfishlike from adoration to hatred, without once stopping to think. No wonder we don't feel fear.The film's crux is class. In KANE, when Kane takes the podium, he is passionate, convincing, hilarious, on our side, defender of the weak, opponent of oppression and mendacity. He is all charm, his dynamism is infectious. Yet, raised with a silver spoon in his mouth, he can afford to be, and there is something chilling about the Nuremburg-like self-glorification at his election rally. We can understand why he might be popular, while rejecting its basis.ALL THE KING'S MEN doesn't grasp this - not being a pampered magnate like Kane, Willy Stark is a bestial, proletariat mug, as charmless and loathsome as his redneck supporters, suspect from the off, never once emitting sincerity - how anyone could have voted for him is a mystery. (Rossen was blacklisted for being a communist, but there's little attempt to analyse Stark's poverty, the hub of his demons) This failure of personality means that the lure of fascism is unbelievable.The climax is a silly, childish, irresponsible betrayal of all that's gone before, and of the film's so-called politics. We never get a true hint of intitutionalised US fascism, we just have to take the film's word, which is politically dubious in itself.The film's main theme is Oedipal, obsessed with fathers and sons. The hero, Jack Burden, is an aimless, drifting college boy, whose Eden is an undermined refuge of 'honour' against the corruption of modernity, whose father is dead, mother is a lush, and who needs some direction in life. He's always in search of father figures, and he adopts the daddy of them all - Willy Stark.Burden is representative of a lily-livered American population that can't think for itself, needing strong, patriarchal authority figures to take care of things for them, an 'ordinary' people who are mere rhetorical pawns whimsically moved around by undifferentiated demagogues. It says a lot for the film's politics that its Everyman is not a poor 'hick', but an aimless rich boy. He only rejects his 'father' when he steals his girl.The film is as unsubtle and hectoring as the person it tries to criticise - it barely rises above the level of propaganda; it's boringly directed; its dialogue is dated, 'worthy' claptrap; the acting veers from unremarkable to the hollow to the atrocious. Another overrated 'classic'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting picture, a bit underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford) is a big man around town. Rising up from his roots as a local rabble-rouser to become the boss of New Orleans' political engine, Stark goes from being a hoped-for savior to being an even more dangerous and corrupt politician than your normal breed of scum. The whole arc of this is observed by one of his closest friends, the journalist Jack Burden (John Ireland) who helps Stark befriend some of the society people in his family circle.One thing that you can't deny is that this film is chock full of outstanding performances, leading off with Crawford's performance which is the best I've seen him give. Ireland is also very good in this movie, being just interesting enough to watch but not to distract from the film's more obvious dynamic characters. Also in the mix is Mercedes McCambridge, playing a disappointed political operative who harbors obsessive love for Stark that doesn't interfere with her canny political judgment. The relationship between Sadie (McCambridge) and Burden is fascinating and fairly unusual.What I didn't like about the film was how things ended up developing into a fairly predictable, almost deus-ex-machina, type of ending. I would have liked to see something develop which includes the Derek character more. Sheppard Strudwick is a kind of starched screen presence and the events surrounding his character played out like standard melodrama. Having Stark assassinated was kind of a cop out I thought. It avoided the need for the characters to actually take responsibility for what had happened, and instead ties things up with a neat bloody bow.Still, it's a worthy film about politics and would form a good counterpoint to "Born Yesterday" or some of the older Capra films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the King's Men depicts what can happen in America if a despot seizes power.This is just the case as Willie, fantastically played by Broderick Crawford, shows.Willie runs for governor. As a small town hick, uneducated and uncouth, Stark is taught how to read by the lady who he eventually marries, Ann Seymour. Their son is a young John Derek in a memorable performance. Willie loses the race, but exclaims, 4 years later, that this time he knows how to win. Win he does, but corruption ensues.Quickly losing the respect of his wife,his son is paralyzed in a wild car crash. Willie starts drinking and drinking heavily. He will smash anything in his path.When the town judge poses a threat to him, Willie is able to find information that leads the judge to commit suicide.Mercedes McCambridge plays the unbalanced Sadie, a reporter, who becomes close, very close to Gov. Willie.Crawford and McCambridge both won well deserved Oscars. Crawford would win for best actor. McCambridge was voted best supporting actress for her first film. Her win was made even easier by the nature of her rivals for Oscar- the 2 Ethels, Barrymore and Waters for Pinky and Celeste Holm and Elsa Lanchester, both for Come to the Stable.All the King's Men is based upon the life of Louisiana's Huey Long, a man who would have challenged FDR for the Democratic nomination for president in 1936, had he not been assassinated in 1935.This film, with its exciting climax, should be viewed by all to see the impact of demagoguery in the U.S.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good political movie that only comes up short against the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this movie after reading and enjoying the Robert Penn Warren novel on which it was based. As a companion piece to the book the film inevitably disappoints, but taken on its own terms it's a fairly good movie. Both book and film tell the story of Willie Stark, a man who begins as an idealistic, rural lawyer crusading against political corruption in his (unspecified) state, but only gains power after he turns into a cynical demagogue, as seen through the eyes of Jack Burden, the black sheep of a wealthy family, a former reporter, and Stark's right-hand man. The difference is in the emphasis; the book's focus is really on Burden, and his moral development as seen in relation to the polar opposition of the pragmatic, Machiavellian Stark and the unbending, idealistic doctor Adam Stanton. Of course, Burden's moral struggles take place largely in his own mind, and as such don't lend themselves easily to filming. Probably sensibly, the movie chooses to focus mainly on Stark's political rise and moral decline, with Burden's role reduced to more of an audience surrogate than a character in his own right. No one in the cast sounds very Southern, giving the movie a somewhat timeless, disassociated feeling. Still, the filmmakers convincingly evoke a world of back ?country towns and back room politics, with little of the glamor associated with Hollywood films of this period. The performers are excellent, if also fairly vague in terms of background. Broderick Crawford's Stark is convincing both as a naive country lawyer and a cynical demagogue, and John Ireland effectively portrays the moral struggles of Jack Burden. Mercedes McCambridge, who I'd previously seen in the unlikely role of a lesbian Mexican gang member in Touch of Evil, is more ideally cast here as Stark's tough-minded adviser Sadie Burke. Warren claimed that the book was partly inspired by the similarities he saw between Huey Long and Mussolini. Understandably for a post-WWII movie, Rossen's adaptation pumps up the references to fascism and makes Stark a much more clear-cut villain. He has his own private army of black-shirt style, leather jacket-wearing cops, stages a political rally that looks like a small-scale version of Nuremberg, and by the end is even revealed to have ordered an assassination. Unfortunately, Rossen's changes oversimplify the book and greatly reduce the impact of Stark's climatic assassination by Adam Stanton, which Warren intended as a tragic clash of opposites, but becomes here a simple case of a tyrant getting his just deserts. Though the movie tries to deal with the issues of pragmatism versus idealism, it too easily dismisses the representative of idealism out of hand. The novel's Stark was not an admirable man, but he also could not be completely dismissed- by Burden or by the reader- in the context of a state hopelessly mired in corruption. Still, I don't want to completely dismiss the movie, which on its own terms is an effective political drama that successfully captures the smoky back-room atmosphere of old-time American politics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>However, it could not be more inaccurate in portraying the TRUTH about Huey. Go to Huey's speeches on the floor of the U. S. Senate and discover the real Huey P. Long! Huey was notorious for exposing other leading Senators and how they were paid off by big companies and how they catered to the rich and elite. Huey was for the poor and struggling masses who the rich wanted to keep in their place as slaves to their Almighty Dollar Bill. Huey was the greatest man to ever ascend to power. Franklin D. Roosevelt feared him, as well as every other bought off officer of the government. Research Huey Long online and you will learn of his extraordinary accomplishments as governor of Louisiana for only one term. You will soon understand why Huey P. Long was the only governor ever to be assassinated in the U. S. You will see how deadly it is to pull for the poor and go against unbridled wealth!!! If you ever get your hands on the Pulitzer Prize book, Huey P. Long, read it. It will open your eyes to the world of politics, organized power, and how the wealthy are truly in power over all!!!

The film is disjointed and sloppily edited, particularly the early parts. It picks up some momentum later but the plot turns are predictable and melodramatic. Willie is supposed to be a charismatic leader but Crawford is so bombastic and unappealing that it is hard to believe that Dru would fall in love with him. The loyalty of Ireland in light of Crawford's increasingly boorish behavior is also unconvincing.

		<shortDescription>A Waste of Good Source Material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Oscar-winning screen adaptation of the Pulitzer-Prize-winning Robert Penn Warren novel feels oddly truncated, like director Robert Rossen filmed a much longer movie, and then an unqualified editor hacked it down to the movie we see. The pacing is off, scenes feel cut short and much of it is confusing, as if there are elements missing. It doesn't come close to capturing the greatness of the novel, and it's one of the weakest films to win the Best Picture Academy Award from that time period.Broderick Crawford makes a fine Willie Stark, though, I'll give the film that. He's all bluster and hot-headed arrogance, just what the character calls for. John Ireland does fine with the role of Jack Burden, but the character itself is minimized. The book is really more about Jack than Willie, but the film doesn't give Jack much of a character arc, and he feels decidedly supporting. Mercedes McCambridge nabs the role of a lifetime playing Sadie Burke, perhaps one of the most colorful female characters ever put to paper. Here again, the movie doesn't begin to make use of her character like the book does. It uses the elements of her character that are necessary for the plot, but leaves behind everything else---the more human dimensions of Sadie, and her own moral crises, are lost.Overall I thought this was a tepid and forgettable movie based on a landmark and compulsively readable book. If you avoid this one entirely, you won't be missing anything.Grade: C</fullReview>

In its day we overlooked all its shortcomings because it was grand and relevant and seemingly true.That political sweep still resonates. But I suspect that where the film reflected political reality, it and its siblings now create political reality. And thats what makes this worth watching because the focus on the story is politics as theater.Its not just simple theater where an illusion is created that seems real. This is a reality that is drawn out of the viewers. Our huckster literally says you're hicks and I'm a hick too. It is a very clever form of theater that works best in politics. I'm writing this before the 2004 presidential election in the US.One politician in that race (Bush) is a privileged son from New England. Went to Yale. Tapped by Skull and Bones.Yet he affects a Texas drawl and a manner that says, I'm a hick with the implication that I'm you.

"Forrest Gump" actually made a better movie than book, Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" was done very well, even the Harry Potter adaptations are entertaining.But this...this is the biggest insult to an author I have ever seen. And this author happens to be Robert Penn Warren, who not only was a big-time Southern regionalist writer, and did not only win the Pulitzer prize for this novel and two others, and was not only our country's first poet laureate, but wrote a novel with such a great impact on American politics and literature that modern authors are still trying to repeat it (remeber Primary Colors?)Not only does this movie completely stray from more or less ALL of the novel's contents/plot/character developments, etc., but the movie, set in the South--a very important detail when considering what Warren was trying to achieve--does not contain a single actor even TRYING TO FAKE a southern accent, it's horribly miscast, and the dialogue is re-written to make the characters seem vapid and stupid. The pacing is entirely wrong. Key parts of the book are completely neglected in the movie, along with crucial characters. Things are re-written so much that the movie seems to be either what its writer (Rossen) wished the novel was or him just taking the characters and manipulating them as he pleased. Both the writing and the directing are incredibly sloppy.Folks, do yourselves a favor and read the book. Because I can't see anyone enjoying both, and I'm having a harder time seeing how anyone could enjoy this movie.</fullReview>
