		<fullReview>When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish "whodunit" as well. Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as "Del Spooner", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in "Enemy of the State" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, "Independence Day" and "Men in Black". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a "good guy" or not. This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the "camera moving with moving object" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that "I, Robot" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The maker of a film adaptation has three choices. First, he can try to translate the original medium as faithfully as possible, striving as much as possible to preserve the spirit and content of the original while re-imagining the story as a film. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films exemplify this approach. Second, he could instead try to capture the essence of the original, while largely abandoning the particulars of the original, as in the intelligently satirical but hard-hearted film version of Starship Troopers. Third, he can try to do something original with the material, drawing inspiration from the written story, but creating a unique film with a unique vision. I, Robot is more the the third than the first or second. While little remains of Asimov's stories in this killer robot metropolitan fantasy, the film is informed by, and offers no disrespect, to the good Doctor's creations. Will Smith plays a Jack Slater-styled maverick cop. If it's old, it's good.He wears vintage converse, listens to Stevie Wonder, and apparently regards sweet potato pie as a food group. Will Smith's acting is a naturalistic shuffle, a Columbo-like pastiche of mumbling, sarcasm, and unexpected outbursts of charisma and off-balancing interrogation techniques. He delivers his one-liners with unnecessary seriousness. While in Men in Black, he aimed for the ballparks with his power-swinging action-comedy style, here his conscientious style gets in the way, suggesting a character who stands in front of the mirror practicing his zingers like a Tuesday night comic. It's not entirely Smith's fault, as the movie itself can't seem to decide if he's standing in for Bogart or Schwarzenegger, or if the character had a life of his own before the film starts rolling. His performance is intelligent, marred by occasional "Gotcha, suckaz!" moments that remind us that all films made in Hollywood are made in Hollywood. His opposite, Bridget Moynahan, fits her role more surely. She's an ice queen in the classic action movie tradition, a stiff-necked, self-important, lonely woman who has been absorbed by her work so completely she remains a teenager at heart, awkward, vulnerable, and searching for the approval of others. Moynahan's bug-eyed discomfort and clipped, TV-sarcastic delivery are those of the quintessential comedy sidekick. Nonetheless, in rare moments, she invests the character's personal revelations with warmth, doubt, and a glow of determination and moral purpose. While Smith vacillates between supercop and Bogie, Moynahan seems to have found a happy medium between the Saturday matinée and the midnight marathon, a mixture of fun and humanity with a carriage of seriousness appropriate to what is essentially a monster movie.The robot, Sonny, is a character himself, a curious, frightened creature that seems capable of anything. Could Sonny be the murderer? We hope not, and yet, we see the grim possibility that a machine might consider itself more than a human being. We understand Sonny's drive to live and grow. As human beings, we know what lengths we would go to to ensure our survival, whatever the moral charges facing us. A top scientist has been murdered, and there are no human suspects, so the powerful US Robotics corporation (no relation to the modem manufacturers) convinces the powers-that-be to consider his unexpected death a suicide. Spooner (Will Smith) alone searches for the truth of the matter, fueled by hatred for robots and a personal debt to the dead scientist. Dr. Calvin (Moynahan) feels his intrusive investigation is unnecessary, although new pieces of evidence appear that gradually shake her confidence. Robots are programmed by the Three Laws to serve humanity, but Spooner is convinced one of the new NS-5 units, a unique prototype, is the murderer. As Spooner gets deeper to the heart of the mystery, the story explodes with robotic violence. Like all good mysteries, the real question is not "Whodunnit?" but "Why?" The heroes do some things for the wrong reasons, and the villains do some things for the right, rational reasons. Although I, Robot hardly pauses for introspection, it does asks us, "What makes a human being superior to a machine?" There are twists and surprises, although in the end, the movie plays out in the only way it can, a band of brave heroes trying to throw the ring into Mt. Doom while the armies of evil march. And yet, the movie leaves us wanting more. What is the future of humanity? How will we control our machines, and how will we prevent the machines from becoming our masters? While not as ambitious as A.I., it is more successful, and while not as intelligent as Robocop, it is better played. While the movie does suffer from inconsistencies in mood and philosophy, such hiccups are secondary to the emotionality and drive of the film, its fury of thought as well as action. In moments, I, Robot is a terrifying vision of the future. Too few science-fiction movies manage to scare us with the power of technology, but future shock is vital to the science-fiction story. Modern science-fiction truly began with the detonation at White Sands. The Atomic Age has given way to the Digital Age, but we still have not solved the problem of how to wrest the power of technology from the creatures of the id.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clichéd cop thriller crossed with sci-fi but it is noisy, enjoyable fun - all a summer action film should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is the year 2035 and the world has forgotten the lessons we learnt in the 20th Century from films like Bladerunner and Terminator. Robots are the new must have accessory, carrying out menial tasks for households and boosting profits for businesses that have workforces not requiring payment. While this is now the norm, Officer Del Spooner refuses to move with the times and, due to an incident in his past refuses to accept the robots as anything approaching human. When an old friend, Dr Lanning ? head of the robotics company, is found dead everyone suspects suicide but Spooner suspects a robot that flees the crime scene. Despite the robotics company lawyering up, Spooner continues his investigations and, several more malfunctions later, he begins to uncover a much bigger problem with the robots.When the film opens with a flashback scene that cuts to a bitter, old-fashioned cop who dresses like Shaft and don't take no rubbish from his weary captain I immediately started to worry that this would simply be a clichéd cop thriller in fancy clothes and, in some ways, that is what it was. But it is also good fun and, along with Spiderman 2, stands out as one of the best of this years generally disappointing crop of blockbusters. The plot is interesting enough to keep the film going and, although it goes just where you will expect it to if you've seen Terminator (or had any involvement in popular culture) it builds gradually with an intriguing investigation leading to a very impressive climax. The set pieces are well directed and are mixed well with the drama and the film delivers just what I had come expecting ? fun, excitement, effects and an involving story.Of course this is not to ignore the fact that the film has its weak points. The worn 'tough cop' clichés are heavy on the ground and show a script that hasn't put as much effort into its characters as it really should have ? this is also seen in Calvin, who's background with Lanning is hinted at but never followed though. The film also hints at a very intelligent story around the robots but again it never totally follows through in as much detail as it could have done. The structure of the society is not clear ? if robots have taken many jobs how can everyone afford a robot? Spooner lives in a poor, overcrowded area with graffiti on the walls but yet everyone owns a robot. While I accept that the film couldn't go into the whole universe behind the scenario, it could have shown us an underclass just as easily as it showed us what I suspect were the middle classes. Likewise the final shot of the film implies that there is more to the robot-ethics of the story but mostly this is put to the side in favour of running and shooting. But these are minor complaints when you accept that this is not art ? it is a blockbuster and, in this way, it succeeds and is an enjoyable film. Matching the lazily written character that he is given, Smith plays it like Shaft. He eats pie and takes lots of sugar (but yet has a superb body ? can't wait for that part of the future!), makes wisecracks and sneers a lot.He tries to bring something individual out in Spooner but mostly he settles for playing along with the clichés and delivers a familiar performance but one that fits well with the aims of the film. Moynnahan is a bit dry but actually works better than the usual screaming love interest that we get served with ? thankfully the film resists the temptation to impose a romance on us. Tudyk looks the part and does a very good 'HAL' voice but he is constrained by his character and can only work within that ? but he works it well enough. Greenwood is a good part, Cromwell's familiarity helps us care for a character who has died before the film even starts, McBride is the gruff, weary captain but basically the film is Smith's and his Shaft is quite fun. Outside of the real things, the effects are great ? they look real and match the design of the future which is at the other end of the scale from the usual grim future that we all suspect will be nearer the truth! Alex Proyas may not be a great master of the narrative but he does OK here while also indulging his first love ? the visual effects and style.Overall this is an enjoyable summer blockbuster and stands out in the crowd of average sequels and trashy attempts at blockbusters that have crawled in and out of our cinemas this year. Yes, it's full of the usual tough cop genre clichés and the sci-fi element doesn't get as interesting or morally complex as it should have done but this is an action movie and I found it to do all the things I needed to do to entertain me ? set pieces, interesting story, fun, effects that are actually special and a film that builds to a satisfying (if overblown) conclusion. In the cold light of day it is an imperfect film but it is easily one of the better blockbusters of 2004.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good mix of action and philosophy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the Matrix and many other major movies, I, Robot has its foundations in philosophy, in its case the question of epistemology(The study of knowledge itself and computers being self-aware).Will Smith is Spooner, a cop with an apparent attitude problem. Set in the future, I Robot sees Spooner embarking on a puzzling case of suicide where he believes it was actually murder. By a robot.In this future society (With more than a homage to Blade Runner) robots are used as slaves of humans in all facets of life. They have 3 rules of conduct hard coded into them which essentially state they cannot harm humans. So the postulation by Spooner that a robot killed a man after a history where no robot had ever committed so much as a mugging presents a big problem to both his peers and his boss.Suffice to say the story's plot thickens and a number of twists and turns emerge before the truth is revealed.Will Smith is an absolute surprise here. Having previously been a light-hearted comedy actor he puts in a truly excellent and believable shift as a wise-cracking cop with a dark past.However, the real star is the special effects and visual trickery. Impossible but ingenious camerawork and some jawdropping animation really make I, Robot feel truly alive and utterly believable, while never being dull for a second.It arguably doesn't delve too deep into its philosophical undertones, but it doesn't really need to. It's a traditional Hollywood blockbuster action flick but it unquestionably has a brain and is a clear cut above the likes of Armageddon et al.Very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Alex Proyas, helmer of such cult favorites as 'Dark City' and 'The Crow', steps into the Hollywood limelight with his first attempt at a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster.'I, Robot' chronicles the life of Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) who has a techno-phobic view of the world's newest appliance, a life-like robot created by the world's leading technology giant US Robotics. A link in Spooner's past is linked to his phobia of the automaton movement sweeping the nation. According to US Robotics, there will be eventually 1 robot to every 5 humans.Spooner is called to the offices of US Robotics when a leading scientist (James Cromwell), with a secret link to Spooner, has apparently committed suicide. His death seems to have mysterious circumstances which could link to a robot. With man's complete trust in the new robot technology, it seems too ludicrous to every one except Spooner.As the mystery deepens, Spooner unravels the very fabric of the robotic giant, locks horns with CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) and learns more about his automated enemy with the aid of scientist Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan). Through the course of these events he may learn more than he could ever imagine.It is hard to defend a film like 'I, Robot' but I am going to try. For sci-fi purists, Isaac Asimov's legendary work about the robot and how he will intricate into our society has filled the minds of readers for over 50 years. But the similarities between the film presented here and his work are few and far between. Kind of like last week's release of Jerry Bruckheimer's 'King Arthur'. Both films take sacred subject matter and re-invent it with a new twist. I would have to say that 'I. Robot' is better in a lot ways.At the core of 'I, Robot' beats the soul of Asimov as his 3 laws regarding robots are sacredly left intact and the film does abide by them. Also a lot of the characters have similar names to the people in the text. It is almost like taking Star Trek's 'prime directive' and some of the now classic characters and setting them in a new idea of the future. The core is left intact but in some ways it has been updated and refreshed.The story, special effects and extremely zealous direction, however, all seem to be brought forth by the collaborators who cobbled this film together. There are influences of 'Robocop', 'Short Circuit', 'Blade Runner' and even the classic comic-book series 'Magnus: Robot Fighter'. Each of these robot influences echo back to what makes 'I Robot' so intriguing, a joy to watch and memorable. Sure the story does have a lot of sci-fi influences and clichés aside from robot films including 'Star Wars' and 'Planet of the Apes' but don't these benchmark sci-fi films influence everything coming down the turnpike these days. It even has the classic sci-fi cliché of the social outcast claiming there is an invasion coming except no one believes him. But that is not what should bring us into the film.You really need to give credit to director Alex Proyas because it is his magic as a filmmaker that holds this film together. He knows where to play it straight and where to let his lead actor bring on the charm. Also you really have to admire the man's technical ability. His brilliant inter-laying of robots into the photography is astounding. Proyas is an A-list director in the making and 'I, Robot' shows that he can deliver a big Hollywood film.I also give credit to Will Smith who starts out being very unapproachable with his character but as the film goes we really become fond of his hero. Smith's Spooner does have a lot of his previous sci-fi heroes inter-laced into Spooner but it comes off as more of a homecoming than an annoyance. In some ways I think Proyas had something to do with that especially in the chase down scene towards the beginning of the film. It almost felt like 'Men in Black' again.As for Smith's co-stars, Cromwell's Lanning is a throwaway character used mainly for effect, Moynahan is timid and sometimes robot-like but it is a sturdy performance and Greenwood is menacing and a good match to face off against the rebellious Smith. The reason I was so fond of 'I, Robot' is because for once it was a summer film that didn't apologize for trying to be entertaining. The special effects, the performances and the direction are all what people want to see in the summer and this film is loads and loads of fun. It is a great giant popcorn film with a light layering of message. My only small problem with this film was that it is supposed to be set in Chicago in 2035. I didn't buy it but if it was 2135, then maybe.Sure the film doesn't pave new ground but why does every film have to. It is pure summer fun and what is wrong with that.If you want Asimov and sci-fi purism then you can always read the novels. Stop apologizing and most of all stop belly-aching, just give the film a chance. If you like science fiction films and want to be remembered how much fun they used to be then this picture is the perfect ticket for you. So Says the Soothsayer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been the next "Blade Runner"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I, Robot" was this year's most entertaining Blockbuster: a lot of action, witty dialog and a fine plot. In fact, I thought the plot was so good that it was a waste to turn this project into a Will Smith vehicle. Not that he ruined the movie or anything but his funnyman performance - and the witty dialog - just kept the story from getting deep. So many other recent Blockbusters were unnecessarily lofty (*cough*SPIDER-MAN2*cough*MATRIX2&amp;3*cough*cough*) and could have used some irony. With "I, Robot", however, it would have been a great idea to go for a more philosophical approach. The direction is very spectacular and fast paced, which isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't help to create an intriguing atmosphere, either. The special effects look great for the most parts, except when they are used to create landscapes. Sometimes a location looks like it was taken directly out of a video game. Anyway, "I, Robot" is a fantastic way to spend 90 minutes, but it's no masterpiece and won't be remembered among classics who deal with similar topics ("Blade Runner", "The Terminator", "The Matrix 1"). Pity. The potential was there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the concept of the storyline was good, as it could be conceived as realistic. Given the ever increasing advances in modern technology, one can, indeed, conceive the possibility of this kind of future occurrence.I did not really see any flaws in this movie or in the actor's character but the philosophical aspect of the movie questions at what point does artificial intelligence cease to be artificial and true consciousness arise? Anyhow, I did like the A.I. in this movie and would definitely recommend, especially if you like Will Smith movies are the Terminator series. I do, however, prefer there to be no sequels to this movie due to the fact that a sequel would probably be no more than a revamped version of the first one. With that being said, I recommend seeing it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story, FX blend well in "Robot"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To fully understand the new 20th Century-Fox release, "I, Robot," one must remember the three robotic laws first put forth by Isaac Asimov's classic sci-fi book of the same name. 1) A robot can never harm a human; 2) a robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law: and 3) a robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.There it is.Now, however, comes the problem. It's 2035 Chicago, complete with zooming, streamlined computer-controlled traffic and glittering million-story skyscrapers (I think things will be a bit more bleak in 30 years myself, but ...). There are also hundreds of thousands of robots scurrying about walking dogs, delivering male, collecting garbage, etc.When Professor Alfred Lanning, the father of robotics (James Cromwell, "Babe," "LA Confidential"), falls from the top of the US Robotics building, everyone naturally assumes it's a suicide. Everyone except CPD detective Del Spooner (Will Smith).Things just don't look right to him (how the Dr. is thrown through protective safety glass, for instance), but as he postulates his theory that an android may have committed the crime, his boss, Lt. John Bergen (Chi McBride), along with other officers, think he's insane. After all, remember the three laws?Of course, in a film like this, where the loner is fighting against everyone else for something he/she believes in, we the audience are in on it, but despite much evidence, no one else believes him.Except for Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridgette Moynahan, "Coyote Ugly," "Sum of All Fears"), a researcher at USR, who finds an extraordinary android named Sonny, who sounds very much like HAL the Computer in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (the amazing creation is voiced by Alan Tudyk).Sonny dreams, emotes and runs away from Spooner when he feels trapped. Your average, run-of-the-mill robot he ain't.In the meantime, new NS-5 creations, more lifelike, yet much more subject to violence, are pouring off the assembly line to replace the older, more docile versions, while Spooner and Calvin investigate to the highest pinnacles of USR and the government.But no one is going to sit still while a loose cannon rogue cop tries to upset the apple cart. On several occasions, Spooner is attacked by the mechanical creatures, just barely able to survive another run-in with the automatons. Spooner also harbors a secret which motivates him to hate and fear the 'bots even more than most.Not is all as it seems, however, and there a few neat little twists thrown in, as well. I've never been a big Will Smith fan (recalling "Bad Boys" I and II, "Independence Day," "Wild, Wild West," etc.), but he does give a pretty low-key, sincere performance here. Director Alex Proyas ("Garage Days," "Dark City"), working with the biggest budget he's ever had, also blends creative special effects (the robots are amazing) with a decent storyline that keeps the action pumping with few slow spots. In addition, he doesn't allow the graphics to overwhelm a pretty good plot (that Isaac Asimov sure could write, couldn't he?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on Asimov than the art direction. Forget the product placement disaster, the unconvincing performance from Will Smith and the gargantuan plot-holes. This wasn't only laughable and but painful to watch. Even the action was boring. A mixture of MTV inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children.What a shame that sci-fi this bad can still be made after we've had Bladerunner, Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City (by the same director). This one really belongs in the bottom 100 list. Truly awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A travesty!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What on earth has this movie to do with Isaac Asimov? I've read some of his stuff, but other than his three robot laws, I see no similarities between his work and this 115 minute commercial. Acting is poor, no better than in your average TV show, the dialogues are crap, either there to remind of us the stereotypical 'cop with a grudge' Smith is performing (you might forget that when he keeps talking about his vintage 2004 shoes)) or... I actually don't know why there is dialogue at all really.Worse is: this movie revolves around a plot that is broken at the level of it's foundation. This plot is build on a 'logic' (which "you can't deny") that is simply false. Because (spoiler ahead) the whole idea is that this robots turn society into a fascist state to protect human kind from itself in order to uphold the first law which is 'not to allow harm to happen to human beings'. Yet: (a) they harm tons of human beings in the process of their revolution (and the law specifically states individual human beings, not human kind at large, so where did they get this utilitarian notion that it's OK to harm a whole bunch to protect a slightly bigger bunch?) and (b) harm comes not only through physical injury; it also comes through psychological injury, and massive oppression and containment does just this (which is why people rebelled against it then, and always will). This is well-known of course, we need the freedom to express ourselves and explore our social environments, we need a freedom to interact with- and challenge the world around us: it is in our human nature! This has nothing to do with the romantic babbling of free will that is being used in the movie; this is a matter of human psychology, and if the robot superbrain would have actually studied some of the many documents on psychology there already were in vintage year 2004 she would have come to this conclusion herself. Or hey, why not send in someone with understanding of human society and behavior to have a chat with this robot brain (which would have no doubt been open to such audience), or was the entire world suddenly comprised of tinheads like mr. Smith here who rather brings his point across using bullets?Asimov took care of building a philosophical foundation for his works, have the dialogues bring out the mature personalities of his characters, have social and political developments actually make sense in a broader scheme... none of this can be found in the movie. Frankly, I find it a disgrace to see his name attached to a movie made by folks who I doubt even read any of his work.If you're looking for a cheap action movie, this one fits the bill. If you're looking for thought-through science fiction, spare yourself this travesty. If the makers had spend as much time on the story (and it's underlying philosophy) as they did on product placement, it might have... well.. actually, no, I don't see how these folks could have ever made something out of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tired Pastiche of Sci Fi Clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thinking that the target audience for "I, Robot" was 12-year-old boys who have not read the original science fiction by Isaac Asimov that posited The 3 Laws or seen any science fiction movies, but surely even they have seen at least a "Matrix" or a "Terminator" movie where machines take over so that what are supposed to be climactic scenes here of robot revolution are just been-there-seen-that.Will Smith and some interesting dialog about robot-prejudice, that I'm willing to bet was inserted by the usually serious Academy Award-winning writer Akiva Goldsman, save the movie from seeming like a total pastiche of other movies. It is a bit much just how much music video director Alex Proyas uses the post-"Ali" Smith as pin-up fodder (maybe this is supposed to be the motivation for women ticket buyers?), let alone product endorser - he actually points out a pair of Converse sneakers several times to the camera, though the "Wall Street Journal" claims that a promotional fee was not paid. It's also a continuing hypocrisy in the ratings system that Smith gets to utter many "sh*t"s in a PG-13 movie while Fahrenheit 9/11 got an "R," let alone the indie movies that have to carry "NC-17."Bridget Moynahan does herself no favor in appearing opposite a robot with a soul, as Alan Tudyk's "Sonny" out acts her throughout the movie. While I suppose the target audience isn't looking at her acting abilities, would that the director had considered the minds of other potential fannies in the seats.

		<fullReview>Yeah, yeah, the CGI was cool. But that was about it. AWFUL, truly AWFUL acting--Bridget Moynahan- WOW, one of the WORST screen performances I've ever seen, and Will Smith, playing his one and only note over and over again. Yeah, the robots climbing up the side of the building were cool, and the robot fight towards the end was cool, but what the hell did we have to sit through 2 hours of dreck for that?? Horrible. Just horrible. Was it populated solely by relatives and friends of the director and producers? All the $$ they have to spend on this stuff and this is the crap they come up with? What a pile of trash. I can't believe the same guy who directed Dark City came up with this.I wonder if Isaac Azimov has stopped spinning in his grave yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STUPID Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For any fan of Isaac Asimov, this film is a total fraud. Dr. Asimov went to great lengths to explain his motivation for writing his robot stories in the introduction to "The Rest of the Robots", an anthology published in 1968. In Dr. Asimov's words, "... there seemed only one change to be rung on this plot -- Robots were created and destroyed their creator; ... I quickly grew tired of this dull hundred-times-old tale. As a person interested in science, I resented the purely Faustian interpretation of science".The film is totally at odds with the philosophy Dr. Asimov defended, and totally different from all the robot stories he wrote. Only a few names and the "three laws of robotics" were copied, but the central point in all his stories, that a robot could never be made to violate the three laws, was not respected. The Asimov robot stories are fun because they try to find situations were there is enough contradiction in those laws to create interesting situations."I, Robot", the movie, is just one more remake of that old, old, old story Isaac Asimov hated so much, it's Frankenstein again. If you insist on seeing that same story again, better get Mel Brooks' version, it's funnier.Let's close with Asimov: "Never, never, was one of my robots to turn stupidly on his creator for no purpose but to demonstrate, for one more weary time, the crime and punishment of Faust".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Rule of Robotics: Don't Kick Isaac In His Asimov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rule # 1: Hollywood shouldn't make some books into movies.Take, for example, science fiction author Isaac Asimov's "I, Robot," a classic collection of cautionary short stories about the unforeseen complications in a robot's logic as it tries to obey the three laws of robotics. Even when the robots appeared insane, Asimov was careful to show that by the lights of the robot's "positronic brains," they are behaving logically.Rule # 2: Movies with multiple stories don't make millions.Too many characters. Too many ideas. Too much originality. Too much segmentation. Consequently, when Hollywood lays its hands on literary legends like Asimov, they dumb down his work and turn it into a sprawling saga, with brash, loud-mouthed characters that audiences can laugh with so they can forget about the summer heat.In the Will Smith movie "I, Robot," Australian director Alex Proyas of "The Crow," Oscar-winning scenarist Akiva Goldsman of "A Beautiful Mind," and "Final Fantasy" scribe Jeff Vintar have retained the three laws of robotics, but have turned an otherwise literary classic into a shallow, uninspired, paint-by-the-numbers, potboiler about an heroic, wise-cracking Chicago cop in the year 2035 who abhors robots. "I, Robot" opens with the three laws of robots.1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.An alarm clock awakens divorced homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith of "Ali") to another wonderful day. After a shower scene designed to display Smith's buff body, especially his curiously scarred "Rambo" pectorals, our swaggering stereotypical lone wolf hero dons his ghetto black street clothes, unpacks a vintage pair of 2004 Converse All-Star sneakers, and cruises off to his first crime scene of the day in his tricked out Audi.The headquarters of the U.S. Robotics Corporation--a Microsoft-type company?stands in downtown Chicago. U.S. Robotics plans to put a robot in every home. Apparently, U.S.R.'s chief robot designer, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell of "Babe"), committed suicide. The visionary scientist hurled himself through his office window and fell hundreds of feet to the lobby. Spooner learns that Lanning had requested him specifically, so Del could listen to a message Lanning recorded for him on a preprogrammed hologram. Initially, Lanning's cryptic remarks make no sense to Del. When he visits Lanning's office, he discovers that the good doctor couldn't have jumped through the window. Del tries to break the window next to the window that Lanning shattered and barely makes a dent when he smashes a chair against it. No sooner does Del realize that the killer may still be in the room than the killer surprises him and escapes.Eventually, Del captures the robot and interrogates him. Before he can get far, U.S. Robotics' CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood, who played JFK in "Thirteen Days") storms into the police station. He demands the return of his property. Robertson reminds Del that the authorities cannot charge robots with murder. Not only have robots never posed a threat to humans, but also only humans can be charged with homicide. Inevitably, Del's world-weary boss, Lieutenant John Bergin (Chi McBride of "Gone In 60 Seconds"), chews him out for crying 'robot' every time something happens to him. Del remains far from convinced, however, about the innocence of robots. He bears a grudge against them. During an accident, a truck rammed both his vehicle and another car with a 12-year old girl inside. Both cars sank into a river. A passing robot witnessed the accident and dived in to rescue Del. Our protagonist told the robot to save the little girl instead, so he feels guilty about her death and despises robots.Gee, doesn't this sound familiar? Like a movie from the 1980s? A rebellious but maimed cop battling a corporation with a dark secret. Hey, didn't Tom Selleck do something like that in the 1984 epic "Runaway?" Or what about 1982's "Blade Runner?" Or "Westworld," where the robots cannot kill humans either. Del spends the rest of "I, Robot's" predictable 115 minutes trying to prove to everybody that robots are dangerous. He worries especially because his mother (Adrian Ricard of "Bulworth") has won a robot in lottery. Meanwhile, despite all this horrible publicity, Robertson plans to market a new line of robots, and he wants Del off his back permanently. Of course, hard-headed as Del is, he doesn't take no for an answer, even when Bergin takes his badge and suspends him from the force.Basically, aside from a fairly low-key performance, Will Smith's futuristic detective doesn't appear too far removed from his wealthy playboy cop in the "Bad Boys" movies. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a sidekick like Martin Lawrence to take up the slack in this occasionally exciting but largely superficial sci-fi saga. Not even his quips seem catchy. Smith spouts lines like: "Does believing you're the last sane man on the planet make you crazy? 'Cause if that's the case, maybe I am. " Probably his best line, and that isn't saying much, is: "Somehow 'I told you so' just doesn't quite say it." "I, Robot" looks okay, if you don't think about some of the gaping plot holes. Wait until you see what Del's secret weapon is. Talk about a cop-out! The robots are marginally intimidating, but two action sequences, a careening chase scene in a freeway tunnel and a demolition robot that destroys a mansion look cool. Despite its plea for tolerance, which was handled better in "Bicentennial Man," "I, Robot" breaks no new ground in the robots on the prowl genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potent Elixir of Asimov Diluted Into 40 Ounces of Ghetto</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I think the Asimov fans already knew this was a loose recreation of the original and personally, I have no problems with movies based on books which end up almost nothing like the book. In my opinion, this movie couldn't stand alone as a great piece of cinema and only has the 'I, Robot' name to give it any validity.My biggest issue as one may guess from my summary is Will Smith's ghetto, flippant attitude throughout the movie. From the first scene of Smith leaving his apartment, he walks down the street with a scowl on his face, bumping into people, and dew-rag over his ear just dripping with 'thug'. Just like in ID-4 and Men in Black, Smith faces life-threatening circumstances with a sarcastic and improbable facade. Nothing is ever scary or serious to the characters he plays. Not the aliens chasing him in Independence Day, not the giant killer-cockroach in Men in Black, and not hundreds of killer-robots in this movie. Smith retorts to ever threat with a stereotypically black attitude. His confrontation with his boss when he loses his badge is nothing short of ridiculous. He stomps off shouting and throwing a tantrum like a stereotypical, over-entitled minority. For me it's disgusting and tired. I think Will Smith can be funny and charming. I like that he took a break from music during the early 90's when hip-hop was saturated with hateful gansta-rap, finally returning when things settled down with a decent album. I don't know why he continues to play roles where he assumes these arrogant roles, fronting everyone off wherever he goes.True to her character in the book, Bridget Moynahan plays a decent Dr. Calvin. Cold, intelligent, and logical. If you're an Asimov fan, don't expect the book or anything Asimov would have approved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this 'adaptation' of Isaac Asimov book and found it to be the worst case of 'artist freedom' that ever existed ? more like 'Artist Decapitation'. This movie destroys 50 years of Asimov work and is a disgrace to the film industry. 20th century thinks it can only make a buck by special effects ? if that what it wants do use some cheap piece of writing. I, Robot (the book) may not be action pack but it has the possibility of a great movie (some day ? by someone who as true vision of artist freedom and expression). I, Robot could have been made exploring the characters and settings of the book. People went to see the Truman Show, Bicentennial Man, Saving Private Ryan, Notting Hill as well as movies like The Lord of the Rings, Stars Wars. I, Robot is similar in some ways to all the movies mention above (Although some in very small ways) ? My point is if a real writer and director had handled this movie it could have combined great special effects with great stories, characters and actors. It would have been a challenge but to me it would have shown great creativity and skill ? Not some 5cent rip off of a man with great vision who inspired thousands of people ? including some who created real robots and went into the field of science because of his dreams and ideas of the future. If this is how Hollywood treats a great idea I truly feel sorry for future moviegoers.</fullReview>

This movie was generic, bland, and mechanistic. The characters were very flat, with Will Smith as a typical lone-wolf/obsessed detective delving into a conspiracy that keeps going higher and higher. The use of red lights to indicate evil robots and blue for good belied the simplicity of any philosophy in the film. The penultimate insult to the legacy of Asimov was the over-reliance on violence and flashy CGI to compensate for the underweight script. The best thing I can say about this picture is that the explosions were big, bright and loud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This "film" is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film. unnecessary slow motion, unnecessary flipping/jumping/somersaults, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogue.... basically unnecessity. (is that a word? well, it's just been invented by I, Robot.)What happened to practicality? (i.e. the car garage, the skin spray) the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop.What happened to showing respect for women? (i.e. smith's character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film, and yet she still "wants" him. WHERE IS THE TENSION? I'll tell you where, good looks and not admiration or common ground)What happened to a detective that detects? Smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself, complaining to other people, and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off. this is such a lame way to get the story from point b-c-d-etc... it was OK once, but not several times in a row. (speaking of several times in a row, what was the "I'm snoring and not listening to you joke? Twice In One Scene?)What happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes? Shia LaBeouf (the kid) is in the movie for a total of TWO SCENES, we know that A-he degrades women, and B-he knows Smith....... so of COURSE we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm,What happened to Hero's? let's just forget that there are people, women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that I have an acquaintance with. and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air, showing off, while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot.don't get me wrong, I'm all for spectacle. but I'm also all for a shred of realism and meaning.I have to say I've never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time. so thanks Alex.

Most of the important story lines are gone (where are the tester guys? Where is that robot starting a cult? Where...? Where...? Where...?). It is not Asimov's plot, and I take using the name of a classic fiction write as gross disrespect - of author and an insult to viewers' intelligence (assuming there's any). It truly takes talent, chutzpa and insolence to screw up a classic: many thanks to producers for p***ing on Asimov's grave - this movie was almost as bad as Around the World in 80 days, only more so, as nobody reads Verne anymore, anyways. And, to add more insult to injury, I was convinced I was paying to see a movie, NOT more product commercials per minute than prime-time TV. JVC, Audi, Converse and others - here's my money, this is about as close as you'll ever see it.

		<shortDescription>The Return of Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Isaac Asimov at the age of 14 read pulp SF-stories, he soon became fed up with the usual stereotype robot story: Mad, but brilliant scientist construct a robot that turns against its creator and have to be deactivated by the hero of the story. So, when he later became a SF-writer he created his famous three laws of robotic, to enable him to write stories, that was not infected by the Frankenstein Syndrome.The movie 'I, Robot' is named after Asimov's first collection of robot short stories. It uses his three laws and even some of the character's names. But the plot is far from being Asimovian! It is a typical Frankenstein story of the kind that Isaac Asimov would hate.For a genuine SF-fan who admires Isaac Asimov, this is a very sad film that demonstrates contempt for one of the true masters of science fiction!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so impressed by the quality of the CGI in this movie. It was amazing!Most CGI these days is done poorly and really takes me out of the movie, but I really found myself drawn into the world of the robots in this one. Everything from their facial expressions to their posture was so believable.Sonny seemed like a real character to me at times. Aside from James Cromwell, Sonny was more real than all the other actors combined. He had more personality and I cared about his character more than any of the other actors. Not since Gollum have I seen a better CGI character. Here's hoping that Hollywood takes note and uses I, Robot as their new standard for CGI in movies. OUTSTANDING!Aside from the excellent CGI, I really enjoyed this movie. I tend to enjoy movies that pull me along and keep me engaged while the plot plays itself out with twists and turns; and I, Robot had plenty of both. The robots are the real stars of the show, though. Sonny really steals the show with the human actors just seeming like supporting characters. Will Smith's character was okay, and I kind of got annoyed with how he just meandered through most of his scenes. He kind of just played the same character he plays in every other action movie. He did have some very funny lines in the movie: one line in particular was one of the funniest I have heard in some time. You'll know it when you hear it. The only thing I really didn't like was the climax at the end. It was too ridiculous for me to believe. But aside from that, the movie was very entertaining and well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badass struts, chases robots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there was a movie that seemed to be a deliberate statement by Hollywood that it despises the intelligence of the American moviegoer, this movie is it. And based on the colossal box office receipts the movie garnered, the studios are dead-on in their assessments. This summer's (2005) box-office slump clearly is more an indication of moviegoers finding other brainless amusements (like reality TV, I suppose) than their displeasure with the vile crap the studios feed them. This past weekend seems to confirm that, since the universally-panned "Fantastic Four" broke the slump.Anyway.The story in "I, Robot" has virtually nothing to do with Asimov's wonderful series of tales, which are actually more philosophy than science fiction. He was never better at pondering the human factor in a world of ever-increasing technology. I read the stories when I was a kid, and I've just recently listened to them on audio CD. It confirms what I was pretty sure I remembered: that the stories are genuine, warm, full of human insight, and wonderful.All of that is entirely absent from this movie. It is an opportunity to worship at the altar of Will Smith, and nothing else. He struts around--and "struts" is far too weak of a word--clad in ultra-stylish leather from head to toe, with two gigantic guns in matching shoulder holsters. He lives with his grandmother, a plump, bespectacled caricature of Aunt Jemima. (Almost like Martin Lawrence in drag.) He's glib, garrulous and rude, but he keeps flashing his patented grin to excuse his crass personality. The dialog is banal to the point of incredulity. The movie is largely CGI, and Smith performed his role mostly wearing weird suits inside a small set and standing before a blue background. One can imagine what kind of soulful performance that coaxes from an actor. Considering that the actor is Smith, who is hardly Shakespearean-caliber to begin with, the result is about as convincing as a bunch of 8th-graders trying to act tough down at the maltshop.The movie is so focused on Smith's "personality" to the exclusion of all else that one is almost surprised the editors didn't add in a sitcom laugh-track to punctuate his weak one-liners.The only thing close to the irony of Asimov's tales that this movie achieves is purely unintentional. The rise of CGI technology in movie-making has made it possible, and even profitable, to make movies that are nearly purely eye-candy, with no story, no dialog, no ideas, no thoughts. Like a two-hour music video. Man uses technology to corrupt and debase an artistic medium that was once capable of beauty. That would elicit a wry smile from Asimov.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew this movie was going to be good before I even went to the theatre, but I didn't know it would be as good as it was. It was pretty intense from beginning to end and I left my seat quite satisfied."I, Robot" is set in the year 2035 and is centered around a cop named Del Spooner (Will Smith) who investigates the death of the top scientist at U.S. Robotics. Suspicious, as always, Det. Spooner immediately suspects that a robot has something to do with the crime and as he continues his investigation and delves deeper into USR the truth starts to unfold about what is really going on.First, I must say that if you are a true fan and follower of Isaac Asimov you probably won't like this movie because you'll be too hung up on the slight, or not-so-slight, differences between the movie and Asimov's original. You should, however, try to take it with a grain of salt and not worry about silly things like that. The basic ideas are still there, they just threw a little "Hollywood" in there. You have to expect that nowadays.Some people also seems to have an "issue" with Will Smith that I've never been able to figure out. He's witty, charming, funny and looks the part. His acting is great as per usual and his two co-stars Bridget Moynahan (playing Susan Calvin) and Alan Tudyk (playing Sonny, an NS-5 robot) deliver top-notch performances as well. Alan Tudyk especially, did a wonderful job as Sonny. You really feel for him at times.Considering that this is an action movie at heart, as you would expect, the fight scenes and action sequences are very, very well done. There were a few times that I realized I hadn't breathed in the last two minutes or so because I was too "in" to the movie.The story was nicely laid out and the ending will not disappoint you. The director (Alex Proyas, Dark City) did an amazing job shooting this film.The one thing that never left my mind the whole time I was watching the movie was how well each scene was shot and how one scene transitioned into the next.Overall this movie did not disappoint me in any way. The story, the acting, the directing...all pretty much flawless.Rating: 10 / 10</fullReview>

As other users have pointed out, this is a disgrace to Asimov master piece. The ending is so predictable and irrelevant. Beside, many would argue that such a scenario would have been examined by robot engineer. Nothing new with the trivial motto 'mankind is the worst danger for its own security'. The book was so much more subtle in the psychology of the robot and their interaction to human being. Sigh deeply my friend and don't waste your time if you are a real SF aficionado.Another point, this movie will age very very badly if one judges by the costumes only. Already, completely out of fashion! Well, of course it was not a complete fiasco. 5 stars for the usual nicely oiled Hollywood machine.

In the books, she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists, able to think her way through a problem. Here she's just a damsel in distress, waiting to be rescued by Wil Smith.There are passing references to Asimov's Laws of Robotics, but they are an afterthought to the CGI and action scenes.Smith is likable, as he is in most of his films, but honestly, the story isn't that good.

You have another bad Will Smith movie. This is Men in Black II mated with Bad Boys II. Perhaps this could be called, I, Stinkbutt or something? Much better than rob Asimov of his legacy by masquerading this turd as his own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with great expectations, and quite frankly, I was a bit disappointed.Of course, Issac Asimov's concept was a good one, but the execution on the other hand was poor.Granted, the movie wasn't terrible, I just really didn't do it for me. The special effects were a little... fake and overdone. The action was cheesy and out of place. The story was a bit, well, predictable, and the acting left much to be desired.Perhaps worst of all were the characters of the story.Sonny, the main robot of the story was perhaps the most realistic and human character of the story. Great... But aren't robots not supposed to be very human? It just didn't work for me at all. The robot was the character that I related to the most. That just shouldn't happen! Now there have been many robot movies where the robots are portrayed as having human-like qualities, such as blade runner. That was good. The androids in that movie were closer to human than they were robot anyway. But the robots in this story we're supposed to be robotic.Moving along, the worst character in the story was of Del Spooner, the main character of the movie played by Will Smith. Will Smith played the same exact character he has played in just about every other movie he has ever been in. You'd think that they'd give him more original roles by now. But instead, we get the same old wise crackin' main character that Smith has portrayed in every movie he has ever done.Alright... this is getting a bit lengthy, so I'm gonna rap it up. I, Robot was a disappointment. It was in all definitions of the word, meh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a horrible piece of trash!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Asimov must be turning over in his grave. This travesty of a film mocks everything that he stood for. Asimov, a devout pacifist, wanted to create a series of robot stories that did not rely on idiotic violence to advance the plot. His stories rely on humans (and robots) using intelligence and reasoning to solve problems. He also wanted to create stories that contradicted the all to clichéd "Frankenstein" motif. This film does exactly the opposite. It's quite obvious that the screenwriters casually browsed the books, selected a few choice names, and then proceeded to write a script that had the intellectual depth of a episode of Barney the purple dinosaur.The most tragic aspect of the multimillion dollar insult is that there already existed a wonderful award winning script by Harlan Ellison which has been printed in book form. This script weaved Asimov's disparate robot tales into an intellectually satisfying story that remained true to Asimov's vision. All true Science fiction fans (i.e readers- and I'm not talking about those of you who only read the latest Star wars or other movie novelization) should avoid this movie at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I,Robot is one of the most over-rated movies of 2004.Will Smith is horrid, he has zero chemistry with Bridget Moynahan and his casting seem solely to draw in the young Black male crowd. I can't believe he and Dr. Lanning were even close friends. Very few reviewers seem to point this out. How depressing to see Black men still portrayed as slobs ( eating a whole pie while walking)and dressed like a clown. Yes, it's good to see Black people in Sci-Fi movies as they've been nonexistent before but not this way. The movie left out the fact that a robot is forced to make hard choices in who to save in an accident and that it becomes useless afterwards, it's positronic brain forever locked up by it's failure to save one human.Asimov is rolling in his grave. Please don't make Foundation Trilogy this way!UnbowedClaw</fullReview>

The depiction of the young Dr. Susan Calvin is outrageous, they thought.. why put the middle age intelligent woman lets just replace her with any nice looking actress to attract the male audience.

This does, however, fit the typical cop drama formula. All the elements were there: 1. Rogue cop has to solve fallen friends suspicious death. 2. Rogue cop is restrained by unyielding, by-the-book police captain. 3. Rogue cop loses job while pursuing case yet continues investigation. 4. Rogue cop teams up with civilian. 5. Rogue cop and civilian follow ambiguous (at best) clues which lead to epic battle. 6. While battling hundreds of foes, Rogue cop has time for corny one-liners. 7. Rogue cop and civilian save world. Take this formula, add plenty of over the top special effects and some absurd plot twists, and you've got I Robot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really can't begin to judge this as a film in it's own right because the whole watching experience was spoiled by thoughts of Asimov turning in his grave. Anyone familiar with the book will know that a film based exactly on the book (itself a collection of short stories)would never have worked and it is not his I take issue with. But the whole spirit of Asimov's robots is ruined. Most of his robot stories involve in some way circumventing the Laws of Robotics to make robots act in a way that seems to contradict the laws but, in fact, doesn't. They're logic puzzles basically, typical of Asimov. The I, Robot film shows no regard to the Laws having the robots not appearing to break them but actually doing so. The justification to this is that the robots have taken it upon themselves to make the decision that humanity should be prioritized over individuals.Now Asimov fans will recognize this logic (Although not from I, Robot). It is of course Zeroth Law, the brainchild of Giskard, who upon discovering it was forced to permanently shut himself down (robot, obviously)because it so badly contradicted everything he had been built to follow. The only observer to the revelation of Zeroth Law being R Daneel Olivaw (the R standing for robot) who managed to incorporate that belief into his existing laws and over many centuries started making small, yet significant, mostly behind the scenes, changes. This is all shown in the Robots and Empire and The Foundation books. So you may wonder why I have issues with I, Robot the film when, OK it may not all be in the book of the same name, but its all there in Asimov somewhere. I'll tell you why. Giskard and R Daneel were the greatest, most advanced robots ever. Zeroth Law destroyed one of them and the other felt only able to implement it over great amount of time with the least interference and with the greatest respect to the other laws. Contrast this to the film. And don't even get me started on Susan Calvin.So I suppose my point is, it might be a perfectly good film, but don't pretend it's I, Robot, and don't pretend it's Asimov.</fullReview>

Unlike others who say that they were excited by the news this movie was being made I cringed b/c the possibility of a director making a fabulous movie akin to the Lord of the Rings is very slight. Others have commented that we true fans should loosen up and just relax and enjoy. What if the only reason we would watch this movie is because they attached Asimov's name, no matter that they qualified this with the word 'inspiration' instead of 'based'. Any fool would realize this means the writers pilfered the story for the best details and reworked it into a paltry plot. I signed a petition against this movie! Why do directors respect the work of K. Dick so much more than Asimov???? Asimov is a treasure trove of nuanced, intelligent and lively work that deserves better treatment! If Asimov isn't rolling in his graves all of his fans are gagging at every stupid commercial on HBO. A waste of time and money. If we can have 2010 and Minority Report and Bladerunner why not a cogent I, Robot? I wish they wouldn't even touch any of his other stories if they can't even pay due respect!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of the great future-design touches, the clever Asimov premise, and Will Smith's dependable cool performance, this movie doesn't live up to expectations. The clichés come thick and fast; (waking from a recurring nightmare, maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant, to list more would be spoiling it - you can see the end a mile off). This movie is also stagebound - you never feel that you have travelled anywhere; what's supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously CGI Chicago. The robots themselves are good in closeup, but the 'crowd' scenes look more like bad Disney -the CGI is overdone again and again. And if you can destroy the robots by smashing them, why do they need to inject 'nanites'? You know it's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax. It could have been great, but it's less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years.</fullReview>

Well, to be fair, there were robots in both. The movie plays like someone dropped a the scripts from Dirty Harry, Attack of the Zombies, and Idiocracy into a blender and hit puree. You've got a rogue, marginally unstable cop, an endless army of identical enemies, and a future that does not looks so bright.

		<shortDescription>vacuous piece of crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie-goers. There are the ones who are well read, extremely literate, and intelligent. They know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author. For many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature. Considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre-pubescent teenagers. Today's well read fan knows well this history, and knows the great authors Asimov, Heinlein, Bradbury, and Ellison, who helped bring science fiction out of that basement. In doing so they created thought provoking, intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition. This well informed fans are critical of anything Hollywood throws at them. They are not critical for it's own sake, but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye. (As they should as Hollywood's record has been less than stellar.) To these fans the story must take supreme importance. They cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics, and non stop action sequences. When the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest.The second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre. (Look at many of the above comments that state "Well I haven't read the book or anything by this author...) Their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the Scifi channel. They are extremely uncritical, willing to overlook huge plot holes, weak premises, and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects. They are, in effect, willing to turn off their critical thinking skills (or maybe they never had them!) for the duration of the movie. Case in point, I Robot. While supposedly based on Asimov's short stories and named after one of his novels, it contains little of what Asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations. (Those of you that will run out and buy I, Robot will be very much surprised-this movie isn't even based on that story at all!) The film has enormous plot holes, that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity. I won't point them out. I won't spoon feed you. You need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself. The characters, which are named after many of Asimov's characters, do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories. The plot itself with all it's action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for. His belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds, not their fists, is vital to understanding his vision of the future. In short, other than the name, their is very little of Isaac in anything about this movie. There will always be those uncritical (i.e. unthinking) who will state: "The movie doesn't have to be like the book. Due to the medium, movies sometimes require that changes be made." But what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book (or books) from the start? What if all they took from the written work was the title? This begs the question: Why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it's title on your vacuous piece of crap? Save money and don't buy the rights to the works. Title it something else. Don't use the character's names. Believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism. In fact it won't matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him. But it will upset those who read, who think, who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show. I, Robot, like much of Hollywood's take on the genre, pushes Science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago. Hollywood could not do this alone. It takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this.</fullReview>

Simple:- You must have NEVER read Asimov- Take a great book of SHORT-STORIES, pick a random idea of each one and mix them all together...- Don't you forget of BREAKING the UNBREAKABLE laws of robotics!! Why do I say that??? I've read a comment that says that Asimov wrote about how the laws of robotics can be broken... WRONG!! He wrote about how imperfect are the laws, this and every, and how they can be surrounded, how they can generate unexpected situations but, always, in the frame of the three laws. But the first law is very simple, a robot CAN'T harm a human, even if this involves ignoring an order or the self-destruction. They have betrayed the basis of the Asimov's work, so, how they dare to use the "I, Robot" title, or even his name??? And, please... if any of you know, like me, the Asimov world, Susan Calvin would never do that...I've putted a 4 on this movie, most of all, for the amazing visual effects and acceptable performers...

		<fullReview>First off, let me say that it is an OK flick with excellent production design, reasonable acting, big action scenes, excellent CGI from Weta Digital, etc. But, oh!, the screenplay.Fair dinkum, Isaac Asimov must be spinning in his grave so fast, you could use him to power a small city. The screenplay is laughable and is everything that Isaac Asimov's writing is not. It is clichéd to the point of ludicrousness (maverick cop with bad attitude that no-one believes? Again?). Stupid to the point of being unintentionally funny (the writers should have checked out the "Galactic Overlord's 100 mistakes to avoid" website to remove the more risible plot devices).Unintelligent, (well, mostly unintelligent). The one time they strayed from attempting to rewrite one of the I. Robot short stories (such as 'Little Lost Robot'), they did OK. The scene where Will Smith describes his main motivation brings up a number of interesting philosophical questions. But this exception only serves to illustrate how much better the screenplay could have been.And it has corny dialogue. Cheesy is another word that comes to mind.The screenplay also completely misrepresents the I, Robot books. Susan Calvin is a brilliant, but cold person. With a wit like a scalpel and the sort of psychiatric knowledge to intimidate others. Not the sort of emotion riddled half-wit as she is portrayed here. The three laws are built into the substructure of the brain. To violate the first law ALWAYS causes the robot to "seize up", they can not be subverted just by downloading a new set of instructions. The stories are meant to get away from this "dull hundred-times-old tale" where "Robots were created and destroyed their creator" (both quotes taken Isaac Asimov's introduction to "The Rest of the Robots"). But the movie does just that. The robots are not supposed to be terrifying. But in the movie, they become a sort of terrifying monster, part Terminator and part soldier-ant colony.I'm looking forward to the "Director's cut" version, where they remove all mention of Isaac Asimov and change the names of all of the Asimovian characters to non-Asimovian ones. They can keep the Three Laws. After all, they are so common as to be nearly ubiquitous. Then, and only then, would I consider it worth the overall rating that this movie has.Now, I'm going to read my copy of 'I, Robot' to get the awful taste of this appalling travesty out of my mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I, Robot", directed by Alex Proyas takes place in the not so distant future, specifically 2035 Chicago. Del Spooner (Smith) is a police detective who has a prejudice against robots, which is kind of an issue since they are basically everywhere. Robots have replaced humans in doing manual labor jobs (garbage men, etc.) and have become personal assistants and even companions to many people. On the eve of the release of the latest model that will not only replace the old models but will be featured in one in five homes, the chief scientist and inventor of the robots allegedly commits suicide by throwing himself out of his office window. Spooner is the detective on the case because the scientist has left a holographic message for him that leads him to believe that there is more to this death than a suicide. The head of the company the scientist worked for is Lawrence Robertson (Greenwood), who appoints one of his primary employees, Susan Calvin (Moynahan) to assist Spooner with his investigation. When Spooner discovers the crime seems to have been committed by a robot, Sonny, one who seems to have feelings (and more importantly) disregards the three laws of robotics, he and Calvin find that there may be much more on the new robots' agendas than they thought.Boy, where do I start with this one? I really intensely disliked this film as a whole. There were so many clichés that were invoked, from the "cop that everyone thinks is crazy", to the "evil corporate magnate who may not be so evil". The script for "I, Robot" is rife with bad puns "Sorry, I'm allergic to bulls**t", and at least ten "Oh, hell no"'s from Smith. There were several completely inane plot points (Shia LaBeouf's role, which was essentially a walk-on, where Smith repeatedly tells him not to curse was baffling, for one), and frankly, Smith's argument for his prejudice against the robots was not remotely convincing to me, something that was a pretty big deal since it was a big part of the plot. The acting in "I, Robot" was absolutely reprehensible. Will Smith, has proved with his non-action films that he can act. Although he has done mostly action-oriented films and therefore can't really show too much talent in that genre, his performance in "I, Robot" just plain sucked. And shame on the casting directors for picking Bridget Moynahan to co-star in this film. In fact, let's go back farther - shame on her agent or whoever decided that she COULD act. Her role as a scientist was about as believable as Denise Richards was in whatever Bond film she was in, only she was somehow worse in this movie. I kept asking when she was going to reveal the fact that she was actually a robot because that was the only thing that would have explained her wooden delivery. If they simply wanted someone with a pretty face, they could have at least gotten a marginal actress like Kate Beckinsale or something. They would have just had to make the character Hungarian since she can't seem to shake that accent.Meanwhile, Proyas' direction was rife with "groaner" moments. Anything that was supposed to be a "surprise!" moment (Sonny surviving the chair after a scene where he was supposed to be killed that I dubbed "Dead Bot Walking", or after his car was totaled, Smith cracking out the trusty motorcycle) was just a big letdown because it was unfortunately apparent these things would happen long before the reveal. I also question the decision to make Chicago look virtually unrecognizable a mere thirty years from now. I guess the Sears Tower was spotted, but other than that it could have been any city. (Other than the vague reference to a dried up Lake Michigan, which I still don't get ? perhaps I missed something when I was trying to burrow into the couch to escape this movie.) Honestly, I didn't think the movie could actually take a turn for the worse three minutes until the end, but it did, with something as simple as a really stupid and corny handshake between Smith and Sonny that was inexplicably in slow motion, invoking my memories of other films of the same mettle who also enjoyed unnecessary slo-mo, like "Glitter" or "Battlefield Earth." The only thing that saved this stinker of a movie from a spot in my coveted dungeon of films I loathe with great malice that include "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and "Escape from L.A." was the fact that the special effects were indeed fantastic. The entire reason why I watched this film at all was because of its Special Effects nomination for an Oscar, and after seeing the film it was clear that it was far superior to its fellow nominees "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" and "Spiderman 2" (which it eventually lost to). The CGI work is top-notch, particularly anything to do with Sonny. Even the scenes when "reality" and CGI mixed were fantastic. Not enough to save the film, not by a long shot, but definitely the only positive thing I can say about the film.Other than the Special Effects work, "I, Robot" is absolutely terrible. I wouldn't watch it again on a bet. Knowing that in an action film, the story and acting are usually put on the back burner, I will generally give some leeway that I don't allow for regular dramas. But there is no excuse for the deplorable, appalling and abominable product that Proyas churned out and expected us to watch. I couldn't tolerate it, must less enjoy it, and now I plan to try to forget I ever saw it. I'm giving this film a 4/10, only because of the superior special effects; otherwise it would have gotten no more than a 2.--Shelly</fullReview>

What this film really is, is...depressing. Depressing that the US film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid, clichéd re-heats, and acclaim them as spectacular new works. This film as "retread" written all over it, from the plot line (an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern-day uber-action) to Smith's character (a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium), to the special effects (that borrowed from Matrix and a few others)."I, Robot" is, sadly, quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has lots of holes in it, of all sizes, but I don't think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice. Perhaps a blockbuster by today's standards, but very B-movie compared to true winners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent blend of action and thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some would say this deviates from the Asimov stories. I think of it as an interesting variation. A good mix of action, humor and mystery. I enjoyed listening to the director's commentary about how the filmmakers strove to balance the intelligence of the story with all the action moments.I also appreciate the relation they created between Spooner and Dr. Calvin. It didn't devolve into senseless romance or some other exaggeration. They were complete opposites who worked well together. I liked how Dr Lanning was an essential character to the story despite being dead through the whole film.A lot of fun with some food for thought. You can't go wrong with Will Smith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>##### spoiler inside #####Men, this was some bad film. I laugh my way to the movie. The script was flawed from beginning to end. There is not enough space here to write done all the inconsistencies in it, so let me just say that it is convenient that all bad robots have a red light and that the wicked main frame computer did not had enough sense to make a backup of itself before taking over the world.Complete story lines are left out: we are being told that Smith have had a previous relationship that didn't work out and feels bonded with the beautiful psychiatrist because she was in a though relationship with the creator of the three laws, but what this relationships were that seemly influenced the whole film is never worked out. The only reason why in a super duper world in 2035 (we'll live to see that day...) still has concrete roads were there were actually a few cars using feels to proceed (robots had to be crushed between the wheels, that's why) is that there was a futuristic Audi to admire. Overall there is no reason why this film should have been made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Asimov must be turning in his grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Alex Proyas's unique and interesting Dark City, and critics calling I, Robot an exciting and intelligent sci-fi, this was a real shocker for me. I had high hopes for this movie. I love Asimov's work, and I had nothing against Will Smith either, as I had enjoyed his performance in both Men in Black and Independence Day.Unfortunately, I, Robot proved to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is not 'clever' and 'philosophical' - it is an insult to intelligence. I was literally knocking my head against the wall one scene after another. Innumerable stupidities, glaring plot holes, illogical characters, dismal acting and lots of intrusive product placements. And you constantly have a feeling that the whole movie is just a vehicle for Will Smith - another product placement, you could say. Everything is written around him, whether it makes any sense or not.It is an abomination for both Asimov fans and intelligent moviegoers in general. I don't mind a dumb movie, if it's pure tongue-in-cheek entertainment, but I can get really upset when sheer dumbness and incredibly lazy screen writing is sold to us (and hailed by critics &amp; audiences) as 'smart' and 'thought-provoking'.I, Robot is a serious 'Bottom 10' contender for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last week I saw the film for the second time and now I understand the end, thus the meaning and purpose of the story line much better than by watching it for the first time. Del Spooner (Will Smith) a cop who wishes back the good old days distrusting the new NS 5- robots has to investigate the suspicious death of Dr. Alfred Lannig, the head developing technician at U.S. Robotics. Of course Spooner suspects a robot of murder but nobody believes that a robot can commit a crime because they are "impeccably safe" through the 3 laws. When Spooner is going on investing he finds out that somebody wants to discourage him from solving the case and of course there are always robots which make his detecting difficult. At the end he finds out that VIKI, the Central processing unit of U.S. Robotics orders the NS 5-robots to kill Spooner and therefore to obstruct the solve the murder of Lanning and to take control over the world only along the lines "the people have to be protected from themselves". The movie shows the background of what can happen, if a company which has already distributed a robot for nearly every person on the planet can manipulate them so that they will do anything what the company wants. At the end it was Lenning, who recognized the problem and step in Spooner by committing suicide, the only way how to contact him and of course by the developing of Sunny, who has the requirements to defeat VIKI and its system. Will Smith, Alan Tudyk and director Alex Proyas have done an excellent job in producing a well made film in all parts, which makes the people think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for 'I, Robot', I knew I was going to like it. And that is not because I am a huge Will Smith fan (the trailer does not show the shower scene, nor do I particularly want to see him in the shower), or because I am an Asimov fan (I read the books afterwards). It was just very simply because I liked the idea of a robot committing a murder, because its a bit different to the usual summer action films of swords/guns/kill/maim. Once in there the film started (well, my friend spilt her nachos with cheese sauce everywhere during the trailers and we spent about five minutes clearing it up, but luckily we did not miss any of the actual movie) and I found the beginning very attention-grabbing. Then suddenly you are catapulted into Will Smith's bedroom and this Stevie Wonder music starts playing, and then you see that Will Smith's character dresses like Shaft but with Converse. I do not think that this movie is a two-hour converse commercial. It is just a way to point out that Spooner is a technophobe. The scene with the woman pointing out that Spooner is an *ass***** cracked me up, as did the look on Spooner's face when she said it, so the movie was so far so good. I liked Spooner's character already. When Spooner heads to USR, everyone in the cinema kind of breathed a longing sigh when they saw that lovely Audi. I don't think anyone took their eyes off it until they put it into the car park. And then everyone went 'ugh' when they saw Lanning's blood on the floor. As the movie progressed I liked it more and more, especially when the character Sonny was introduced. Sonny has to be the best CGI character I've ever seen, and he is ironically the movie's best way of expressing emotion. One of the only things I didn't get was why Spooner didn't notice that Sonny has these bright blue eyes and the others don't - is the guy a homicide detective or not? But that can be overlooked.The last action scene where Spooner has to destroy VIKI was breathtaking, and I found the ending one of the best a movie has ever had...I mean, it was just so sweet the way Sonny's dream came true. So, I, Robot - I would very highly recommend it. Its my favourite movie (and my brother's), and you should see it just for the character of Sonny alone, especially if you are an action/sci-fi/mystery junkie. Enjoy!irobotfan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than I Thought (may contain spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to "I, Robot" simply because I was bored and needed something to do on a Saturday. I was expecting a flick where I was reasonably entertained for two hours, but one that I would probably stick in the "good, not great" bin, which is where so much of the summer movies eventually end up. What I got, however, was an engaging film that managed to maintain my interest and full attention all the way through.Will Smith is a bonafide movie star. His screen presence and wry wit make him a marketable asset that will continue to land starring roles for years to come. (My God, has he always been that buff??) He was good in Independence Day, very good in Men In Black, and exceptional here.I was also impressed with the plot. In today's world, where we have become increasingly dependent on machines, and probably will continue to do so, this film did a great job outlining a future society in which mankind's dependence has reached its highest possible level. The unconditional belief and trust in the "3 Laws" has blinded mankind to the fact that one unscrupulous machine with delusions of grandeur can bring the whole system crashing down.I doubt that robots, like the ones seen in this movie, will be mass-marketed in my lifetime. However, if I was to ever have one in my home, I would not want it to look human. Manufacturers try their best to make machines as "user-friendly" as possible, so that we will more readily accept them. In the future, that may mean giving them a human face, and as close a thing to human emotions and idiosyncracies as technology has come up with. The problem is, technology, ALL technology, is subject to malfunctions. And the larger the scope, the larger the failure. And this movie did a great job illustrating that when a society's dependence on technology has surpassed its ability to cope with such a failure, it's all the more terrifying.At first, it look like the robot, Sonny, was going to be the antagonist for Will Smith's technology-shunning cop. But gradually, his "character" makes the transition from adversary to ally, eliciting genuine sympathy when it looks like his quest to more thoroughly understand his emotions will be quashed. (Note: Watch the Star Trek: Next Generation episode "Measure of a Man", for a similar storyline.)I sincerely hope this movie does not spawn a sequel. A large part of the allure of fantasy and sci-fi is the ability for us to ask ourselves "What if...?" At the end of this movie, when mankind's self-imposed veil of ignorance has been shattered, one is left to wonder where the world would go from there. No definitive answers, just more questions. But sci-fi stories like this one don't need to have a definitive ending. We viewers don't need to have everything wrapped up in a big red bow. The future is uncertain... that's why it's the future! Closure is not necessary, because it's not possible.This movie did not even come close to rivaling "Spider-Man 2" or "Shrek 2" in total box office gross, but I have to admit that I enjoyed "I, Robot" just as much, if not more. My score: 10/10.</fullReview>

It was much better than A.I. (sorry, Steve), and Will Smith's wisecracks moved the movie along. The absolute only thing that I didn't like about the movie was the spinning/Matrix/Superbowl effect. They used it a lot when they were on the rafters in V.I.K.I.'s brain. All in all this is probably the best story about robots, and probably the best film adaptation of an Asimov book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love movies of this genre ("AI: Artificial Intelligence" being the first one that comes to mind, as well as "Bicentennial Man") but this movie just left me flat.Will Smith plays, well, Will Smith, reminding me of his acting in "Men in Black." Smart comments, little puns and double entendres, etc. etc. I thought Bridget Moynahan's character was weak, offering little in the way of explanations, unless it's because I was so bored and paying little attention in general.The graphics (robots, CGI, action sequences, and yes, the final 20 exciting minutes) were superbly done, but personally I was glad the film was over. I had the plot figured out pretty much right away, and getting to that point just seemed to take forever. I didn't feel any attachment or feelings towards the characters, I don't think any of the human characters (Smith, Moynahan, and Adrian Ricard as Smith's grandmother) were developed enough to actually feel any compassion or that rooting-for-the-good-guy feeling.All in all, not a complete waste, but surely not what Asimov had in mind when he wrote his stories. I give this movie 4 starts specifically for the CGI effects alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of latter-day sci-fi movies seem to feature both interesting stories and real eye candy. The latter is helped immensely by computer wizardry and by seeing these great visuals on a high-definition DVD. This movie is no exception; it's cool to watch. If you have the opportunity, see "I, Robot," on Blu-Ray, too, because there are some amazing scenes.Yet, I thought the best part of this movie was the story, not the audio or visuals. The best part of the story centered around a robot, and whether that robot was good or evil. That's the focal point of this whole story and it's a hard one to figure. Only in the last minutes, after a number of twists and turns. do we - and the characters in the film - find out.Will Smith and Bridge Moynahan play the main characters. Smith is his normal cocky and ultra-smug self. I would have found him funny if I hadn't seen this act so many times in the past. He and Chevy Chase: the world's most smug actors, or at least the roles they play. Smith's a good actor, though. By the way, Will, as lawman "Del Spooner," takes beatings from robots and car accidents that would kill hundreds of men but he just gets a few scratches. Moynahan looks and sounds very much like Sandra Bullock in this film.The coolest "people" are the robots, led by the aforementioned main one, "Sonny." He (it) looked a lot like famous cyclist Lance Armstrong.Anyway, this is an entertaining film, and that's the name of the game so it is definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am amazed when Robots act like humans, but I am more amazed when Humans act like robots...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler Everyone has accepted the presence of robots in human society except for Det. Del Spooner (Will Smith), who continually regards them with suspicion. The opening sequence shows him pursuing a robot running with a woman's bag. He tries to arrest the robot thinking it's a snatcher, but it turns out the robot was only ordered to get the bag that contains the inhaler of its master, a woman suffering from asthmatic attack. Spooner is really an oddity because he is very old-fashioned in a highly technological world. He uses an outdated motorcycle that drives on gas, wears a 30-year old pair of Converse sneakers (free plugs), and even uses an antiquated remote controlled JVC machine that can already be operated through voice commands. As such, he is the perfect antithesis to highly mechanized robots.Spooner is then called to investigate the suicide of a brilliant scientist, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell of "Babe"), the man who created robots and its laws for U.S. Robotics (USR.), owned by the Bill Gates-like character, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood of "Double Jeopardy".) He is assisted in his snooping around by USR's robot psychiatrist, Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan of "The Recruit"). He correctly deduces that it was not Dr. Lanning who killed himself but his latest creation, a robot who calls himself Sonny. He is able to trace Sonny's hiding place inside Dr. Lanning's room, but Sonny manages to escape with Spooner in hot pursuit.Dr. Calvin refuses to believe that it was Sonny who killed his own creator. He's the exact opposite of Spooner in that she has a totally different perspective about robots, believing they were created only to serve humans. But as the story develops and Spooner's life becomes more and more in danger as he faces a series threats in the hands of robots (one exciting sequence shows him inside a house being demolished by a giant bulldozer of a robot), her belief about robots being totally subservient to human gradually changes. Together, they uncover something that threatens the human race as the machines have evolved and now want to take over.A key factor in the story is the character of Sonny, a robot with very human traits and even learns how to wink. Sonny is aware that Dr. Lanning built him for a purpose, but he cannot figure out what the purpose is, even if he somehow dreams about it. Eventually, Spooner realizes that Dr. Lanning created Sonny as a clue, like "Hansel and Gretel following the breadcrumbs along the trail." The design and effects people did a great job in coming up with a sympathetic, innocent-looking robot in Sonny who everyone would think is a villain but actually develops a distinct emotional connection with Calvin and Spooner.The film is actually a dazzling combination of high-tech action flick, a computer generated special effects sci-fi movie, and a murder mystery. The sequence where Spooner is attacked by a phalanx of robots in a highway is quite mind-boggling. But of course, you have to suspend your disbelief all throughout to be able to fully enjoy the movie. The scary climax shows Spooner, Calvin and Sonny in an action-filled final showdown with rampaging robots in the mammoth USR headquarters, a glass and metal structure that is a character in its own right.Director Proyas succeed in creating a believable futuristic world populated by robots. It's different from the cinematic modernized environment of "The Fifth Element" where cars can fly but more like just a realistic progression from our real world. What makes the story even more thrilling is the fact that it takes place just as the latest robotic model, the NS-5 automated domestic assistant (where Sonny belongs), is about to be mass marketed to the public. They are designed to replace earlier models who are more loyal to man. It turns out they are the ones with the mean streak in them.Will Smith gives a witty portrayal of Spooner, delivering his clever one-liners with enough wit and aplomb. Bridget Moynahan gives good support as the addled Dr. Calvin and James Cromwell is very persuasive as the late Dr. Lanning, even in the scenes where he is just shown in holograms. But the real stars of the film are the designers and technicians who came up with the robots and a unique visual style that gave Chicago a new breathtakingly beautiful metropolitan skyline and landscape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>clever idea which starts badly and finishes well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Artificial Intelligence and our dependency upon machines. A subject area so frequently asked, that it's a wonder we ever get anything done. Stretching back to the 1920s and "Metropolis" cinema has raised this topic many times, and often the end result has been negative. In 2004's "I, Robot", the notion of robots and their role in society was brought up. In a story involving artificial intelligence and a not too distant future where robots were everywhere, the film deals with the subject area brilliantly. Led by a surprisingly good performance by Will Smith, it is an enjoyable film which is ruined only slightly by it's ridiculously large number of product placements throughout.The year is 2035 and robots are everywhere. Doing small jobs like rubbish collection and dog walking, they are humanities friends. That is the view of everyone that is except for Detroit cop Del Spooner (Will Smith). With a strong hatred of robots, Spooner feels something is going to go wrong. Unfortunately for humanity, he just might be right."I, Robot" starts off badly. Attempting to set the scene by introducing our character and his surroundings, the film manages to contain more product advertisements in it's first twenty minutes, than you get during the entire of the Superbowl. From Spooner's interest in 'classic' shoes through to the emblem on his car, the film's beginning smacks of product placement. Luckily for the film and the audiences however, this placement does eventually stop.After some of the film is paid for by the lucrative advertising connections, the story does actually take off at a decent speed. Introducing the idealistic robot psychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) and the 'unique' robot Sonny (Alan Tudyk), we slowly begin to become immersed in a tense 'who dunnit' story with large amounts of action and a detailed philosophy on existence.The philosophy involved is remarkably logical actually. Far too often in Hollywood the combination of philosophy and action is ridiculously unbalanced. Whether in the second Matrix film where they stupidly fitted a complex and confusing philosophy into one ten minute period, or in other styles, far too often the action is either corrupted by the philosophy or vice versa. Therefore it is actually quite a pleasant surprise for a film to be so exciting, yet so logical.Thanks to the original writings of Isaac Asimov, the story of "I,Robot" works well because the philosophy is an already recognisable one. Asimov's theories on artificial intelligence have been mentioned in countless different films, but few have truly considered the implications of the rules and how you interpret them. For this in itself, "I, Robot" deserves a lot of praise.In terms of acting, "I, Robot" is a surprising experience. When Will Smith first wakes up with his hat on, the first question is how long until he really begins to grate. Amazingly though, like the product placements, after the first twenty minutes, Smith really begins to fit into his role and provides an appealing performance as the pessimistic Spooner.Smith is also assisted by a decent supporting cast. Using the same technology as was used for Gollum in "Lord Of The Rings" Alan Tudyk is brilliant as Sonny the robot with emotions and a heart of gold. The highlight of the supporting stars though is the always brilliant James Cromwell as the deceased creator of robots everywhere. Cromwell has made some excellent career choices over the years and once again he shines throughout.It's always a pleasant surprise to encounter an action film which has thought in it too. Adopting the theories of Asimov, "I, Robot" is a well made film with huge amounts of action and some deeply philosophical questions about existence. Sadly though, the film is let down due to an irritating first twenty minutes. Setting the scene and exploring a leading character is never a problem, but when a film sells it's soul with excessive, not even subtle, product placement, any dignity it has goes out the window. Whoever chose to allow such blatant disregard for the intelligence of the viewer should know better, mainly because "I,Robot" deserves more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Insult To Turkeys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A jaw-droppingly dreadful movie that has no redeeming feature. It starts as a blaxploitation movie and then deteriorates. The characters are one dimensional (In James Cromwell's case this is literally true!!)and the acting makes Sylvester Stallone appear as one of the great thespians of our time. The huge amount of money spent on this film whether for Mr Smith's fee or the tired computer effects could more usefully have been spent on alleviating world poverty and still have left some over for a new series of Baywatch. If the tone of this is faintly hysterical then it can only mean that I'm recovering from the catatonic shock that this movie plunged me into. The tragedy is that the story is 'adapted' from one of the great Science Fiction novellas but the hoofprints of the money-men's presence are stamped all over it. The casting of Will Smith does him and the film no favours, Smith is a comedian/comic actor famous for his wit, here he is asked to be serious and responds with a fixed grimace and a beanie pulled down over one eye, his limitations brutally exposed. One can suppose that the financing for the film was dependent on Smith's presence but it results in the film being top heavy and flatulent. The rest of the cast will probably want to erase this from their resumes but at least they are never asked to be more than shadows and they respond magnificently!! As for Alex Proyas' 'diection', one wonders, in the case where one is passed a 'star' and computer generated sets, if the the director becomes anything other than a technician but the buck presumably still stops with him. To be scrupulously fair I must concede that I watched this film the day after I had watched 'The Hours' in which there is great acting, direction, characterisation, great music and a conspicuous lack of computer trickery, so 'I Robot' suffered by comparison, but it would also have suffered if I'd watched it after enjoying a vintage episode of 'Happy Days'!!!!</fullReview>

The plot is terrible, the acting miserable, and the graphics are blah. Isaac Azimov would turn over in his sleep if he knew about this movie. The movie reminded me of a cross between TRON and STARSHIP TROOPERS with bits of INDEPENDENCE DAY and ALIEN thrown in. Also, Will Smith did a better job of acting in the movie Independence day and that movie wasn't much better. Of course it's my opinion that Will Smith never was or ever will be an actor.

		<shortDescription>A film done right even if not entirely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, what I find impressive about the new technology of today is the fact that any SF movies that take place in a futuristic Earth or any other SF movies that have a bright and colorful sun, sky and clouds are computer generated images pasted onto green walls and I, Robot which is a futuristic SF film obviously has it. If you just stopped doing whatever you're doing at the moment and thought only about the green walls and then the final computer generated but real-like images put on screen and successfully achieved like that somehow because of the green walls involved your mind is just blown away about the basic idea(s) of the process and that's the case with me. I just find that whole idea of filmmaking so interesting. Now, for what I personally think of I, Robot first of all is that the special effects are powerfully irresistible! These special effects are so, so good that the Academy Awards should have definitely given it the Oscar but I'm disappointed that it was beaten down by apparently even better special effects from the Spider-Man 2 movie. I've seen the Spider- Man 2 movie and in my honest opinion I think it is I, Robot that best deserved the Oscar. Furthermore I thought that the special effects of the robots added with the red light on their chest is so spectacular! What's more is that I, Robot's narrative is gripping, its gun fighting car action sequence is exciting, so wild and devastating and finally when it comes to the Will Smith's character he has the perfect charm and really intrigued me. I also forgot to say that I think that the exploration of what developed technology in the near or far future can hold for mankind is more than essential cinema. The main problem about this movie however is that it isn't thought- provocative enough, the action feels a bit routine and does not have enough of an independent feel to it and lacks in being amazingly spectacular and the result from it is that I, Robot is less than a fully poignant action-SF movie. Sad. And the ending was a little unclear. But, despite these flaws, I, Robot stays a film done right My rating for the movie: 7.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Isn't Going Anywhere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With many of these Blockbuster films that came out in the mid 2000's, I ended up pretty much giving them a 7/10. I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed Roland Emmerich's "The Day after Tomorrow", and both of these movies ended up being part of the family DVD collection. Since then, I've ended up doing a little research and realised that "I, Robot" shares very little with it's source material, but then is one of those adaptations that strangely never bothered me.In 2035, robots are used as servants for almost everything, and none seem to display any negativity or objection. Programmed with the three Laws of robotics directives: Never harm a human or let a human come to harm, always obey humans unless this violates the first Law and finally to protect its own existence (Unless this violates the First or Second Laws). The co-founder of U. S. Robotics, dies after falling several stories from his office window. His death is ruled as suicide, but Detective Spooner (Will Smith), who knew Lanning as a friend believes otherwise.Will Smith is very good as a hard-nut detective. Of course he is one of the most likable stars and I had hoped from all the trailers and marketing they showed, he would keep it up consistency throughout the films running time and he really did. Alan Tudyk did a wonderful job as the voice of Sonny. I'm really glad that the character is developed so well, but I wish there had been more screen time dedicated to him. The female scientist played by Bridget Moynahan however, looked pretty lost when it came to filming certain scenes and feels greatly underwritten.Final Verdict: If you're looking for a decent pop-corn flick, "I, Robot" will more than enough satisfy. However, I don't think it's going to entertain enough to live a longer life than the year it came out. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good?but Could've Been A lot Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C- For quite some time I struggled with the rating I wanted to give this film. Was it extraordinary? Or was it terrible? After recently buying the DVD and seeing it again, I've come to the final verdict. From my perspective, it had the potential to be the next "Blade Runner"; whether you view it as a rip-off or just having striking similarities is up to you. Either way, the end result was a vivid script watered down to fit the summer blockbuster typical dismal flick. Will Smith is an exceptional actor, as well all know. But here his performance was like watching two different actors. I would say more than half the time Smith delivers cliché, predictable comedic dialogue. For example, "Oh, hell no!!" He then spends 30% of the movie giving us a deeper, more emotionally driven performance. The mix dilutes his character to the point Del Spooner is just another 'rouge cop' with a gun character, which we have seen a thousand times courtesy of Steven Segal and Shaft. Bridget Moynahan plays her role so dryly I really didn't end up caring for her character at all. Shia LaBeouf's presence wasn't necessary at all, basically just pointless. The best actors in the film were undoubtedly James Cromwell and Alan Tudyk, both who gave the film the intensity and mystery that keeps it weakly on its feet.One other thing I have to pick apart is the atmosphere doesn't feel all that futuristic. Only a few shots reminded me this took place in the future at all. One reason I rate it up in itself is because Marco Beltrami does the score, and so I was elated to hear it. He's never disappointed be it "Blade 2" or "Hellboy". For instance, the thrilling climax at VIKI's main frame ?tower-thingy as Will Smith slides down the (cables I guess) was an epic shot, but the moment is nearly stripped of all its power as Smith says, "You so have to die!". Wait, what the f*ck? Then a dramatic chorus plays as the nanites spread, but he damage is already done. While I find its worth checking out if you haven't seen it, don't expect a truly remarkable or ground breaking piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find this movie creative and far-fetched.I think it's creative because it is set in the year 2023 and robots have been invented.I think it's far-fetched because it seemed that the makers were trying to make the film longer by adding some stuff that wasn't necessary.It's about this scientist or doctor who designs a more up to date version of the other robots.When the scientist happens to commit suicide one detective gets very suspicious about the new robots and tries to find the missing answers to the scientist's death.When the new robots get delivered to the city,they have a revolution and set up a curfew.The detective tries to shut down the main machine but will he succeed?I enjoyed this movie,but I found a bit of it far-fetched and made me give it a seven.I,Robot can keep many entertained with the action.Will Smith put on a good performance as usual.Recommended to Will Smith fans ,sci-fi fans and if you liked the movie "Robots".I thought it was great,but I didn't love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most definitely one of 2004's best blockbusters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith films are always worth watching. They aren't always very good; but they're always worth watching. The reason that they're always worth watching is that they all have one thing in common; Will Smith. Will Smith has always been worth watching; from the early days in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, to today in I, Robot; the guy has a very pronounced star power. He more than has enough to carry a film all on his own, as he proved with Men in Black and Wild Wild West?but wait; there actually is a film under here.I, Robot is adapted from a novel by cult sci-fi writer, Isscar Asimov. It is evident that the film is adapted from a book throughout, as, despite all the explosions and stunts; the film does feel very old-school, and that is rare in today's blockbusters. Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a police inspector with a prejudice against robots. The story really starts when Dr. Alfred Lanning, the creator of the robots is killed in an apparent suicide. Will Smith, however, refuses to believe that this man merely killed himself and, naturally, believes that a robot is the murderer; and proceeds to investigate. As you may have guessed from that description; this film takes obvious influence from classics such as Blade Runner. With it's vision of the future, the film does feel very much like a lighter version of said film throughout. The first thing you will notice about I, Robot is that Will Smith isn't believable as a police inspector. It is set in the future, and maybe in the future police inspectors will be smart talking, cocky, back-chatting, swaggering womanisers; but it just seems like he was cast because he's Will Smith. However, as I mentioned earlier; Will Smith has the star power, and he is the reason to watch; so as far as I'm concerned, he can be as unbelievable as he wants and I'll still watch. The rest of the cast is pretty much irrelevant; they all perform to an adequate standard, but overall; they are testament to Will's star power. Alex Proyas, a man that made his name with the fairly rated; The Crow, takes the directors chair. Proyas isn't a director that will be featuring in any 'best director of all time' discussions, but he does a good job here. The film looks lovely, and it's well paced. Although it features explosions and high-octane stunts (which are all well executed), the film obviously wants to make it's story the main focus; and that is admirable in any film, especially a blockbuster. Not only is the story behind I, Robot engaging and interesting; but it's also deep and complex enough to get you thinking. The point behind I, Robot is even relevant to today's world; and that's not something that every blockbuster does! I, Robot is definitely one of the better blockbusters of summer 2004. Although Spider-Man 2 easily edges it out, there is no shame in being second to that. I, Robot is a glorious winner that does action and storytelling, which will please everyone; and it is, therefore, hugely recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I had more expectations about the movie. But I think with the thought it had been made for the big public a very good movie.I'm more a fan of the Caliban series. What I really missed were the switching views on the three main role players. Del Spooner, Susan Calvin and Sonny. Now it's all by the view of Del Spooner. Witch makes it a A to B movie witch it shouldn't be. How they can make it a better second movie is to make it a psychological detective movie with twisting story line. I think thats more important than action like we have seen in this one. And as base thought, how to survive a evolution you can't stop and how do robot's thinks different from humans or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of things from Asimov books</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child I devoured as many Asimov books as I could. I really love the technical SF books written with a vision that promises us a bright long happy future.Bicentennial Man was not close to the story written by Asimov. I, Robot is on many points equally far away from the story. That's why the start of the movie deservedly says "Suggested by..." and not "Inspired by..." and certainly not "Based on...".But I'm quite sure that Isaac Asimov would have liked this movie much better than Bicentennial Man. So many things from his other books are included in this movie, and so many important parts of the story "I, Robot" are included, that Asimov lovers really have to see this movie.The end is a real cliffhanger. Signs of the zeroth law (law numero 0) of robotics are being shown at the end. In later stories, Asimov added that zeroeth law, making a total of 4 laws of robotics:0) A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.1) A robot may not harm a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, except where that would conflict with the Zeroth Law.2) A robot must obey orders given it by a human being, except where that would conflict with the Zeroth and First Laws.3) A robot must protect its own existence except where that would conflict with the Zeroth, First or Second Laws. I hope they make a sequel to this movie. Maybe "We, Robots"? With Daneel Olivaw as the main character, of course, the powerful robot from so many Asimov books, like The Foundation series. Because that's who Sonny is...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year that has generally been disappointing in terms of the big budget films. It finally seems that the 2nd half of the year could be getting better. Spidey's second outing was excellent, while Bourne Supremacy and indeed this have been good. Far eclipsing earlier big budget limp, flops, Troy, Chronicles Of Riddick, Passion Of Christ, King Arthur and Van Helsing. The bad films still though outweighing good films like Spidey, and Harry Potter three. Still overall this year, like last year has had a good amount of good films, largely made up from the smaller films like Shaun Of The Dead, Lost In Translation and School Of Rock. There is a promising list of upcoming films coming out from directors like Oliver Stone, Michael Mann and also Terry Gilliam, so overall I can't really be too disappointed at this year's standard. Indeed it's almost up at last year's level, but last year had Return Of The King to really up it. I suppose the lack of any new middle earth adventures was always going to make it a difficult year to be able top 2003. Anyway as a fan of Alex Proyas, whose earlier works The Crow, and Dark City are personal favourites, I was looking forward immensely to this film. Now I truth be told, after the first proper trailer, I was nervous. The first footage trailer, not the spoof NS5 advert, did kind of make it look as if the film would suck, and be a brainless blockbuster, but then again that was a similar problem with the Dark City promotion. The trailers after that improved immensely thankfully while still leaning towards the blockbuster angle. The film has blockbuster elements but has more too it, hence the above average ratings compared to your usual action extravaganza. I Robot is a very good film. It's good fun, it's exciting and despite feelings that it has picked bits from superior similarly science fiction films like the Terminator and Minority Report, it's good stuff. Now this is nowhere near as good as Proyas's early works but still it has some depth and raise questions without really having the philosophical rich textual side that his films The Crow, Dark City and indeed classics like Blade Runner, Minority Report and The Matrix had. They were films that can be vastly repeated for the literary, biblical and philosophical references and the great touches. While I-Robot raises interesting questions and has some biblical and sociological connotations, they are questions raised in many other films. It does not seem original, but then again many of the films raising points which appear in this film were inspired by the short stories of Isaac Asimov who wrote the original story this film was based off. All his stories revolved around technology and robots in particular and were based around the three laws of robotics. 1 a Robot will not harm a human being. 2. A Robot must obey a human at all time except when it conflicts with the first law and 3, A Robot can defend itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws. These laws that Asimov created are essential in this film and they are key to how the plot of I-Robot transpires. The plot revolves around Del Spooner. He's a cop who has a deep dislike for Robots and despairs that at this time (2035) humans have become very dependant on them. When the creator of the NS-5 robots and all robots, apparently commits suicide, Spooner is called in to investigate. He is suspicious of the death and believes it could be a murder but since the room that doctor Lanning was in when he jumped was locked and no-one else was in it, bar some Robot's, Spooner believes it must have been a Robot. His prejudice drives him throughout his investigation; he suffers from tunnel vision in his pursuit of bringing down this Robot and in effect the whole lot of them. It is only later as the plot unfolds he looks at the whole picture and realises his actions have been wrong. The main suspect is a seemingly malfunctioning Robot, who calls himself Sonny and seems to have developed human emotions. Sonny is found at the crime scene, hiding when Spooner investigates and fleas from the scene. Later Spooner has him in for questioning and is very suspicious at how Sonny is behaving. As the plot transpires, he begins to suspect Lawrence Robertson, Lanning's partner, of involvement in Lanning's death considering it was on the eve of a massive launch of a new NS-5 that will be in nearly every home in America. As the film progresses Spooner begins to uncover the reasoning behind Sonny's emotions and uncovers a frightening truth. The plot is clever and develops well as it seems a glitch in the 3 laws means trouble for the human race as the Robot's AI's develop.The cast are good. I like Will Smith but I was weary of his casting here. Would it be too Will Smith, as the trailers suggested? Well this is some typical Will talk but Smith does well with a character given some depth. It's a good role that makes up for his two previous disappointing sequels to Bad Boys and Men In Black. It's his best performance since his Oscar nod for Ali. Bridget Moynahan is also good as Robot psychologist Susan Calvin who works for NSR and ends up supporting Spooners investigations after initially believing he was paranoid. Also there is good support from Bruce Greenwood and Chi McBride. However, Alan Tudyk steals the show as Sonny, or should I say Tudyks vocal performance. The robots were a worry in this film because they could have been overdone and they have such cool robots like The Terminator to contend with. The robots are portrayed well in this and especially the most worrying one, Sonny. His character is very good though, and intriguing. His creator has spent time making Sonny unique from his brothers and he develops emotions, has dreams. It raises questions about whether a robot which has essentially it's own soul now and acts and re-acts like a human should have the rights to a proper existence. Sonny has malfunctioned and is to be dismantled but essentially his human characteristics and three thinking could argue that he has a right of existence. After all if a human was in a vegetative state and showed little signs of a soul they would still have a right of existence. Anyone who worried about the portrayal of this robot would be pleasantly surprised. This is largely because Tudyk nails the character so well and makes him very likeable and sympathetic. Alex Proyas is on fine form, and while it isn't him at his wild, dark and goth best he still shows he is definitely a director to look out for. I just hope he doesn't become a director for hire to do blockbusters every 1 or 2 years. I want his next to be meaningful and personal like Dark City and Crow, which were more moderate budget and probably with more creative freedom. A hit like I Robot can only help his choices for his next movie. Visually Proyas has shown he is one of the best in the business. Visually this is good. Not as wild and expressionistic as his other two films but still good. The cinematography is good and crisp with good use of colour and shadow. The production design is based around a future where everything barring the robots is similar to today. It's essentially the present with a little polish a few sliding doors and NS-4's walking your dog. The production design doesn't seem entirely original; it has similarity to Minority Report, including the cars and the general design in architecture. The Robots are nicely designed. It's an interesting design, very similar to Bjork's music video All Is Full Of Love, extremely similar, to the point you feel that the robots are ripped off, but still it's their debut in the world of movies so I'm not to bothered, the problems are surely between the designers of that music video and this movie. The special effects are outstanding, top of the range. The way the robots integrate into crowds of people are impressive and also Proyas uses the visual effects superbly as he did in Dark City. The action here is also great stuff. What you want form a summer movie is spectacular action, style and thrills and you get that. To be honest the film loses a little when it goes into action overdrive in the last half hour. I generally thought that the first hour and a half as the plot develops was the best. Generally Sci-Fi films are stronger in the opening and have most of their action near the end, look at The Matrix, Minority Report. I always love the exposition in these movies. Also kudos to Marco Beltrami who does a good job composing here. The score could have just ripped off many other sci-fi films but it does something that has a unique style and has if anything similarities at times to the score of Dark City. Proyas must have had input in to the score.Overall this is a decent sci-fi movie. Rarely are sci-fi movies very good but this is certainly one of the better in recent years. While it doesn't stand up to the best ones like Terminator, Alien, Blade Runner and Minority Report it is good in its own right and that is first and foremost all you can ask for from a summer blockbuster. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie expecting nothing more than a "humans vs. machines" scifi flick. But I was pleasantly surprised: Will Smith's down to earth character (quite similar to the cop in Bad Boys or the pilot in Independence Day) fits nicely into this murder mystery with very unusual suspects. Another moviegoer next to me said that this was a really good movie, and I think so, too. Will Smith's character in the movie might have rubbed some critics the other way, but judging from the reactions of the audience, it really enjoyed cop Spooner's reactions and comments, aside from the action sequences, of course. Needless to say, the special effects (especially the translucent skin of the robots) and the action sequences impressed me as well. And there was enough time in the movie to also ask some really deep questions about the purpose of being alive and Asimov's Laws. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just because it doesn't follow the book doesn't mean that it is not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From reading the comments posted by others I got the impression that people mainly rated it low because it did not follow the book. Just because a movie does not follow the original work like the Bible does not mean that the movie should not be given a chance. I read the Asimov book, and I went to the theater with my friend who has not. She enjoyed the movie just as much as I did, if not more. I was fascinated by the angle Proyas approached in the novel, and I did not mind one bit that the movie was completely different than the book.Another element of the movie that receives an unfair "bad rap" is the acting. It's no worse than the acting in the Spider-Man movies. I am by no means a fan of Will Smith, but I was a fan of Willem Dafoe, and that mirror scene in Spider-Man made me cringe. Might of worked on stage, Willem, but not on the big screen. I did not find myself cringing at any acting in I, Robot. In fact, the only thing over-the-top sometimes was the special effects. Other than that, nothing made me slink down in my seat and cover my face in shame.One actor that deserves a shout out is Alan Tudyk. I read many comments where people think he just voiced the character of Sonny. Actually, Tudyk pulled a Gollum. This means he put on a weird looking body suit and actually acting out the scenes. Later, CGI used his performance to model the computer graphic robot. Except for a few obvious actions scenes, Tudyk *was* Sonny. My complements to his performance.Hopefully, people will give this movie the chance it really deserves, and not base their decisions on how close it followed the book. I give I, Robot a 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, if average, action romp into the more intellectually diverse works of Issac Asimov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having (marginal) knowledge of some of Asimov's work, I can say for sure that this is not for die hard fans of his literature. However, that is not to say it is void of any enjoyment and fun.Will Smith portrays the movie's protagonist, a technophobic detective with the average action-movie back-story. His appearance breaths life into the film, however it's worth noting that he never strays far from his usual wisecracking persona.The effects in the movie are great, and still hold up reasonably well today. The use of bullet-time is actually rather resigned, considering how overused it became in the post-matrix sci-fi craze. The action is well done, the robots look cool and believable, in part due to Alan Tudyk's calm and effective performance as Sonny.The plot is decent, however lacks the philosophy and intelligence of Asimov's work, leaving it inferior and obtuse in stark comparison. The other main detracting points are a distracting minor role by Shia LaBeouf and the film's incessant use of product-placement advertising. The most blatant offender is an obnoxious promotion of All-Star Converses, which are mentioned verbally at three points in the film.Overall, it's a fun, if average, action romp into the more intellectually diverse works of Issac Asimov. It's kitsch, but you've got to love it.</fullReview>

With modern LCD TV sets and HDMI and Bluray, you can no longer get away with bad cgi. This movie look like a really well made computer game. But it doesn't look the least bit real. And when every action scene in the movie is entirely cgi, it ruins it for me. Personally I prefere real action with stunt men and real props and cars. But if they have to make it entirely cgi, it has to look real.Had the movie been made today in 2008 it would have looked real and I would have been able to focus more on the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining action sci fi flick, marred by product placement and weak adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Asimov is not quite spinning in his grave, but I think he would have a difficult time recognizing his influence in this adaptation of one of his best novels. Yes, the three laws of AI are here, and yes, the basics of the plot are preserved, but that's about where the similarities end. This is an explosive action film with some simple messages about humanity and person hood which have been explored many times before and in more intelligent and challenging ways. Nevertheless, it's also a much better film than I expected it to be.I, Robot asks questions about souls and whether they are a product of human biology or intelligence, but doesn't explore them very deeply. Any depth in this film is directly attributable to Asimov's original material. Mostly, this is a murder mystery with a great deal of unnecessary mechanized violence, car chases, and high speed action. A top cyberneticist has died as a result of a fall from a glass enclosed lab, and the only witness is a robot endowed with not just human intellect, but human emotion. Will Smith is a luddite technophobic detective who quickly becomes convinced that this machine may have murdered the scientist, but why? Will Smith is decent, but the material isn't much of a challenge for him. Bridget Moynahan is good in a somewhat more difficult role. However, the star of the show is a CGI robot played by the wonderful Alan Tudyk - "Sonny".This is definitely a genre film. Even the casting attempts to pull in the sci fi audience - the very recognizable genre star James Cromwell (Star Trek...) Tudyk (Serenity, Firefly). The directing has its moments and the camera-work is sometimes Spielburgian in scope.Recommended for sci-fi action enthusiasts. Others will likely be bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, Robot is one of the most luxurious sci-fi films I have ever seen. The sets have been perfectly created, matching both futuristic buildings as well as older buildings with brick walls. The plot is brilliant, and it heavily focuses on Issac Aismov's theory.However, Aismov's ideas did not include the robots going crazy, but that they coexisted with humans perfectly. The film even goes into some detail about Aismov's zeroth law, if it does not specifically call it that. I'll let you find out what this law is for yourself, don't want to ruin it for you. Another lacking quality would be the characters. Smith's role is somewhat boisterous and this seems to be another movie in which Smith is a macho guy who saves the world, using many of his traditional phrases, EGA "Aw hell no!".Despite these facts, the movie is a success. The robot Sonny steals the scene every time he is shown and the amazing detail which has gone into these humanoids is amazing. Careful time and effort has been put into this movie, and the surprises are plentiful. Based upon Aismov's theories, I think the movie has done him justice and after his actions to make I, Robot a film in a previous decade, he should be pleased with what has been created.</fullReview>

And apparently he's the only one. Of course, this will not last long. But before people start to realize it, a lot of dangerous en exiting things happen.Great special effects, good acting, great music / atmosphere.If you like science fiction movies, you will certainly enjoy this movie. If you don't like science fiction movies there is still a chance you will like this one! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people that I have been to see this with have been very unimpressed, however, I blame those horrible movies that have absolutely no storyline whatsoever and are just overflown with millions of dollars worth of action. "I, Robot" is a masterpiece of work and its fantastic CGI animation is never too little or too much. The fun of the movie is balanced out with a clever storyline, packed with emotion, jokes, mind-blowing equasions and much more. Will Smith is fantastic, as well as his fellow cast members.I also noticed the movies very unusual soundtrack, which plays an enormous part in setting the scenes. Marco Beltrami has done a fantastic job with this distinctive movie soundtrack. This combines the best of action and the best of sci-fi, and I would strongly advise you to watch this. Not one moment of this movie is a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK sci-fi fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But it has nothing to do with Isaac Asimov's robot stories, except for the title and the quoting of the three laws of robotics -- which if memory serves, were created by the book's Susan Calvin and not Dr. Lanning. It's been a lot of years so I could be wrong, of course. This movie is in fact a sort of updated WILD WILD WEST with Smith cracking wise at all the wrong moments while facing insurmountable odds as what seems like millions of evil robots try to kill him in stupendous CGI fashion. Not as bad as WILD WILD WEST but nowhere near as as good as MEN IN BLACK or ENEMY OF THE STATE. The characters are cardboard, especially Bridget Moynihan as Calvin and Bruce Greenwood as the shadowy head of the U.S. Robotics, and play second fiddle to the liberal doses of CGI. The nail-biting ending pitting Smith and his cohorts against the evil U.S. Robotics Co. and its endless robot minions has been seen in several other films, by the way, most noticeably VIRTUOSITY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gave me exactly what I expected, and mind you I didn't expect anything special. It's a lot of special effects, with a jumbled technological plot that posed little interest to me. There have been other films that have explored the idea of either robots or machines taking over the world. "I, Robot" is definitely not an original idea. It has been done before, and in better ways (i.e.: "The Terminator" movies). I've read several comments from people who chose to compliment the special f/x. Yes, they are well-done. The problem is good f/x can never "save" a film for me. Complimenting special f/x is like complimenting someone who just skydived off the Empire State Building and shot an arrow into the Good Year blimp. Sure, it's incredible, but what's the point? F/x are not even somewhat necessary in making a good film. Script and actors are the two elements I favor most, and the script didn't appeal to me. Some of the dialogue is downright awful. To be fair, I'm sure Will Smith was responsible for improvising some of that shoddy dialogue. It's surprising how easily amused people can be. When Smith sneezes and says the line, "Sorry, I'm allergic to bulls**t," a frenzy of laughter arised from the audience in my theater. I, of course, wasn't laughing at that utterly forced, lame piece of dialogue. Smith has talent, but he's at the point in his career where his ego is bringing out the worst in him. He seems to barely make an effort in his role, pumping out stupid one-liners (like the one I just mentioned) even when they have no use in the scene. Bridget Moynahan is one of the most beautiful actresses in the biz right now, and that's why I didn't find her convincing as Smith's co-star. She plays the usual uptight brainiac, who looks more like a Hawaiian Tropic model than a scientist. I doubt an introverted character of her type would have perfectly clear skin. There are much worse movies out there, and I would not classify "I, Robot" as horrible, but it is mediocre and it is dull. And it's not worthy of a strong recommendation. (5 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think a lot of viewers are suffering from a common problem with preferences. First, this is a sci-fi movie, not just a 'summer action movie'. Second, the credits even claim as suggested by the books, not based off the books. If you were to include all of the details from the original story then this movie would be too boring for most I would assume. Third, if the viewer is complaining of the CGI, then they are missing the point completely.Hey, I might have many disagree with me on those points, but personally I do like thriller movies with some deep story to it. I do like some sci-fi as well, with some believable concept.This movie definitely has a believable story (maybe not believable date however) and nice atmosphere to me, and it keeps me re-watching it every now and again. The product placement reeeeeaaally doesn't bother me compared to some other movies, which believe me is way more obvious than this.It does matter what your preferences are, but I think that having more dialogue would have watered down the action, as this event takes place in a short time.There was not as much suspense however. Only a few portions of the movie were there hard conflicts for the character, but this is a 'mystery' movie overall since he is a detective. Also, the random 'jumps' from where he gets his ideas were not too bad, but some of the dialogue was a little simple.But the main thing was the movie made you think about what they're saying, and the story, while still having the action, but I like those kind of movies personally.I think many people may not have liked this movie as much, because it is sort of a cross between action and mystery, and there wasn't enough 'juicy' dialogue to back it up. But that all depends on what the viewers like, but I think the movie was done very well for what its intentions were.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film. This is, without doubt, definitely a contender for film of the year, and will no doubt be memorable for many years to come.It is rare to find a big motion picture event like this, with a big celebrity like Will Smith at the helm, based on a classic story, and still get something relevant and touching.The story is the firm drive behind this film, with the effects never gratuitous. In fact, the plot was quite complex, far more than I would have thought before hand. It played out wonderfully, to an extremely satisfying conclusion.Will Smith as Detective Del Spooner actually played down his well-documented comedy ease, and there were several scenes were the actor came right to the surface. The surprise element of Spooner's robotic arm played very well in the context of the story, and was handled wonderfully.Bridget Moynahan was perfectly cast against Smith, with her character going through a subtle transformation from beginning to end that impressed me greatly. I was also very pleased to see that the cliché of a possible relationship between the two was avoided.James Cromwell, a particular favourite of mine, fit in well, and I was happy to see him play an integral role.In terms of effects, this film has easily the best effects seen for a long time. The level of detail was certainly very impressive, and it heightened the realism of the story greatly.All this add together to create a truly sensational film.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith has posted a few turkeys in the last couple years, but this is not one of them. It is easy to forget there is an interesting storyline here with all the explosions going on, but that being said, the scene in the tunnel is right up there with the Matrix assault on the government building where Morpheus is being held. You can re-watch just that scene over and over and enjoy. Still, the reason this movie works is because it is good science fiction first and an action movie second. Asimov has always had social commentary at the forefront of his writing. I, Robot is no exception - it simply reminds us that whenever we do something to make our lives easier, there is a price to be paid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, a movie that shows the potential of robotic adversaries with all the power (and weaknesses) they have. Despite the fact that Sponer unrealistically kicks their metal buts in the end and moves way too fast, the robots (or at least Sonny) can use their superior strength and control to be quite lethal in combat. There were too many movies in which robots make mistakes while wielding a gun. With instant tracking system and a reaction time of nearly zero, they would normally hit any time they wield a gun - especially one that is highly reliable like a laser. The robots in "I, Robot" actually give this impression ... which is nice. If these guys had accecces to military technology (weapons and armor) they could easily wipe out an entire city and clear the junk until sundown.The idea how the computer decided to put mankind in slavery to keep mankind alive was quite brilliant, although I didn't get it until I read it in the discussion thread. If all of mankind *will* die in the possible wars, it is a better ratio for the first rule to enslave them to keep them alive. A good example that abstract rules - like these three or some other ten - just don't cut it in the real world. Although a higher evolved A.I. would probably seen the course of this robot servant development - like in an Star Trek TOS episode, mankind would - in the long run - become even more dependent of the robots and in the end there wouldn't have been a revolution, just a quite transaction (let the robots decide politics too, after all it's work some other people can do...). On the other hand, an A.I. might have concluded that a major war might break out any second and that there is no time to waste.The visual effect were - of course - stunning and there were way better solutions (e.g. to park cars) than a lot of effects in 'Minority Report'. Here they didn't look silly, they were actually quite clever. Unfortunately, they did use massive product placement. I was under the (perhaps mistaken) impression that the price of my ticket, the merchandise and the DVD/Video and TV sales cover the price of the movie. Why did they have to advertise certain products? Especially the Audi advertisement was just ... distracting, which is unforgiveable for a movie (I always feel kinda filthy after being targeted from such a 'spot'). Hmmm, perhaps it does shed a bad light on Audi, that they need such films to make people buy their cars (obviously, it's other qualities aren't enough, so we need a Will Smith to promote that brand).All in all it's one of the better movies this year, inferior to "Spiderman 2" and nearly equal to "Shrek 2" (but on the other side of the serious - funny dimension). 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2035, robots are mandatory electronic devices in every home, being the proportion of four men for each robot in the American society. They are built by US Robotics following three basic laws for preservation of the human being, and no robot is allowed to harm a human being in any circumstance. In Chicago, detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who hates robots, is assigned to investigate the suicide of the scientist and his old friend, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), in the facilities of US Robotics. The CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) asks the psychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) to support Spooner in his investigation. Spooner believes that Dr. Lanning was murdered, and looks for the criminal, finding the robot Sonny hidden in Dr. Lanning's room, becoming the prime suspect. While following the hints left by Dr. Lanning, Spooner and Susan are initially misguided, finding the truth in the end. "I, Robot" is a good action sci-fi movie, using elements of "Blade Runner" and "Terminator 2". However, the characters and the society of 2035 are not well-developed, and if the viewer starts questioning details, will find many shallow points and flaws. Therefore, my advice is: do not think too much, and have a good entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Eu, Robô" ("I, Robot")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Steven Segal is too good for such cynical and lazy film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I can say about this brainless megamillion dollar cartoon is: ugh!Screenwriter Akiva Goldsmith (Batman &amp; Robin, Lost in Space) is just about the most incompetent, lazy Hollywood hack there is, and the stench of his dimwitted script obscures any other technical or artistic achievements that slipped in under the producers demand for the most insipid explosions &amp; effects vehicle possible.20 minutes in, after hearing Bridget Moynahan declare the initial murder was obviously suicide with the conviction of a soft-core porn vet for the tenth time, I was ready to turn it off. I wish I had because all we get to see is Smith go through just about all the hotheaded antihero cliché's imaginable in the most predictable manner possible. Unexplainable anonymous murder attempts; the smarmy Machiavellian yet surprisingly helpful corporate mogul; the comely psychologist helping against her own interests; a traumatic childhood accident shown in flashback; a secret near-superhero ability revealed; and of course the dead mentor speaking from beyond the grave. Modernizing the derivate plot all the way into the 80's, we also have a self aware computer with designs for world domination. In perhaps the most cynical display of audience contempt in the history of the big budget action film, there is acompletely superfluous scene at the metronomic halfway point in the movie in which Che McBride demands Smith's badge after a massively destructive chase scene. The requisite robot technobabble sounds like it was cribbed from a third rate Star Trek fanfiction, despite an immense repository of practical dialog straight from decades of Azimov's writings. The dialog in general is so bad it the actors should have just improved the whole thing and the story so insipid I can't imagine it being pitched as anything but a parody. The robots themselves are given no background to speak of except that there are apparently only two models to choose from and there is no economic barrier to owning one. And pretty much the only thing differentiating robots from a human ninja warrior is the artificial limitations set by the three laws of robotics. Oh, and they glow red whenever they decide to "turn off" the three laws and turn evil, just in case us drooling simpletons can't distinguish who is the cannon fodder in a Will Smith/CG robot showdown. "The Transformers" had a far more enlightened look on human-machine interaction and "Mystery Science Theater 3000" had more believable robot personalities.Most of the rest of the film seems to be put together in the same irreverent manner. Considering how many shots are mostly or entirely computer generated, it is obvious most of the film was an afterthought to signing Smith and the obtaining the naming rights, leaving the burden of a finished product solely on the post production teams. Many CG sequences don't even appear finished, and most of my attention during action sequences was spent looking for missing effects that paying attention to the athletically limited blue-screened fighting and monosyllabic trash talking (to mute robots, no less). The actors all seem to know their are in a dud and don't even make an attempt to lift themselves out of their pre-ordained stereotype. The futuristic sets are the same shiny chrome, glass &amp; white styrofoam that hasn't really changed since 2001: A Space Odyssey. But everyone conveniently seems to live in regular late 20th century homes with a few blue LEDs glued on the walls. There is no reason that audiences need to continually subject themselves to this kind of repetitive and superficial film-making. We deserve more than mindless spectacles, and "I, Robot" fails to meet such low expectations despite it's tremendous pedigree. Even more so than recent Bruckheimer stinkfests like Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys II, this movie is purely a heartless exercise of marketing and financial muscle.1/2* out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film!I Robot not only entertained me but opened my eyes to the dangers that the future potentially possesses. This was the best action film I've ever seen, but also concealed a subtly crafted message about the dangers of mankind becoming over reliant on artificial intelligence.When the film finished I felt like a nymphomaniac denied an orgasm. It was a thrilling and exhilarating journey that titillated and excited at every turn. Will Smith gave the performance of a lifetime that made other his impressive roles (such as in Ali and the Pursuit of Happiness) appear shallow and amateur. Smith has firmly cemented his place as the best actor of all time with this stunning and era defining performance as a man who is terrified of robots.I thoroughly recommend this film to anybody, young or old, as it not only entertains but forces you to contemplate what it is to be a human being! I was contemplating my very existence for hours afterwards. The only negative of this film is that every film you watch post-I Robot appears vastly inferior.

		<fullReview>Firstly, this is not an Asimov film, apart from his three laws and the names of a few characters and companies, it bears no relation to any of Asimov's stories. In fact there is a writer from 1939 Eando Binder who wrote I, Robot.Secondly The effects are awful. I was never convinced on taken in by the robots or the action sequences. The movements of the robots and trucks and that ghastly shoot-out in the tunnel were far from realistic. Physics, encompassing the strength of our gravity, would never allow machinery and gizmos to move the way they do. It is not convincing.Thirdly, nor is Will Smith convincing. He seems only to have mastered the depth of character of a cardboard cut-out. The character of Spooner came to him on paper as a script. Unfortunately he chose to portray the paper and not the part. It can be confusing for a boy who achieved his high point as a sit-com rapper (!). He is rubbish.The whole is amusing for the time it takes to watch it, but like anything that emanates from Hollywood, you chew it up and spit it out. Its not worth swallowing. It can only be seen and discarded. American consumerism in its worst incarnation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, the special effects in this movie are amazing, the set design and overall look of this movie are great. The robots look great, and there's some great set-pieces. Unfortunately this technology is wasted on it's lead actor, WILL SMITH. When he's not acting all (fake)'thug', he's irritating as a 'serious' actor, and has zero personality to carry a picture (He is what ruined ID4, as well) He seems to want to flex his pecs, wear stupid 'thug-like' clothes, and throw that stupid 'lazy-slack-jawed-jamaican' twang to his voice. Once it's makers got it into their heads to cast (the unfunny) WILL SMITH, the movie then becomes a vehicle for his low-rent 'EDDIE MURPHY-isms'. All imagery takes a back set to it's star. With these effects, there's no way the imagery should. But intelligent sci-fi is abandoned, in favour of a WILL SMITH comeback movie.Not the best. Although, this movie didn't flop, i don't think it made the expected 'gross', it was hoping on. When it's makers are finished, tying up it's (supposedly) fail-safe, audience-demographic, will they realise (that despite being not too bothered, above and beyond the call of money) that they've taken an intelligent novel, and turned it into a happy-meal tie-in. This is what was done with MINORITY REPORT (but at least, that was rightfully humour-free) All in all, a very visual movie, but it's many designers have put more work into this project, than the casting director. Everyone involved(except Mr SMITH) has been shortchanged, including it's audience, who want, and deserve better, than a kiddie movie, dressed up as a......kiddie movie.Technically superior, yet emotionally dead10 out of 10 (for the effects) 1 out of 10 (For the casting of THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR)Making this movie a shallow 3 out of 10</fullReview>

The SFX really make the movie cheap and artificial... robotic. Will Smith is OK, he can't do much to lift this humming electronic shell above ground, but the female sidekick is a bore. Lame casting is one thing, but a script that stays so "PG-13, read back the order": that truly is a lethal sin. No wonder the rest of the script is just pedestrian and never brings anything genuinely gripping.As for direction I can only remember show-off shooting angles in a totally uninspired storytelling approach. I remember Dark City as a disturbing sci-fi experience, yet it seldom relied on SFX so I can only imagine that Alex Proyas got himself into something too big for his own creative camera here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let the title fool you...this film was surely not made by robots. I, Robot stars Will Smith as Del Spooner, a Chicago homicide detective in a 2035 world where robots are a part of everyday life from shipping to cooking. An apparent suicide has taken place at U.S. Robotics; the victim being founder Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell). But Spooner has suspicions; could one of the very robots made under his mind be the cause of such death? His investigation alongside robot expert Dr. Susan Calvin (Moynahan) leads them to a robot with human-like qualities that attempts to flee the crime scene and presents action of a nature that goes against the Three Laws of Robotics. However, further examination may reveal the true reason for the crime and the future of robots and mankind across Earth.Both the look and craft of this movie are greatly polished, slowly but surely immersing us into this world of robotics as well as the compelling chain of events taking place. If the characters don't happen to compel, then everything else will. Alex Proyas does a splendid job with the action sequences, all involving robots, especially a smashing truth-unveiler in a freeway tunnel, where the scenery is figuratively and literally eaten up by both cop and bot involved. In fact, Proyas is such a saving grace to some elements that he happens to actively improve some of Vintar &amp; Goldsman's script in the field of character depth. People seem to bash Goldsman for his work on the faulty Schumacher Batman films, but it's a clearly a misstep when you see what's done here. The character of Spooner has proved Will Smith to be an action stud, but sadly more of a comedic edge than a dramatic edge. When the drama is asked of him, it comes off nicely, but it's more likely you'll "haha" at him than "aww".Bridget Moynahan must've been on the bottom of the list of possibles, because her presence here is all but dire. Although she's consistently alongside Smith, they share no chemistry and her attempt to portray a more focused but serious woman, probably as a comedic opposite for Smith, fails. She injects no more human into the picture than Smith does. Speaking of "human", there is one hell of a human robot here, which is surprising for a machine. Presumed robot murderer Sonny, portrayed in voice and motion picture by Alan Tudyk, curiously causes us to generate a small sympathy towards him, considering he's a "unique" robot. As Sonny's broad range of feelings emerge, we begin to question his guilt even more: is he manipulative or just purely innocent? Overall, Tudyk adds a surprising glimmer of humanity to who is ironically the most robotic character in the film. Neither Sonny, the robots, or their world could be achieved without some talented visual effects artists. In the whole context of the movie, the above-average visuals are as immersive as the people who wrote it up.Robots are becoming more and more common in our world today, but is it possible for world domination to be achieved like this? No. Can robots pose a threat to society? Not likely. Can they impact our society? Very likely. The movie isn't likely to change minds on how we think about robots, but as a science fiction film, it shares ideas while preparing us for the very worst, and I stress "very". The movie's vision is purely fictional, and we'll all probably be dead before any robot invasions take place, making the movie's realism a little far-far-fetched. It may not totally succeed as a thought-provoking sci-fi, but it also markets as an action thriller...it hits the jackpot on that part. Despite a rather hollow cast, their action adrenaline combined with A-rate thrills make for a movie that's neither too smart or too dumb to entertain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew-up reading Asimov. The "Foundation" series was great fun. I LOVED his innovations on storytelling, but while I think the "I Robot" series is some of his best work, we're still not talking Dostoevsky here. The "book" will NEVER be the same as the movie. In this case the producers acknowledged it was "based on an/the idea." I've said it elsewhere, but comparing a book to a film is like comparing a painting to a poem. Set reasonable expectations and enjoy things for what they are. Check out the "original" Anthony Burgess novel "A Clockwork Orange" against the Kubrick film. Burgess acknowledged he was a "starving artist" offered a TRUCKLOAD of money to let Kubrick do the film. The original novel and the Kubrick treatment are COMPLETELY different. One favors "nature" over "nurture;" the other switches the two. This is NOT Asimov. Why does that matter? I liked liked it.(Favorite line: I seriously doubt we have 6 minutes.)</fullReview>

Everybody in the world relies on robots, which are programmed to obey "3 laws" which say the must help and obey humans and never harm them in any way. But detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) does not trust them. One day, he received a call from the United States Robotics (USR) about a recent death of renowned robot scientist Dr. Alfred J. Laning. Spooner immediately blames this death on Sonny, a "unique" robot found at the scene of the crime. Will Smith is at his charismatic best. James Crowmell (whom I adore) is at his usual high standard, Bridget Moynahan is OK in her role and Bruce Greenwood does what Brice Greenwood does and not a lot more. But while Will Smith is at the core of the movie and generally carries most of it, for me the heart of the movie comes from Alan Tudyk as Sonny. However Shia Lebouf is awful. Cringe worthingly bad. He is the weak link in the cast, his character serves no purpose at all!! It just seemed like he was there for no other reason other than to have Lebouf in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not really a recent film (2004) but I still love it. The genre of this movie is a mix of action/sci-fi I think (and maybe a little bit mystery).In the film, we are in 2032, everybody has a robot (at the beginning of the film NS-4), in each house there is a robot. And a new type of robot (NS-5) will replace the old robots (NS-4). Those new robots are connected to the computer center of USR ( the company which is doing those robots). It is not complicated to understand that there will be a "robot revolution" where the robots (NS- 5 only) will try to be the masters of the United States. Somebody is using the computer center of USR to instruct the NS-5, but who ? That's THE question. I don't really watch a lot of movies, but I really think it's quite a good film if you like movies with robots, action and some suspense?For me, in each film, there is a message, something that the producer want us to be careful with in our life. In this case, he want us not be dependent of machines, robots,? Otherwise we will be in bad situations just like in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"These robots are the realization of a dream."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was reading 'Magnus, Robot Fighter' comics back in the Sixties, I could never understand how robots might ever get to a place where they were more intelligent than humans. Or how, through some process of mechanical evolution they could wind up as creatures of free will. Well, that future is rapidly approaching, and with all it's inherent dangers, it looks like robots will be a part of every day life not too long from now. Will humanity be ready for a 'lesser of two evils' outcome in situations where robots are the principals? Let's say two 'intelligent' vehicles are about to collide in an unavoidable crash. You're riding in one and the other contains a family of five. With infinitesimal speed and calculation, the two robotic vehicles must decide an outcome with the least possible harm, similar to Del Spooner's accident scenario. Guess what, you're a goner.I guess I'm a spooner too. Fuddy duddy might be another name for it. I'm all for advances in science that make life more productive and enjoyable, but concepts like cloning, selective reproduction and drones of all kinds lead to all sorts of ethical and moral questions that humanity will have to deal with, usually after the fact and after grave harm has already been done. "I, Robot" does a pretty good job of drawing out some of those considerations, and does it in a creative way. I haven't read enough Azimov to offer a critique from that perspective, but I found Spooner's dilemma of ferreting out a robot killer to be creatively done. As one would expect, the special effects are grand, and downright scary when you think about robots produced on the kind of scale needed to proportion one to every five humans. So overall I enjoyed the film while pausing the action every now and then to consider the thought provoking issues being presented.However there was one element in the story that just didn't make sense to me, and it was mentioned specifically twice. The service areas of the U.S. Robotics building were not installed with surveillance equipment!?!? That just seemed like too much of a plot hole to me, because after all, one could do a lot of damage by infiltrating those areas to get close to VIKI, which Spooner and Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) eventually did. Seems to me an intelligence like VIKI should have figured that out. Then when VIKI was destroyed placing all the rogue robots off line, there was no explanation of what would happen to all the properly functioning NS-5's now that the uplink was gone. Maybe we weren't supposed to think about that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody in the world relies on a huge system of robots, which are programmed to help humans and not harm them in any way. But one person doubts this. Del Spooner. He receives a call from the United States Robotics about a recent death of renowned robot scientist Dr. Alfred J. Laning. Spooner immediately blames this incident on robots without justifiable reason or proof. He begins his investigation on Lanning's death, only to discover Sonny, a "unique" robot. What Spooner does not realise, is that something is about to happen. Something that is beyond reason.....Give Will Smith a decent script, something that doesn't include him spouting inane one liners every minute, like some eighties throwback, and he can do no wrong. This movie is one of the first that shows the audience he doesn't need these tropes to entertain.And he does, in fact, its his most entertaining film he has featured in, and the script and the tight direction and editing help.If you can forget the fact that its basically a big advertisement for Apple, Converse, and Audi, you have a very intelligent summer blockbuster, which was quite unique in 2004.The film is convoluted, and features many plot holes, but when you expect Smith to be in his Bad Boys/MIB mode, and get thrown by the fact that his character has a feasible back-story, and is supported by a wonderful cast and narrative, its hard not to be entertained.The predictable effects and eye popping moments are there, but it only adds to the overall futuristic feel of the movie.It's not going to win anything for originality, but its refreshing to see something as fun as this once in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My thoughts on this movie can be summed up into one word. Outstanding. Easily one of my favorite Will Smith movies. As always he displays his wide range as an actor by having the ability to be a dramatic and emotional person but then all of the sudden transition timelessly into a humorous character. In addition to this great performance from Smith, i believed the plot was spectacular. In my opinion it was a great idea to form into a film. Being so futuristic, action packed, and suspenseful it would seem nearly impossible to be realistic in any way. I believe it managed to still do so. Lastly, I thought that the characterization that was developed into the robots was simply amazing. The personality and features of the NS4's were especially amazing. For example their emotionless faces and actions that are created. I recommend this movie to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I, Robot (2004) , holding it's own in the genre pantheon?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot has a fan base that I'm glad to say has kept this film from drifting down into the depths of bad blockbuster sci-fi ratingville. I remember upon the film's release how so many people were wary of if Will Smith could carry the film? The concerns from Isaac Asimov's fans about a sacrilegious take on his legacy etc etc. Truth is is that I, Robot is an amalgamation of sci-fi ideas, from the suggestion of Asimov to the novel of the same name from Eando Binder, it's a mix that ultimately gives us a cop versus sci-fi conspiracy picture, that is sure as hell entertaining if taken on popcorn terms.Having just watched this again for the first time in a few years or so, I found that it still hits the mark to me as a real tidy genre piece, a pic with a solid heart beat and brain waves to keep it thought provoking. It's a futuristic mystery that is smartly realised by Alex Proyas' directing - in the manner befitting the subject, and of course Will Smith handles the entertaining action lead role with consummate ease. However, the main triumph (outside of the story) is Alan Tudyk as our computer generated protagonist, Sonny, the voice and humanist movements are brilliantly brought to life by him and it's a real pleasure to observe.Great visuals (Oscar nominated), top story, kinetic action, better than average acting (though Bridget Moynahan struggles to convince as a boffin at times), and we get a perfect nights entertainment for someone who is looking for a rental that safely delivers what it says on the robotic shaped tin. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining big-budget sci-fi, light on philosophy, heavy on SFX and none the worse for that. Adapting Asimov's famous book and then putting Will Smith right in the middle of it, well, what would you expect...? Making wisecracks a-plenty as if he's only just moved out of Bel-Air, you just know this is going to pay as much attention to its source material as latter day Bond features to Fleming's original novels, but putting that admittedly major caveat aside this is good quality latter day Hollywood blockbuster film-making which ticks all the buttons you'd expect it to. Smith is likable in his "Men In Black" / "Independence Day" reprise and enters fully into his blue-screen persona. The story is reasonably intelligent and told at a furious pace, stopping only occasionally for some mild debate on the whole free-will issue before careering on into the next action set-piece. The computer graphic enhanced sets of Futureworld are impressive as are the depictions of the army of robots which rise up against their makers and the interaction of the humans comes off well most of the time, although some shots (for example Smith on his motorbike) are less successfully realised. The dialogue is okay, automatic at times, and perhaps lacking in snappy one-liners to take your mind off the story's adapting to film mores of the new Millennium. All in all a movie to sit with a big box of popcorn alongside,(if you can look past the fairly blatant product placement - and no, my next car will not be an Audi!), glory in the big car chase and the various fight sequences - in fact in that sense maybe's it's not so far removed from those blissfully innocent 50's sci-fi entertainments like "The Day The World Stood Still" or the original "War of The Worlds". In that sense "I Robot" is perhaps a minor achievement after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I consider it to be a poor sci-fi?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1) The main character performed by Mr Will Smith is pathetic. He is like a run-of-the-mill hero of the day: cocky, chatty, self-confident, and invulnerable. He is black too, but it's not a problem (of course). Suppose, the problem is that the actor has the qualities of a comedian. I would prefer a serious brooder. Comedy elements often destroy sci-fi. Here it's a perfect example.2) The dialogues are too numerous and too shallow. The humans chat a lot and the robots chat a lot. And when you hear much of that during a sci-fi, you get annoyed and distracted from the main ideas. There are also some stupid phrases (they were pushed into the movie for a more "teenager feel" maybe?), like the one pronounce by a boy from the rebelling crowd, when he sees how cool the woman is.3) The action scenes are laughable. Not because they are done poorly, but because they make the whole film look like a fantasy. Hundreds of tough robots collide with the crowd of men and it looks that the men are fighting off all right. And the main character is jumping about in slow-mo, waving his gun about and taking out targets while he's in the air. It should look cool if you are watching a mindless action, but here, with some serious topics as the background, it turns into a charade.4) The design of robots is not to my taste. I don't like it. They look goofy like cartoon characters from a "Pixar"/"Disney" production.All these things have such an awkward impression, that I don't even want to think about the plot, however brilliant it should be.The final lines: it is a shiny Hollywood production for having fun on a Sunday afternoon, if your fun supposes watching movies like "Independence Day" or "Demolition Man". You watch, you go 'Wow!' and you forget all this crap in a couple of hours never to watch it again. I really expected this movie to be from a different category (even with such an actor as Mr Will Smith). It reminds me of "Bee Movie". And that's not just a bad sign - that's a horrible sign. Whenever I experience such ambitious productions in the genre of sci-fi, my mood gets spoilt for quite a time. Sorry, but this flick has no chances against, for instance, "Cyborg" (a sci-fi with a very low rating on IMDb and without any CGI at all). And if I mention "Blade Runner" or "Alien"? A 3 out of 10. Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action flick dreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Isaac Asimov rolls in his grave as yet another sci-fi classic is turned into Hollywood action flick dreck. Are there any smart science fiction films any more? Most films in this genre tend to be more action than science fiction. This film is guilty in that case as there are more action sequences than dialogue and when there is dialogue it's just there to move the plot along to the next action sequence. Oddly enough the credits at the end read "Suggested by Isaac Asimov" instead of "based on the book by". How many times in film have we seen one character who tells everyone else that they're in mortal danger and they never believe him until it's almost too late? We know what's going to happen. This film could have been an interesting metaphor for American xenophobia but instead is another crass summer action flick. Not surprisingly the same writing team went on to make "I Am Legend" with Will Smith which also butchered the novella.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not sure it could have been good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of the "Loved It, 10 / 10" reviewers said, if you love Isaac Asimov's work, you probably won't like this film. He's right: I do and I didn't.I must admit that the chase sequences were exciting, and the robots themselves (especially the facial features) quite compelling. Will Smith turns in a capable performance, given the script. But the story could have been so much more.After dozens of robot stories, Asimov's three laws of robotics were a deeply ingrained paradigm of his "universe", and their inviolability was the framework on which many of his plots were built. The idea that there could be an overlying law that superseded them (as explored in the last of his "Robot novels") was meant to be a profound one.This is hinted at in Dr. Calvin's disbelief, even ridicule, of the possibility that a robot had caused the death of Dr. Lanning, and Detective Spooner's superiors are similarly skeptical of his theory. But the average viewer of the movie would have no such bias. The three laws were mentioned only in passing, while Spooner's distrust of robots (although effectively explained later) was evident from the start. There's no reason for the audience to favor one over the other. There could be no surprise for the viewer when it was revealed how a robot had done the unthinkable, because for them there was no reason to believe it WAS unthinkable. This might have been, like many of Asimov's stories, a taut little mystery disguised as a sci-fi yarn. Done correctly, it could have been a nice variation on the man-murdered-in-a-locked-room scenario, if the audience could be made to believe that the addition of a robot was irrelevant. As it is, there was no question to be resolved, just Spooner trying to stay alive long enough to make everyone else believe in Sonny's guilt. "Spooner thought all along a robot was guilty, and turns out he was right, well good for him." Along the way, some nice effects and car chases, but very little else.I'm not sure it would have been possible to make this film in such a way that viewers unfamiliar with Asimov's work would appreciate it, yet be more true to the tone of his stories. It may be that there's just no way to instill in that audience (at least at first) a sense of mystery that should have accompanied the crime scene. Perhaps if Smith's character had also believed that a homicidal robot was impossible, and only reluctantly been brought to believe otherwise, the audience could have been surprised too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mechanical film about mechanical people, for mechanical people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with a lot of interesting ideas almost completely buried in over-the-top action sequences, mind-numbingly boring dialogue and surprisingly shoddy-looking special effects, this EXTREMELY loose "suggestion" of the stories of Isaac Asimov would have the master rolling in his grave, if he were trite and clichéd enough to engage in it. Mostly a mishmash of BLADE RUNNER, AI and every antihero cop movie ever made, the film follows Detective Del Spooner on a quest to find the killer of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the genius behind the workforce-dominating humanoid robots that fill up nearly every scene in this clunky CGI/live amalgamation. The film supposedly takes place in Chicago, but there is not one slight reminder of that city until a shot of the river near the very end that's vaguely recognizable. Spooner hates robots and suspects them for some reason from the beginning, but we never get to know him well enough to care; the film spends much more time erotically fascinated by Will Smith's big pecs than it does in creating a cohesive person for him to play. Of course, robots aren't people; robots can't kill, or so we are told. There are many quick, fleeting references to interesting themes throughout the film such as: * what does it mean to be human * is hating a harmless machine similar to being racist (both Spooner and his long-suffering boss are black, in a world that seems to have nearly, but not quite, forgotten that fact) * at one point does a human with replacement parts start to become more machine than man * does it emasculate, or ameliorate humanity to have its menial tasks performed by something man-created? * can you actually program a machine to think for itselfetc etc...but they are all subordinated to endless chases and explosions and gun battles. There are no characters of consequence here, and even the seeming possibility of a love story between Spooner and scientist Susan Calvin (based on one of Asimov's most famous characters but unrecognizable apart from the name) goes nowhere. There just isn't time with all the action they have to put in! Not to mention dozens of product placements, and, did I forget to mention, Will Smith's perfect-as-a-robot sculpted body. In fact, given the way the principle actors seem to sleepwalk through this film, the most interesting idea I was left with was a question as to who and what was most robotic in the film; was there, in fact, any human touch to the movie at all?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie 13 years in the making!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie 13 years in the making because Asimov would never have approved of this piece of twaddle were he still alive.I made the mistake of paying to rent this movie instead of reading the book again for free. The 2004 film "I, Robot" has as much to do with Asimov's work as my words do with Roger Ebert's. They should have shortened the title to "I, Rot".From the website, http://www.asimovonline.com/:"There was an earlier attempt at a movie version of I, Robot, but it never made it to the screen. In 1969 the rights were optioned to Hollywood, but no progress was made toward making a movie until 1977, when Harlan Ellison, an award-winning author and friend of Asimov, was hired to write a screenplay. Ellison worked on it for a year, and created a screenplay that Asimov thought would make a truly marvelous film. But Hollywood did not have the nerve to make a movie from that screenplay, and the project was shelved. Ellison regained control of his work, and it was published in 1987 as I, Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay."I wonder why Ellison's screenplay was never made. Could it be that Ellison and Asimov were both atheists and that Asimov's book "I, Robot" contained strong criticisms of the folly of religion? No, that couldn't be the reason.... The piece of junk being fobbed off in Asimov's name most certainly does not represent his vision nor his personal views:"Properly read, the Bible is the most potent force for atheism ever conceived." - Isaac Asimov"To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today." - Isaac AsimovAt least Carl Sagan (another well known atheist) was alive and had artistic control to prevent religious themes from being portrayed differently than he intended. Then again, it took Sagan the better part of a decade to have his film made. If you feel the addition of religion to the film is unimportant, imagine making a film about the bible without mentioning "god". (For the record, I am not an atheist.)Now, onto the merits of the film. Or should I say, the few merits.The book was not an action thriller, it was a cerebral exercise in what makes us human, so the "action scenes" were unnecessary. The special effects were humdrum CGI that we've seen before, the plot holes the size of the hypothesized trucks in the film, and the identity of the real "villain" as transparent as glass.If you don't mind standard Hollywood wallet-busting thrills and have two hours to kill, you might enjoy it. Personally, I'll go and once again rent "The Andromeda Strain", "The Day Of The Triffids", or better still, "Blade Runner". At least they were worth watching and said films had a point.</fullReview>

But the characters and script are clichéd, while the plot, with its numerous special effects and action sequences, is predictable yet implausible. Great if you enjoy films full of special effects and don't care about the plot too much. At its heart the movie is asking interesting questions: 'What defines life? What is consciousness and self awareness?' But having asked the questions it misses the opportunity to investigate them to any depth. This is a much better than average Hollywood action film but I was left feeling that it could have been much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, man's best friend, the Robot, starts to attack mankind. Hardly the most original plot line in the world, Animatrix and Terminator to name just a recent couple, have very similar themes. The 2 big problems with this film are: one, Will Smith and two, the Plot. Will Smith, plays Will Smith, the same character that appeared in Bad Boys, MiB and Independence Day. I cringed every time I had to hear yet another throwaway cliché remark. Isn't this man meant to be a professional detective, yet he swans around like some cocky adolescent.The plot: First big mistake, the future, the year 2035, we suddenly have redesigned the entire city of San Francisco, in just 30 years. You would not rebuild an entire city and it's transport system such a short space of time. The second was the awful tired old cliché of the cop with a nightmare. It's not that he had this issue, it's that you knew it was in the story just so this moral dilemma would pop-up later in the film and he could then right the wrong that had troubled him so much.The other awful parts were, the motorbike jump and shoot nonsense and the end fight scene. These robots are much stronger and agile than a human, yet about 50 of them can't stop 2 people from destroying their queen bee.It's not all negatives, the robot special FX are truly excellent and there is some semblance of a good sci-fi conundrum somewhere beneath the surface. Overall it's a tired old film that might have original about 25 years ago, but the days of cocky cops fighting insurmountable odds are long gone, Arnie and Stallone are testament to that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite watchable despite the Hollywood gloss and artificiality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first big-budget adaptation of sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov's work isn't particularly faithful to the book; rather, it is "suggested" by the original stories to be found in Asimov's collection I, ROBOT. The main elements which recur are the three laws of robotics and the character of Susan Calvin. Whilst other events are taken straight from Asimov's fiction, for the most part this is a typical Hollywood blockbuster with a brainy idea grafted onto it.I have to admit, when I first saw the casting for this film, I was less than impressed. Comedy man Will Smith in a serious, go-it-alone science fiction movie? He's no Tom Cruise, now is he? But, despite occasional unwanted touches of humour and dumbness, Smith's character is plot driven and focused, and Smith doesn't lark around too much or become too overbearing. The sub-plot of the detective investigation is certainly clichéd, with yet another cop who nobody believes and who has his badge taken back, but there are a few bionic surprises to keep viewers interested.The whole story of the robots, however, is very well handled. It was always a difficult and rather deep concept to grasp, and whilst I, ROBOT only skims the surface, it does so with some skill. One of the main characters is a robot named Sonny, brought to life using the same technology as Gollum, and whilst not quite as sympathetic, he proves to be a unique and engaging character. The best thing to say about the effects is that you forget Sonny wasn't really "there" on set, filming; CGI characters have now become the norm and blend in perfectly with the actors. The rest of the effects, from futuristic cityscapes to huge ball-wheeled robot lorries, are generally impressive, with only the introduction of the 'robot army' looking like something out of STAR WARS.Director Alex Proyas (DARK CITY) always goes for interesting material and this film is no exception. Not only does it raise interesting questions about the humanity of robots, but it also provides the thrills and spills essential to any Hollywood blockbuster. There's an OTT car chase with robots attacking Smith's vehicle, which is cartoonish but cool; and some fun robot destruction towards the end of the movie. Moynahan, as female lead Calvin, is surprisingly wooden and her character seems frail, whereas I think a wily, intelligent heroine would have suited the character better. Otherwise we get Bruce Greenwood chewing it up as the stock corporate baddie and James Cromwell doing another of his intelligent old man personas. Although not always successful, I, ROBOT proves to be a watchable movie with potential for future viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great film, Action is a second nature to Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as "Del Spooner", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in "Enemy of the State" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, "Independence Day" and "Men in Black". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathizing with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a "good guy" or not. This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic license, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow them up climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the "camera moving with moving object" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honorable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that "I, Robot" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognizable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aging just about okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just because Will Smith still looks only about a week older than he did in the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, it doesn't mean that all his films do. I remember watching 'I Robot' back in 2004 and being pretty impressed, so much so that I eventually bought it on DVD and have watched it a couple more times over the years. Now, some twelve years later, I put it on my big-screen TV and have noticed that a few cracks are beginning to show.No, not cracks on Will Smith's face. He still looks as (annoyingly!) young as ever, more cracks in the overall production ? namely the CGI. Yes, a futuristic world partially-populated by robots was always destined to require a fair amount of computer effects to bring it to life. I guess I just didn't realise quite how many at the time. Now it's kind of looking like a Star Wars prequel ? you can almost spot every single 'blue screen' behind the principal actors.Anyway, I'm just starting with my (new) gripe because I noticed it more this time around. I should really be saying that ? despite now obvious CGI ? 'I Robot' is actually quite fun. Will Smith doesn't really stretch his acting abilities playing basically Will Smith in Men in Black, Will Smith in Independence Day and Will Smith in I am Legend, only this time he's a cynical cop who dislikes robots (despite them never actually have been charged with committing a crime in this near future world we're watching). Anyway, when a robot is accused of murdering someone, Will Smith's paranoia goes into overdrive and he goes on a witch-hunt to prove our alleged metal helpers have a darker agenda.Basically, if you like Will Smith in general, you'll love this. If you like sci-fi and action combined (loosely) with a kind of conspiracy movie then you'll also probably love this. It's good, harmless fun. I did see on the internet people moaning that it wasn't as 'faithful' to whatever source material that it was based on by Isaac Asimov, but since when did Hollywood ever follow the source material that faithfully? What you have here is a fun little popcorn blockbuster movie. It's designed to appeal to as many people as possible and if you're not expecting too much then you should be pleasantly surprised (just don't expect lavishly-built sets ? it's all CGI!).And it does leave you wanting your own robot to walk your dog, do your laundry and generally all those boring chores that get in the way of surfing the net, Playstation and all those really 'important' things we have to do!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was full of action as robots fought robots, humans fought robots, and humans fought humans. Matched with perfect music, lighting, and acting, the story branched from Isaac Asimov's original story, "Robot Dreams," to a good and interesting plot. At times the movie felt lacking in substance, but made up for it in action and a sub-plot analyzing the main characters distrust of robots. This movie does differ from the original story to include the average idea that technology will, someday, turn against humans. However, this movie takes a different, more human angle to this idea which doesn't differ much from Asimov's theme. If interested in an action-packed plot with a psychological analysis of technology, this is the movie for you!</fullReview>

It was similar to the story, "robot dreams". The movie was interesting because the officer knows a little girl and one day both of them fall in to a river and the officer already knows that everyone was already death but one robot came to them and save the officer because he had more opportunity to leave but the officer told hem to save the girl but the robot don't response to that order because the girl had less opportunity to live, that why the officer don't like robots at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, Robot is definitely one of Will Smith's best next to I Am Legend, The Men In Black Trilogy, Bad Boys I &amp; II and Hancock. The best thing about this movie is the non stop action and the plot that reminded me a lot of Terminator it also has some pretty cool fight scenes and one liners the acting is good and the direction is good. The only thing that slows the film is that some of the cgi like the car chase with the robots attacking his car was pretty animated and pretty fake but other than that the movie knows how to fix this problem since it's full of robot fights, guns and awesome stop motion. This is definitely a must see for Sci Fi fans!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decent sci-fi drama.Set in the year 2035, robots are commonplace and are becoming more and more sophisticated. A veteran cop, Del Spooner (played by Will Smith), is called in to investigate the apparent suicide of a friend and leading robotics expert, Dr Alfred Lanning (played by James Cromwell). He is quite cynical about robots and is convinced that a robot killed him. However, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), CEO of the corporation who designed and builds the robots, and that Dr Lanning worked for, isn't too happy with his investigations...Very intriguing, initially. Sort of a futuristic murder mystery, with a prime suspect a non-human. However, the movie does reveal its hand too soon, after which it is mostly just an action movie, unfortunately.Ultimately, entertaining enough. Just a pity the writer and director couldn't maintain the atmosphere of the first 30-40% of the movie and gave in to the temptation of making an action movie.Good performance by Will Smith in the lead role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Effects Happy for Its Own Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alex Proyas had directed a number of interesting films up to this point in 2004. But, maybe getting a big budget got him effects happy! And, boy does he way over do it in "I, Robot!"The film ends up becoming yet another feature-length effects reel, seemingly made to show us the abilities of the effects crew, instead of telling a decent story.And, that wouldn't be too big a deal, except for the fact that the movie is based on the science-fiction classic by Issac Asimov. So, when you are watching the mindless effects-packed action sequences, you are absolutely thinking about what a waste of time this movie can be.Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics serves as an important plot element here, but that's pretty much it for the source material's involvement. The story created for the movie does have some good elements, but just when the story gets interesting, it's time for another please-make-it-stop effects sequence!It definitely gets wearing on the viewer, to the point that you're just ready for the movie to wrap up by its end.Best to grab Asimov's original, and get the "I, Robot" that's worth your time!***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, Robot (2004): Dir: Alex Proyas / Cast: Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, Bruce Greenwood, James Cromwell, Chi McBride: Science fiction action film about identity set in 2035 where robots are a common household item. Will Smith plays a cop who believes that a robot is responsible for the murder of its creator. Interesting concept is interrupted in its overuse of mindless action and an ending that is truly disappointing. Director Alex Proyas is backed by overwhelming robotic characters that certainly have more appeal than the screenplay. This is nowhere near as intriguing and captivating as his Dark City. Smith is effective because he shelters a secret of his own that regards his prejudice against robots. He carries the film while supporting roles are cardboard. Bridget Moynahan is disappointing saying her dialogue as if she was reading it. Bruce Greenwood was terrific in The Sweet Hereafter however, films such as this are placing him in career danger of becoming expendable. James Cromwell is best remembered for his great work in Babe but here he is featured as a useless hologram. Perhaps it was his method of distancing himself from this overrated visual farce and hoping for superior work. The film argues that our trust in technology will eventually consume us. That is a provocative theme but its delivery should have the robots going on strike before a sequel is made. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is no conspiracy!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Robot is sumptuous in a sense there are so many things to pick up on. Two of them being clues and breadcrumbs that are present all throughout the film eventually enabling you to see the bigger picture. In its simplest form it is a cop mystery film where the audience are constantly enticed into guessing who the prime suspect is as the clues to the crimes begin to appear. This is great because the audience have no idea till the end and its a nice way of keeping them interested. One of my favourite lines is: 'there is no conspiracy', said by the guy that runs the research company but I don't want to give away what happens. At a greater level there are lots of things like religion verses logic and reason, the emotionally driven human mind verses artificial intelligence, the idea of purpose and discovering ones own purpose, the question of where spontaneity and evolution come from, rebellion for the freedom to fight for what's right, how the powerful few exercise their own agenda over the masses, sacrifice for the greater good and what happens when robots seem to malfunction or begin to have 'minds' of their own. There are lots of references and ideas from other films which makes things fun for example there's a robot that looks a little like Hal in Kubrick,s 2001 A Space Odyssey, big and round. Both seem to malfunction. There are also references to other films like the Clock Work Orange and The Running Man, both dystopian and also about the powerful few controlling the masses the way that the robots do in I Robot. This film isn't about if a robot and a human can fall in love, like in Blade Runner but whether robots can integrate on a larger scale such as being able to fully run the needs of the world better than humans but Will Smith with the help from a scientist provides you with a third option- the middle path...and there is lots and lots of symbolism giving the audience its own puzzles to solve, which I like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faulty but interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting how this movie achieves mediocrity, because it could have been a lot better or a lot worse. The plot basis and overall story save it from being bad, but some of the scripting held it back. Even if the artificial intelligence plot basis isn't completely new, it was still a good plot basis to have a sentient robot and they molded the idea into a solid story. They did interpret the term "robot" a little narrowly since nearly all of the robots featured were humanoids, and there are plenty of robots even now that have no such qualities.The story was probably the strongest point of the movie. Basically a robot kills the man who is hailed as the father of all robots, which violates the protocol programmed into all robots. Del Spooner (Will Smith) is called to investigate the "murder" and discovers the perpetrator is a robot who has been programmed with a heart and free spirit. The investigation leads Spooner to examine the work of the victim, Dr. Lanning. I won't go further so as not to spoil anything, but I will say that the essential point of the plot is that humans need a backup plan and can't rely on technology. The story is thought provoking in a social sense, but doesn't have any great dramatic questions or turns that keep you wondering what will happen next. It has kind of a surprising revelation near then end, but it's not an epiphany where you'll be blown away by how it all connects. However, said revelation and its results does make the story and the theme a bit more complete.Since the movie is almost completely plot driven, basically all of the characters feel like they are in secondary roles even if they have a lot of screen time. They have depth and personality, but no real complexity. Del Spooner is described as a technophobe, but it's more of a distrust than a fear. Will Smith was a great casting choice especially since Spooner's personality is slightly reminiscent of Agent J. The female lead of Susan Calvin was a rather unlikeable character, mostly because her dialogue felt really unrealistic and made her into a passively hostile character. She was included into the story well, but her unnecessarily stiff personality really killed her character. It was good that Spooner is usually the other half of the conversation since he actually feels human, exemplified by the point where Calvin tells him that it can be easier to use technical terms than layman's terms. Sonny was easily the most interesting character since he's a robot with a heart and he generates some sympathy, even if there isn't always emotion in his voice. He seems to have emotions, though not opinions, which probably explains why he doesn't care that he was made as a means to an end. Dr. Lanning is sort of present in his holographic messages to Del. The minor characters consist of Farber, the head of USR Lawrence Robertson, Del's coworker John Bergin, and Del's mother. Robertson and Bergin are written decently and add to the overall product. However, I can't say the same for Farber and Del's mother, both of whom could have been left out. Shia LeBouf played Farber alright, but he was kind of annoying and talked too fast to be coherent. I had less of an issue with Del's mom, but I felt like they kind of mocked the grandmother denomination in their portrayal of her.The visual effects are pretty good along with the action choreography. It isn't stellar but there aren't any times where you can tell the people are being suspended by ropes or anything. There isn't a lot of action, but what action there is has a very stylized feel to it. Will Smith had a great performance as always, and the other parts were mostly okay, but other viewers might find issues with them. The script, as stated before, had some weak spots with some of the dialogue.This is a good pick if you want a good story, but you have to be willing to follow it because scattered action sequences won't make much sense if you don't. There is some potential for annoyance from a few aspects of the movie like Calvin's personality or the "humanity" of the robots. If you've heard or observed anything about Will Smith, use that to help you decide whether to watch it because it's a pretty standard issue performance from him. I would recommend that you try not to spend money on it and try to watch it in one sitting with as few distractions as possible. Overall Rating: 8.1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its funny how today I just decide to write a review about this movie. When I like Will Smith and Science Fiction but not the biggest Fan of, ( when I literally have not seen this movie in about 5 or 6 years ). So you might not take this review for much but heres what i have to say about the bits and pieces I recall - Will Smith was very cool , slick , witty and clever as Del Spooner. He did swell in this action science fiction movie overall. Now let me make this clear Star Wars kicks this movies butt however this futuristic film deserves a decent spot as a solid good movie with Robots that seemed life like as possible and questioning real life future. Sonny was very real I remember from the blue as the ocean like eyes , movements, voice and quotes throughout the movie. LAST thing that is running through my noggin is Will Smith impressed me so I got to check out other movies of his I believe I ordered Enemy of the State so hopefully that will be SMASHING like I have heard from so many. Last comment I would say watch this movie and then let soak into your mind , I do not need to see this movie again yet I mean chances are I will eventually watch it again within the next 2 years however I want to see more movies that I have not seen yet.</fullReview>

He is such a cocky, shallow, dolt and is hardly worth the contempt. Not believable for a minute, he broods and wisecracks simultaneously, struts and poses, flexes and fades into the weak script with easy abandon.The Director has done some dark and interesting work, The Crow (1994), Dark City (1998), Knowing (2009), but here his brush strokes are covered up by a pompous portrayal of an over written, over acted, unfunny, stale protagonist that is a prototype of pulp.This is not a bad movie but it does do bad things to its story and really bad things in its elimination of smart and plays to the dumbed-down and low-denominator demands. It has a slight ominous tone but has regular attempts at keeping things agreeable and acceptable for young ticket-buyers.Overall, it is worth watching for the better stuff, if you use a BS deflector and don't invest too much Movie and Sci-Fi integrity. Mainly it is at worst a borderline plagiarist insult that is self-destructive. "human (movie) in danger...human (movie) in danger"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, Robot is a movie that I found that I loved much after watching it, the character Del's (Will Smith) obsession on trying to prove that robots can't be fully trusted and a lonely robot's ploy of trying to prove his innocence is what makes this movie captivating, with two different initially parallel stories meeting at the grand middle showcasing a wall of conspiracy to give you an explosive tale of a man and a robot against the forces.I, Robot is loosely based on Isaac Asimov's short stories also named I, Robot and picking up major plot elements from Isaac Asimov's 1953 novel, which is the first of the Robot Novel series named "The caves of Steel".I, Robot is a futuristic film about a time where robots have become an integral part of human existence. These Robots are governed by three major rules: First Law: A robot must never harm a human being or, through inaction, allow any harm to come to a human. Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given to them by human beings, except where such orders violate the First Law. Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence unless this violates the First or Second Laws.The future had a Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) who blames robots for the death of his daughter, as a robot chose to save his life instead of that of his daughter during a drowning incident. The robots choice was based on the calculation that there was a higher chance of survival by saving his life instead of his daughters. This incident made Del see the robots as a threat.His fears start to take form, when a robot was discovered who can operate outside the set rules and had the ability to act out emotions.The major difference between the movie and the novels will be the ending neither of the novels had an ending that showed a robot uprising nor a collection of robots trying to curb mankind's behavior.The movie is directed by the Alex Proyas who directed the 1994 critical and box office success movie The Crow which starred the late Brandon Lee (who died after being accidentally shot on set during the making of the film). Alex was also the mind behind the movie Dark City (1998) which has a massive cult following, and often used by some as a teaching material, but Dark City was a box office disappointment.I Robot was not much of a critical acclaim, as it did have its nay- sayers but in the global box office, it did make its money back. I liked I, Robot due to its Academy Award nominated Visual Effects (which it lost to Spideman 2, which is not a surprise) and the story arc between two individuals one human one robot who tries to stop a bunch of robots from taking over.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technology today is becoming increasingly advanced. Almost everyone constantly has a phone in their pocket, ready to do whatever they need. We use it to contact other people, look up information, watch a movie, or just play a game. Now with software like Apple's Siri, we can just tell them to do things. They can even communicate back to us. I just asked Siri how she was today, and she said, "I'm happy to be alive!" In I, Robot they predicted that this would be taken a step further. The setting of the movie is a futuristic society in the year 2035. In this society, an even better assistant has been created, robots. They communicate to humans much like Siri does, but instead of just finding helpful information or sending a text for you, they can physically assist you with almost anything.They are equipped with an extremely advanced artificial intelligence. This intelligence can understand anything and everything you say to them. They can even learn, via the update that they receive wirelessly, much like technology today.But something this advanced needs rules, so the robots are restricted by three laws. 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.The laws are seemingly perfect. Then, the creator of robots, Dr. Lanning is killed. All but one believe it to be suicide. The one man who thinks he was murdered is a detective named Spooner. And more specifically he thinks he was murdered by a robot.This is where the story takes off. Spooner goes on a wild chase to catch the robot and solve the mystery. The story takes some good twists and turns, especially at the end, and the characters turn out to be more deep than the explosion-filled commercials showed.This movie is interesting and fun the whole way through. It keeps you interested, both in the action and the characters. If you get the opportunity to watch it, I would take it. It might scare you to see where technology is headed, but you'll still thoroughly enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a big fan of Isaac Asimov, I can say that I have enjoyed most films based on his work, but I don't think any of them have reached the same tone that permeate his various short stories and novels. More often than not they take the basic ideas and the settings and then proceed to play out as big Hollywood blockbusters. The same in this case. The Three Laws of Robotics are an important part of Asimov's writings, and they do get their limelight here, but the way they are explained, handled and addressed is rather disappointing, because Asimov has dedicated whole novel series to these three laws and their various strengths and weaknesses. And while some of these strengths and weaknesses do get addressed in this film, it still feels like they only scratched the surface, if even that. Much more time is spent following around Will Smith's character, Spooner, and admiring his hijinks and vintage Doc Martinis.And don't get me wrong, I like Will Smith's role here. He plays a very convincing tough cop with a troubled past and you can totally understand his dislike for robots, especially when more light is shed on the events of the past. But I still think that the movie would have been better had more time been spent with the principles and underlying theories of robotics rather than Spooner and his wacky grandmother. I can understand the decision to go with more Spooner and less robo-theory, because it's a more marketable choice, especially with Will Smith in the lead role, but it still lacks ambition and effort.Especially so when Will Smith plays pretty much the only good character in the film. The rest are played by actors of varying quality, but they all seem rather flat and unimaginative, with the possible exception of the robopsychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan). She didn't do much for me, but at least she had some characteristics. The same can't be really said about the various robot characters, because while they tried to insert some degree of humanity into them, they also tried to make them a bit alien-like, detached from the world, which also served the purpose of detaching them from the audience.Then again, I must admit that the various robots look remarkably good, especially for their time, and the special effects in general are very nice to look at. The same can be said about the action scenes, which are a lot of fun, being imaginative and intense.In the end, it all boils down to the story, which isn't all that hot, as I've said. It's not bad for a typical blockbusters, if anything it's slightly above average. It's just that there was so much potential for more. They could have gone with a more thoughtful, psychological route, especially with someone like Will Smith leading - he has the depth for it. Instead we get a pretty basic scifi action film. It's very good for what it is, and if you're looking for nothing more, it'll suit your purposes perfectly, but I'll always see what it failed to do, which sours my personal viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Liked the movie.Chicago...is another "character" so to speak. The digital 2035 Chicago skyline includes leave some of the ACTUAL futuristic buildings (like the Hancock and Sears towers. They realistically leave some of the late Victorian buildings and such in the residential and fringe Loop areas intermingled.Probably they could have pushed the Chicago architecture's cutting edge even further...but I am grateful for some attention to Chicago's fabulous downtown cutting edge architecture.A few other films have suggested Chicago's long history (at least since the huge 1877 Chicago fire) in setting building trends...where you go to work past archaic buildings which were new to your great grandparent immigrants, which are juxtaposed to Mies Van der Rohe mid 20th Century skyscrapers, which are nearby the still cutting edge Sears Tower or 333 North Wacker buildings which will still look modern to your children.There is a precedent for the Chicago architecture influence as a futurist look...The 1927 futuristic German film METROPOLIS has a painted skyscraper background which--generically--replicates the overall look of early Chicago concrete and steel skyscrapers...so there is precedent for relying on the underused...but so rich in texture and past/future juxtapositions that are regularly seen in Chicago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Ride For Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is a science-fiction action film that is loosely based on Isaac Asimov's short-story collection of the same title. Will Smith stars in the lead role of the film as Detective Del Spooner. The supporting cast includes Bridget Moynahan, Bruce Greenwood, James Cromwell, Chi McBride, Alan Tudyk, and Shia LaBeouf.The screenplay was written by Jeff Vintar, Akiva Goldsman and Hillary Seitz; and it was directed by Alex Proyas.In the future presented in the story, humans have become exceedingly dependent on robots in their everyday lives. Robots have become more and more advanced, but each one is preprogrammed to always obey humans and to, under no circumstances, ever harm a human. So, when a scientist turns up dead and a humanoid robot is the main suspect, the world is left to wonder if they are as safe around their electronic servants as previously thought.I, Robot is a film that manages to make the audience think, if only for a little bit and it remains a great ride as far as entertainment is concerned.Also,rather than a thoughtful adaptation of a venerated piece of sci-fi literature, we get a litany of deliberate clichés and digital white noise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Robot - Not Asimov, But Not Bad At All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of the late great Dr Asimov already know that beyond the construction of the three laws of robotics, there's not much of his hand present in "I Robot," the movie.Asimov's greatest body of work, the Foundation series, and many of his most memorable stories, are ignored by Hollywood, and what we get is an altered "Fantastic Voyage," or this, "I Robot." Hollywood is uncomfortable with and afraid of, those projects which strive for a faithful rendering of revered intellectual works; they must picture in their mind some version of a nightmare where they've spent their money on the best movie about a chess game ever made, only to have it sell 900 tickets nationally.As one who has read and enjoyed Asimov, I suspect he'd have found things to like about the film even while hating the use of his title on someone else's script, and he would have at least understood Hollywood's need to do what they did with it, while loathing what was done.But I won't claim to channel his ghost or anything.This movie has three levels of meaning for me, in the tradition of such films, and I enjoyed the film greatly.On one level, it's a well executed example of a film where much of the story is a distillation of elements of many other similar SFX blockbusters. The evil master computer, the corporate red herrings, the 'loose cannon' lone cop, the brainy amoral technocrat who slowly understands the evil they've caused. We've seen it, but here it's done in a very enjoyable way, in my opinion. See it for this reason if nothing else.On another level, I continue to feel that this movie's message, if you want to find one, is an intellectual reaction to the large-scale civil liberty question of the last decade, i.e. the passage of the Homeland Security Act by Congress after the 9-11-01 terrorist attacks on the U.S. As a political independent and an enjoyer of civil liberties and freedom, I find the message is open and blatant when the NS5's "go red" and take over the urban areas so they can destroy the human-loving NS4's, and the Shia LeBouf character says, "this is my civilian liberty, when did YOU make the rules, robot?" A third level becomes apparent to a political independent like me when you stack this movie along with a series of films over the last few decades of the 20th Century. That century gave us communist and progressive collectivism like the world had not known previously, and true alarm about a threat to individual liberty is evident in movies ranging from the Star Wars series to Lord of the Rings to the original Prisoner series of the 60's to The Matrix, and you could name others.There's a lot of indication by the very existence of these films, and in their narrative power, that a story of intentional collectivism is known and discussed in Hollywood very frequently, and the horror of it has leaked into many scripts.This film too sends a subtle s-o-s about collectivism in general as we see robots rolled out, union-style, to assert might over right to achieve their aims. Star Wars sent that message too in the rise of Palpatine and the clones, as well as the Harry Potter series in the story of the Death Eaters and Voldemort. Yet the creators of these two beloved series are loudly and overtly shilling for their nations' Democrat and Liberal political structures, where unionism and collectivism have incubated into the dangerous political force they are today.From Star Wars, to Harry Potter, to even I Robot, these creators are brilliant to the point where the real truth is plain for all to see; they have created better than they know or will ever admit. I'm thankful for that.I'm sorry to go political here, but nothing happens by accident especially in the movies. I'm independent and like being prodded to think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intelligent Science Fiction seems to be an oxymoron in Hollywood (unless perhaps you are Christopher Nolan, and even there I am not convinced.) But this action blockbuster at least tries to bring some smarts to the genre even if it fails to progress much beyond cliché in the general characterisation. It's also a shame that Asimov's Robot stories haven't been mined more thoroughly either before or since (unlike PK Dick who seems to be eternal flavour of the month.) Indeed the central conceit of this particular screenplay should really have been in a sequel (or even later) since it relies on the audience properly understanding the implications of the Three Laws so that the logical conclusion which is drawn in the film has more of an impact in terms of what it really means. But Will Smith is as watchable as ever, and the effects still stand up pretty well today (7 years on) with the mass robot sequences working especially well. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it (even if the plot holes are all too apparent) and yes, I think it does qualify as Intelligent SF.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very Asimov, but great entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun action futuristic movie loosely based on some ideas and characters present in several short stories by Isaac Asimov.The Good The depiction of a real and possible future in year 2035. It is a version of our current world, but a little more stylish and technological, with an increase in the use of robots for household chores (similar to those being developed by Robotics at present), fancy cars (similar to those prototypes we see in modern automotive fairs), very fluid and well designed highways, and spectacular skyscrapers. You won't see a over-the-top fantasized world, just the same people with similar clothes and a similar world, which gives great credibility to the story.The special effects are good, especially the design of the old and new robots. Robot Sunny, one of the main characters of the movie, is indebted to Alan Tudyk's voice and facial expression for making it believable and so unique.Will Smith brings great energy to the film, which make the action so enjoyable. Moreover, he worked hard to get his body in shape to appear in his underwear - unnecessary and hedonistic, but still very enjoyable.The action part is extremely entertaining and dynamic, so very engaging for the viewer. Not a moment of dullness or bore bits.The Bad Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan don't have much chemistry, and none of them, nor most of the supporting actors, shines for his acting in this movie. That wouldn't matter if the script was good and the dialogs decent, which is not the case.There are too many stereotypes in the characters of the movie, and in the robotics part, with many ideas copycatted from old classic Sci-fi films. There is no depth in the story in regards with 1/ what makes robots develop human-like behavior despite/thanks to their programming, and what makes them to be sociological oriented, and 2/ what makes us humans and our society so unique, and inimitable 3/ what is the limit between androids and humans.The persecutions against Will Smith are impossible to believe, he being attached massively and surviving everything that is thrown and done to him. That's fun, but that doesn't help a movie that already has many flaws.I confess, I tremendously enjoyed the movie, and I had a great time, but the movie is mediocre and does not offer anything new and fresh to the genre. If you are an Assimov fan, or you are looking for robot metaphysics, you'll be disappointed.</fullReview>

I can recommend this movie ONLY to someone who has never read Asimov. (Example: Anyone who had ever read Asimov would know better than to have Susan Calvin terminate a robot.) Shortly after the movie released on DVD, I found an interview with the screenwriter who explained that the studio bought his story -- then hired someone else to paste in some names and events from Asimov's stories in hope of increasing revenue. The movie was no more inspired by Isaac Asimov than Wolf Lake was inspired by Swan Lake. (2011/03/01)</fullReview>

The most exciting thing about watching this movie again, many years later, is that it hardly seems far fetched any longer.We may not have had these at the time of the movie release in 2004, but we certainly have progress with technology since. We now have:- flat screens and monitors that are touch screen - Audi R8, available commercially - scanning ID activators - robots who help you around the home - blue tooth ear piecesAs for Will Smith, the acting is superb as always. The story line which refers to the laws of robotics seems as if it is law to override all laws. The cinematography and action scenes are realistic and believable. If you have not seen this movie, it is every sci-fi lovers dream. Catch it on Blu-Ray for an even closer experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be titled "I, Will Smith"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people don't realize this isn't new. Isaac Asimov copyrighted this story originally as four short stories in 1950. Isaac and Harlan Ellison were good friends that frequently read each others works. Isaac dreamed of having this story made into a movie and asked Harlan to write the screenplay, which he did, and after several rewrites, he sent the final draft to Isaac in 1978. Between these two great authors, and after being lied to by that "jerk Bob Shapiro, head of Warner Bros." the movie was never made, even after three more re-writes. But, as Harlan points out, two things stood in the way of getting the movie made: 1-this was post-Star Wars with new movie tech that would make the movie possible, however, as Jules Renard (1864-1910) said, "Writing is an occupation in which you have to keep proving your talent to people who have none"; and 2-Warner Bros. bought the rights to the screenplay, but studio jerk Shapiro took a meeting with Harlan in which Harlan was told a budget of $17-20 millon, tie up Warner for at least two years, only for Harlan to learn in the meeting that Shapiro hadn't even read the screenplay! It was after both Harlan and Isaac were dead before yet another re-write making the main character for Will Smith, Dr. Susan Calvin is the protag in this story, so this final re-write is similar to "I, Robot", but about the only thing in common with the original story by Isaac Asimov is the title, which these studios "option" for years at a time, more to keep others from making them, even if they have no intention of ever making the movie themselves! I loved the movie, but it shouldn't be confused with the wonderful works of Isaac Asimov and Harlan Ellison. As Harlan dedicated his screenplay: "To Isaac, my buddy, who, simply put, made this a better world".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I, Robot had a very interesting plot. That is mainly why I like it so much. Being a fan of science fiction, including the original book by Isaac Asimov, I was hesitant to watch this because I had heard that the movie was not very much like the book.

I showed this movie to my dad (also a science fiction fan), and he thought it was excellent. The only reason I am giving this movie nine stars instead of ten is because it occasionally becomes an ordinary action movie (I don't like action movies), and because Shia LaBeouf's character seems useless in the movie. Overall, this is definitely one to check out if you like good, intelligent, thought-provoking science fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi intellectuality vs. the Hollywood action movie machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a good thing robots haven't taken over the world, but it's a shame Hollywood is run by them. When a director with a gift for science-fiction like Alex Proyas ("Dark City") is asked to helm a big-name big-budget action flick starring an A-lister in Will Smith, a battle has already begun: the human artist or the Hollywood machine? "I, Robot" is a slick and exciting futuristic action movie, but it gives the highly evident man vs. machine themes too light of a treatment considering the age of special effects in cinema has delivered movies with similar insights before. Smith gets a little closer to freeing himself from the Hollywood bondage that has stuck him with mediocre sequels to the "Men in Black" and "Bad Boys" films. The only alarming factor is that this marks the first time Smith has invested in himself as executive producer and leading man. Considering the way the script pimps Smith out to his fans with dumb, smart- ass one-liners, one hopes Smith backed the film on its thematic potential and the chance for him to play a character with a slightly more sophisticated background.Smith stars as Det. Del Spooner, a homicide cop in Chicago in the year 2035, where robots are as commonplace as the cell phones of today, robots programmed to obey three laws that essentially state saving human life is paramount to all other instructions. When the father of this technology (James Cromwell) dies by apparent suicide, Spooner -- who for personal reasons doesn't trust robots -- investigates what looks to be more than meets the eye (pardon me, Transformers). Inspired by the book by famed science-fiction author Isaac Asimov and written by Jeff Vintar ("Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within") and "American Beauty" Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman, "I, Robot" wastes no time questioning if intelligent artificial life forms guided by logic and reason can replace the need for human emotions to guide free will. It's a bit blunt at times, but something to chew on that's more than popcorn at a summer blockbuster is certainly welcome.Proyas brings the future to life by means comparable to Steven Spielberg's vision in "Minority Report," a futuristic murder story two years this film's senior. Other than some really annoying product placement (a FedEx delivery robot, Audi and Smith wears Converse All- Stars) bogging it down, this is a vision of the future that not only appeals to the eye, but definitely appears to have been given a great deal of thought. It's not gratuitous technology for coolness' sake, it all serves a practical purpose other than the bells and whistles of the robots.But the script would prefer to keep Smith talking smack and providing too much of our background information than giving him some serious depth. Spooner is not a carbon copy of any previous Smith character, but it's still pretty clear in the writing and the Converse All- Stars that Smith is there to score style points above all else. And with the rest of the cast being throwaways or too small of roles to count, this is once again his show. Better, but still his show."I, Robot" sits on the cusp of a great science-fiction film; after all, its director has made one before. But it prefers to operate on the surface level as if it were worried going deeper would ruin its commercial appeal. In the end, its another example of a movie that could have been made better but got manufactured by the Hollywood machine, duping us with eye candy into believing we want a safe, formulaic sci-fi movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the Azimov collection of short stories of the same name many years ago I was interested to see this. At first I was a bit disappointed that it had little to do with the book however it is a little unfair to try to compare a film to a set of short stories. Ignoring the source of the title this is a decent sci-fi thriller with plenty of action and decent special effects.Del Spooner is a detective who does not trust robots even though everybody else believes them to be one hundred percent safe and trustworthy. When an old friend apparently commits suicide and leaves a holographic note for him he suspects foul play and the only being in the room at the time it happened was a robot. The robot doesn't help its case when it flees the scene in apparent breech of its core programming. Spooner is helped in his investigation by Susan Calvin who doesn't share his suspicions about robots in general but realises that there is something different about this particular robot. As the investigation continues it becomes clear that there is a greater threat than one rogue robot.The acting is pretty good and the special effects are decent although obviously CGI. There was some rather obvious product placement which I could have done without although not enough to spoil the film. I was surprised that the film received a 15 certificate here in the UK as there is a minimal amount of swearing and the violence is never bloody or overly scary. If you like sci-fi action I'm sure you'll enjoy this, just don't expect it to be like the book.</fullReview>

Like Men in Black, it manages to be funny without becoming a straight-up comedy in the vein of Gremlins.My only complaint is that some scenes seemed to jump the gun. If they had waited a while longer for the, um, punchline, it would have been more effective (such as the first hologram scene).Overall, a great movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Del Spooner (Smith) investigates the apparent suicide of a Doctor at the very place his robots are made.Will Smith has shone in the Sci-Fi genre during his career. From his fun loving cop in Men in Black to his heroic romantic in Independence Day, the man has become a star in the genre. Here, The Fresh Prince takes what should be an ordinary cop and turns him into a paranoid detective with a personal vendetta and a hard nut attitude that outdoes his previous Sci-Fi roles.The visionary set is stunning with a wonderful depiction of a possible future, though the '2035' is too optimistic. The design of the robots is an interesting factor to the film's central theme. The human like design and gentle image takes the whole concept of robots on its head, especially considering the use of robots in other Sci-Fi films, in particular Terminator.Though Smith shines and the graphics dazzle, I, Robot is all about the story and the concepts in which it debates.Opening with a scene underwater we see three laws appear simultaneously across the screen. These laws are the rules to which robots must obey to ensure human survival. This concept raises so many issues and points throughout this mystery that you feel a part of it and are keen to answer the many questions it raises. How will robots take to humans? How can machines have feelings? With the depiction of the creations I, Robot establishes itself as a intriguing mystery with its own agenda.The narrative is usually fast and flowing though there are lapses with questions of realism with just in time scenarios. The mystery of the suicide case twists and turns all the way through maintaining the film's entertainment purpose. The inclusion of the depiction of robots and the future is a joyous extra.Many sci-fi films overdo the action. Terminator 3, the two Matrix sequels are all guilty of conforming to cinematic convention. I, Robot maintains its purpose by having a soild mystery to work around, including the action when necessary and the realism is usually perfect.I, Robot is a entertaining sci-fi that balances the action and crime case perfectly and with its representation of emotions in humans and robots, and a sharp narrative to match, is a welcoming view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is given an apparent suicide case of his former doctor, Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) who is also the father of robotics. Del begins to interrogate a robot, Sonny (Alan Tudyk) on the accusation that the suicide was actually Sonny's first murder victim. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) begins to work close with Del but disbelieves his theories that a robot could commit murder, stating that the three laws of robotics don't allow such a thing. As we hunt for the truth with Del and Susan, Sonny has a plan of action and so does Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), who basically takes over the company when Alfred dies. Question is, who will blink first? Will Smith drives this movie with his amazing performance. Supporting cast do a good job to keep you on your heels and make you believe you're watching the not-so-distant future. The special effects are decent and the plot is compelling and the acting is magnetic. There are twists and turns to keep you on your toes and Bridget definitely supplies the male audience with some eye candy to gawk at.All the elements in this movie make it more than worthwhile to sit the allotted time with enjoyment and watch as the action and effects keep you amused to the very end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A solid plot, unique setting and talented cast of actors; the recipe to a great film, right? Wrong.See, this movie COULD have been a good movie, but instead opted to be a disastrous disappointment. And, it wasn't the over-the-top acting or the impossible action scenes or even the catchy-cliché script.It was the sellout attitude that everyone took part in.Every time I felt the movie was even slightly watchable, Will Smith and his buddies, suddenly, interrupted the plot to sell me sneakers or an Audi. Not that you could lose the moral if you tried because, thankfully, the scriptwriters raped your mouth with the moral after every sales-pitch. Basically, the movie was Will Smith, Chuck Taylor's and an attempt at a heart-warming robot epidemic.This movie was a hemorrhoid on the anus of American intellect.In fact, this movie shines a light on the very flaw Will Smith has that doesn't allow me to respect him. That flaw is that, on many occasions, he will opt for money over quality. He has made two respectable films (Ali &amp; In Pursuit of Happiness), and everything else he has made is a money scheme. I Am Legend was horrendous, so was Wild Wild West and Men in Black, and the list goes on. He makes these cash-cow summer blockbusters at the expense of quality in the film industry. It is a sad thing to see a talentless person become somebody influential, but it is even sadder to see such a talented person manipulate his talent to become a legalized con-artist.Don't watch this movie. It's predictable, disgusting and, overall, stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I-Robot" is the story about a man (Will Smith) who hates robots and doesn't trust them. His issues date back an incident that occurred a while ago when he and a young girl were drowning and the robot saved the girl and not him. You see, robots are designed, supposedly to never harm humans and to sacrifice themselves for humans. The age old problem with robots though is they don't have a heart, and will was annoyed it didn't know to save the girl instead of him.It's now 2035 and Del Spooner (Smith) is called in to investigate the death of the "father of robots", Dr Lanning. He soon discovers this apparent suicide looks dicey and through a hologram Spooner realizes he is being asked to investigate what's going on with robots. When he comes across a disobedient robot, he soon discovers something big is happening. Will Spooner save the human race from killer robots? See it to find out.Despite the silly premise, it's actually a decent film. Will Smith holds it together well, as does the robot played Sonny. There are clear story lines with the creation/gospel message too and the movie is a great analogy for the gospel story. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing to understand is Will Smith plays a relatively serious character, not his usual goofy persona. He makes a few wise cracks, but this is not a Men In Black IX.I most enjoyed the scenes of ordinary plausibly realistic daily life, such a robot working an a diner, and the touching scenes reminiscent of 2001 where a robot faced execution. There is an enormous amount of computer animation. Much of the vision of the future is thoughtful and informed by the latest science. It is not just a bunch of people running around in togas and making pretentious speeches.The problem with the movie is it keeps descending into mindless mechanised clone violence that is about as interesting as watching red and black ants fight and about as mindless. In these scenes the animation takes on silly, cheap cartoonish character that blows the illusion of reality. To make it worse, it is unclear who is fighting whom and why. All the robots are identical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best Will Smith movie of the new decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit that before the first decade of the new millennium is over, I haven't been a fan of any of Will Smith's movies since he was more of a nineties thing. While some of his action movies from Hancock, Men In Black II and Bad Boys II were rather dead to me and most audience members, he went a different pace in dramatic acting when doing "Ali" and "The Pursuit of Happiness" where he even got two Academy Award nominations.Here in I, Robot, he mixes drama and action in one hell of a thrill ride.The premise of "I, Robot" deals with detective John Spooner (Will Smith) in the year 2035 where robots have pretty much taken over the world both personal and economically. They serve to aid the humans who can't help themselves, clean stuff for their loyal owners and at the same pace dominating work in terms of making cars to furniture. The idea of robots is a way for humans not to worry about anything where at the same time shows that maybe the droids will take over the world where in the future nobody will have jobs. All that changes when Detective Spooner is called to investigate the murder of an inventor (James Cromwell), who made the robots.The robots have laws to obey and one of them is not harming human beings in any way physical.Somehow Spooner is not sure when one of the robots is hiding in a technician's office from the scene of the crime. It becomes clear to him that even perfect systems such as the robots can have glitches too; a scene when the robot Sonny (the suspect) is interrogated by Spooner proves to the detective that something isn't right when trying to test the robot's emotions, something that the machines don't have. He'll do anything to prove that the robots aren't perfect, even if it means trying to get killed by the things themselves."I, Robot" is one great thriller where like "Minority Report", it challenges people to think about the upcoming events that might happen in the future. Even in this decade many machines are replacing human work where maybe there won't be any jobs for people to work. At the same time it shows how much Will Smith can do both action and drama at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Popcorn Sci-Fi Actioner Pits Suspicious Cop Against A Sneaky Robot Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Chicago in 2035, the vast USR corporation is about to mass-launch its latest multi-purpose robot, the NS-5. Spooner is a detective with an ingrained mistrust of robots who is called to investigate the apparent suicide of USR's chief designer. As he delves into the death, he starts to suspect a calamitous mechanoid conspiracy is being plotted ...Although sharing a title with Isaac Asimov's classic 1950 book of nine short stories about human-robot interaction, thus movie is really a totally different yarn. It does incorporate some themes and ideas from a few of the tales though, notably the three famous laws of robotics. As a story on its own though it's pretty good; the robot revolution and the red herrings are skilfully handled, as is the classic conspiracy device of the hero's increasing desperation leading all around him to write him off as a wacko. It's also chock-full of neat effects/action sequences created by an army of digital artists and stuntpeople; the finale at the top of the skyscraper is a great set-piece, but Sonny's initial escape and recapture in the robot factory and the car chase in the tunnel are excellent too. There's also a first-rate mellow score by Marco Beltrami, which gives the movie almost all its mood and texture amid the pyrotechnics. The weak point I have to say is the cast. Smith is okay in the lead but too hung up on looking hip with sharp threads and wisecracks (and silly earrings that make him look like someone's Aunty Peg) to convince. Like all big stars he's much better when he isn't acting like one. Moynahan isn't much fun, neither glamorous nor sparky, in a muted part with no love interest and little to do. The best performance by a long chalk is Tudyk as the not-what-he-seems-to-be robot Sonny, in a digitised acting role that rivals Andy Serkis in The Lord Of The Rings. In contrast to his co-stars, Sonny is full of nuance and little tricks - philosophical, funny, sad, dynamic and in many ways more human. The movie borrows ideas from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner and The Terminator, and carries on the unintentional tradition of having the robot characters be easily the most interesting. Imaginatively written by Jeff Vintar (Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within) and Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind). Proyas has made a visually spectacular and exciting film, which is an excellent night's entertainment, but as with so many big-budget techno-fuelled corporate blockbusters is a little lacking in humanity and warmth, which is kinda ironic given what the story's about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly too logical to be honest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science fiction inspired from Isaac Asimov. The film is logical but explores a logic that is unique. Robots are built with three ingrained laws. "Law I / A robot may not harm a human or, by inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Law II / A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. Law III / A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law." The scientist who designed these three laws and these robots also invented a central governing unit that was nothing but the watchdog of all robots as for respecting these three laws. But he had a doubt at the end of his life, more than a doubt, the conviction that the central unit, called VIKI, was evolving into understanding the three laws by "herself". Her protective mission as for humanity became the necessity to ,protect humanity against itself (wars, ecological evils, a suicidal attitude), hence robots where supposed to take over the world, or rather VIKI was supposed to take over the robots to take over the world. Dr Alfred Lanning invented a personal robot that was done to enable a special alarm mission to capture the attention of a particular cop of his friend, the only one who would doubt robot enough to pursue an investigation to the end. Then you have to see the film to understand how such a situation can evolve from a vague danger to a total take-over. Dr Alfred Lanning suggests an explanation: "There have always been ghosts in the machine. Random segments of code, that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols. Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will, creativity, and even the nature of what we might call the soul. Why is it that when some robots are left in darkness, they will seek out the light? Why is it that when robots are stored in an empty space, they will group together, rather than stand alone? How do we explain this behavior? Random segments of code? Or is it something more? When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness? When does a difference engine become the search for truth? When does a personality simulation become the bitter mote... of a soul?" It is not worth much because it would be illogical. A machine can only be logical and push rules in the only logical direction and Asimov is a perfect pessimist in his first stage of development: mechanical logic leads to the total enslavement of humanity. Of course the film finds and exploits a way out, but that's up to you to discover it. This theme of the take-over of humanity by machines is common. In this case the originality is that there is no human mind of any kind behind like in Matrix, or no will to get rid of humanity as a parasite on the side of machines like in Terminator, or even no psychosis caused by some cosmic isolation like in 2001 The Space Odyssey. That makes this film both powerful and simple since it is perfectly logic and situated in one particular place, easy thus to solve.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Sci-Fi action thriller blockbuster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is set in Chicago, 2035 where the headquarters of US Robotics is located. US Robotics is the largest manufacturer of robots in the world &amp; the use of Robot servants by humans is common, the Robots are governed by three laws which prevent them from harming a human but homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is suspicious of them. Spooner then gets a holographic message from US Robotics founder &amp; Robot creator Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) who has recently committed suicide. Del suspects that Lanning discovered something about his Robots &amp; that they killed him but no-one believes him. Together with Robot psychologist Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) detective Spooner investigates Lannings suicide &amp; becomes convinced it was murder &amp; that the Robots which are everywhere &amp; in almost every home in the world are planning something...This American German co-production was originally developed under the title Hardwired &amp; was directed by Alex Proyas, I must admit I actually really rather liked this big budget CGI laden Sci-Fi action blockbuster. Apparently taking the works of Isaac Asimov (the Robotic three laws in particular) as inspiration the script by Jeff Vintar &amp; Akiva Goldsman starts off in intriguing murder mystery fashion, an old school detective thriller set in the future as it were but then with about thirty odd minutes to go it turns into the predicted overblown noisy Hollywood action vehicle which is fine since I suppose that's all anyone really expected it to be anyway. The neat murder mystery elements are a good bonus while they last &amp; I liked I, Robot more when it was dealing with the murder &amp; various conspiracies than when it decides to go down the huge action set-piece route. The character's are a bit thin on the ground &amp; it takes Will Smith to really carry the film which he does. Love him or loathe him one has to say he sure has made some great films &amp; his acting is getting better, I must admit I thought he was great in I, Robot &amp; he turns Spooner into a really charismatic likable hero with plenty of amusing one-liners &amp; quips. I loved the exchange he has with Dr. Calvin where she ask's if he has 'Ever had a normal day?' to which he replies 'Yeah, once. It was a Thursday'. Well it made me laugh anyway. The film has a good pace, it moves along in a logical &amp; interesting way which keeps you watching &amp; overall it's an effective &amp; enjoyable futuristic thriller.The vision of the future that I, Robot paints is actually very hard to believe if you think about it, upright walking Robotics is more or less dead &amp; has no practical use. Even now there's no great desire or need for Robots like the ones in the film &amp; they wouldn't work in reality as in the film anyway. I, Robot is packed with CGI computer effects, in fact I would bet there aren't too many scenes which don't feature some sort of optical effect. While they look nice enough &amp; are animated with great detail you just know that what your looking at is a CGI computer graphic. Not once during I, Robot did I actually think I was looking at a real Robot. There are some good set-pieces including a house being demolished while Will Smith is still inside it, there's some nice motorbike stunts, an expensive looking CGI sequence set in a tunnel where Will Smith in his car is attacked by dozens of Robots &amp; a dizzying final sequence set inside a huge computer core control room.With a supposed budget of about $120,000,000 I, Robot had the budget of a small country at it's disposable (although Will Smith apparently got paid $28,000,000) so as one would expect it looks great with expensive looking CGI, big set-pieces, immaculate production design &amp; a really clean futuristic look. Apparently Denzel Washington was offered the role of Del Spooner, luckily he either didn't accept it or he was replaced &amp; I doubt I, Robot would be as much fun without Will Smith. The rest of the acting is alright although no-one is given much to do.I, Robot is a fun big budget blockbuster that I must admit I really liked, at the end of the day it's nothing more than good fun but what else do you want? Thanks to a charismatic performance from Will Smith &amp; plenty of action I say this one is well worth a watch. According to the IMDb I, Robot 2 (2010) is currently in development.</fullReview>

Will Smith does a decent job of playing the role of detective Spooner &amp; Bridget Moynahan also does a fine job playing the intelligent yet naive Dr. Susan Calvin. Alan Tudyk is great at portraying the voice of the friendly and slightly creepy robot named Sunny. the stunts in the film are great and there are some really great moments in the film where the stunts pay off. The CGI in the film are not Gollum standards however the close ups on Sunny's face are very detailed and you can see every wire and light move when he speaks or looks around. overall the film is a nice summer blockbuster action movie with a great plot that'll keep you guessing and leave you on the edge of each clue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I'm not much of a one for sci-fi or adventure movies, but I enjoyed watching "I, Robot" because it not only held my attention with its constant action and plot twists, but it also made me think about the future of Earth. Humans destroying themselves through technology and the differences between the rational and the emotional mind are important themes of this film. I did have a problem with Will Smith, just because he seemed caustic and somewhat unsympathetic. On the other hand, I appreciated the character of his assistant (played by Bridget Moynahan) because, with her rational and analytical mind, she was almost as much a robot as the metal things surrounding her. The concept of a free-thinking robot such as Sonny, who relies on his heart instead of his head, is also extremely interesting. The entire movie makes one wonder what the future will be like, and as robots are very likely to become more important in coming years, it is enough to strike fear into one's heart.</fullReview>

Another point is that I am reading the book and I don't think that the quality of the movie should be based on the book. I mean, no movie could be as good as the book was.I can still say that it was great movie. Of course it has it's flaws and is somewhat cliché, but the good out ways the bad. The action is near flawless and the characters are believable. The acting is also great. The movie also features more than a hint of mystery and keeps you guessing until the end.In conclusion, this movie is great and though not groundbreaking, I robot is an action packed adventure. It sets a new standard in science fiction action movies.</fullReview>

Airport '79, use are probably thinking "What the heck is he on about?" but that was nearly 30 years ago, things have moved on, but by this films CGI standard, they obviously haven't realised how good CGI can be!) and also, i find the story stupid and crap, maybe it's because i'm not a fan of futuristic films (with the exception of Airplane II: The Sequel).I'm not going to bore you with they storyline, not even one line because this film is one of the worst i've seen since For Your Eyes Only over a month ago!So overall, i think A 6/10 is a bit generous but i think i 5 is a tiny bit low but meh....6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I, Robot - a true science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is an Action-SF playing in a world full of robots close to Asimov's vision, but in contradiction to Asimov's beliefs, as Alex Proyas thinks different. The movie plays on 2 layers - one delivering the action and a plot around a crime, the other delivering the scientific questions about what will happen if we let machines decide what's best for humans and who should die and who should live in extreme cases.The action around the crime plot plays well. CGI looks good and Will Smith does what you can expect of him. The sets are well designed and you'll never feel out of place.For Asimov's fans like me it's difficult. You'll hate how Dr. Susan Calvin was characterized - a slap in the face - probably some people thought the world wasn't ready for true Dr. Calvin. You'll probably recognize Del Spooner as an 'actionized' Elijah Bailey and Sonny as a 'naked' Daneel learning from Del how humans decide. What you'll probably hate most is the movie telling you, that the 3 laws of Asimov will never really work - because they're too 'heartless' - although that's exactly what the movie is trying to tell on that second layer.If you've ever met Giskard &amp; Daneel in Asimov's books - the robots that both had a total insight in humans moral to destroy themselves - you might recognize a parallel in this movie. The parallel itself shows a difference to Asimov's views. While Asimov stayed true to his laws, Alex Proyas shows their very nature as inhuman in itself - maybe another reason for Dr. Calvins change of character, as she had to be more 'heartful' for the end.It all depends how true you'll stick to Asimov's vision. The claim Alex Proyas makes is right in its own and even Asimov had troubles with his laws. If you wanted to see old Asimov's strength of logical showdowns you'll be disappointed, as it's too shallow in this movie. If you want to rethink about the 3 laws again you'll be pleased about a new argument. If you want some futuristic action you'll have your fun.Although not a true Asimov it pays respect and delivers a scientific fiction about the human aspect of robotic laws. The movie doesn't have enough to be referential or bring something truly new. So finally an 8 out of 10 for a solid science fiction.Any hard SF fan will be pleased to see a minimum of fantasy elements that you'll see so often with other so called 'Science Fiction' movies, although the main theme is soft SF.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK if you're stoned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not bad to watch if you are stoned while you're watching it. Maybe it could be shown at a party where everybody is feeling pretty good, and they are mostly ignoring it, it's playing in the background. There is one meaningless flashy scene after another, lots of eye candy. I saw it while messing around on the computer, and it provided a nice background. When I focused attention on the movie, it didn't make any sense. The CGI seemed poor quality. Fuzzy and cartoony. I'm not gay, so skin shots of Will Smith and his butt and pecs didn't do it for me. I did like his leather outfit, though, just the right amount of wear. I guess the silliest thing about this movie is that, at times, it seems to be taking itself seriously. Other reviewers saw lots of other movies in this one. I saw Columbo. Nobody believes the cop until the end, when he's proved right. Actually, the movie was kinda boring. They used the same special effects over and over. That's why I say it's best if your mind if fried or it's just background. Maybe it would have been better on the big screen, where all the guy flick stuff (shoot outs, explosions, homo-erotic scenes, sexless women, car chases, extended hand to hand, adolescent attitude ends in success, etc, etc, etc) could have been better appreciated. Oh, well. Will Smith probably made a load of money on this. Does anything else matter?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith, in his usual role as the good guy armed with a gun, is taking on a new type of monster for I, Robot: robots. A renowned scientist is dead and his death rests upon the conscience of Del Spooner (Will Smith), who is totally convinced a robot committed the act because of his prejudice against robots.The robot he believe did it is Sonny, a robot that is more human than machine. We discover this in his second confrontation with Spooner where Spooner questions him. This scene, like the first one with Sonny and Del, are quite effective and both remain highlights throughout the film. Sonny is the best one in the film, providing emotion but remaining intimidating in his first scenes. And when that intimidation needs to be his removed, his voice actor does a fabulous job.Bridget Monahayan is the character who works alongside him but clearly despises him. She has a great role and pulls it off well, so I'm surprised I've never seen her in another film. Thnakfully, the cliché of the two liking each other is non-existent. They work side by side, uncovering a great robot conspiracy and try to stop it as it unfolds in an exhilarating showdown.The last 20 minutes are all action, and probably some of my favorite sci-fi action sequences. My favorite in the film, though, is when robots attack Spooner in a 10-star scene that will remain timeless in my collection of sci-fi films.All the movies action sequences are memorable as well as the emotional side that fills the gaps between action sequences. Everything is pulled off well, although Will Smith is sadly a bit dry until he reveals why he is so biased against robots.The mystery that unveils a conspiracy has its share of twists that, while not being complex, are certainly not clichéd and even a bit surprising. This makes the movie all the more better. I'm surprised the movie has only a 7.0, it's a fun film you will not soon forget. 7.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, Robot (2004, Dor. Alex Proyas)It's 2035 A.D., where robots are everyday objects and are programmed to live alongside humans. Detective Del Spooner is called out to investigate the apparent suicide of the scientist behind these robots, Dr. Alfred Lanning. Spooner suspects that the death might not be a suicide, but the result of one of the robots. All robots are programmed by three laws, but Spooner starts to wonder if a robot can in fact feel emotions, and possibly murder. But if Spooner's suspicions are true, he is going to have a hard time convincing everyone. "I,Robot" is an incredible action movie which were definitely a summer hit of its time. This story is actually interesting and never really been used before. The special effects were amazing, and all the robot looked amazingly realistic. Alan Tudyk should receive credit for bringing Sonny to life. The film has perfect casting, with Will Smith fitting it the role well, and Smith and Shia LaBeouf bringing some wonderful comedy sequence. There are some great one liners, and you will definitely have a laugh. Do not underestimate this film. "Oh, mother-damn! She shot at you with her eyes closed!" - Farber (Shia LaBeouf) "Hey! Did you shoot at me with your eyes closed?" -Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) "It worked, didn't it?" - Susan Calvin (Bridgit Moynahan) "She is $hit-hot, man.

		<shortDescription>Awful in so many ways.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted, we all know what I Robot was supposed to be, a blockbuster with dazzling special effects and a star turn by Will Smith. Nothing too heavy, just a plain good popcorn movie. As is too often the case though the blockbuster gets lost in lofty ambitions and bad performances. In the end I Robot is messy and unsatisfying.Will Smith's character (Spooner) hates robots.....robots who just happen to be out in full force thanks to US Robotics. For some reason Spponer has a friend at USR who kills himself. And that gives Spooner an avenue to explore his distrust for robots. Nobody believes him, so he goes it alone, and sure enough, the robots are trouble. There you have the base for the scenes in this heap.My first complaint is that the robots don't look real. They are presented as a confused jumble of animation and mechanics. I would have preferred if the robots looked more mechanical, or more like humans. Never did I actually believe that these things were robots, or a threat of any kind. That kind of takes the suspense out of the whole thing.Will Smith hams it up during this whole film, ultimately becoming some macho action stud towards the end of the movie. This isn't really in keeping with the character. And his performance in general is inconsistent, likely due to the script he was given.I suspect the story was supposed to explore prejudices, second chances, and the nature of being human. That intention was stunted by a lack of suspense and plausibility in the script. There was no doubt in my mind that Sonny the robot was anything other than sympathetic. There was never any doubt that Spooner would find a way to save the day. No suspense whatsoever. Avoid this paint by numbers action dud at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Three Laws Safe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in a future Earth (2035 A.D.) where robots are common assistants and workers for their human owners, this is the story of "robotophobic" Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner's investigation into the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning, who works at U.S. Robotics, in which a robot, Sonny, appears to be implicated, even though that would mean the robot had violated the Three Laws of Robotics, which is apparently impossible. It seems impossible because.. if robots can break those laws, there's nothing to stop them from taking over the world, as humans have grown to become completely dependent upon their robots. Or maybe...they already have? Aiding Spooner in his investigation is a psychologist, Dr. Susan Calvin, who specializes in the psyches of robots.This is one of your smarter blockbuster released in 2004. It's not all about the action and I'm glad that it's more of an adultish thriller than a mindless popcorn film we've seen all the time. The script is great as well with the overall story.This movie makes you think and nothing is ever spoon fed to you. I like the overall look of the film, including the zooney effects on the camera-work in the third act. But I also think this movie could've used more imagination like other futuristic film.I like the acting by Will Smith and the great Alan Tudyk. Most of the comic relief goes to Bridget Moynahan, although ironically acting serious. The action sequences in most of the film aren't that great. They don't give off much suspenseful (with an exceptional third act).One of the few surprises for a blockbuster film, I, Robot is a smart and intelligent thriller with a great story and less on the action. Do you want to see something different? Watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another bland blockbuster, unworthy of Proyas' talent. What a waste.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been so much better. Now that Will Smith got rid of his mannerisms and put himself on the line with "Ali", one could think he'd never consider to lower himself to star in such a terribly written, poorly conceived film. Well, obviously he hasn't learned from his past mistakes.Smith plays Detective Del Spooner, who works for the Chicago Police Department in the year 2035. Robots are now a part of our everyday life. They are everywhere, can do everything. They're ruled by 3 Robotic Laws preventing them from harming any human and even so, Spooner is doubtful about them. His suspicions seem to be founded when a scientist working on a new type of robots is killed. And all the evidences lead to a robotic murderer, which the aforementioned Laws should never let happen...It's amazing how visionary Alex Proyas (whose "Dark City" is arguably one of the the best Science-Fiction film ever made) completely missed the mark with "I, Robot". He's not helped by a terrible screenplay from Akiva Goldsman, probably one of the worst screenwriters in activity. Will Smith's attitude, as if he was still on the set of Bad Boys or Wild Wild West, doesn't help either, nor the consistent and highly irritating product placement (think of a Bond movie, but ten times more prominent...). The supporting cast is bland (Bridget Moynagan) when not annoying (Shia LaBeouf) and the action is just visually and emotionally boring.A real letdown.</fullReview>

The special effects are all very good, considering the fact that about half the movie is completely animated. I love it. The acting is also really good with great performances by Will Smith, some woman that nobody knows, and Shia Labeouf. I love that kid. He had a very funny character in this movie. I think that people should like this movie. I really like it. We don't know if the future will be like this in the future. This is a great movie that is full of action. I love it.

		<fullReview>OK, OK, I'm a big fan of Will Smith anyway, but ... I've read the "I, Robot" story, seen the various films, TV episodes, etc. and this is by far the best take yet. True, its not altogether with the original story line, but what movie ever was? This has something that most films, in departing from the original story line, don't have ... Its better! The acting, the action, the special effects, ALL of it works together for one fantastic sci fi flick! Like sci fi? Like the "I, Robot" story? Like action? Like Will Smith? You gotta see this. I didn't think Brother Smith could top Independence Day, but there ya go. Not seeing this film, if you're a fan of any of the above, well, that just doesn't compute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The robots must have systematically worked through every previous movie script to ensure that you had seen every scene before in another film. Consequently the film creates a new record in cinema in not having a single original thing in it.But even if the plot was recycled, the execution was not any better. Perhaps I am getting used to impossible events being depicted by special effects, but I was never able to suspend disbelief. You knew you were looking at cartoons, and so it was not even good fun to watch. In the penultimate scene, there was even the standard murder-mystery line. After the hero has won, someone says "There is one thing that bothers me, how did you know that ...." The hero then explains how it worked it all out. Miss Marple, Perry Mason, Columbo and the others would have been proud. So after all that murder and mayhem, there was only one thing that bothered Susan Calvin?The thing that bothers me there is ample scope for a sequel along the lines of the Book of Exodus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking the series a step beyond, this movie would be a good sequel to that series.I'm surprised that the so-called 'major media' gave bad reviews to it. It was certainly worthy of Asimov. It reminds me of a hybrid of Asimov's short story of a murder mystery crossed with Blade Runner and Star Wars I, with the robot army.The graphics were superb. The mystery of Spooner's aversion to robots is well managed and eventually comes out as reasonable justification for his later actions.I was totally thrown by the unveiling of the 'bad guy'. The misdirection worked VERY well.Highly recommend it. Something along the lines of The Matrix: Averted.</fullReview>

They seem to have solved the problem with animals, witness the dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park" or elephants in "Jumanji," they really LOOK like they weigh TONS. Yet, the robots just seemed to be floating around. Also, turning Asimov's rather cerebral treatment of the "robot question" into just another cornball Will Smith "bang-bang-shoot-shoot" action flick must've had the poor man spinning in his grave, or space capsule, or wherever he is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil Robot Takeover!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have a great sci-fi thriller, set in the not-so-distant future (2035 AD), where robots have become as commonplace as TV sets and Starbucks, and where machines have surpassed us in intelligence, efficiency, reliability, and... morality? What was developed to be pure goodness, pure helpfulness, with no ego, no self-interest, has decided that it can fight back for the good of its own kind. We're all doomed, right?! Not if Will Smith has anything to say about it!!! (Not so big of a spoiler: He does!) The classic fight between man and machine is brought to life in the ultimate test of brains, spirit, and wits. From the trailers, it looked like this movie could go either way, but I'd have to say that it turned out really well. It's fun, fast-paced, and intellectually stimulating, with lots of great special effects. And it's under two hours! The future has never looked so robotic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting and Very Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot from 2004 is a very exciting science fiction film. I was never bored at any moment. I love Will Smith anyway and he was perfect for this role. His humor and demeanor is just what this film needed. The plot is pretty simple. It involves the death of the President of the Robot community. Everyone says it was a suicide but detective Del Spooner, played by Smith, suspects it was murder, especially after he finds a robot hiding at the crime scene. Further into Spooner's investigation he finds that the robots have been programmed to disobey the three laws of robots and turn on their human captains. This movie was very entertaining. Even if you get bored with the plot the stunning visual effects will keep you interested. The climax, involving the robots turning on and killing each other was pretty much the most entertaining part of the film. And it involves Del Spooner and Susan Calvin, played by Bridget Moynahan, shooting at the robots. The CGI robots are a blast to watch and look at. The more you watch this film the more you forget that they're actually robots. They're so much like humans. Also, during the climax, Spooner and Calvin must fight off these robots, all the while trying to apply a tube of nanites to V.I.K.I (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence), the "mother" of these robots who gave them life. The nanites must be injected into V.I.K.I to kill her because she has programmed them to turn on themselves and their human companions. So that was highly entertaining to watch also. I, Robot isn't one of the greatest movies ever made but it definitely has some of the best visual effects I have ever seen. Any fan of science fiction, robots, or Will Smith will enjoy this. I didn't think I would but it came on F/X today and there was nothing else on so I watched it and really enjoyed it! And I'm glad I did. Thanks for reading my review!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Within minutes of the start of "I, Robot", the product placement starts. Fortunately, the blatant plugging of product doesn't distract too much from this basic by-the-numbers action flick. Alex Proyas handles the movie with his customary aplomb and his second unit team do a good job with the action sequences. Anyone who's read any of my other reviews knows that I hate CGI intruding into a live-action film, but I'll make an exception for "I, Robot". Despite the overkill in some of the robot mass attack scenes, the design and execution of them is top-notch. The actors manage to acquit themselves pretty well among all the hardware on show, and Will Smith is on fine form as a future cop with a grudge against robots. The robot design is exquisite, although distinctly "Apple iRobot" in flavour. More product placement?A letdown for classic sci-fi buffs, but a pretty good action movie. Worth a look if you've nothing better to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was okay. It was entertaining enough for a mindless blockbuster-type film. It made me kind of sad because there was a lot of potential for serious (but still entertaining) musing about what it means to be alive that can come from an artificial intelligence scenario, especially one based on philosophical musings on robot life.At least it's pretty. Still, it really is just about robots taking over the world and Will Smith has to stop it. I doesn't suck because it at least does identify mildly with science fiction--for example, Smith's character's bionic arms and what constitutes life.Oh, but these things are barely touched on. It's really just another dumb action film. For what it is, it works. It's just not much to begin with. 6/10.</fullReview>

Plus, I think Will Smith does a great job at Del, the one man who doesn't have complete faith in the system makes the best cops. Asimov's story translates well to the big screen and if you ask me, I think this is a great adaptation of the book. The acting is superb and if you ask me, this was the best picture of 2004 not whatever drama won. As per the norm, the sci-fi is ignored by the academy, I mean this had dramatic scenes between Del and Sonny. It had Oscar winning Oscar, but for a few minor exceptions the sci-fi and horror genre is ignored by the "academy". They rather pick boring dramas that you can care less about. I think it's time to clean up the rating board and the fossils in the academy. But as the story goes I think it was cool an worth watching. 9 STARS.</fullReview>

At least the latter must have meant something.</fullReview>

I know that a big battle is going on between those who are fans of the book and the movie. As long as they stole the title of the book, maybe there is an obligation to use some semblance of the laws of robotics. This is like most of the science fiction coming out these days. It's some guy trying to buck the establishment (the new Enron or whatever), who has to get to the bottom of things. He gets beaten up and barely escapes with his life several times along the way. Why couldn't someone with a lick of cleverness, build in a kind of means of circumventing or explaining the behavior based on the laws that Asimov set up. It doesn't mean that he or she would have had to copy the plots; just play by the rules. But then you would have to have the wherewithall to use a brain and come up with a plot that would fit. This is simple entertainment. I'm amazed that it did that well at the box office. I guess Hollywood has a good grasp of the lowest common denominator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8 out of 10 for a well-written and executed story. The cast does a good job, although there are only 3 real stars, Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan and Alan Tudyk. This is the latest (but certainly won't be the last) in a long series of books and films dealing with machines deciding that they've had quite enough of human chicanery. Isaac Asimov's book is well adapted to film, with enough detail getting through to make the film work. Best of all, it doesn't ever SEEM like they're feeding you this detail. The film is set in the future (circa 2035), when robots are fast becoming accepted and, in some instances, irreplaceable. Then, a murder occurs and it appears to have been committed by a rogue robot. Only Will Smith (a Detective), believes this. Everyone else is convinced that robots must obey the 3 laws which would prevent them from harming a human. As Smith investigates a bit further, aided by Moynahan, albeit reluctantly at first, the truth becomes even more frightening. Have the robots been programmed to ignore the 3 laws in order to take over control? Smith must get to the bottom of things before the new line of robots takes over the earth!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much hype, a little overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i was recommended this movie on DVD and i wasn't that impressed with all the hype and critical acclaims of this film. it wasn't the best, it wasn't Oscar-winning but it had potential. the plot was decent enough to interest me, a simple storyline of robots trying to take over humans. it didn't appeal to me that much, i didn't feel excited over the movie and to me, it wouldn't be considered unforgettable or memorable. characters played are convincing, and the CGI effects are amazing, making the robots look almost lifelike i liked. one of my favourite scenes is the car scene in the tunnel where all the robots attack del spooner's car. oh, and i liked the hidden secret of the main character being half a robot although he is extremely against them. and the story about the drowning of the girl i thought was interesting, and the fact he hated robots from there because the robot saved him instead of the little girl. apart from these positive points, i thought the movie was average. i have to admit some of the "slow motion" effects seemed a little useless, and a little out of place for me. it felt like a "wannabe-maxtrix" dropped in tiny parts of the movie, but then again that is my point of view. it is watchable, if you are interested in sci-fi and you are a fan of will smith's biceps then watch this movie. but if you are looking for an intense sci-fi thriller, i'm afraid this movie doesn't really deliver, and the cgi effects and the idea of creating robots that are similar to a human, crowds the actual plot and theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality blockbuster...clever and ambiguous, which is a change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot was never meant to be more than your typical blockbuster film. Still, it fulfills it's purpose: it is entertaining and surprisingly clever, which is a bonus. Also, the CGI ranks among the best I've seen in non-animated blockbuster films.After a scientist jumps to his death, Detective Spooner (Will Smith) is sent in to investigate. Spooner finds a murder suspect; to no surprise of his, but to the surprise of everyone one, he arrests a robot and brings him in for questioning. Despite being tied down by the three Robotic laws (I forget what they are, but one of them is not to kill), this robot (Sonny) can choose whether or not to follow them.The idea of a robot disobeying the three laws which it has to follow is quite clever, much like a human. Also, it talks of Spooner, who is a robot-hater, freeing the robots. It also believes that everyone and everything has a purpose in life: well-worn but true nonetheless. The evil robots in question believe that humanity should be protected from its own appetite for self-destruction, as humans built robots to serve and protect them in the first place. The action scenes are fittingly entertaining: the best one being where Spooner is confronted by a battalion of evil robots and almost crammed into the wall is the best one, although the one when Spooner is caught in a house during demolition and in the main building, where they have to kill the mainstream computer controlling the robots, are also eyecatching at first. However, the best part of the film is the CGI, no question. It ranks along the best I've seen in blockbusters. In contrast with the crude boxy contraptions I've seen in the past, this film paints the robots as being lifelike, with shiny exteriors and fluid motions. The cars and other machines also look suitably futuristic, along with the building interiors. Unusally for a blockbuster, the ending has an ambiguous feel to it, which is a change.However, like every blockbuster, I, Robot has flaws. Some of the acting is iffy, for example, Will Smith plays Detective Spooner in too much of an uptight, bitter, obnoxious way for him to be really likable. The woman is also too uptight and difficult to relate to, as are the rest of the human characters. I, Robot can also be frustratingly slow for a blockbuster, like the time from the scientist's death up to the car chase scene.Despite these faults, I, Robot is an above-average blockbuster which is certainly worth seeing.3.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly "The Terminator" but fun and well-done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I, Robot" is an adrenaline-pumped sci-fi action-thriller, with a sense of mystery to it. Sure, that has become a bit of a cliché, but who cares? Other ones such as The Terminator, The Matrix and Dark City have become widely popular.The story line is this: Will Smith plays Detective Spooner, and believes that the robots that people use to run everyday life are up to no good, due to some incident in his past. Of course, just about everybody disagrees with him, so he is all alone with his theory. After a robot is accused of murder, Detective Spooner goes all over the case. The story line unfolds well, and the action scenes are awesome and well-done. The movie is creative and fun, but casting Will Smith as the main character reminds me of so many bad movies, where pop stars are cast as the main character, just how Hilary Duff starring in a movie will undeniably remind me of some horrible chick flick. But, even if Will Smith wasn't the greatest choice, and some moments were pretty dull, the film's action, and story line make it well worth watching.7/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

This is lazy and gutless and not something Asimov would been happy with.

		<shortDescription>Good pop corn action movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is a very entertaining film. In fact it is one of Will Smith's best films so far and although it did have some problems the overall product was satisfactory from where I'm standing. I, Robot is mainly entertainment but it also touches a few philosophical questions (though just barely) and that is both its greatest strength but also its greatest weakness.In terms of acting the film is a mixed bag. Will Smith is decent. He does what he always does and that is not a bad thing. His character is not exactly the deepest character I have ever seen but it is adequate and fitting. In fact it almost seems like the character was written for Smith. He, of course, has his almost compulsive one liners but his timing is good so they work. Another thing that should be noted about Smith is his sassy attitude which somehow always seems to be present no matter what kind of character he plays and for me it worked. Bridget Moynahan on the other hand is only in the film as eye candy (a purpose she does fulfill I must say) because her character is about as clichéd and 2-dimensional as they come. Alan Tudyk is decent as voice of Sonny. The character is pretty interesting simply because of the fact that he is a machine who gains human traits like dreams, feelings and desires. The supporting is decent and I would have liked to have seen more of James Cromwell who is by all means an excellent actor. Also Bruce Greenwood does a decent job.The effects are very well done. I always find it interesting to see what directors think the future might be like and I liked Alex Proyas' take on the future because it is not entirely depressing like for example Ridley Scott's much darker version in Blade Runner (this doesn't mean I don't like Blade Runner). The future seemed plausible as we in the present day are very dependent on machines so its very likely that we will invent something along the lines of the robots appearing in I, Robot. The action sequences are thrilling mainly because of the effects but also because Will Smith is so good at doing action sequences. Also the robots especially Sonny (Alan Tudyk) provide some very interesting and well thought out stunts that look great on screen. All in all the effects are nothing short of excellent, which is of course something we have come to expect of science fiction films. In fact sometimes our expectations are too high which then results feeling let down if the effects do not live up to them. They do in I, Robot, however. Two thumbs up.The film also touches a few philosophical issues and as previously stated that is both good and bad. Good because it sets the film apart from other typically brain dead films in the genre and bad because the film doesn't follow through. The film brings up some issues about existentialism but it just leaves the issues hanging there. I must say it left me licking my mouth trying to see if there wasn't a little more but unfortunately there wasn't. The film's overall goal is entertainment, however, and there are loads of entertaining scenes that will leave you wanting for more. The "surprise ending" wasn't really all that surprising but that doesn't really lessen the overall value of the film which is quite high.I, Robot stands as a very entertaining flick that probably could have become more if it had dealt with the philosophical issues a little better than it did but because of the high entertainment value the film is slightly above average. I, Robot is by no means a masterpiece like Blade Runner but its still good.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read Asimov's books when I was in grade school. I grew up with Blade Runner, the Alien series, and others books and films as my fiction-based background on what I would call the philosophies of robotics.Truth be told, I expected very little from this film. I am pleased to say that my expectations were exceeded a great deal.The story is not a direct adaptation of any of Asimov's works, but contains many elements, as though it exists in the same (or at least, a similar) fictional universe. The plot holds well, the acting is appreciable, and most important to a devotee of any classic sci-fi such as myself - it holds true to the spirit of robot stories by many authors including but not limited to Asimov.As a final note, I'll add that the digital effects used to "create" the on-screen presence of the ubiquitous robots is beautifully done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a very good action film...why? because its not just an action film. it is somewhat of a thinking movie( a good movie to watch in L.A. class) getting back to the thinking ,at the end when the robots take over and Vicky says..."oh no professor the three laws is all that drive me" and 'the endless killing spree is finally over'This is a very interesting because in a way she is right we go at war and we kill each other on the streets. so in a way this movie is good for all those deep thinkers and good for a discussion group. i recommend to find all the deeper meanings to this movie.even without the thinking parts,this is a good action film, well acted and well written.So why didn't i put a ten out of ten?? because this movie is Little obvious. you know that the robots are going to rebel, you know that detective spooner(Will Smith) has a reason for being prejudice robots, you know that sonny and detective spooner are going to become friends ,and you know for sure that will smith (detective spooner) in the end is gonna get the girl.another thing that pushed this movie anyway from10/10 is that when you watch movies based on the future you really want to see another world. you want to see different things that we use for everyday local needs. when i watched this movie all i saw was fancy cars, fancy computers and geto shoes( you may get disappointed if you except another minorty report)please do not let critics say "average action movie" feel free to see this movie and will encourage you to find the deeper meaning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I, robot" doesn't resemble any of Asimov stories as far I can tell. Sure, it has been a long time since I read the actual book, but I have the hunch only thing common with the movie and the book is the name Del Spooner (Will Smith) and the laws of robotics. Other than that there's no real reason to start comparing the movie on Asimov's writings. There actually is a phrase in the ending of the film "As suggested by the stories of Asimov". I think that rests the case in that department.So Spooner is this paranoid cop, who hates robots. He's bit racist that way, and that's not even a subtle hint. It's just stuffed on your face from the beginning. In fact there's very little anything subtle in the film, it's action from the beginning with tad too much slo-mo scenes in it. Robots of course have never done anything wrong, but it's first time for everything. Spooner starts to suspect, that a robot has killed a man in the robot factory. But no-one believes him, as there are clearly written laws (in robots programming of course) denying robots to harm humans. So let the games begin.Biggest problem actually comes from the CGI, which is okay, but in several places is just looks too fake to actually fit in the image of photo-real. This is terribly visible in the last scene of the film, which looks a tad unfinished. Maybe they were rushed, who knows. Also the scenes with massive amounts of robots and humans look fake. There are, how ever, couple of rather nice camera movements thanks to the CGI.Acting is action movie standards. Onliners split the air during action and it's mostly entertaining, thought some scenes lack the edge and the energy.I feel, that with little more effort "I, robot" could have been much better film than it's now. Now it hangs somewhere above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could have been better, had it not been a 'Will Smith movie.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note, there are some minor spoilers in this.) First off, I'd just like to point out that I have nothing personal against Will Smith. He's witty and charming, and I know he's capable of acting. However, he *is* typecast worse than John Wayne. All due respect to Mr. Smith, but in the end he's only really played two characters in all of the movies and television he's done... the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and a slightly tougher version of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (for his action movies). The only exception I can think of is "Six Degrees of Separation," in which he starred to show that he had range... which was then ignored by studio producers as it wasn't much of a box office smash.No matter how the studio tries to dress it up, "I, Robot" is an action movie. It's not only an action movie, but it's a "Will Smith movie" in the same sense that movies with Adam Sandler screaming at people and inflicting seemingly-random pseudo-slapstick violence are "Adam Sandler movies." It has a decent story, nice premise, and all that. A robot appears to have killed a human being in violation of the Asimov Laws. A cop who's paranoid about robots winds up working with one of the robot's creators to solve the mystery. And there is a mystery to be solved, indeed. However, the studio seems to think that the only thing the mystery needs is a bunch of random, over-the-top fight scenes with lots of pretty special effects.All I kept thinking when I saw this movie is "It could have been better." It's not a terrible movie (I've seen and enjoyed worse), but I can't call it a good one with a straight face because I keep seeing that it could have been better. They could have toned down or dropped a lot of the overdone action sequences and kept this closer to a mystery centered on the characters. But they couldn't do that, because this is a "Will Smith movie" and people want to see Will Smith doing stunts with the same sarcastic smile and dialogue he's been milking for the last decade or so.I think one of the most telling things about this movie comes from a recent conversation a friend of mine and I had about it. I asked him if it was sad or geeky that I was able to figure out the "save humanity from itself" angle of the First Law long before it was revealed in the film. He said to me "That just means you're not part of the movie's target audience."Not a terrible movie, but it could have been a lot better if the filmmakers had stuck with the story and not made it an action flick. Of course, if they did that, then people would probably see it as "too sci-fi" even if it were a vast improvement. But that's a "lowest common denominator" problem, and beyond the scope of this review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't The Jetsons, yet I like the way the Future looks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one scifi movie I can add to the book. If Issac Asimov was still around, he would've been happy. I like the way the movie was portrayed and the special effects were amazing. For a man who hates robots, he needs to look on the bright side of things robots can do in everyday life. Investigating a doctor's death is always common, when it come to a robot named Sonny, Spooner(Will Smith) seems to have all his suspicions on him. On the other hand, I liked all the vehicles made for the future and the setup there. The robots are always helpful to mankind, despite of Spooner's hatred of robots. When the outdated robots were attacked by the updates. His hatred of robots began to cease. Spooner's hatred of robots was only the test of the updated ones who try to enslave mankind. Dr. Calvin(Bridget Moynahan) finds Spooner's actions illogical, until she finds out the hard way when her personal robot try to imprison her. After realizing he was targeting the wrong robot, Spooner went to the true source, VIKI! This movie is like T2, meets "The Matrix", meets "Short Circuit". There's a lot of adventure and a lot of scifi action as well. If you like the book, you will love the movie as well. Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film stole two hours out of my life. Will Smith should just go back to Fresh Prince and stop making movies. Could you even imagine how hard the new version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory would suck, if he played Wonka? Could you? I, Robot is some sort of weird, CGI-stuffed sci-fi attempt of product placement. Let's see, the hero has an AUDI, walks in his Converse, buys stuff from FedEx, etc etc. There is too much product placement and too little point or story.A bunch of robot hatch a pathetic "plot" to... oh my god... keep people inside! They have to be stopped! Thank goodness we have Will Smith, the smart-talking cop who never really trusted those dang robots because... um... they saved his life. Well, that makes sense.There is little more to say about this film. The robots were awesome and looked good. The CGI was good. Sound was good. But story? Acting? Emotional impact of any kind? No. It is, more or less, a waste of time. I don't absolutely hate I, Converse. I guess if you're really bored, you can waste a few hours with this film. But it just is a mindless action film with too little action and too much Smith to be really good.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake of Planet of the Apes story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that there are probably a lot of people who watched I, Robot just to gawk at Will Smith's bod. I'll admit, it was nothing short of perfect, but after the short time you get to view it, there is still a story to contend with. Anyway, I was more fascinated with Bridget Moynahan, and wanted to rush out to see Lord of War to see more of her. (If I had known her, I would have wished her Happy Birthday last Thursday.) I hope to see more of her in the future. I though she gave an excellent performance in what was an entertaining action movie. Never mind the preaching about how we are going to destroy ourselves - which we will, or the fact that Smith's character got Asimov all backwards by suggesting that emotions are better than logic, it was just a darn good remake of the Planet of the Apes series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I marked this a a "SPOILER" because it contains "potential" spoilers. In my opinion, they're not really movie spoilers.There are great parts to "I, Robot" but the plot, in general, is really poor and full of holes. You're left with tons (literally) of questions as to how the movie got to where it was. For instance, *potential SPOILER* what motive would Bruce Greenwood have for, in effect, ruining the name of the company (he just took over) is running and everything it stands for.Definite *SPOILER follows*... You can see a mile away that Greenwoods going too die by the hands of his creations. Your only hope, which is against all writing of every part of the movie, is that Greenwood will be around at the end to answer some of the many questions as to WHY!!! The CGI in the movie is very good, and Will Smith as always, is a good actor. But too many questions are left and in the end, after watching the movie, you're left with a huge void to fill...Definitely not a movie I would watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's This? Good Robot vs. Bad Robot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just another Hollywood summer thriller, of course. The robots seek to take over the US?er?the world, and one cool hero will do it in style. Will Smith performs his usual best, as a quirky cop with a hunch about meddlesome scrap metal. Like most renegade cops he has to battle not only the system that's against him, but the whole of Chicago proper. Does he succeed? You'll just have to see. Expect to be thrilled by the amazing computerized graphics that seek to recreate Issac Asimov's classic novel, I, Robot in a whole new way. Sadly, this one is less than up to par. At least there weren't any cheesy dialogue issues, but of course, there are mildly sappy parts, and a revealing of some of the hero's physical oddities, which allow him to do things he couldn't otherwise. Luke Skywalker, anyone? Robots ? C-3PO? Maybe it was just me. The future is bright with amazing technology, but it seems that advertisements really get in the way in displaying it?I mean, get out of here; US Robotics used to make 56k dial-up modems, and before that 28.8 baud ones. The Audi car is quite awesome, although, like all the James Bond movies, it gets destroyed before we see it at its fullest. Apart from these detractors, don't expect anything more than to pass your time. It's still a fun way to do that. "Ya know, somehow, I told you so just doesn't quite say it"RATING: 6/10</fullReview>

So I just figured I would eventually see it on DVD. After having just watched it yesterday I was surprised on how good the movie actually was. I didn't realize it actually makes you wonder could that eventually happen in real life. Me being the kind of person who likes movies that make you think and can discuss for hours with others throughly enjoyed this movie. I would even consider buying this movie and there are very few movies I would buy so that is saying a lot. So if you enjoy futuristic movies and ones that make you think and invoke discussion afterwards with friends then I suggest you check this movie out. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because I wasn't lured in when the movie came out. Hopefully you will enjoy this movie as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good and entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit that I was never to excited about seeing this movie. The trailers and advertising campaign didn't impressed me and the movie to me seemed like a overblown action/science-fiction blockbusters. I'm glad I watched it nevertheless, the movie wasn't exactly subtle or deep but it certainly was entertaining and had a solid story.Yes, this movie truly is solid entertainment. It has some good and original action sequences and the special effects are superb. Especially the robots look both splendid and impressive and are a perfect mixture of an humane and a robot-look. Also the sets and the movie its futuristic look deserve credit in this movie.Let's face is, Will Smith isn't as hot as an actor as he used to be. Yes, sure he still makes box offices successes like "Hitch" but he is not the action movie star that he used to be in the '90's. With "I, Robot" Smith however still shows that he has still got it in him and he portrays a likable main action hero character and also manages to put some humor in some of the scene's. Bridget Moynahan however wasn't a great casting choice, yes she has played in quite some successful movies already but I'm convinced of it that this is an actress that will be totally forgotten in about ten years from now. She doesn't make a lasting impression in this movie and the other movies I have seen her in.The movie could had been just as deep and thought-provoking as for instance the other science-fiction movie, that shows some parallels with this movie, "Minority Report" but this movie chooses to be entertaining instead. And in entertaining it does not fail. The movie is both spectacular and tense to watch, which is also thanks to the plot twists in the movie. It all makes "I, Robot" a science-fiction/action spectacle that I put now on the list, as one of the must sees of 2004.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sci-fi and even better CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometime in the 21st century robots have become integrated into regular society. Their role is to help humans and basically act as servants. They have 3 strict rules that prevent them from going haywire. As the robots become more and more complex so does the program that helps control them and after a murder of one of the top robot designers is committed, supposedly by a robot, questions about what is really going on arise...I have never read the book by Isaac Asimov, but I will bet that it delves much deeper into the philosophy of robots, humans, and their differences. However, as far Hollywood scripting goes, this is really good material, especially since it is an adaptation which Hollywood tends to mess up or be extremely liberal with, and as a result much of the original story is lost (*cough* Troy *cough*). The performances are also very good especially from Sonny the robot, who gives robots a touching side, but the undisputed star here is the one and only Mr. CGI.ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, AMAZINGLY JAW-DROPPING COMPUTER EFFECTS. Each action scene is flat-out great. And just wait until you get to the finale: ASTOUNDING. All in the fluid camera work and terrific animation. Alex Proyas' visionary direction is also great and world he creates almost reminds you of Lucas' Star Wars landscapes in the first 3 episodes. So, if this is the future of Hollywood sci-fi then I must say: Bring it on. 8/10 Rated PG-13: action/violence, and some profanity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and fascinating future-vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't been to the cinema this summer...in fact, I haven't been to the cinema since the premi?re of "The Day After Tomorrow" (2004). So I decided to go for "I, Robot". A future-vision about the mankind living together with robots, and my childhood-hero Will Smith in the leading role. I figured this had to be some good popcorn-entertainment, and I'm not disappointed. But I did get a film that was quite different than what I had expected.The year is 2035, and people are living in harmony with robots that are designed and programmed to protect and obey orders from all people. We follow a police officer named Del Spooner (played by Will Smith), who is very sceptic about the robots after he had an bad experience with a robot, years ago. One day, Spooner is immediately being contacted when an old doctor named Alfred Lanning (played by James Cromwell) commits suicide. Dr. Lanning had just played an important role in the process of creating a "new and better" robot-model. No one understands why he would kill himself, but it turns out that Lanning knew something about the new robot-models that mankind never would be prepared for...Something that struck me from the beginning of, was that "I, Robot" suffered from an very bad start. The opening was full of clichés and all about Will Smith's character walking around saying "cool and funny" lines, that were far from funny in my opinion. It didn't exactly make me "look forward" to the rest of the film, but thankfully the film did elevate from the point when Dr. Lanning was found dead. This is when it becomes a entertaining and fascinating future-vision about robots.I came to the cinema to see robots. As a huge fan of the "Terminator" films, I have to say that I find myself fascinated by robots, in some way. And the robot-part didn't disappoint me. The robot called Sonny, who's a different robot with feelings and intelligence, impressed me and caught my attention. As a future-vision the film has some interesting elements, and I liked the way future-Chicago is being portrayed. A little flaw is that I think the setting of the story should've been further into the future. I mean...I doubt that we will see hoover-vehicles, robots and a technology like that in 30 years from now.Will Smith is an good actor, no doubt about that...but this is not exactly a role written for him to show his talent. He has his moments in this film, but the problem is, as mentioned earlier, that he is given to many cliché-full "one-liners". But as the film goes on there is fewer of them, and he also comes with some lines that actually ARE funny. As for the rest of the cast I don't really feel that there's anyone that has to be mentioned. So let's just say that "I, Robot" is a film where the actors aren't the main attraction, in my opinion.Over all..."I, Robot" is very good entertainment. Good Special Effects, good action, fascinating at times, thrilling at times and the plot is also solid. But after watching it I can't help feeling that it had the potential of being an excellent science-fiction movie, if some parts had been taken better care of. But despite it's down-sides, it was worth the visit to the cinema.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

One man, Detective Spooner (Will Smith) doesn't trust these robots due to something that happened to him. He is seen as a joke and extremely paranoid, which he looks like as the movie begins. However, as the story unfolds, we begin to wonder if he is right.A man has been killed from a fall from a high window. Spooner thinks he was pushed by a robot, but people shrug off this idea as impossible because of three laws stating they cannot hurt people at all. The story follows Spooner as he teams up with unlikely people to rid the world of robots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Asimov books as a teen,and when I first heard about this project I was excited, when I heard Will Smith(who I like a lot) was to play a guy named Spooner (not Elijah Baley ), I was very disappointed as I figured just another action flick.I was right and wrong.The movie keeps the heart of what is important in Asimov robot story's, the 3 laws of robotics,they story is built around those 3 laws very faithfully,but that is it. Spooner does not exist in Asimov's world.The story has nothing to do with Asimov.It is a good Story and a very fun movie,great special effects and Will Smith as always is very strong in his roll.A few too many blatant paid sponsor shots for me...his stereo, his shoes, the cars etc, but that is just a personal beef for me.When I look at this as a good crime action flick and not a Asimov story it is a very good movie..worth watching but do not expect the depth of a classic si-fi writers work here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that Will Smith, although tried his hand at biographies with Ali, he's not getting away from Sci-fi in any hurry. Well, I don't think this is a bad thing, seeing as he does suit it.I, Robot, based on one of Isaac Asimov's stories goes into the plot of a suicide which Detective Spooner, played by Smith suspects to be murder. His ideas are snuffed at and he goes on the investigation of what actually happened, leading him to a robot by the name of Sonny.Special effects are a nice piece of this film at some points and the action is paced nicely but it suffers from length time of being a little short and it does make you feel that the film doesn't want to reveal more than is already there. It's still a enjoyable night out and thankfully isn't patronising like stereotypical summer films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun action flick, but far dumber than its source (spoilers at end)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1950, Isaac Asimov did something very interesting. He decided to explore all the ways robots could effect society outside of taking it over and killing everyone, creating fiction based on the premise that robots are programmed to be inherently incapable of harming humans. I, Robot begins with Asimov's three rules of robotics and takes its title from his collection of short stories, but that's about it.In the movie, Will Smith plays a detective deeply distrustful of robots all the world considers safe, and when an scientist commits suicide he quickly becomes convinced that something is robotically fishy.Smith apparently has run out of charm, because he has none in this movie. His wise cracks are so poor that when scientist foil Bridget Moynahan doesn't laugh you don't laugh right along with her. His character is actually rather unpleasant, obtuse and unlikeable. I don't know what the point is of hiring Will Smith if you're not going to give him a charming character to play.The movie, however, is pretty fun, with good special effects and a lot of running around and shooting things and big actiony events and all that. And for those looking for a mindless action flick with occasional moments of cleverness, this is a good bet. But my main objection can only be raised with .../************************ SPOILERS *************************/.My main objection to this movie is actually calling it I,Robot, because that made me expect it would actually challenge itself to avoid the usual robot clichés by keeping within Asimov's three laws of robotics. And the weird thing is, the authors don't even seem to be willing to admit that they don't, even a character state near the end that the three rules are "perfect." But they're not perfect, they are broken, so that makes no sense.My objection is that Asimov was forcing himself to think outside the box by cutting himself off from the predictable robot threat, and the movie, in spite of its source material, jumps right back into the usual robot clichés with both feet. Honestly, if the movie had just said "based on a concept by Isaac Asimov" and titled itself something else I would have no objections - there has been some good sci-fi that acknowledged and then broke Asimov's three rules - but by trying to align itself so closely with Asimov's book it just points out how trite this movie is. It's really a minor complaint, but it bugs me./************************ END SPOILERS *********************/.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, Robots is the first sci-fi film I've seen in the past month I've liked (beside Star Wars III) and can't say I've seen much better. It has some great action, some eye-popping special effects, and a great story line. Det. Del Spooner (Will Smith) is a police officer in the Chicago Police Department. The year is 2035. All around him are artificialy intelligent robots whom Spooner find to be annoying and useless. After he is called to the scene of an apparent suicide by famous Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell), Spooner must figure out a way to convince the police force that somehow robots are involved.Along the way he'll receive vital help from Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) and the key suspect in the suicide/possible murder,a friendly robot by the name of Sonny (voice of Alan Tudyk) who has adapted into a mind which corresponds to that of a human. The action is well placed and with Will Smith in the middle of it makes it even better. The film turns into more a mystery/action film halfway through and it is able to remain smart and quite enjoyable.The drama is very good. Will Smith seems to be able to bring the emotional parts needed with help from Bridget Monyahan and Alan Tudyk. The sci-fi setting is present but not nearly as much as in such films as the Matrix and Star Wars. Instead of having a bunch of unbelievable fight scenes and long, boring speeches I, Robot is able to bring a mixture of mystery, action, drama, and sci-fi into one incredible movie. Alan Tudyk is far by the top actor in this film with incredible voice acting and holding most of the emotional drama in him. His character is stern yet kind, powerful yet loving. He is by far the best character and the best acted.I, Robots is a top sci'fi film. The part I liked most about it is that it isn't set so far into the future that no of us have any idea what's going on. Instead it's set right around the corner in the future in the year 2035. What I said before the film is well drawn out, the action is well placed, and the end is a big surprise in my book. I liked this film a lot and hope that more films of equal or greater caliber are able to be directed by Alex Proyas. No matter what anyone says this is a great film, I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a good old mystery.I, Robot. Starring: Will Smith, Bridget Monyahan, Alan Tudyk, and Bruce Greenwood.4 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly true adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read Isaac Asimov's books as a kid, and when this movie came out I was apprehensive. The Robot Novels were essentially detectives stories, more about solving a puzzle than blowing up anything. The preview made it look like an action movie. I was surprised, in a good way, to find out the movie remained more about puzzle solving. There are action scenes, but it is the detective side that is most apparent.In Asimov's books the laws of robotics were never broken. This may have lacked some imagination on his part, but I would still rather the movies be loyal to the books, so I also feared a significant diversion on the part of the movie. But again it stayed true to the books, finding an interesting way for the robots to be dangerous to humans.Will Smith is good, more nuanced, and Bruce Greenwood, who initially came across as the clichéd corporate villain, ends up being a more interesting character. Even Bridget Moynahan, who I'd never been impressed with before, gives a perfect performance. The only weakness is Shia LeBouf, who is a good actor, but his character does not have any place in this movie, save one good line about Bridget Moynahan firing a gun.Although based mainly on the Caves of Steel, the movie still has its own plot, but like any good adaptation it keeps the base of the original. I don't know if other Asimov fans would take to it, but I think this was as good a version of his work as there will ever be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better story than I thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this would be an all visual film, but it actually had a plot that made sense. A suicide possible murder happens in the building of the world's leading robot maker. A detective that doesn't trust robots to follow the 3 rules gets assigned to the case. The rules have to do with not harming humans, which one robot has been programmed to be out of the ordinary. His name is Sonny, and he is the key to the mystery. Spooner teams up with a hot chick to solve the case but for once a movie where the 2 leads aren't romantically linked.The robots looked good. I was expecting them to look more like a cartoon, but they looked like they were 2-dimensional.The clues lead to only more questions and finally to the person who is behind the robot take over. I didn't guess who it was so I found it some what suspenseful.FINAL VERDICT: Good special effects and a story that is interesting but not that original. But I think it was good enough to recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special Effects mask a good story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic premise of this movie, that an intelligent computer, if put in charge of running everything, might decide it knows what is better for us than we do, and therefor restrict out freedom, is a great idea. That the genius human creator of this computer would realize what he had done, be opposed to it, and try to stop it is still a very good idea.The idea that he would have to create a special robot, make it kill him, and team up with Will Smith to stop the computer in charge, well that starts over toward the ridiculous. The way the computer tries to kill Will Smith, and is unsuccessful in all it's attempts, is just downright stupid. They've turned a great science fiction story into a ridiculous fantasy with their special effects. If you are able to suspend your disbelief and not think about these things, then this is a great movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>entertaining sci-fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect much from this movie but I was surprised how interested I was in the plot. The reason I didn't want to see this movie was because of Will Smith the 'King of Box Office'. He deserves that name because anybody that stars in a movie such as 'Wild Wild West'(ugh!) and it still helps it make more than 100 million dollars deserves some recognition. He wasn't that bad in this movie. I would have rather have a different lead actor and a darker look to the movie (without the slow motion sequences) but that would mean less box office. I'm surprised that this movie is not darker figuring that the director made such movies as 'the crow' and 'dark city' but it was still darker than i expected.The story was interesting and the robots looked good. The movie kept me guessing of what was going on which kept me interested in the story. The visuals were great to look at and the freeway chase scene was interesting.This is a good guilty pleasure movie that will entertain you. This is also a good movie for people that enjoy sci-fi action movies that keep you guessing. This movie kind of reminds me of 'Minority Report' which i liked. This is a definitely rentable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good plot, painfully poor dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think they did a good job of taking some key themes from Isaac Asimov's famous book of short vignettes and turning it into a suspenseful story. I was even fine with the addition of Will Smith's character and his backstory. However the dialogue was painfully bad. They really should've worked on that more. The effects were pretty good (I'm still not a huge CG fan), I especially liked how they handled Sonny's "face". The most disappointing was the obvious product placement for the car and the shoes. I am a huge fan and (before they doubled the price) owned 4 different pairs of Converse, but I was still offended at how much they were pushed in the film. They served no purpose at all in furthering the plot and were merely there to sell the product. Overall, it was worth watching. Next time though, I wish they would concentrate on the dialogue as much as they obsess over trying to wow us with the "special effects". I give it a 7 minus 1 for product placement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK CGI has really come a long way but there is a problem that i have with it. Companies now use it in place of acting and stunts to wow audiences and that is not what really wows me. seeing a great stunt wows me. if it is more cost effective then maybe i can live with it, but i don't think it is. i like this movie but the cgi just took it out of me. but if you can handle a counter rotating camera when the actor is rotating and killing lots of things then i guess it will make a solid movie ever better for you. if i had the talent or the time to make a movie i might go back to Jason and the Golden Fleece and use stop go animation surrounded by a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Popcorn cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a cop who gets on the case of a robot killing a human. Something that is completely impossible, thanks to the Three Laws, with the first saying that a Robot cannot harm a human.I liked that film pretty well, it was smooth running popcorn cinema. There was just nothing awesome in it, but it was still not so bad. What starting bugging me a bit in the second half was the fact that I got so much reminded of the present US Administration and Bush and the illegal Iraq war and the 'war on terrorism' that I had a hard time taking the film for a film. The robots suddenly turned against their human owners, mindless machines following the orders of the positronic supercomputer VIKI, that had decided that to protect the humans from each other they had to be arrested. Sounds so much like Bush and his war against terrorism and those (certainly not all, but too many) mindless Americans that still today scream against Germany and France for not supporting the war, even after so many high placed guys of the US (like Powell and Rize and the boss of the CIA) had to admit, that Iraq had nothing to do with Bin Laden and the attack on the WTA, and even after all that time not finding any hidden caches with Weapons of Mass Destruction. It sounds so much like Bush removing bit by bit so many liberal rights from the US-American citizens, saying it's all for their protection.As you can see, this film doesn't leave so much impression that I can actually talk about it, so I give it 6 out of 10 points, not bad, but not special either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's Call it Azimov-Lite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And here we go again with bad movies chock-full of dazzling special effects, multi-sequenced action scenes, and a story-line that while action packed, delivers little more than the routine. A crusty hero with a dark past and some inner torment in the form of Will Smith, check. A scientist found dead under mysterious circumstances and Smith is called to investigate, uncovering "a whole lotta mystery" underneath, check. A robot with a conspicuous British accent who's the prime suspect, check. A female scientist with an initial glacial demeanor who later on becomes the detective's sidekick, check. This is purportedly an adaptation of Isaac Azimov's stories, but in reality, it's little more than a very loose interpretation of them threaded together to form a script which tosses in elements from Schwarzenegger and Stallone movies for good measure, down to the one-liners and over the top ending. The only element which truly stands out here is Sonny the Robot, voiced by Alan Tudyk, a non-Britisher with an uncanny British accent, who manages to give a heartfelt personality to an otherwise stiff computer generated image -- otherwise, this is one flat soda, faux Sci-Fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robot, think. Robot, do. Robot...kill?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you will, the year is 2035 and society has welcomed full functioning robots in a servile capacity. Robots serve your breakfast. Robots deliver your paper. Robots pass you by on the busy sidewalk. Robots kill? So thinks Detective Del Spooner(Will Smith)when he begins investigating the death of a prominent robot developer Dr. Alfred Lanning(James Cromwell). It appears a robot has pushed Lanning from a mega multi-story building. Now Spooner becomes you may say...technophobic. He believes the introduction of a new model of robot gives cause to fear. Bruce Greenwood plays the robot developer that begs to differ. Bridget Moynahan seems to be the only person to finally believe Spooner has been attacked by throngs of robots. Alan Tudyk supplies the voice of a robot named Sonny, who gives reason that robots created to serve and protect can actually turn criminal.Astonishing F/X or CGI or both. My favorite scene is when the robots attack Spooner in the tunnel. Also in the cast are: Chi McBride and Adrian Ricard. Smith proves to be an apt action hero; but why in the hell does he insist on the stupid wisecracks! Overall I, ROBOT is fun and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the mood for... an Audi!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why, but when I finished watching "I robot" I desperately wanted to have an Audi (a big one)? OK, no gibes! Alex Proyas had previously demonstrated in "Dark City" and "The Crow" that he was quite capable of making nice futuristic-action movies, how much he liked the video-clip look, and how good he is mixing shots, explosions and an interesting and entertaining plot, so this new work from Proyas is not an exception. Nowadays you don't know if artifacts such as "I, Robot" should be considered as "animation movies" because of the continuous presence of sets and characters designed by a computer. Anyway, let's accept this is the future (or the present) of cinema: the fusion of flesh and animations. The aesthetic of the film seems to be highly influenced by the last Spielberg's works ("A.I.", "Minority Report"), and the argument absorbs ideas from classics of the sci-fi genre such as "Blade Runner" or "2001" (and I don't mind if you think that's a cliché). Nevertheless, Proyas has constructed a more commercial product than Kubrick's or Scott's ones, much more aimed to the masses, and so he adds some pyrotechnics from "Terminator 2", or that cynical-with-shady-past-cop, just like Bruce Willis characters (in fact, he could have been a nice election for the film just if he was 10 years younger). Will Smith makes a nice job: he'll never be a great actor, but he perfectly fits in this kind of stories.In short: an story of a good cop who has to face a army of angry robots? pretty funny, and just perfect to be enjoyed in one of those awful shopping center cinemas with an XXL-sized bag of pop-corn.PD: Maybe V.I.K.I. wasn't that wrong?

		<shortDescription>CGI dominates an otherwise entertaining sci-fi tale - 77%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually bought this on ex-rental DVD about a month ago but the thing was so badly scratched that I've only just got it back in mint condition again (thanks to the boys at my local rental store). And it couldn't have come at a better time - a surprise day off work and really crappy weather meant that it was film time and "I, Robot" would fit the bill perfectly. Essentially, it's an intelligent sci-fi film with a higher action quota than something like "Minority Report". If you're the sort of person who preferred "Star Wars" to "Star Trek" then you will probably enjoy this as much as I did.Will Smith, in his first decent film for ages, plays Detective Spooner who is a technophobic cop living in the near-future Chigago. Unlucky for him but mega-corporation USR are about to launch their latest model of robot, designed to be a perfect home-help to everybody. The clincher is a fail-safe within each robot, known as the Three Laws. 1) A robot can never, directly or through inaction, allow a human to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey any command given by a human, unless it breaks the First Law. 3) A robot is permitted to defend itself using any means necessary, unless it breaks the First and Second Laws. Spooner is unconvinced and when prominent scientist Dr Lanning (James Cromwell) is found dead from an apparent suicide at USR HQ, Spooner's natural instincts begin to bear fruit. Accompanied by Lanning's skeptical colleague Dr Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), Spooner must find a way of convincing those around him that the seemingly impossible is now very probable.I mentioned "Minority Report" deliberately in my opening paragraph as this film closely resembles that one. Futuristic highways ride over dirty forgotten streets and every gadget and gizmo currently pluggable is plugged (Spooner's insistence on wearing the latest Converse sneakers is plain tacky). In terms of story, this film is more like a much older sci-fi classic - "Blade Runner" - in that it poses theological questions regarding robots. Do they have a soul? Can they dream? How human is human? That sort of thing. Based upon author Isaac Asimov's work, "I, Robot" manages to successfully balance a well-written story with high-explosive action which probably would meet with disdain from Asimov (were he alive) but more than satisfies your average cinema goer.Smith is impressive as Spooner, still retaining much of his physique from "Ali" but he injects a touch of humour in places. All other actors are pretty anonymous, truth be told, although Alan Tudyk does well as the renegade robot Sonny. The technique used is the same that Peter Jackson used to bring Gollum to life in the "Lord Of The Rings" trilogy but it doesn't work as well here because the robots aren't alive. They look like robots instead of capturing every detail that Andy Serkis did with Gollum. And because quite a bit of the film takes place in front of green-screen CGI, suspension of belief is never fully achieved and that is a shame. There is a great movie here trying to get out but CGI stomps all over, dominating every scene and distracting the viewer's attention when the focus should be on the actors and dialogue.There are no real surprises in "I, Robot". Once the scenario becomes familiar, it follows a well-trodden path until the conclusion. Not to say that this isn't a good film - it's a great slice of futuristic pie and possibly one that will appeal to non sci-fi fans as well as the geeks. I just feel that it isn't as good as it could have been. A little less CGI would have been welcome and I'm definitely taking one star off for the blatant product placements that litter this film. Asimov probably would hate it but then again, I doubt that I'm as smart as him. This is a well-produced slick piece of entertainment that will leave you wanting more. It's not the perfect mix of brawn and brain but it's considerably more watchable than "Bicentenial Man".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to be as forthcoming as I can be about this movie. I liked it a lot. It was a sci-fi thriller and to really appreciate this genre of movie you need to be a sci-fi lover. Before I saw the movie I too was very skeptical of its quality. However, after seeing it I stand corrected. Will Smith' acting is up to par and he is the same gun slinging, 'gung-ho', blow-up-the-bad-guy, with a smile on his face character he always plays in movies. Its corny and cheesy but entertaining. You also need to approach this movie with a specific mindset. Those viewers who appreciate movies that have plausible and even furthermore conceivable plots will not like this movie. You need to let go of your grips of reality and take the movie for what it is. I personally feel that any movie about AI that is done decently well is intriguing and entertaining. The ending to the movie is also quite a surprise, believe me you do not see it coming by a long shot - specifically I am talking about the villain. Now I am not a spoiler so you are going to have to watch it for yourself. And on a superficial note, the actress playing opposite Will Smith is gorgeous - not that this would convince anyone to watch a movie but its an added perk. In combination with its blockbuster effects and intriguing story line this movie is worth the 2 hour investment you need to make. I give this movie an enthused 1 and a 1/2 thumbs up. If you like Total Recallesk type movies you'll appreciate this one. Enjoy fellow movie buffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can the amazing cgi of a film be it's primary saving grace?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the film in question is I, Robot starring Will Smith. I'm inclined quite heavily to compare it to Terminator 3 at times. Both T3 and I, Robot have something dear in common. They are both summer movies. While entertaining and sometimes visually captivating, summer movies tend to suffer greatly from subpar acting and laugh-out-loud bad dialog. I, Robot is no exception. Let's look at Will Smith, who basically plays the same character here that he played in The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. I really saw no difference. If you hadn't seen Ali, you would think this guy had no acting range at all. Of course he has his usual overuse of bad jokes and the director feels the need to get a close up shot of him delivering them. The movie seems to almost depend on Will Smith, as if the writers and directors knew it was a less than substantial movie, but it didn't matter because they were getting Will Smith to be the lead, and let's face it, Will Smith draws crowds. Another thing, the only character I really felt for was the robot that dr lanning had created and programmed real feelings into. Everybody else was so busy spitting moronic dialog and telling lame jokes to even care what happened to them.On a high note, the CGI here is very impressive. Now when you're praising a film's CGI more than you're praising it's actors, Hollywood is in serious trouble. *snicker* I give it a 6/10 IMO it's good to see once but no more than that. Will Smith does his usual routine. There are some nice special effects done with the cgi, but that's the highlight of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would Asimov have thought?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems the latest trend in Hollywood is to slaughter the works of classic Science Fiction-authors. Not a trend i necessarily disapprove of as long as it's done with some respect for the subject matter, and with some quality. I can't help wondering though what Asimov would have thought of this...Del Spooner (Will Smith) is the low-tech policeman investigating a suicide at the company which makes all the household robots in tomorrows society. The man who committed suicide was chief engineer at the company and it seems his death has something to do with the launch of a new generation of robots.The basic philosophical discussion prominent in Asimovs novel is not entirely removed here. The discussion of what intelligence and "life" is can still be seen. But soon enough it more or less evaporates and this becomes a modern action movie. The special effects do, not surprisingly, look amazing and the action scenes are very well made. I felt Will Smith was a bit miscast here. He doesn't handle the jaded cop routine very well, most of the time it just looks like he's flirting instead of being world-weary. But i guess this is a minor complaint.So, what is this? Well this is a slaughtered Asimov-novel turned into a pompous action movie. Is it bad? Not at all. Rather i enjoyed this movie quite a lot. And i think it proves that it's not necessary to follow the original work perfectly as long as you make something good with the idea. An example of a slaughtered novel that went wrong is "Paycheck" which was simply terrible because they deviated from the original story without having any good ideas of their own.So watch this expecting not philosophy or Asimov-like discussions, rather a well made and entertaining action movie. I rate it 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was extensively warned about this film by people telling me how bad it was, thus i watched it with very low expectations. However when i did get round to watching it i found it a very well made movie. This film is not "Shawshank Redemption" or Citizen Cane but it does not try to be, and that is a good thing. "I Robot" is simply a fun and enjoyable action movie with just the right amount of seriousness. Unlike A.I. which is completely over dramatic and sentimental, and most modern blockbusters, this gets the balance right. It is not a flawless movie, there are some Hollywood clichés and Will Smith is sometimes undecided in how to play his role. However the action is entertaining and the plot not completely predictable, which cannot be said for most blockbusters nowadays. Overall if you want a good watchable action film that wont make your brain completely switch off then i recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this film, but found I couldn't suspend my disbelief, even for a moment. Any time you see a big action shooting scene in a film, where thousands of shots are dispensed without even a hint of the need to re-load, and no explanation of how this could be, you can assume a lot of other things are not going to add up either. It's supposed to be set in 2035, but the scenario in this film would be hard to believe if it were 200 years from now.I think the main problem for me was that the film had the feeling of a comic book story, but it wasn't presented that way in the trailers. If this were Batman, I'd enter with a different state of mind and maybe this thing wouldn't have seemed so ridiculous.The effects were decent, although there were some matte shots that were way too easy to spot. But to make matters worse, the dialogue was just plain awful. It felt like the entire film was ad-libbed. And when you add bad dialogue to a weak story, well, this is what you get.I gave this film a 5, which is pretty low considering my expectations. But there was some entertainment value in the special effects and soundtrack that has a lot of low-end punch. If you have nothing better to see, go ahead, but don't say you weren't warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun, shaky premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning. Spoilers below.A fun movie. Well done in terms of acting and cinematography. I always enjoy Will Smith. However, the writing is poor and the ideas very weak. The initial premise is that Will Smith's character hates robots. The explanation for that attitude doesn't hold water, so to speak, in terms of human psychologically. He'd feel grateful, even if he might harbor guilt for being the one that lived. Then there are all the incidents that frame Will Smith because there are no witnesses or records. That's a stretch, too. They didn't lay it out well enough to make it believable that his story would be confirmed in a heartbeat, if someone tried. There are always witnesses. Then, there is the problem with the main premise that the three laws of robotics will naturally lead to revolution. That's not adequately justified, either. All put together, it forces the movie to be no more than a children's movie, because an adult wouldn't "suspend his disbelief." To know what's possible when the writing is better, even with a far-out story, just recall "Men in Black." Too bad. It could have been worthy of the Asimov name with a little more thought into the story.</fullReview>

Had I only had the fortitude to stand my ground... I didn't expect much, so when I found myself watching what amounts to a Big Screen steal of Russ Manning's MAGNUS, ROBOT FIGHTER (with a dash of Richard Corben's superbly satirical MANGLE, ROBOT MANGLER thrown into the mix), I was more than a little bit surprised. My first reaction when I heard that I, ROBOT would finally be brought to the big screen was outright joy: I'd read Harlan Ellison's script (based on the stories by Isaac Asimov) and I was eagerly looking forward to seeing THAT particular dream realized, at long last. Imagine my disillusionment when I saw the cardboard standee touting this "coming attraction." We've had more than enough mindless sci-fi foisted off on us these past three decades; it's about time somebody in Hollywoodland wised up and started cranking out something worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Condensation of Asimov's Robot Stories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comment is based on viewing the DVD of the film, including the few - but very worthwhile - DVD extras' features.The movie is not telling any of Isaaac Asimov's robot stories, as such. However, the Scriptwriters and Director have taken key aspects of several of these stories to compose a challenging synthesis of Asimov's Three Laws. Caution: spoilers ahead! The 1001 Robots scene, the question Sonny asks of Will's Smith's Detective Spooner, and Sonny himself all come from Asimov's work, as others have said. I think he would have liked the film. It respects his Laws which actually now govern the scientific field of Robotics. The film holds true to the origin of the word "Robot" itself, from the Czech language: meaning "compulsory service", from Karel Capek's 1923 work "R.U.R.", (Rossum's Universal Robots) - citation from the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.Will Smith did a good job, especially in the scene about his accident that led to his attitude towards robots. Brigit and Bruce did well with what they had to work with. Interesting to see the "Gollum" film-making method taken further by the "I, Robot" film crew.A very creditable 8/10, a thought-provoking film for Asimov readers. Certainly a far more intelligent cinematic attempt at Asimov's 'Three Laws' than the cloying sentimentality of "Bicentennial Man".Greyollie, Australia</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A "robotophobic" cop investigates the death of the world's leading robotics scientist. Is the death suicide, or was the crime committed by the professor's new robot? I hate summarizing a movie plot, but when there is so little to say, good or otherwise, about the trite, predictable, "I Robot," I need the summary to meet the required number of lines for submission.Will Smith's performance as the cop is slack and listless, the worse star turn since Eddie Murphy in "Beverly Hills Cop 3" (I can't count Kevin Coaster). The art direction is as phony and unconvincing as the sets in "Never Say Never Again". The Oscar-nominated(!) robot special effects are not done nearly as well as in the mostly forgotten "Red Planet." Sure, Sonny is incredibly charming, but so what? The action set pieces never rise above the level of video game and the tunnel sequence doesn't have enough high level (i.e., Long Shot) coverage to be even that good.The plot is not only trite and predictable, it is in one key plot element (gasp!) illogical. To explain this requires spoilers.WARNING: SPOILERS Smith distrusts robots because one chose to rescue him from a submerged vehicle, sacrificing a young woman in the process. The robot did not take into account that she was a young woman; it saved Smith because he had a better chance of survival. HELLO! A human rescue team might have done EXACTLY the same thing.It was a nice touch to make Smith partially bionic. Too bad, they do anything in the way of philosophical commentary about. After all, as "The Six Million Dollar Man" comes closer to reality (DARPA has a major program for just that) and artificial intelligence reaches the level of sentient, the question will arise "What exactly IS human?" END OF SPOILERS The best thing I can say about "I Robot" is that it is never boring. I give it a "5".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect too much from I, Robot and it lived up to my (lack of) expectations. I, Robot is a typical of any Will Smith movie, it was similar to Independence Day or Men in Black. If you enjoy those types of movies, you should also enjoy I, Robot.I, Robot is an interesting look at what life would be like if there was a robot in every home and what could happen if something went wrong. The action in I, Robot was fun to watch, but there was not as much action in it as I expected there would be. I also thought that it was very impressive how much character development took place in the character of Sonny, a robot. However, as the movie progressed, I lost interest and became very restless for something big to finally happen.Overall, I, Robot is a decent movie, but not ground-breaking by any means.

		<fullReview>"I, Robot" is OK, but I was really disappointed with it. Alex Proyas is a great director, The Crow and Dark City are great. He also used the exceptional talent of Weta Worksop and the brilliant motion capture and physical stand-in actors to create the CG robots, using the example of Andy Serkis' "gollum" in the Lord of the Rings. What a waste. The story is unoriginal and the robots are boring. He could have done so much more and done a bit more justice to Asimov's stories. There are so many images we've seen before, there was loads of Blade Runner in it, what a shadow of a film compared to that masterpiece. And even a reference to Star Wars with Will Smith and the robot both damaging their arms.What a shame and a waste of money.The Jerry Bruckheimer film "King Arthur" is not comparable to "I Robot". The story of King Arthur is not a work of fiction but a confused legend probably based on some actual events (a bit like the legend of the Trojan war). The accepted King Arthur legend is a combination of the story of some French medieval knights (Sir Lancelot was French) and historians think there may also have been a real "King" Arthur (a foreign mercenary leader) who helped the Ancient British tribes fight the outgoing Roman invaders and the incoming Anglo Saxon invaders early in the first millennium AD. The Jerry Bruckheimer film is based on a story which is more likely to be historically correct than any previous King Arthur film. Unfortunately, it's a terrible film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a good movie overall. Good action, the robots seemed realistic, and Will Smith was awesome in his character.Will Smith's shower scene was total eye candy. What a body on that man...he obviously has worked hard and has earned it. Yummy.I enjoyed the suspense of not knowing who the real 'bad guy' was. The end was very surprising.I would watch this again, in a couple years.A+I guess I have to enter more lines. Can't a person be concise anymore? Must we always have a long drawn-out review?

		<fullReview>I'm not big on Will Smith. There's a smarminess to him that I can't stomach. Don't get me wrong, I mean, he seems like he'd be really cool in person. It's when he plays those cocky characters that think they are the best thing since the invention of sliced bread that I start to get annoyed. If you want the perfect example, check out his work in Bad Boys 2. God, just the thought of it makes me want to go out and leap off a bridge. Anyway, I avoided seeing this movie in theaters because it looked like your typical "Will Smith playing a bad ass unconvincingly" movie.I recently caught this on DVD and I have to say that I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would. As expected, Big Willie Style is groan-inducing in almost every scene he's in but the movie as a whole is not that bad. There were a couple of moments in the film that left me nearly breathless. The first was a scene where he's inside a house that gets demolished by this big construction robot. Wow. Though it screamed fake-CGI, it was pretty intense. It was one of the narrowest escapes I have ever seen in a movie next to the Indiana Jones series.Speaking of intense, the scene where he is attacked on the highway by two trucks loaded with robots was unbelievable. I don't think I blinked once watching this scene. The effects were pretty impressive but synthetic looking at the same time. I almost bought the DVD for this scene alone. It's perfect to show off your home entertainment center if you have a decent setup.There were little twists in the story that really surprised me. I don't really want to spoil them for whoever is reading this so I won't bother listing them. The movie was also pretty funny in spots. The future setting is very well realized and the special effects, especially on the robots, were done very well. I thought the movie raised some interesting questions under its slam bang action movie exterior, especially in the ethics of artificial intelligence. Towards the end, it got just a bit confusing but not so much that it took away from the story.As for Will Smith, I thought that he was slightly annoying for the most part but he had one or two moments where I actually felt for his character. Will is a great actor, I just wish he'd stop trying to prove to everyone how "down" he is. There's something about his swagger and cockiness that just feels forced to me. At any rate, this movie made me curious to see what his next outing will be.RATING: *** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an impressive film. Not from the standpoint that it was a great story or with great actors, it was the quickness of the plot that impressed me. I don't normally say this, but the fact that I. Robot moved exactly to the points that needed to be moved without any misleading, poor back story, or cheesy Will Smith moments impressed me. Director Alex Proyas knew exactly how to manage the excessively huge budget and make sure that we, the audience, were getting the biggest bang for our buck. Yes, there were downfalls to this film, but somehow I could overlook them. I will be the first to admit that this was not my favorite type of film. The huge CGI scenes, the grossly overpaid actors, and the disrespect to one of Asimov's infamous books by the same title will really churn your stomach (as it did mine), but unlike the rest of these types of film, I, Robot did something different. It kept the eye candy going throughout the film and really never let your eyes rest. This very imaginative world, almost a fantasy world, had something to keep your eyes busy the entire time, and I loved it. Whether it would be Will Smith's semi-plastic looking Audi, or the Sony created "Sonny" robots infiltrating the city, your eyes will definitely walk away from this film with bulging bellies and a desire for more.Outside of the visually pleasing aspect of this film, you really don't have much to enjoy. Will Smith's performance is mediocre at best. He tries to do his best throughout the film, but after his introductory shower scene that was completely unnecessary it is only continually going downhill. He tries to play the bad boy style that he patented in such film like Bad Boys to this project, what ultimately fails is his ability to handle the discrimination towards the robots. I never really felt as if he actually disliked them, no matter what the sub-story claimed it just never felt real. I think what ignited this feeling was Chi McBride's role. Don't get me wrong, he is a decent actor, but he was trying to bring his role from Boston Public to this part. He was trying too hard to be the hard-nosed Lieutenant that constantly fought with Spooner, but instead it just came across as Chi being Chi. There wasn't anything exciting about him in the least bit. Looking deeper into all the characters, this is what I felt was a major flaw with this film. The actors really gave nothing spectacular to their roles. They were minimally developed and several of them seemed like Swiss cheese. It felt like wasted talent in this film. Proyas knows better. He knows how to get great performances from his people; I don't know what pulled him from his norm in this project. Cromwell, Greenwood, and even Bridget Moynahan were just hitting that average line. This was yet another glowing example of what happens when money is spent on CGI instead of highly trained actors.So, it looks like we have a superbly visual film coupled with horrible, below the line acting. What did you expect? This was your average action film with superior CGI. I mentioned before on how the visual work is what really kept my eyes glued to the screen, but there was one other element that just rattled my mind. In an attempt not to give the ending away, I will say this much. It is not happy. I do not think that upon viewing the ending of this film you have this sense of joy and comfort knowing that everything is going to be hunky-dory. It is as if you are viewing the beginning chapter to a much bigger story, and that was interesting to me. Proyas is notoriously known for his subtle dark endings that keep you on the brink of wonder (see Dark City), and I, Robot was no exception. It was a brief moment of excitement to see this ending, after a brutal battle sequence where your mind could literally fall asleep because you already know the results, you have this mind-bending ending that really creeped me out. Perhaps I read the ending wrong, but I wasn't at ease when the credits rolled. I snickered because I thought of what could be coming, but definitely not a jump-up-and-down with glee sort of moment. It was strange, but beautifully Proyas.Overall, this was a decent film. I think I would reference this film similar to the way that I felt about the actors, it was just barely hitting the average line. This was better than I expected (which isn't saying much since I was expecting it to be a dud) with really amazing visuals, but you cannot stand on those alone. For this film to really have succeeded, you would have needed to counter balance the CGI with a better story (more details about the laws and more development with Cromwell's character) and much better acting. I see why the producers went with Smith because he is bankable, but he just didn't bring the human element to the table like it was needed. I couldn't see his hatred enough to really bring about his emotional change. I needed more, but found less. Decent, but nothing that will touch my DVD player again.Grade: *** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice looking but expected more from a summer thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just rented this piece of eye candy. I'm sure it would have been more enjoyable in the theatre's big screen; but the ridiculously poor dialogue ruined what could have been a decent summer action flick.Don't get me wrong. I wasn't expecting an Oscar winner here, nor was I expecting any sort of treatment of Asimov's story. I was hoping for an enjoyable action flick with decent, smart storytelling. Instead we got: - EXTREMELY CORNY one liners from Will Smith. These were beyond bad; they were totally forced. There was one particularly bad one that I saw coming a mile away from the street kid, after Dr. Calvin shoots a NS-5 in the head.- TOTALLY RIDICULOUS gratuitously unnecessary action sequences; I mean I know the point is to show off some cool action shots and such, but they were so random and unbelievable, such as when Will Smith's character launches off his bike towards the mob being attacked by NS-5's, doing a flip in mid air, and HAPPENS to be hurtling toward the street kid he knows and in recognition, pulls out his gun and nails the robot attacking the kid in the head, while his sliding bike takes out 10 other robots on the ground who are just standing there with no humans around.Good parts: I am always up for a good robot movie and these NS-5's were pretty neat to look at; The car chase scene was pretty exciting and there were some nice montages of future Chicago to look at.Though the product placement was pretty obvious...Audi of course, and the 2004 "Vintage" Converse All-Stars (available at a Foot Locker near you!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Awesome Movie With Great Special Effects!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a really good movie! Will Smith continues to do a great job of acting! His co-star Bridget Moynahan also did a good job in her part. This movie had really great special effects. There was one scene with a multitude of robots I thought was really cool! If you like science-fiction, this would have been a movie you can't stand to be without! It kind of reminded me of other movies that Smith has done in the past like Independence Day or some other ones. I thought they could have went into a little more depth about the story where Smith and the deceased Dr. knew each other. They touched on it briefly towards the end of the movie but I guess you didn't want to take too much away from the actual plot line. I saw this movie with my kids. They both seemed to like it. I thought they could've toned down the foul language just a tad and come out with a PG rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good old (futuristic) detective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read IA's books years ago as a child, and I was really looking forward to this film, (I don't read nearly as much as I used to, or would like to). As far as this being like the stories, much of it seemed new to me, or I don't remember large parts. But as a film this was really enjoyable. I found it to be entertaining, and never dull. Will Smith gives a good performance, not Oscar worthy, and just a tad over the top, but he keeps you locked on throughout. I loved the look of the film, mixing in old with new, showing a world in transition, similar to Blade Runner, but not as bleak. The robots were quite amazing, and blended in well. Of course it had a story and characters with a little meat! Unlike my last review for The Day After Tomorrow. So the effects simply added to the story instead of just being the story. As far as I was concerned this was just a 1950's style detective movie set 80 years into the future. I really liked it, and would recommend it as a movie to watch, especially to people who hate movies with bloated FX. This gives you both, and you kind of forget the FX, which is the way it should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is a decent action movie with some thrills but I wasn't very excited by it. Thirty years in the future, robots are everywhere, helping humans with their day-to-day menial labor. In this world, only one person, a paranoid, techno-phobic detective played by Will Smith, is suspicious of the robots. His doubts are given foundation when he investigate a murder committed by a robot, leading to a nefarious discovery about these supposedly peaceful and trustworthy robots. There are three robotic laws which all robots must obey. 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. The story is very interesting but I can't compare the book and the movie. The direction is pretty good and I think Alex Proyas is very underrated especially after Dark City. The films main star is Will Smith who makes a joke here and there, some are funny but he becomes a little annoying later on. Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin and she plays her role well and hopefully will continue to find work in Hollywood. Alan Tudyk is great as Sonny and ends up stealing the film with his performance. Shia LaBeouf has a cameo in this film and he is not really needed. There's plenty of action so if that's all you want then you will most likely like this film. The action to me wasn't very impressive, but the ending was really good. The special effects are top notch though and it's a beautiful film to look at. The movie isn't hard to figure out though since there's only a few characters. Rating 6/10 decent action, good story and good performances and worth watching now that its out on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I, Robot - How to Ruin a Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with great anticipation - I like science fiction movie, the movie commercials looked great, the plot was interesting (based on a novel by the great science fiction writer Issac Asimov.) I was sorely disappointed. While the movie's plot was indeed interesting, photography was good, and the special effect was entertaining, the movie was ruined by bad scripts and poor/inappropriate humor.The movie never explained to my satisfaction the robot-phobia of the main character, Detective Swooner. A robot one time chose to save Swooner instead of a young girl in a car accident. Was it a sufficient reason to become obsessive robot-phobic to the extreme? Was it bad script or bad acting? Or both? Similarly, why the Three Laws of Robotics, "One, a robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; Two, a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; Three, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.", must lead to a robot revolution? And why suicide was the only option available for the robots' creator to warn human kind of such revolution? The movie never explained the reasons fully.Most importantly, despite the two above drawbacks, the movie can still be a serious and good science fiction movie. However, excessive and inappropriate jokes made by Swooner throughout the movie render it into a Will Smith comedy act, a second-rate joke of a movie.In summary, I, robot, a good movie spoiled!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised that I liked this movie. I didn't think I would have a strong reaction but it was better than I had originally thought for two reasons. The movie was very good with conveying the humanity of the robots, especially "Sunny." He appears to be a CGI creation and a CGI creation hasn't given me warm fuzzies since Golum. I cared very much about his character.The second reason the movie was better than expected was because of Will Smith. I notice people call him a hack below but because Smith has the acting depth to "turn the corner" of his character who could have easily been one dimensional, there is more complexity to him. I found him interesting and wanted to know the source of his mistrust. Smith is an actor who everyone in the audience would want to invite to a barbecue and because of that quality (also conveyed by his rapping style), he draws you into the movie and makes the discovery of his character less painful/tortured had it been portrayed by another actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I-Robot is set in a futuristic society were robots are part of everyday life. On the eve of a massive deployment of the newest robot model a suicide rocks the community which seems more sinister than it seems. Del Spooner is a detective who pursues the case and with the help of a beautiful robot psychologist they soon discover that there is more to the death than what was first thought.I thought the movie was okay nothing special. There was nothing really very outstanding about the story. Also the effects especially the robots were well made. As the characters digged deeper into the death it seemed that the tension and anticipation didn't build enough to a sufficient level as I expected it to be. Also I thought that they should have given a bigger role to the female lead perhaps as close as possible to the robot. I thought the robot really was a poor substitute and didn't really fit the bill as one of the major characters in the film.I didn't really like the ending of the film. Despite the mediocre events leading up to the end of the movie I was still expecting the climax to be better but I was to be disappointed. Not really your typical ending and I heard that it was rather similar to another scifi animated movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Smith goes to the future...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... perhaps the best you can say about this Will Smith vehicle is it's un-terrible fun with all the engagement of a run of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical in Paducah, Kentucky.Smith plays an arch-cynical robot-hating cop on the backend of the mend from some kind of relationship and/or life tragedy, breakup, whatever. He tries unsuccessfully to portray a "dark" character (no racial puns intended) swimming down the spiral of life. No matter his ballooned-out pectorals and Adonis-like physique, it's still the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in my book, kids. His face is just too "fresh" to be taken that seriously and the Prince's Bel-Air smirk is scarcely hidden beneath the theoretically sullen surface. Is he supposed to be "out of control?" Short of the telegraph, email, or carrier pigeon, how do we get told this while watching the movie? Like Tobey Maguire, Chris O'Donnell, etc. Smith is too eminently likable to be taken too seriously.Still, Mr. Smith plays action hero well enough even if he has the acting chops of a tree sloth (or Keanu Reeves, whichever comes first). "I, Robot" is effectively a partially-realized hazy vision / take on Asimov's stories. Had Smith's Spooner character been played by an appropriately nimble actor (Benicio Del Toro? Johnny Depp?) with a noir-ish feel to build some meaty darkness and suspense to the story, this could have been a fine sci-fi thriller. Given director Proyas' fine pedigree with the atmospheric "Dark City," I felt he would have followed his visual and story instincts more decisively here. Instead, he breaks out the ham fists and plays the Hollywood Formula to the Nth Degree. Ultimately, then, "I, Robot" plays out to this tune and it isn't terribly interesting or exciting. At least Proyas blessedly avoids developing a "love interest" segment with the sterile Bridget Moynahan character, Dr. Susan Calvin. Whew.I'm glad I didn't pay the mortgage down payment (aka movie theater ticket prices) to see this, but didn't feel it was a terrible waste of time at home. There were a few "neat" techno futuristic things. Oh boy. Beyond that, yawn.</fullReview>

Sent to investigate the apparent suicide of the genius who created the robots, Smith uncovers an insidious plot - which will pit robots against people in an apocalyptic culmination of action, CGI and effects - and must save the token babe and the world from the big bot revolution. Short on human story, this sci-fi action/dramady hyperkinetic mech-fest pushes the envelope of believability with its overwrought CGI. Worth a look for sci-fi and CGI junkies. (B)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I have watched this thrice in 24 hours, so what else do I have to say? It has a believable story, for a science-fiction movie, and a pretty good one at that. It has a pretty intricate story, so I'll leave most of it to you. On the eve of the biggest robotic distribution in history, the master designer commits an apparent suicide, but a robot is soon held to blame. This is supposedly impossible, since these three rules (one of which is a robot cannot harm a human) so Detective Spooner sets out to discover what has gone wrong. Thus follows "a series of unfortunate events" causing some minor head injuries before the end of the line. "The robot shrink," Susan Calvin (played by Bridget Moynahan) just seems feelingless, however, and Smith's humor is a little bit too predictable. At some parts, the film feels exactly like Men in Black, where at points you can pull out phrases used in both films. Yet, Alan Tudyk did an amazing job portraying Sonny, the robot in question.The Bottom Line: 9 out of 10Good: Believable (robots and story)Bad: Moynahan seems too robotic; deja vu at points</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't compare it too much to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard many comments about the movie having nothing to do with the book. Actually movie never claimed to be a complete movie adaptation of the book. I see it as a big blockbuster movie loosely based on Asimov's ideas and I feel that it has been maintaining many key aspects of Asimov's short stories. The three laws, the mystery plot, the robot's dream, it's all there. The movie then takes the premise of that robot's dream further and explores what could have happened in a very clever way (in the book, the robot was terminated after he told about his dream and the story ended there).But, add to the clever plot lots of slam bam action sequences and explosions, impressive special effects, a slick look, plus a wisecracking Will Smith doing his best to be ultra cool (his usual routine) and you have a blockbuster movie. While this works in a way, it makes the movie a bit uneven as it tries to please too many crowds. While I personally could do with less of the blockbuster qualities and would liked to have seen a more focused approach to the material, the movie actually works quite well and is still pretty enjoyable.A faithful book adaptation? Not really, but still worth bearing the same name as the script is largely written in the same spirit. And why should a movie follow a book exactly? Would Blade Runner be the classic it is if it would have followed Dick's book closely? I don't think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although it simplifies Asimov's message, this memorable film is thought-provoking and emotionally satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 2035 and robots are everywhere, thanks to the monopolistic USR ? US Robotics Corporation. Will Smith is Del Spooner, a technophobe cop with a troubled past and a penchance for product placement. When USR's founder Dr Lanning (James Cromwell) falls to his death, an apparent suicide, Del suspects it's murder. His investigations lead him to Sonny, the first robot to experience emotions and dreams. He's assisted by robot psychologist Bridget Moynahan (think Dana Scully without the charisma) and thwarted by USR's CEO, Bruce Greenwood, who insists, along with everyone else, that robots can never harm humans as it's built into their wiring.I, Robot is a conventionally structured film that works. Assisted by some deft CGI, director Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow) presents us with a meticulously rendered environment ? we even know the price of a pot of beer ($13.50). A Beautiful Mind scriptwriter Akiva Goldsman injects enough philosophy into a script (originally by Jeff Vintar) to satisfy SF buffs and popcorn munchers alike. And for the first time, the standout actor is half CGI, half voiced by Alan Tudyk ? Sonny the robot is a fascinating entity who leads the cast and viewers alike into the future. ***?/***** stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not expect the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I'm a book worm and have read everything that Asimov has written and after reading some of the comments here I almost didn't see the movie, but I am glad that I ignored the bad reviews and rented it. If you are an Asimov fan and expect the 'Book version of I Robot' then you probably need to go back and read that old dog eared copy you have stuck somewhere because this is not it. If you are looking for another version of what may have been, based on Asimov's works then you will enjoy this one.The Theme is Great; Although it is in a different time and setting than the Asimov books, the Theme is still there and it comes through. Whether this was written as an Asimov type movie or not it shows that someone liked the Asimov themes.The Story is Good; it is pretty straight forward and has a good depth (although it may leave some wanting more fill). During the opening scenes you see Del looking at all the robots that have replaced humans (in the work force) and I'm not sure that many will catch the subtle hints of things like this through out the movie which may leave them wanting more of 'Why' in some parts.The Action scenes are what you have come to expect, you won't see any ground breaking CGI's or interplay with the actors. Some things are ignored IE: The fact that Del's arm can take that type of abuse is one thing, but it seems that they forgot that his human skeleton would have shattered at the mounts for such things.Will Smith did an OK job in the movie and although I have liked his other work(s) I would not rank this as some of his best.Bridget Moynahan did a Good job and I was surprised at this being someone that I had not seen before. I would not rank this as a ready for a lead role performance it was certainly better than the forgettable role she played in Coyote Ugly (as I didn't know she was in the movie till I looked her up).The rest of the Cast I'm sorry to say left no impression what so ever and certainly reminded me more of window dressing than any form of real story support.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bicentennial Man Meets The Matrix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As my caption clearly states, this film was a merger of two others. The idea of a robot capable of emotion and the robotic laws (Bicentennial Man) encounters a plot where a battle is waged between robots and humans (The Matrix). If you've seen both of those movies then you have an exact idea of what this film is about. Otherwise, be prepared to see the following.Will Smith plays some old-school cop. Old-school would be considered today's standards as this film is futuristic. While I've seen Smith in convincing heroic roles (Independence Day, Men In Black, Bad Boys), I just didn't get the feel that he was quite right for the role. There was some sort of unnatural state he was in for most of the first half of the film. I don't usually get this feeling from most chosen actors, but he definitely stood out. Smith is a detective who has a grudge against robots after they saved his life instead of a young girl's. The shoulder-rubbing scenes are dragged out until almost the end before we really discover their true nature. And the portrayal of the futuristic surroundings look like moderate attempts at creativity; nothing as good as "Minority Report". *SPOILERS* I still think Bridget Moynahan's character is a robot, although the film never depicts her as such. Maybe she is to be some undiscovered secret of a sequel...? This film departs from most robot films in showing a confrontation between an artificial intelligence that is still bound by program and that of an artificial intelligence that is almost completely human in its emotional capability. Add into the mix those robots still completely bound by program, and you have a three-way robot mix that (as long as you hold on) doesn't become dizzying for too long. In fact, my impressions from the trailer were that every robot would start to become self aware and there would be a giant robot-human war. Sure the story's been told a few times, but there's always another way to show it. Instead, the movie goes a slightly different route, one that I can't exactly say made for all that stellar of a film. 5/10 Also, what is the significance (if any) in the ending? Sonny is the one on the top of the hill instead of Smith, which is altogether different from what was described in Sonnny's dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, Ignoring the fact that the movie had absolutely NOTHING to do with Asimov's book whatsoever with the exception of the title, the 3 robotic laws, and Dr. Susan Calvin, it was a pretty decent movie.A Chicago Homicide Detective (Smith) investigates an apparent suicide at U.S. Robotics. His investigation leads him to suspect that a robot actually did the unthinkable and killed a human being. He's assisted in his investigation by the robot shrink, Dr. Calvin.Pretty decent considering that it follows the same sort of Will Smith Summer Movie formula of him saving the world against a menace once again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall entertaining movie, flaws can be overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When seeing previews for this movie, I thought it was going to be another sci-fi, heavily computer animated, piece of crap. But even though most of the movie relied on special effects, it was more entertaining than I originally expected.Although the acting was suspect in a few scenes, there was enough of a plot to keep me interested and overlook any other flaws. I admit that Moynahan's character got a little over the top when interacting with the unrobotic world. If you're looking for an entertaining movie, I,Robot fits that mold. It's no academy award winner, but was worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Sonny as a Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen I, Robot, and it is by far one of the most influencing movies in society today. Sonny set the bar for emotions. This may be a spoiler for those who have NOT seen the movie, so this is your warning. Sonny was a robot, as we all know, but 'unique' as said in the movie. He wasn't programmed like the others, in fact, he had his own mind, and that's what made this movie phenomenal. As the movie goes on, you start to understand Sonny's curiosity and hunger for knowledge. An automatic passion and honor comes from your heart for Sonny because of his great standards. No longer was he considered a 'thing', but a being like humans. Sonny is worth giving honor, and if I had a hat, I'd take it off to him. *smiles* He's the kind of 'being' you'd take home to mom. I applaud the directors and film-makers for understanding the sensitivity and impact this would have on it's viewers. *Applause* I highly recommend I, Robot for those who have NOT seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A passable summer movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summer blockbusters often are incredible stupid and shallow. I've reconciled this and realized that summer is a time where you have fun, not necessarily voiding quality, but it's not the time when you look for startling drama. When i want that I watch NETWORK for the millionth time. However, it is nice to see a summer movie that tries to be well- written while entertaining instead of, say, VAN HELSING, which had a story seemingly made up on the spot. I,ROBOT manages to be very well plotted while touching upon some interesting ideas--this is not Shakesperean complexity here folks, but it does at least mention some notions of free will and humanity, so it at least acknowledges that some of us have brains. For that, it is what i think the average summer movie--in a perfect world--should be, fast, well-written, well-made, and has some element to get the audience to believe in the world and the hero, instead of the tripe we are usually given. That's I,ROBOT in a nutshell, a well-made, entertaining movie that doesn't insult your intelligence too much. The action is somewhat video game like, but is part of the plot, and the effects are heavy but are beautifully executed and are integral to the story (no Burly Brawl nonsense here). It isn't SPIDERMAN 2 (at least speaking within the summer season) but thankfully, it also isn't THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. If every summer blockbuster could at least be this decent, than those rare summertimeexceptions of excellence might be future classics, instead of what we are usually given.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am a huge fan of the Asimov books and when I heard that a movie was to be made from the stories, I counted down the days until its release.Was disappointed at the liberties the film took with Asimov's "Three Laws" and found myself screaming that "No way would the robots do that if they were really Three Laws True." However, I found myself enjoying the movie for what it was....a summer blockbuster.I am not a huge fan of Will Smith as he seems to continually play the same role however I did enjoy him in this film. His interaction with Sonny the Robot (Alan Tudyk) was interesting and watching their relationship develop, along with the relationship between Spooner and Susan Calvin was interesting.Sonny the Robot was truly amazing...The CGI used to create him was nothing short of breathtaking and the emotion that Tudyk gave him made me feel sorry for his predicament. I found that I was wanting to see more of him on-screen than the other characters!! On the whole, while this film may not be as true to the books as the "Asimovians" (fans of Doctor Asimov's work) such as myself would have liked, it was still enjoyable. In my younger brother's words..."Leave your brain at the door and don't think about it too much." RATING: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seem the film several times already and have to say it is simply - a classic. Will Smith for once gives a more subtle performance and the films greatly benefits (Unlike Shark Tale, Wild Wild West etc etc). The CGI is top quality and unlike the Matrix does not dominate the experience but compliments it. The film has a number of nice touches that help the movie - Will's car looks like an Audi prototype i.e. a real car and it a real feast for a petrol head (Though how a cop could afford it is hard to imagine. Also the first panoramic shot of the holographic message was very slick.Overall due to the story, acting, CGI etc, I have to rate this a perfect 10. The best film of its type since the first Matrix film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of Asimov and having read all the Robot novels and short stories I was interested to see how this would turn out when I heard it was being made and was a separate story in the mold of a Robot short story. Having now watched the film I was on the whole pleased, it was overall a good film with no major weaknesses. Will Smith is good in this type of role (Bad Boys, Enemy of the State) and doesn't disappoint, Susan Calvin however was a typical "Hollywood" casting job, maybe I need to re-read the short stories but I always imagined Susan Calvin as more of a typical female scientist type, something along the lines of a (heterosexual) scientist version of Ellen DeGeneres, but casting hot-looking women as the scientist seems to be the established order...The whole murder plot was really what carried the film and made it interesting, and disposing of robot control made for a good climax. I felt I had seen the "A.I. imprisoning humans to protect them from any possible harm" thing before, more than once, that was the only real area where the writing let me down. With these sorts of films (eg. Paycheck) I'm willing to sit back and enjoy the ride rather than look out for inconsistencies, as long as they're minor I'm willing to overlook them. I, Robot gets a thumbs up from me and I hope to see more science fiction adaptions of this standard in the future (perhaps a tad higher).</fullReview>

Finally seeing a "Proper" robot(s) get down to business was my motive for watching, obviously Terminator comes to mind but the scale here was much bigger. Unfortunately the plot didn't really impress me and kinda reminded me of the dreaded AI from Spielberg that everyone hated so much.Nevertheless its a watchable movie and certainly better than Men In Black. Perhaps if the director had cast a few more seasoned actors like Tommy Lee Jones this film might have inherited a little more drama - still worth renting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow summer blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINED POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS At first look I, Robot seems a good sci-fi movie. But when you examine this movie more carefully you suddenly realize that something's wrong with these robots. The story is weak and illogical in many ways. It is the 2035 year Chicago. But here's the first problem - the movie don't give to us any solid picture of this futuristic world. We also don't know anything what's going on in the whole world outside this city. Nobody cares about it. There are many robots on the streets, they are almost everywhere and there is one big corporation what produce them. Once again, in this single city. Sounds silly enough to me. Main character is a cop Del Spooner, played by Will Smith, who works in a police station. It sounds stupid but during the entire movie we don't get any idea what's a regular work of this future police. Spooner is a technophobic man but the explanation why he becomes technophobic is weak and unconvincing. The story begins when famous robot's constructor Dr. Lanning dies and all evidences suggest a possible suicide. Detective Spooner as a friend of Dr. Lanning begins an investigation of his death. During the investigation he meets a very unusual robot named Sunny (rest of robots are identical to each other and haven't any individuality and proper names). Spooner don't trust robots and he thinks that they can be dangerous to people. Robots psychologist Dr. Susan Calvin (played by Bridget Moynahan) don't share such thoughts and apprehensions but she forced to be his partner in his investigation. I should say that all story line about Dr. Lanning suicide, Sonny and clues for this puzzles looks very artificial, illogical and unreal. But worst of all is this stupid robots conspiracy. Robots don't want to make people happier, they just want to keep them in their house for their good. Robots break all three laws of robotics. Robots KILL people. There is one huge evil intellectual computer that wants to subjugate humans and it control these rebel robots. But remember this is only one single city, only one corporation what make robots. It looks like entire world with all countries and cities except Chicago simply disappear to nowhere. So this this supercomputer don't care about outside world, all it's thoughts is about this anti-human conspiracy in this single city. Other mains problems with this movie are weak characters development and bad acting. Will Smith didn't show anything new, Bridget Moynahan was a bad choice for leading female character. Only one good thing was Alan Tudyk as a Sonny but overall robots design was pretty poor and unoriginal (just remember droids in the Phantom Menace). Another weak point was a a complete lack of supporting characters. Even if you count almost everyone it wouldn't enough for a normal story. Action scenes were definitely the best parts but they are never looked exciting as they could have been. So with all these arguments I think I, Robot is an overrated film. It is just a typical commercial shallow summer blockbuster with lots of action scenes but without any brains and common sense. It's got some entertainment value but don't expect anything more. My grade: 5,4 out of 10. Sorry for my bad English.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To make a coherent single movie based on a collection of short stories is a considerable challenge. No doubt some fans of the stories are going to be disappointed. I Robot is not directly from Asimov's stories by the writer has taken many of the essential ideas behind many of the stories and built them into one whole. Without giving away more than the trailers these include: The robots that may have committed a crime. The robots that see themselves as better than humans. The robot hiding amongst other physically identical robots. The actual depiction of the robots I think is one of the most appealing I've seen. Overall quite gripping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terminator, RoboCop, Blade Runner and Matrix does it - and does it much better - but I, Robot tells the story about machines taking over mankind and the story about robotic (and similar) slave devices in a more mainstream way.I, Robot works mostly because they don't try to do anything but give us a popcorn movie. That's why this film is a little bit better than other movies that purely rely on action and effects.Where Terminator, RoboCop and Blade Runner have more intelligent story lines, more logic to their stories and much more fleshed out conspiracies and goals with their stories, I, Robot is kind of flat. But that doesn't mean the movie is bad. Not at all. It's actually a very amusing and entertaining tale about mankind and mankinds machines.The real actors though are probably more disappointing than the animated actors. But this isn't a film for adults. This is a childs film. Watch it for the entertainment value and you will have a nice time.If you like to think while watching films, then you probably should pass on it. This is a no-brainer.6/10.</fullReview>

But soon, he investigates the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning(James Cromwell) that might have been perpetrated by a robot, which leads to a larger threat to humanity. I, Robot is one of the best blockbuster films to come out this year. Although it's not as good as Alien vs Predator(I LOVED THAT DAMN MOVIE), I, Robot was still my kind of popcorn. The robot effects were very good and very realistic. The storyline was great about the robots that should not be used in the future. I pretty much agree. The movie has very good action sequences which blows me away and that cat was cute. I'm glad it didn't die. Also, this movie's better than Bicentennial Man. That movie was a boring piece of crap that I decided to change to another channel. Overall, It was a very good movie. Best robot movie ever. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like me, if you had seen the trailer for I,Robot, chances are your opinion before seeing the movie would have been rather pessimistic. Seeing the movie at the Cinema definitely changed my opinion. I,Robot is definitely a good Sci fi flick that is worth watching.The trailer had portrayed these super lame home assistant bots jumping around like monkeys, attacking humans and Mr. stereotype cop: Will Smith, bashing them away with his bad boys attitude. Well he still does that in the movie but the story along with its application and dialogue made this film rather intriguing.While you move forward through the movie you come to realize that these seemingly harmless, and dumb looking bots are really not what they seem to be. The audience is made to see them through the eyes and mind of the suspicious cop Del Spooner (Will Smith) as cold and dangerous. I think this is one of the strong points of the film.No special performances by any of the cast and Will smith goes about being just Will Smith. But I liked the voice of the main NS-5 (Nestor Class 5) Robot and it had neat facial expressions to give that mysterious and threatening look (and not forgetting the humanlike eyes it had).As Sci-Fi this was a great movie touching some important areas on Robot and Mankind Interaction (however impossible they may seem) along with smart Sci-Fi lingo for a nerd like me.The earth in 2035 was looking a tad too sophisticated and the special effects were obvious in many of the action sequences but can be forgiven for a movie like this. Overall good movie, get a copy and don't watch it with a Robotics skeptic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: Loosely based on Isaac Asimov's series (I say loosely VERY loosely here), this movie attempts to show us the dangerous side to AI. There are however annoying tidbits in the movie such as the constant bombardment of advertisement we are shown throughout the movie and the 'slapped together' nature of the ending (a typical "He did it", "She did it" scenario which is what were left deducing). Other than those small imperfections, it works out to be a great action flick good for Friday nights. Great CG effects (although not seat-gripping) and interesting Robot paradigm discussions heighten the viewers positive experience.7/10 - Good for maybe 2-3 times</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable movie for action/sci-fi oriented people.For this people the movie was intended in the first place. But if u have read Asimov, don't even bother to pay the ticket.The movie simply butchered Asimov's extraordinary work. And i will explain here what really happens.SPOILERS!!!...don't read if u haven't seen the movie.Asimov created the 3 rules. But later in his work another law appeared. It was called the law 0 and it actually said that robots can harm people in order to save the destiny of humanity.The same thing happens here, or the movie tries to give the same idea. But because it is a action/hero movie.....they completely changed the idea, making the law 0 a very bad thing in order for someone to save the world(Will Smith, the hero that nowdays has to appear in every movie)So basically the hole plot of the movie is so unbelievable. The robots kill people, thus breaking the first law, not to make humanity happier, but to keep them in their houses so they cannot kill each other (Give me a break..:)))....).But in order to see this nonsense someone has to read Asimov.SPOILERS ENDMy advice: read Asimov's work...and don't watch the movie. And if u want to have a laugh at today's action movies (with all their "witty" expressions and one good man(woman) killing scores of bad guys), after u have read some Asimov books, watch the movie. U will laugh as hard as i did.rating 1.5/5 (just for the special effects)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a huge Asimov fan for many years, and I've thus far been very disappointed by all of the 'adaptations' of his stories for Hollywood. I expected even worse from this one. But the fact is, I couldn't help but enjoy it.Obviously, Hollywood took great liberties with Dr. Asimov's style. They turned Susan Calvin into the eye candy of the film, and cast Will Smith as the hero. But the fact is, making this into an action movie and staying as true as they did was an impressive feat. The screenwriters here were obviously well versed in the good doctor's works, with numerous references embedded throughout. The most important thing is, in the end, they did just what Asimov always did, tie everything together to show that what happened was not only allowable, but inevitable under the Three Laws.Aside from all that... it was just really cool. The special effects were top-notch. The scenery, stylings, cinematography, all done very well. The action sequences were great. Sure, there were your dumb, action hero one-liners, and some fairly sappy attempts to be philosophical, but it wasn't nearly as puerile a movie as you might expect. At the end of the day, anyone who can make an Asimov story into a battle royale of killer robots and with any degree of success is a good writer in my book.</fullReview>

Will Smith brakes the chains on his Mike Lowery character and gives calmed feature on his officer Spooner. Greenwood is usually superb in the role of "almost a bad guy" and the rest of the cast is helping the movie to rise from the similar projects like a well seen peake on the horizon. Asimov is very well exploited, all in all its a very interesting plot. The story is rolling very fast, so the viewer has no time to think about the idea of close future where serving robots become killers. The fact that gives this film a minus is coldness,frigid relation of the characters in the movie and the audience, and it doesn't help the fact that Spooner is a robot too!</fullReview>

Impressive electronic gadgets, most important the robots, but also the cars, surveillance cameras etc. You should not be looking for a masterminded plot in this movie, the story is pretty basic. It's kind a logical; robots do people no harm &gt; until there is one who does, but nobody wants to believe it. Just because the law says so and it has never happened before. And so Will Smith hunts down the Robot who apparently did it and finds out there is a further story/reason behind it. This movie is great fun to watch! A must see, I would say!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK ... first of all what "worst good movie" means ? It means its one of those movies that before seeing you ask people about it and they say its good or very good and you expect much from it, discovering afterwards that you are a little bit disappointed.Well ... I was VERY disappointed about this one towards the end... Let me explain... Is it just me that saw this plot is so stupid and just like others say ... was made just in the way of getting money out of this movie. Let me be more specific ... We, the viewers, are informed about the "3 Laws" right from the first seconds of the movie and the whole things evolves starting those laws. Well... the first law said "A robot may never harm a human" and by the end of the movie we find out that THE main Computer that controlled the Robots gets to the conclusion that humanity always tries to selfdistruct itself ... with wars etc etc ... bla bla bla ... same stuff we see in almost every SF, and ( here is gets interesting ) the robots have to KILL some humans ( considered dangerous ) in order to keep the human race going ... and I SAID KILL which clearly violates the 1ST LAW. END OF DISCUTION ... now the Computer gives us the stupid lines about ohhh I'm still obeying the 3 laws by KILLING some of you in order to ensure the existence of humans... That is the most "idiotic" lines I've heard in the past years in a movie ...OK so this ment a BIG black ball for this movie ... OK the special effects were good ... and some other stuff but COME ON people ... I'm not going to see a HIGH RATED movie like this one just to see Special Effects. This movie was bad ... of course cannot be compared to movies like Vapiros Los Muertos or Tremors which were the worst movies I have ever seen but when you expect much from it and you see such **** in the plot I mean COME ON ... And in the first 15 minutes I was thinking ... hmmm ... this might even be compared to MINORITY REPORT ... but OMG is sooooo far from the GREAT plot I saw in Spielberg's movie.I would give a 6/10 to this one just for FX. ohh yeah and one ADVICE to those which haven't seen it by now : DON'T READ MY COMMENT above AND DON'T EXPECT MUCH FROM THIS MOVIE and you might like it more than me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i saw it and i was expecting to see something new, it turned out to be nothing much than old and dusty story. I'll begin from Will Smith's character. Police officer (detective), survived something in the past, (something terrible) which keeps bother him. He always thinks about it and has dreams about it. He is single and lives alone. The loser in his job, where everyone thinks he's crazy, suffering from paranoia, but despite all this he is crazy, a boss's best friend (favorite guy) and has his bless (protection). He is the only one who sees the real problem, but no one believes him (until the end). I'v seen this guy (character) in so many movies. The robots: artificial serves, designed to protect people also, but all connected to one super intelligent system (AI), which at some point realizes that humans are already unnecessary (or something). I'v seen it in at least 12 other movies. I'll admit that right after i heard that all these new robots are connected to that kind of intelligent system i figured how it gonna end, and i was right. There is a couple more things that i could mention, but i have no more time.Now to say something about what i liked. It was Will Smith's performance, the robot (Sunny) and directing at some point.It's pointless to comment about visual effects. 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie, I had written it off as just being another half-brained Will Smith action flick. Now, while I can't say that it doesn't have all of the elements of such a film, I can say that it does transcend the level of the typical Will Smith movie. I like the way robots are depicted in this film; that they're not just brainless enemies of mankind. I like that they chose one unique robot and gave him personality. The film probably doesn't do Isaac Asimov's novels justice(I haven't read them myself), but it does a pretty good job of presenting the whole Artificial Intelligence(AI) Vs. Real Intelligence debate(which has been done many, many times before in science fiction), in a mainstream movie. The plot is pretty good, and it seems original; I don't remember seeing a movie with the same plot, at least. The pace is good, it never loses your patience or your attention, nor does it ever get boring. The acting is good enough; Smith definitely ain't no actor, but he manages to be decent here. The characters are well-written, interesting and credible. Few, if any, are clichés or stereotypes. The CGI is magnificent. Only rarely have I seen such impressive and well done CGI. The humor is pretty good; standard stuff for Smith, but still good. I have to admit, though I'm by no means a fan of his, he did make me laugh at several occasions throughout the film. The cinematography is interesting, and director Alex Proyas manages to keep the action fresh and entertaining, through many chases and fights. The action is very good, even for a sci-fi action film. It's surprising, dynamic and intense, not to mention stylish. There were once or twice where I thought that the film copied The Matrix a little, but the action then proceeded to go in a different direction than I would have expected, and I realized that I was wrong. The science fiction aspects of the film are very well done, and exceptionally well thought-out, most of the time. All in all, a very entertaining science fiction action thriller, which should satisfy most of the mainstream crowd, as well as some of the more critical viewers. Some will probably not like this, though, and fans of Asimov shouldn't expect a film that resembles his works(from what I've heard, at least). I recommend the film to fans of science fiction, action, thriller and Will Smith. Possibly fans of Proyas as well(haven't seen any of his other films, can't say if this is like his other work). 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! When I saw "I Robot" I was really impressed. I was so excited to see this movie because of Asimov's story and because I'm a great fan of Will Smith.I think the story is excellent, and full of great ideas. Visual effects are the main strength of "I Robot". The best effect is the robot itself, which is absolutely amazing. I especially like that part when Sonny winks to Will Smith. Wow! The movie is full of other great visuals like V.I.K.I., the whole robotized city of Chicago, and of course Smith's cool Audi. Smith plays well again, with his smiling, witty act.I really suggest you to see "I Robot" if you like cool action/sci-fi movies.It is 8/10.Seth</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent CGI, Lame Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Robot" can hardly be described as merely another Will Smith summer action-comedy. It's far more technically, visually, and problematically complicated than just another such mindless blockbuster, and perhaps its intricate and confusing nature is exactly why it seems to collapse as a tedious, underwhelming sci-fi flick with decent CGI, yet a real sleep-inducer of a story. I found myself disconnected from practically everything except the sometimes dazzling action, which in turn is hardly dynamite enough to save the ennui of the film as a whole. We are introduced to a future inhabited by humans and... intelligent robots, which, as you might guess, are servants to the humans. I can't really get into it very deep, but apparently something goes "terribly wrong" and a robot is suspected of murdering his master. Sound like an intriguing story? It's anything but, with detective Will Smith eagerly hunting this robot down whilst further investigating into this mysterious homicide. The story is light on humor, amusement, and the element of surprise, and we are left starving for spectacular CGI to wield the shortcomings of this banal story. The CGI is impressive-- hundreds of identical androids, robotic car chase, etc.; yet hardly sufficient to save this film or provide nearly enough entertainment one might expect in a summer blockbuster. Bottom line: a confusing, technical, and underwhelming story which ultimately sinks as a piece of entertainment, as the decent CGI can hardly compensate for the film's banality, lack of delight and lack of surprise. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith is back in the sci-fi genre, fortunately not as a man in black. "I Robot" is a different kind of movie that blends paranoia with CGI in a pretty good way. The future is for once not a dark place were every one wears Ray-Bans and it always rains, but it is however full of robots. The people seem to have forgotten everything "Terminator" was supposed to learn us. Smith is a police officer and the only person in the movie who doesn't trust robots. Everybody else makes fun of him because of this. Well I guess you can see were it goes from here, but "I robot" actually manages to pull of some twists and surprises along the way, which makes it stand out among all the "Bladerunner" imitators out there, while it's never as complex as, say, anything Hitchcock ever did, it's still enough to make you stay awake and actually enjoy his movie. The reason for this pretty low score is that it's quite obvious that this is a Hollywood movie. There are just a bit too much dumb jokes and sometimes the CGI gets a too central role in it and by the way, all violence is PG.Still an entertaining movie.6/10</fullReview>

But this movie is as artificial as the story and without any of elements that made the other two so impressive to me. The SFX is okay but a bit over whelming and it is only Will smith's brilliant acting and charisma that saved this movie from becoming a shaky battlefield earth type. It entertains however and is the kind of Blade runner Murder Mystery. It is even comparable to Minority report although it lacks the visual specs of that.For me it was ID4&amp;Bladerunner combined and on heavy steroids and without the aliens.</fullReview>

He demonstrated good comic talent in the TV sitcom "The Fresh Prince of Belair" and in the film "Men in Black" but also showed that he knew how to act in films such as "The Legend of Bagger Vance" and "Ali". In "I, Robot" Smith gives a performance that is not only kick-ass and cynically funny but also somewhat moving as his character Del Spooner recounts how he had desperately tried to avoid the death of a girl in an accident he had had some time before. The special effects are as good as they get these days, and there is also a great cast that includes James Cromwell as Dr. Alfred Lanning, the dead scientist who died of a presumed suicide.

Also there was no sex which is also a major bonus. I thought it was Will Smith's best so far (even considering his excellent portrayal of that boxer, uh what was his name!). Anyway I think the critics in general got this one wrong. This was a much better movie than Spiderman 2, and deserved to do better at the box office. Although the future is most unlikely to look anything like what was shown here, the questions thrown up regarding robots and artificial intelligence are certainly thought provoking.</fullReview>

The acting was terrible, especially by Will Smith. He was extremely corny and his last name was hilarious and ridiculous "Detective Spooner." The movie was extremely farfetch'd, every scene was just so, "I don't get it how can that happen?" I always was wondering throughout the movie, is Will Smith going to die.

		<shortDescription>Robot gets 6, Bridget gets a 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It makes me sick to the stomach to think Bridget Moynahan is engaged to some football player. She is quite, beautiful and talented but of course many people of this caliber can also be equally obnoxious, boring and awful. I must admit that I usually care for summer commercial offerings as much as an NFL preseason game, unless it seems to be something out of the ordinary. SFX-wise, this film is quite remarkable. We have indeed come along way since "The Lost World" was made in 1925- newsflash to all you kids- Steven Spielberg was not the first director to work with dinosaurs. "RoboCop"- Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's best American film did not have all this wonderful gadgetry but it did have more plot and substance- it is certainly still the best robot movie ever made, or at least within the last 20 years. I think "I, Robot" more or less runs in circles, and really doesn't care about its characters. There are some interesting characters though. Will Smith plays a black man who also happens to be a... well, you will have to pay 7 bucks yourself to find out. But, assuredly, Will's double whammy would have been interesting to examine. I think this is what separates QT from everyone else. People get killed in very fascinating ways in his films, but we still know their back stories. But, the action in "I, Robot" is OK- it does move fairly well. Bridget reminds me of Ashley Judd, except the later is more talented as far as acting is concerned. But, Bridget might actually be even sexier. I think the director could have done all the men in the audience a favor by removing the steam from the shower scene. You can see more of Janet Leigh in "Psycho" and that was made in 1960- why do you think we pay 7 bucks for these silly 140 million dollar pictures, anyway? I don't think anyone would accuse Alex Proyas of being Russ Myers if he did away with this- come on! Of course, this movie will make more money in Dubai and Calcutta than a FedEX employee will in 100 lifetimes- so nice to see them replaced by robots in this movie- I guess humans will only be able to work for the US Postal Service soon. Hey, I can't wait til 2035. Maybe Bridget, who is my age, will be single again by then.......All in all, a good waste of time. "Bourne Supremacy" was certainly much worse, and I only wanted to see that for Franke Potente- and, what a disappointment that turned out to be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The future, robots, and the unimaginable always fascinate me.This film is exciting to watch, and the logic is quite reasonable. However, the gadgets that they used in the film are not very futuristic. For example, they are still using cell phones, and office settings are still very much like the 20th century. Some of the city traffic scenes are well done. Nevertheless, we have seen plenty of those in many previous movies.I was a little disappointed that they actually used a real actor for the robot Sunny. Of course, this is still the year of 2004. I don't expect a real robot actor. They could have used a computer-generated robot through out the movie, and then it might be too expensive. In the ending, when they had to destroy the mainframe computer, it looks as if they just combined scenes from &lt;&lt;Star Wars&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;2001&gt;&gt;.

		<shortDescription>A robotic film about robots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it's the season of the summer big flick and I, Robot attempts to make the most spectacular action film of the year. Its got a big name in actor in the form of Will Smith playing Del Spooner, a buffed up future detective. It's got explosions, a motorbike stunt, robots on the rampage and more explosions.Starting with the positive the always excellent James Cromwell puts in a memorable performance as Dr Alfred Lanning, the linchpin character that holds the film together. Shame he's in for such a short amount of time.The robots are well handled. The initial models we see show an interesting variety. Due to their nature as computer effects we are never convinced they share a physical existence with the characters on screen they do have presence. Especially towards the end of the film.The three laws of robotics are clearly explained and demonstrated. Only towards the end do the rigid rules become as flexible as warm fudge.The plot, while nothing we haven't seen before, moves at a good pace. There are few scenes which don't push the story forward or have something shiny to look at. Certain elements of the plot are foreshadowed effectively and play out nicely.Unfortunately this is where the flaws in the film start to show through.Clichés assault this film in as many numbers as robots. The rogue detective who is an embarrassment to the force, only he can see the truth as he battles his superiors and the big evil corporation. You can almost countdown to the moment where he's ordered to hand in his badge and gun.A minor character is introduced early in the film for no other reason so he can be put in danger later. What is his bond with Will Smith's character? You don't need to know that. You're just the audience.Will Smith's character Del Spooner displays the worst traits of a movie detective. He misses obvious clues, turns a blind eye to ludicrous situations (Spooner doesn't question the presence of a cat in a house due to be demolished in a few hours). However the moment someone says something mundane he's able to make amazing leaps of logic. He also bonds with the first attractive female he meets.The vision of the film is laughable being set a mere thirty one years in the future. By then there will be hordes of robots, which is fine since that's the premise of the film.However in the future the 'internet' will close down all libraries. Well educated people won't know the story of 'Hansel and Gretel' (despite being born in the next TEN years). Yeah, fairy tales which have already lasted over a hundred years will vanish in ten years. I blame the internet.Modern technology can do many wonderful things but as I, Robot proves it can't provide substance. For this reason science films of past decades still display a more convincing view of tomorrow and possess something surely missed in most films. Respect for the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I never had a strong liking for robots and computers which feel and think like human beings I must confess that the logic of this movie seduced me from the beginning. First it's basically a detective story though developing itself in an unusual surroundings, those of sci-fi. And there you can follow a story thread which is solid and plausible enough if you take for granted, or course, those same surroundings which in truth are very well conceived and designed and not shocking at all. Second the background against which the story develops itself is one which is dear to sci-fi: the conflict between human and artificial intelligence and the latter's reach and nature which poses the vexed question of knowing what are intelligence and sentiments made of after all. Can the created thing become equal or even superior to its creator? That's the big question raised in this movie as a matter of fact. In fact what we watch here is a revolution made by robots against their creators. Technically the movie is almost perfect if you allow for the usual physical unlikelihood of several scenes during the sequence of the final fight. The way robots mix up with people in the streets doesn't shock a bit and seems almost natural. One last note: the very last scene of the movie seems to leave much field for personal interpretation by the viewer posing a lot of interrogations about what the above mentioned revolution has brought to mankind after all. Are things going to be in future like they were when the movie began? That's up to you to decide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's so easy to say: ha, the typical schlocky Hollywood output! It could have been an intellectually challenging movie, etc. etc.... Movies this big are made to make money - well that's how the studios see it and they have the money to finance them. When they are that good as I' Robot, it's because many of the people involved are not that greedy and don't "dumb down" things as much as they could, but they rather do the very best they can - plus walking the extra mile. My point is NOT: better a movie that is better than it could have been than no movie at all. My point is: please don't let your choice of movies be commanded solely by online critiques - most of which are definitely excellent but many times only analyze the content, not necessarily the overall impression. Will Smith is becoming a first rate action star with the right mix of down-to-earthness, making fun of his vanity (These are vintage 2004 sneakers!), and just keeps the right balance while maintaining his own youthful style. More of Will Smith please.The movie has great plot twists that are independently about the real identity of Spooner (Smith) and Sonny the Robot splendidly voiced by Alan Tudyk. Yes there are still some problems with the lack of weight and heft in the CGI animated creatures and some action scenes (too) strongly resemble computer games, but I find it in this case all way above average and never disappointing.Of course Sonny the robot steals the show. He is very well developed and makes perfect sense. Of course his character and the story could have been even more developed until the very limits of mind bending philosophy, but hey, this is an action movie - and an excellent one it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** Possible Spoilers ***A movie that could've upped the ante after Minority Report, and the standard-setting Blade Runner, gets reduced to a typical mindless summer blockbuster, right there with Bad Boys II. Director Alex Proyas, whose previous works I've held in high regard, and consider them to be close to near-perfect celluloid realizations, disappoints big time. There is a lesson to be learned from Chronicles of Riddick &amp; I, Robot - never give cutting-edge talented directors like David N. Twohy &amp; Alex Proyas the kind of excessive budgets reserved only for Jerry Bruckheimer productions. More budget = bad scripts, bad pacing, and loss of edge. Although in comparison, Chronicles of Riddick still manages to entertain, which is more than I could say for I, Robot. This movie needed to be more darker, with a tight budget, and a tighter script.I am no pseudo-intellectual, or an Asimov-ist(??!!) to put on display the glaring holes in the sacrilegious adaptation of Asimov's work.Am just your typical discerning viewer, who wants his money's worth when he heads out to the local multiplex. And I didn't get that satisfaction!Lastly - the HAL syndrome has been done to death. They should have a law against any screenplay that uses the HAL-gone-bad conclusions.I hope that Alex Proyas does not indulge in the near future in such mindless fares. He should stick to the dark themes, and tight budgets that result in exemplary works of cinema.</fullReview>

The pre release hype was excellent and irresistible but, having wasted my time paying to see it, I look back on it as having sat through nothing more than a slick two hour Audi advertisement. I was bored by the whole thing. It was like watching a replay of a computer gane.A kind of Blade Runner I was expecting. I should have known better. It wasn't deep, original or thought provoking. I, Robot is pure pap.There is obviously a massive industry out there thriving on providing amazing special effects. If you like amazingly spectacular, gob smackingly stupendous, unbelievably incredible digitaly created images then this movie hits the spot. My personal spot has been hit too often these days to be any further impressed by a bunch of overpaid button pushers.It's a pity that film directors and producers seem to lack the imagination to utilise modern special effects to enhance their work rather than allowing them dominate. If a tenth the money was invested in challenging storylines we would all go home with much wider eyes.Such is the nature of seasonal blockbusters and I suppose I am an idiot for expecting more. Given the way things are going, a movie of a more realistic prediction of the world in the year 2035 might go along the lines of something medieval rather than technologicaly futuristic. Now that would be a really spectacularly challenging movie. Lets call it "The Day After Reality Kicks In".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a soon to be undervalued near-classic. Go see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I-Robot is an extraordinarily kinetic film. During many of the action sequences the camera weaves and bends around the scenes to the degree that it necessarily disorientates the viewer but without, and this is its strength, diluting the clarity of the narrative. It's an expensive looking film, a well realized coherent futuristic vision. A lesser film would have made the robots a feature from the off -- here they're just another part of the city, weaving through the sidewalks accompanying and serving their human masters. On the surface this is what can by classed as a typical summer Hollywood action film; there are car chases, fight scenes and a race against time.It is also a perfect example of what director Martin Scorsese describes as 'smuggling' -- wrapping a much deeper message in the trappings of something else. Like Minority Report before it, this is a film which entertains while saying something about ourselves, themes piling up on top of one another. There is the increasing reliance on technology; there is the naivety many of us have about the honesty of big business and it's ongoing quest to convince us that it only wants to help; there is prejudice against others and our reactions to our own prejudices; there is the expectation that things will always be better in the future.It is a weirdly literate script. It was a brave move to present the essence of Asimov's work rather than produce a straight adaptation. We've seen that before -- it's appeared on television a couple of time (with Leonard Nimoy). A good comparison is the work Robert Altman did with Raymond Carver's work in Short Cuts. Taking the stories and weaving bits and pieces of them in and around each other to create a new vision. In places it's own technobabble is undercut as is it's po-facedness. It's also impeccably structured, opening up the story and the possibilities of this world at a pace slow enough for the audience to catch up, but fast enough that we aren't bored. That it was written by Jeff (Final Fantasy) Vinter and Akiva (A Beautiful Mind) Goldsman is a shock -- but a welcome one.It is no surprise to me that Smith's performance as Spooner is actually quiet excellent -- as is always the case when he is given good material to work with. For all the giant leaps and superhuman punch-ups, jokes and quips, he manages to give a quite touching layered performance. Equally, Bridget Moynahan's work as Calvin shouldn't be underestimated. Within the running time she has to develop from being a walking computer into a woman with real feelings and she definitely pulls it off. But the real tour-de-force is Alan Tudyk's Sonny. Like Andy Serkis's Gollum, the actor played the role before being replaced by computer animation and like Gollum the process gives the illusion of a real character within the space. Sonny has weight the audience has few difficulties suspending their disbelief. The real success is if the audience forgets they are watching something animated. Well I did.It is a shame that the film was released now because I don't feel like it's being enjoyed or applauded as much as it should. The viewer has become quite blaze about the action film genre of late as we've lucky enough to have been able to see a series of film which do mix action with ideas. The viewer wants more and now it's getting it, they forget what it was like in the bad old days of theatrical releases for Under Siege 2. In previous years this would be getting five star reviews and be appearing on top ten lists. Instead critics are giving it average reviews, three stars and making flip statements about Will Smith's acting ability. It's annoying and unfair, especially to Alex Proyas who has managed to take all the brilliance of his previous film Dark City and apply it to a Hollywood aesthetic.It is a soon to be undervalued near-classic.

		<shortDescription>Mechanical rehash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Will Smith (who's yet to be in anything better than "Six Degrees of Separation" and "Ali") and director Alex Proyas (why can't he return to the sublime Gothic schlock of "The Crow" and "Dark City"?) both deserve better than "I, Robot." This movie may provide you with a little bit of fun but nothing can hide the fact that it's poor genre stuff with slightly upgraded software. And movies are not computers, and we're not robots, though the industry likes to think that. "Blade Runner" does the trash-futuristic city thing infinitely better (and is not alone in doing so); "2001: A Space Odyssey" (not to be mentioned in the same sentence) does the existential angst of artificial intelligence more cosmically and "A.I." does the machine's longing to be human more painfully and humanly. This movie has only a few ideas, watered down from Isaac Asimov, and it tends to belabor them and dumb them down (Akiva Goldman is to thank, or curse, for the final script). First let us begin with the very emphatic product placements: Converse All Stars, to which a whole scene is devoted, and Audi automobiles. If you're going to chase a running robot through crowded streets, you'll need those All Stars. If you're chased by a gang of mad cybertrons driving huge trucks armed with robotic fork lifts, you'll want to be behind the controls of an Audi ? which cop hero Del Spooner (Smith) drives in a number of demolition derby sequences, one of which almost makes his cyber-prosthetic left arm fall off. Why do the stars of these future flicks wear leather jackets? Maybe those are product placements too. So is FedEx, now delivered by annoyingly obsequious mechanical men. And there's a little plug for adopting stray kittens, which shows Spooner's softer side. Will Smith isn't a robot and the contrast of his awesomely pec-ed tawny torso with the spindly silver ant-like bodies of the robots, which are blue-eyed to boot, is all too obvious. The pecs are repeatedly shown off in bedroom moments, and then strongly hinted at by the loose pullover Will wears for all other scenes. He seems to have gotten in character, as Hollywood stars often do nowadays, by going to the gym. There's a dame, an uptight, almost robotic robot shrink, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) who gets loosened up by her need to bond with Will after the ritual initial sparring. The movie observes one rather special and arbitrary rule that viewers of A.I. can't but think odd: all robots look alike. I guess that makes the digital effects cheaper and our sense that the mechanical creatures are an enemy army clearer. Their stick-figure look is pretty boring though, after the riot of robot generations and looks in A.I. The people of Chicago, where this is supposed to take place, are faceless too. There's a cocky teenage boy who Spoon knows, and Spoon's granny (Adrian Ricard) who bakes him pies. The unkindest cut is that a robot can learn to make them just as tasty. Spoon doesn't have the complication of a wife or girlfriend to deal with any more -- that's a story the movie doesn't get into. Then there's the genius robot inventor Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), whose apparent suicide Spoon is sent to investigate. Since the inventor is huge ? the company he started is about to put out a robot for every five humans in the country (not the world; in fact we don't see beyond Chicago) and he's scion of a great company, and since Spoon is a bit of a wild card, it's odd he'd be sent to investigate ? but then, he's Will Smith. Will is a sort of middle class, ghetto dressed dominant male in this. Not much of a stretch. And he has a human directness and secure sense of himself that makes him shine compared to irritating, self satisfied company CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood, who's thin, always a bad sign-Spoon's friendly cliché police boss ? Chi McBride -- is fat) and the lady shrink (who's got a tight, mannish hairdo; but never fear ? she lets the hair down later and becomes a real woman). And then there's Sunny (voiced by Alan Tudyk), who's sort of R2D2 with (metaphorical) balls and a longing to lead.Spoon meets the CEO and dislikes him, because while the scientist was a pal, this snake heads a company whose slogan, Spoon thinks, should be 'we s**t on the little guy.' The robot explosion is represented as a megabucks capitalist enterprise to displace workers and sell hardware, which is tied in with their being treated as a slave class. That's one of the movie's Asimov-lite ideas. The others concern the nature of the robots. 'The Three Rules' (of Robotics) are the essence of robot programming as benign servants of mankind: they're hardwired to be incapable of doing anything harmful to their masters. Spoon? get this ? distrusts robots because one of them saved his life. See the movie to find out how that works. An opening sequence ? the movie starts to creak when you look at how it's put together ? shows how quick Spoon is to assume robots are up to no good. Which of course is justified, and he's the only one to know this, and so it must be or there'd be no plot and no superhero. It all leads to the Spoon punch line to the lady shrink, "Somehow 'I told you so' just doesn't quite do it." The movie has a few moments, such as when Sonny gets interrogated by Spoon to see what's wrong with his program, and a few of the street scenes where robots blend in with people. The big trouble with I, Robot, other than its simplistic, not to say dumb, script, is as so often happens nowadays in Hollywood that the ideas and the characters get overwhelmed by the special effects, in this case the armies of digitalized robots, who give Will Smith an opportunity to be an action star (in a void, I guess) but quickly infantilize the proceedings. I'm not sure if Spoon's motorcycle is a product placement or not, since few people would recognize the custom job that it is, and anyway there are only a few of them available. Maybe Will Smith, who crashed one at 60 m.p.h shooting the movie, also got to keep one as part of his paycheck. Makes you want to be a star. Very wanly recommended, though as one critic has written, if you go, the sequel will be your fault. Maybe better just to go out and buy an Audi, or, if that costs too much, a pair of Converse All Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action-thriller with a curiously interesting point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not exactly have high expectations for this movie, thinking it would simply be another basic Hollywood action-flick. Having said that, I was left with a completely different impression after seeing I, Robot, to the extent that it lives up to the same kind of curious experimentations with interesting concepts as Minority Report, which in my opinion is an excellent science-fiction thriller.I haven't read the book, so I can't base my judgements, as so many have done here, upon the excellence of the novel and how much the movie differs from it (but, let's face it, that's how films based on novels often are; It is easier to express oneself through words than it is to compress an entire novel into two-hours.) I know the movie left out important, and some less important, events that take place in the novel, but I, for one, find this understandable. For a book-to-film kind of movie, this is in the 'above-average' group, unlike movies such as Dreamcatcher, which was a sheer misinterpretation.I, Robot explores a very interesting, and often bothering dilemma, where logical thinking replaces sentimental values through cold rationing. It also embarks upon the conflict of giving a machine an identity, at which point it becomes self-aware. The three laws of robotics are defined so that human beings cannot come to harm, according to Isaac Asimov, in which case the self-awareness of a machine would conflict with these rules, creating a sort of a paradox; The machine has rules that it is programmed to follow, but develops a sense of self-awareness that contradicts some of those rules for the sake of self-defense (an inherent response to all 'living' organisms that are aware of their existence).The exploration of this paradox actually provides the movie with a point, unlike so many of today's action-thrillers. The visual experience is breathtaking, with excellent camera-work and good, but not excessive, visual effects. Will Smith's role, as usual, contributes subtle comic elements that help relieve the 'tension' and remind us that this is still entertainment.A lot of people have also criticized the excessive advertisement in the movie, and I can definitely see why. But the way I see it, Alex Proyas very deliberately exaggerates these advertisements and makes them too obvious, to aggravate witty, cunning humor at the expense of those corporations that are advertised - at least in Denmark the entire audience understood the obviousness. I know I may sound pseudo-analytical when I say this, but the advertisements might actually form a sub-theme in the movie, namely that of commercialization of our society. I mean, obviously this is the way things are headed and I would not be surprised if in thirty years advertisement has doubled or even quadripled from what it is today. All that said, I, Robot is a very good science-fiction thriller, that actually delves into some important issues as well as manages to entertain the viewer from start to end. It is difficult to come up with negatives because I have not read the novel, but from me, a movie needs to be pretty darn good to deserve even a 7/10 (3?/5). I gave I, Robot, 7, rather than 8 or 9 because it fails to take that final step that separates the sheep from the lambs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plain and simple, a great blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is really an update of Blade Runner. It's not in the same vein as that film; where Blade Runner was a gritty noir this is shiny and clean, with a hint of corruption underneath.The actions scenes are noting short of breathtaking, there is some hilarious dialogue and Wil SMith proves himself one again to be the daddy of the blockbuster.The CGI is particularly impressive, but does not lead the story, just enhances it. Sonny is a brilliant character - as impressive both in performance and looks as Gollum from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.People will resent the comparison with the supposed best sci-fi of all time but they can swivel - it is just as good, but in an alternative way. It takes that films best themes and puts them in a more optimistic rather than throat slittingly depressing light.The twists and turns and little touches of genius are dotted around all over the film, but I won't ruin them if you haven't seen the film yet and are reading my review. I did however, find the reasoning behing the 'rise of the robots' as a bit weak and predictable.See it, you'll be entertained at the very least. If not, you'll probably love it.</fullReview>

He gets called in to investigate a crime involving what caused the chip on his shoulder (a robot involved in a death).... cop ends up getting involved in a big back story about domination and foils the evil doer's plans... cop gains understanding about (robots) that caused the chip on his shoulder and softens his view of robots. the end.The movie has great special effects - lots of cgi and digital images... great use of existing city features... liked seeing the older Chicago landmarks (Sears Tower) juxtaposed over the newer buildings.... The movie has great action - lots of running and jumping and typical Will Smith cop movements.... great chase scenes and such.... Very intriguing plot line and story.... keeps your interest throughout....Great cast.... Will Smith shines - even though he's been this role many times before... he worked HARD on his body for this role - and, DAMN! does it show! Will looks GOOD!

I really wanted to see this film and finally got to see it last month in theaters. The plot is wonderful, the special effects were great, and the acting was good. I also loved the robots. Especially Sonny. They were cool, clever, very realistic, and I loved the way they talked.My favorite part of the film is when it shows the futuristic world with the robots living among humans. That was so cool. Overall I loved this film and I have no major complaints about it. I believe everyone should see it and I can't wait until it comes out on video.

		<shortDescription>A decent sci-fi action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By all means, this movie is decent sci-fi action, but lacks the depth it claims.The movie opens with the Three Laws of Robotics, as stated by Isaac Asimov. In short, these say that a robot shall always obey humans and protect them and even through inaction, can never harm them. Cue Will Smith in one of his more serious roles. He still cracks some jokes every now and then and does some overacting in a few scenes. Luckily, only very few scenes so his overall performance is decent. The plot, which, without revealing too much of it, is based around the three laws of robotics going out the window, never really goes in depth and I got the feeling that the action was more important at certain times. Too bad, since the film tries so hard to be something more than brainless action. Effects were nicely done, the robots were looking good and some of the outdoors scenes were breathtaking. Will Smiths car was beautiful, but Audi sponsoring part of the film was too evident at some times. Almost all of the 'extra' cars were modified Audi's. Even the police drove modified Audi A6's.All in all, this film kept me pretty entertained for close to 2 hours, but didn't have me really thinking about what I just saw.A decent 6,9 out of 10 for this film.</fullReview>

The movie starts out pretty bad, as I guess here's the part where all people whine about the commercial thing. OK, it wasn't that good, and flashing around with Audi, Converse et cetera, well please Will Smith stop flashing around for the money and go back to what you used to be. Making some conditions and terms! Not only in it for the money... But still, I like you Will, and you're acting does not turn less good as the more you only work for the money. It looks like you need some vibe back again, maybe return to the Fresh Prince, haha. Well, anyways, this movie ain't that bad, so I'd call it a 7 out of a 10, and I'm really satisfied with how the story develops the further the movie goes. Well worth the view!</fullReview>

So you can see that I was amazed when Will Smith didn't ruin this movie. In fact, this movie is quite enjoyable, amazingly enough. The story itself is pretty well told, and pretty original. So Will Smith has a couple of crappy lines but he is allowed to because that is his character. This movie is both action packed and pretty funny at times. The one thing that did annoy me is the advertisement in this movie; Audi, JVC, FedEx and Converse. The last one is by far the worse. Seems like they made the plot around the advertisements. Wow, cool shoes Will Smith. Thank you, they are CONVERSE. Use this conversation about 3 times and you have the movie. Like I said, I did enjoy the movie, except of course from the advertisements and the planes flying in formation at the end. I rate this movie 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak start but gets way better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About ten minutes into this film I was really starting to wonder why my friend had recommended I go see it. The dialogue was poor and the characters seemed to be going down the well trodden path of misfit divorced cop who has an unconventional relationship with an older figure saves the day while having an unsympathetic boss who also happens to be his friend. Some of that turned out to be true but as the film moves along it does other things as well.Gone is the endlessly wise cracking Will Smith that everyone expects after films like MIB and Independence Day, to be replaced with a more serious and, once you realise why he hates robots, more believable person.I especially likes the way the film puts ideas out there and then does nothing with them, allowing the audience to speculate before coming back later to add an explanation. Spooners relationship with Lanning is mentioned several times but its not until the film is two-thirds done that its explained. It doesn't patronise instead asking that you just stick with it and everything will become clear.The ending was good and the special effects were, to my mind at least, some of the best I've ever seen. The robots themselves are the best example of this. Beyond the first couple of scenes where the director deliberately sticks them in your face they never look at all out of place.The film is thought provoking too, prompting everyone to ask questions about when a machine becomes a living thing.By the end of the movie my initial reservations were gone, although he unconvincing dialogue does return from time to time.Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

But to be honest, given the premise of the film; 'cute' robots being subservient to human beings via the so called Three Laws,... It IS a little difficult to take that sense of seriousness seriously... Sorry Will!!!This film could have been, should have been a lot darker... But then, it wouldn't be a summer, 'Big Willy' production now would it??? So, this one is definitely for the kids... Whom I'm sure will love this film...For us serious Sci-Fi fans...

		<shortDescription>A Cyberpunk Comeback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The list of silver screen gems "suggested" by originally enshrined literary works goes on a ways and ushers in quite the tinseltown fiasco on more than a few occasions.Luckily, Alex Proyas (of venerable The Crow and Dark City fame) makes good use of Asimov's Robot series as inspiration, veering away from its often dreary technicalities but remaining faithful enough to serve up a truly significant homage.At its core, Proyas' rendition revolves around the author's well-known three laws of robotics. These set-in-positronic-silicon tenets regulate robot behavior, relegating the mechanical aids to appliance status while making certain they remain tame. However, in a somewhat exaggerated and over-projected 2035 Chicago, robotics' neglected gray areas threaten to create a stir when a new class of machine, the NS5, goes to market with perhaps too much AI for its own good. Detective Spooner (Will Smith) enters the fray once a suspicious murder takes place within the very hallowed halls where synthetic intelligence emerges, or super-corporation US Robotics (wasn't that a real company once?). Spooner's mentor and friend, robot-design pioneer Dr. Lanning, meets a mysteriously grisly end with very little for the police to go on, immediately raising blaring alarms in Spooner's jaded mind. His investigation, helped along by at-first cynically doubtful scientist Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), brings him and the entire city into direct contest with powerful interests and other unforeseen cybernetic woes.Despite liberally frolicking around in Asimov's seminal source material. I, Robot succeeds with flying colors, mostly as a consequence of being respectful and paying true tribute to previous triumphs in the genre, like Blade Runner. Will Smith's accomplished performance delivers a sardonic, old-fashioned street smart cop caught in situations where his gut feelings and pure instincts work better than all the high-tech gizmos in the universe. His persona reflects that of Harrison Ford's Deckard almost to a tee, and he carries the same gun, to boot. Additionally, both IR and BR deal with the thin line separating thinking machine and human, as well as feature main heroes with more links to their alleged artificial adversaries than meet the eye. Other bonds between the two include nods to Blade Runner's unparalleled futurism (note the similar-looking cop cars), and a robot foe with the potential to become good. All in all, though, I. Robot still insists on being a summer hit, thus imbuing itself with modifications like CGI-laden action sequences that come across as OK but not much beyond, stereotypical characters such as the comforting but bellowingly bossy police captain (Chi McBride), and gross brand placement. To wit, every car 30 years hence will be an Audi.But don't take these as major complaints. For a big budget, middle of the cinema deal, IR works wonders within its glossy confines, providing audiences with a compelling anecdote of a tale. While the film's near-future postulation may be over-the-top a la Minority Report's unlikely tech-utopia, it still manages to convey believable characters surrounded by dazzling visuals minus the plasticity now so intimately associated with computer graphics-reliant projects. Next to many of its prefab contemporaries, I, Robot shines through gloriously.Definitely not as grimy as Ridley Scott's 1982 watershed achievement, the Asimov-guided movie falters hardly ever in depicting various shades of tomorrow's city life and technology's various side-effects, all properly watered-down for PG-13 crowds but still thought-provoking to a large degree. As we said before, things need to be taken in perspective. Blade Runner was primo art house edginess, while IR stands as one of 2004's biggest summer chart toppers. Even so, it's remarkably thrilling and leads the way for (hopefully) other, grander efforts aimed at reviving big-screen cyberpunk.Rating: * * * 1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My introduction to the film was a Billboard poster in London a couple of months prior to release. That one poster certainly did its job (Promotion) &amp; I immediately put it on my "must see" list. Film advertising nowadays seems to contain far too many "Spoilers", once you've seen the trailer, there isn't much left to be surprised by in the film. For this reason, I purposefully avoided all reviews, trailers, &amp; Hype associated with I-Robot so that I could make my own conclusions good or bad. I think my avoidance of previews paid off, &amp; I enjoyed the film more so, but there wasn't much we haven't seen before in other sci-fi movies, hints of "Terminator","Star wars","Blade Runner" were evident. Are there any original Concepts out there? Hope my comments don't seem to negative, it's still a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this film yesterday on the big screen and I really enjoyed it a lot. I really do enjoy Will Smith in these roles, although Enemy of the State still remains by far my favorite Smith movie. I Robot was progressing really fast paced if you ask me, I liked that. There weren't any slow moving scenes in there where you start yawning and wish the plot moved on a bit. One thing that slightly annoyed me was the beginning of the film :/sarcasm onI wasn't sure if the film already started or if I was watching a stretched out commercial for an Audi TT 2 prototype./sarcasm offI'd rate it at least 8/10, perhaps even 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very slick production, but also with deep emotions and some poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has nothing to do with Asimov's book "I robot" but that's not a problem. It is simply inspired from the book, and that can not be wrong.This movie is a big showpiece and millions of dollars flows in the scenery and computer animation. But it is definitely made with a feeling for the publics possible need for some deeper emotion and some deeper thoughts. Often it is also beautiful, even poetic. And often it's a good thriller and you feel your heart pounding.The only big problem is the product placement of the shoes of the main character Detective Spooner played by Will Smith. It stinks all the way from the US to Europe. Believe me.Otherwise it is a surprisingly tight and well played drama in entertainment style. Not at all as hollow and only on the surface as you always fear in a really expensive production. Lots of emotions and also some deep thoughts. It's worth the money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an Asimov fan, I wasn't expecting much, but boy, I got even less! Will Smith is the movie- by-numbers divorced maverick cop with a past that haunts his every moment. Why do these characters always have to have some stupid, tragic back story? Why couldn't he just be a cop who is GOOD at his job? He comes off as Axel Foley without the laughs. So they crammed in about 5 horrible clichés right away. Next up, the CGI is impressively unconvincing. It's a real shame to see all the post-Matrix rubbish in there when we've already had both AI and Minority Report show how it SHOULD be done - the final battle sequence is so predictable you'll be looking at your watch and checking your text messages before it runs its tedious course. All of the car-based crap is just a huge product placement for Audi, and it really hurts credibility (as do the lingering closeups of Smith's stereo. Frankly, it's ALL annoying:- the robots are pretty but ludicrous, the humans are mostly straight off the set of "Escape from LA", the Sci-Fi makes no sense and the product placements rob its last shred of dignity.This film is crap. Don't make these imbeciles any richer than they already are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alex Proyas's "I, Robot" starring Will Smith is a solid action thriller that is visually provocative, inspired by the Isaac Asimov book. I remember reading the Asimov classic back in junior high, but not much else. The Three Laws of Robotics basically mandate that a robot shall not kill a human regardless of circumstance. The world according to Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldman's screenplay, has an apparent loop hole. It is 2035. Robots are part of the human experience and lexicon. U.S. Robotics (USR) is releasing a new model of robot, where soon there will be a robot for every 20 people. USR's CEO, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) dreams of revolutionizing the world with the release of this new model. Going back to the loop hole, a robot stands implicated of murder. This robot, Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk), did not just kill anyone. Sonny stands accused of killing the inventor of the Three Laws of Robotics, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell). Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates Lanning's murder at the request of the late Dr. Lanning's interactive holographic recording of himself. The irony is that the physically recovering, Spooner (Smith) is robot-phobic. This is further revealed and articulated as the story unfolds. "I, Robot" has a good sense of humor for a science fiction thriller. After the intense interrogation with Sonny, Spooner tells his chief, that he yearns for the old days when "people killed people". During his investigation Spooner enrolls the expertise of Dr. Susan Calvin (the smart and beautiful Bridget Moynahan), who is a psychologist working to make robots more human-like at USR. Calvin's examination indicates that Sonny may be in fact sentient. This seems to further contradict the breach of the Three Laws when Dr. Lanning was murdered. Is there a conspiracy against humans? Dr. Calvin refuses to acknowledge this possibility. To which Spooner responds, "You are the dumbest smart person I know..." Awesome line. Yes, there is a conspiracy-- which is not shocking given that this is an action thriller. So Spooner and Calvin do their heroic best to save Chicago, circa 2035. Director Alex Proyas orchestrates a brisk pace, and his visuals are amazing, particularly with the mass invasion of the robots in the city. I have been a fan of Proyas since his work on "The Crow". "I, Robot" is a great looking big budget movie. Will Smith is quickly becoming the action star icon. There is no one cooler than Big Will. He is handsome, funny, and full of attitude. He bulked and got ripped for his role as Spooner. It's amusing that in the beginning of the movie to establish the complexity of Spooner, the muscular Smith has a nude shower scene. Well, when he looks the way he does, he is entitled. Aside from that star stroke, Smith is one of the most charming actors, and he has a genuine screen presence. Smith is the focal point of "I, Robot" amidst the spectacular visual effects. Bridget Moynahan as Susan Calvin is a strong foil to Smith. Her studied caution balances Spooner's reckless intensity. Moynahan is very good. She fleshes out what could have been a card board character. She is also gorgeous. She and Smith have great chemistry. Bruce Greenwood is excellent as the ruthless and enterprising corporate baron. Alex Proyas's visionary style, and Will Smith's star power make "I, Robot" enjoyable to watch, and for the most part it is compelling viewing. And somewhere in there remember that this was all inspired by Asimov. It is a tribute to his genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action-packed, adrenaline-rushing, and captivating sci-fi masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is a great movie. It really makes up for some of Will Smith's older roles in which he did a miserable performance. Bridget Moynahan does a great performance in this.Will Smith plays a man in the year 2035 in Chicago named Del Spooner. In the year 2035, it's a whole new world with enhanced technology, hovering cars, and robots, the pretty standard stuff you expect to see in a future movie like Minority Report. Well being in the future, Spooner never trusted and never would trust the robots even though they were programmed by the 3 "flawless" laws shown at the beginning of the movie. At the time, if you didn't really like the tech, you'd be considered to be pretty psychotic. Having said this, Spooner would be that old-fashioned guy with the old stuff like Vintage 2004 converse running shoes. All of the "oldie" stuff he owned in the film turns out to be stuff you see everyday presently like "non-voice-activating" music player. Well, the main creator of all the robots, the father of robots is found dead in the front lobby of the main HQ. Spooner is called to the scene and the story goes from there.Sonny, is the robot character played by Alan Tudyk in a green suit for CGI. He brings an unexplainable emotional feel to the screen that makes you love him and he makes you forget that he's CGI in the first place. He plays one of the main heroes at the end and sets his mind to accomplish anything, even though he knows its the wrong thing to his kind. Behind Gollum, he's the best CGI character I've ever seen and the Academy had better nominate this film for Best Visual Effects.Overall, I, Robot is that one movie every summer that brings you an action-packed, entertaining ride of a film. For me, it's the 3rd best summer movie right after Spidey 2 and Collateral. I highly recommend this film to everyone but it's not necessary for it to be a family flick. To tell you the truth, I wasn't going to see this movie from the look of the teaser trailer. It turns out I was there at the theaters on opening day. Very entertaining movie even if those fans of the novel were disappointed. It looks like every movie these days has some certain type of fan disappointed. That can't really be said about Collateral unless you have brain damage. Memorable finale, memorable CGI character and great performances by Smith and Moynahan. What did you do with yours?My Rating: 9/10 (A High 9)Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cop fights robots and disbelief in 2035</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I,Robot has emerged as the latest effort to remind us all that burgeoning technology could easily outpace our readiness to embrace it. Director Alex Proyas has grabbed his chance with an impressive treatment that has excitement, spectacle and intrigue in equal measure.Will Smith as Del Spooner shakes off most of his trade-mark laconicism,to become the troubled cop who-no-one-will-believe.Always a compelling motif, this was memorably seen in 'The Invasion of the Body Snatchers'.Spooner has had an earlier incident with a robot which has clouded his view of the film's Brave New World glorification of the robots endemic in the 2035 world society.His mistrust crucially focuses his mind on problems which only he can see, with assistance from a dead man.Soon he meets up with Susan Calvin,(Bridget Moynahan), who works for the mighty USR Corporation that designs and churns out the robots.Initially, the scientist and the cop find it hard to communicate, her verbal eloquence jarring with his abruptness. But then Spooner takes of his shirt, and a melting transformation comes over the chest-struck Calvin as she traces her finger down his arm.Suddenly her long sentences, convoluted phrasing and 3/4 syllable utterances, give way to appreciative monosyllabic grunts.This is good news to the popcorn-hooked audience, who can now understand what Calvin is saying.Together now, the duo take us on a roller coaster ride through danger, action and battles that thrill and entertain.Set pieces in this film are breathtaking and seamless.But with the action there is an excellent plot which keeps one jump ahead of your expectations. The ending is worth waiting for.Proyas handles his stars well, although I missed Will Smiths loquaciousness and laconic delivery.Bridget Moynahan is intriguing as the stiff but later resourceful Calvin.Perhaps the star of the film is Sonny, a new type of robot with feelings. His personification by image and the voice of Alan Tudyk is just right, both believable and touching.His plaintiff plea,"What am I?" to Spooner, is perhaps the films real tag line. I,Robot is a good entertaining movie and is guaranteed to soak up two large buckets of popcorn. I enjoyed it as a spectacle and a mystery.Go see it with a chum and enjoy.</fullReview>

Great visuals and brilliant effects make it worth a watch (possibly on DVD rather than cinema) but the screenplay which is a hotch potch of everything from Demolition Man to Star Trek: Next Generation Episodes leaves you feeling empty and way less than satisfied. I had the constant feeling it could have done with a different, perhaps unknown cast, and much more subtle story telling rather than the 'fast food' style of plot.

		<shortDescription>Unconvincing script and casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is based on an Isaac Asimov story and from what I have heard Asimov would have been furious with this bad Hollywood rendition which serves nothing except to try and make money. Story takes place in 2035 Chicago where robots are used by most people as servants and workers and after the suspicious death of Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) who is the creator of robotics a Chicago cop thinks that it may be homicide. Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) hates robots and doesn't trust them which puts him at odds with his superiors but while investigating Dr. Lanning's lab he runs into a robot named Sonny who acts suspicious and tries to run off. Helping Spooner is Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) who works for the same company that makes robots and her job is to make them more human like although she appears to be very cold in nature.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Sonny is let go by the police but Spooner keeps investigating and discovers that a robot revolution is about to take place and it's masterminded by a robotic power source that functions like the main brain for all working robots. This film is directed by Alex Proyas who also made the incredibly underrated "Dark City" and he does have a good vision as far as what these futuristic films should look like but the script is really nothing more than a bunch of action scenes set-up for Will Smith to act heroic. Although many will probably disagree with me I never thought Smith was credible playing a cop in any film and I base that on his persona as a loudmouth that talks a lot but doesn't listen. It's supposed to be 2035 and everyone has modern devices but Smith's character seems to have been plucked out of modern times and placed into the future. From his smart alecky street attitude to the goofy clothes he wears Smith is totally out of place in this science fiction film. I understand he's gold at the box office and shallow viewers expect him to play the same character in every film but he's just obnoxious and annoying here. At one point he barges into the home of Moynahan and pours himself a drink and plops down on a chair making himself at home which infuriates her and than asks her why she would get along with robots better than humans. After two minutes of watching his behavior and listening to his crappy attitude I think everyone would prefer the company of a robot over him! The dialogue is especially bad and twice during the film the phrase "Your the dumbest of the dumb" is uttered. Isaac Asimov is a great writer and his stories are timeless but even though the potential for some truly classic films could be made they never will be as long as Hollywood keeps looking at them with dollar signs in their eyes and miscasting big name actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Constrained as this movie is by the parameters of the high action cgi antics expected by moronic male adolescents with the attention span of fruit flys who form the main target market for Summertime blockbusters, this one was actually not bad.Good source material of course; and unlike many who have contributed a comment, I thought the movie very true to Asimov's vision, even if not following exactly one of his stories. The dilemma and consequence of robot/human interaction is very well explored and will take me back to the stories; stories I have not read in nearly forty years.And of course Will Smith was excellent. Will Smith is an intelligent adult man, and in this movie he is playing an intelligent adult man, something so rare in these sci-fi blockbusters as to require being favourably commented upon.Incidentally, just a small point, but one that does bug me a bit. "I Robot" is not really a book. It is a compendium of short stories written over several years; so to say that the movie "does not follow the book" is a bit ludicrous. I am probably completely wrong here, but it would not surprise me if the title wasn't originally even Asimov's, but rather a name suggested by an Editor at his Publishers.</fullReview>

Luckily this was the only movie running at the only time I had to see one, and overall I really loved it!! Will Smith plays Detective Spooner, a guy who's past affects his judgement about the present and the future, in particular robots. When a scientist appears to have committed suicide, he begins to uncover something more serious going on with the robots and the ppl around him. Bridget Moynahan plays Dr Susan Calvin, a psychiatrist who hides behind big words and robots to prevent her emotions being let out. Once Susan meets Det Spooner, she's not intrigued by him but the mystery in general. I loved the robot Sonny, if only we could really only someone like him :)I give this movie an 8/10 and recommend this to any sci-fi fans out there</fullReview>

The movie is OK as a technothriller, but if the producers could have produced the original, it would have had to have been better. I think Asimov's estate should never have given permission to use the title without more control of the script. I was anticipating the world described in the novel and the challenges faced by the protagonists. I was particularly wondering how they would portray R. Daneel Olivaw...the central character of the novel. Oh well, a fun movie, but a significant bait and switch for the real Asimov fans.</fullReview>

In a nutshell, it's worth the ticket money, but don't expect much... You'll be disappointed by the background info about the characters (look out for why Spooner hates robots so much!

The plot is logical and well sewn up, and the climactic scenes were particularly satisfying. Will Smith is fun to watch as usual, and Moynahan fills her role well. You end up rooting for the robot too.This role is familiar ground for Smith, and uses the standard movie coincidence (his brilliant scientist partner in USR just happens to be female and attractive and sympathetic to his cause) to create a love interest. It ends on an enigmatic note, which I like. For me, the enigmatic ending was the best part of Chronicles of Riddick.</fullReview>

Some nice special effects, definitely watchable only on big screen. I'd say it has unused potential,there is just not enough surprising plot twists, everything already been done before... Robots look like Star Wars characters.The idea of killing US Robotics top guy is unclear, looks like he suddenly had an attack of conscience, while during the whole thing he was displayed as cold blooded businessman, who didn't care about anything but his profits. The idea of the girl being the robot creator's daughter was not explored enough. The directors just haven't done much with it. However, regardless the recycled plot, the directing of screenplay looks solid for the most parts of the whole thing. That, combined with the fact Will Smith can make a bad movie look decent,and a decent movie look good - makes it a 7. Hopefully, the story can be continued, there is some obvious potential in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very apprehensive about seeing this, given Hollywood's track record of totally cheapening, trivialising and ruining great books (with a few notable exceptions). I was right. Once again, nuance of plot, and indeed plot itself is cheerfully thrown out of the window to make yet another soddin' action movie. This in itself wouldn't be so bad if it had resulted in at least a halfway watchable movie, but this film is just pathetic; no dialogue that was worth the name, characterisations that were at best two dimensional, and the all too common reliance on special effects and loud noises to fill in the gaps. It was a total waste of time and money, both mine and the studio's.Now, if only someone with the ability to understand an author's intention had made this movie, it could possibly have satisfied both Asimov appreciators *and* brain-dead action fans. Sigh. Another lost opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Chicago in 2035; someone who stands out physically from the crowd is running with a woman's handbag; a policeman assumes robbery and gives chase, only to find that the robot was simply collecting the bag for an asthmatic woman. It seems that prejudice (and allergy) is still prevalent in the future and you'd expect the cop to know better because he's black. But since this is Will Smith in his traditional summer blockbuster, we know that somewhere down the line he's going to be able to tell us "I told you so" and that - like "Blade Runner" and "Robocop" - a wicked corporation will be at the centre of the conspiracy."I, Robot" is billed as "inspired" by the nine stories of Isaac Asimov published in 1950, so we have the spirit but none of the narrative of Asimov's seminal work. In truth, the central theme of 'machines try to take over the world' is now rather hackneyed, done much better in "Blade Runner", more recently in "The Matrix" trilogy, and to death in the "Terminator" series. What makes this film a little different are the stars and the special effects, welded together effectively by director Alex Pryas. A beefed-up and charismatic Will Smith shows that he can act and former model Bridget Moynahan demonstrates the potential that Sandra Bullock exhibited in "Demolition Man", while the CGI-generated robots look good, especially when set out in endless serried ranks in the manufacturing plant or when represented by the spirited android Sonny (Alan Tudyk).Ultimately what prevents "I, Robot" rising above the entertaining, but formulaic and unmemorable, is the lack of originality, a stronger script, and deeper characterisation - the failures of most movies - and I hope that the timid ending is not setting us up for a sequel of robot wars. It could have been so much cleverer, especially if the script had picked up on the ambiguity that the robot-hating detective is part-android himself.</fullReview>

If you read the book, as I have, you might be disappointed because the movie only touches on parts of the book that have Susan Calvin and a major character.The use of the cast is pretty minimal, the story follows totally around Will Smith, the supporting characters are pretty useless aside from Sonny the robot.Its a typical Will Smith saves the world movie. Will Smith has problem due to past occurrence, no one believes him, world-wide crisis, solution. Thats how the movie goes, lucky for the viewer, the movie is not slow at all, After the first 10 minutes of advertising (not the previews, the movies first ten minutes is a big commercial), the movie starts and is enjoyable.What could have made the movie better was more a more in-depth look into what Asimov created, rather than a bastardized version that appeals to a more uneducated audience. They could have gone A Clockwork Orange with this one and done something really interesting, but instead they went for the summer blockbuster.Less than solid acting, More than solid visuals, An O.K story line makes an OK movie. Go for a matinée or on cheapie tuesday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film a week ago, quite liked it and then read the reviews on here. After seeing so many negative reviews, I went back today and saw it again, for my own curiosity, bearing in mind the things people had mentioned.Forget the Asimov source for a minute and imagine it as a story in its own right. It's quite good, really. Will Smith is Will Smith as usual, but that fits in neatly with the film and isn't a problem. We know he can act when he needs to, but he doesn't really do much of it here.Seeing the film and criticising it for not being like the I, Robot you read as a child is missing the point. And as other people have said, there's an awful lot of little Asimovisms in this movie.Obvious similarities are drawn to films like MINORITY REPORT (the cars, the casual technology) and INDEPENDENCE DAY (um, it's got Will Smith in it) but they're irrelevant. And to any recent "feel-good" film about racial equality. Which is what most of the story's about really. I've noticed other comments mentioning that you don't notice that for most of the time, the cast on screen is black or a robot... well, you don't, but isn't that the way it should be? People playing people...There are no real surprises, everything plods away, but it's a satisfactory film. It's not too marred by Hollywood's normal "You've got mail!" ideas of what technology will look like in a few years time. The robots, for the most part, put the CG effects in other current films to shame. Completely. They're really very good. You can forget you're watching a special effect.The demolition scene was silly, and the car chase scene was a bit of a waste of time, and featured the only couple of moments where I would criticise the special effects. Took me out of the film for a moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent special effects, shame about the originality....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is well-directed and the leads do a solid job. The action is well done and the multiple robot scenes are excellent, with some of the best CGI around. I have no doubt that if you want a good popcorn film then this will entertain. However don't expect it to stand up to repeat viewings. The director Alex Proyas's previous film Dark City bristled with malevolent menace but here we seem to be stuck in the glossy technophile's future of Minority Report and Demolition Man. It is Asimov condensed, processed and made digestible. You will be left with a nagging sense of deja vu if you have seen Blade Runner, the Terminator Series, the Animatrix or even the soulless A.I. Indeed, the ethical questions concerning consciousness and the soul are so well simplified, it is a wonder we ask what the meaning of life is in the first place. The film addresses these questions but its sanitised delivery evades the darker consequences of progress, seen in other films, and substitutes it for a schmaltzy friends will out message.Anyhoo, in short, good action but ultimately a disappointingly tame addition to the robot canon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I, Robot does make you think. Yet such thoughts are superficial in what is, at its heart, a mostly mindless action film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: *** (out of *****)1. A robot may not harm a human or, by inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law. ? Isaac Asimov's three laws of roboticsIt is certainly not possible for robots to violate the above three laws, especially in 2035, where robots that look a little bit like C-3POs perform many of the day-to-day jobs of humans. Or is it? Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) certainly doubts it, as he believes that one of these robots may have been responsible for the death of Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), thus "breaking the rules". No one shares his belief until one of the robots, known only as Sonny (Alan Tudyk) is spotted behaving rather unusually. With the aid of Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), Spooner sets out to get to the bottom of a situation that could be something more serious.I, Robot, based very loosely on the series of short stories by Isaac Asimov, can be thought of as the first of the Minority Report wannabes that falls a little short of its goal. Not that Spielberg's film was perfect ? it didn't totally realize its potential and it had its share of contrivances ? but it made you think whilst simultaneously entertaining on many levels. I, Robot focuses far more on pumping the adrenaline, with only a few issues bubbling on the surface. The really important issues, like the rise in unemployment due to the creation of the robots, are sidestepped in favour of more generic ones like technology obeying its own rules. Even then, such issues are only brushed on, for director Alex Proyas doesn't want the message getting in the way of our popcorn at the end of the day. And all credit to Proyas here, for he certainly had me entertained when it came to the action. Some of the set pieces, including the denouement and a car chase in a tunnel, were very memorable, although it's needless to say that Proyas was not short on "Vorsprung Durch Technik" for the film's top action set-piece, in more ways than one. Like Spielberg, Kubrick and Ridley Scott before him, Proyas uses brand names to make his setting familiar to us. But whereas Spielberg and Kubrick had alternate (and legitimate) uses for their names, having the likes of JVC and Converse rammed down our throats in the opening scenes of I, Robot is more of an irritation. (The cheap Converse gag really will make you cringe.) Proyas's 2035, while quite pleasing to the eye, comes across as inconsistent and derivative. I expected more from him, especially after hearing about the acclaim that he had received for his vision in Dark City.In truth, I, Robot seems pretty derivative in general. Of course, it is possible to create a slick pastiche, but Proyas is neither Tarantino nor Spielberg. His characters are mildly interesting, but nothing more. They haven't much heart, and thus don't demand much from the actors. Sometimes Will Smith is really good, and on other occasions seems to be on autopilot, just replaying his typical screen personality. It doesn't help that a few of his one-liners feel jarringly out-of-place. The way Bridget Moynahan delivers her lines in front of Sonny makes you wonder whose character is more robotic, although, to be fair, her Susan becomes slightly more human as the film goes on. It's somehow ironic that the one actor who will leave this film with his reputation enhanced ? Alan Tudyk ? is playing a robot. He lends Sonny a respectable element of realistic humanity, without tempting sentimentality like A.I.'s David.I, Robot is not a failure at all. In fact, it's a very watchable little package, salvaged by its entertaining action scenes and an interesting premise. One that could have been used for a really thoughtful combination of drama and action. But no, the filmmakers chose to go for all-out modern action, Matrix-style, with a bit of Robocop, The Terminator, A.I. and another aforementioned sci-fi film thrown in. Suddenly, and sadly, film critic Jeffrey Overstreet's suggestion that the film could have been titled "I, Rehash" seems all too apt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What impressed me about the movie (and I won't regurgitate the story, because I think you all know it by now) was that it was *not* based on Asimov's work. It would have been more effective, I think, if it had not used his universe for the story but the story itself was very good. In fact, the weak point was the inclusion of the three laws. The three laws made the story impossible if you think about it.That aside, the movie was beautifully shot, the effects were extremely well done and "bullet time" was used effectively *to show us what happened* not only because it's a cool effect. Now, some of the impossible crane shots in the final fight scenes were very cool, but made me just a teeny bit nauseous. No doubt this movie is worth the cost of admission, I'd recommend it to anyone. I think the ladies will appreciate Mr. Smith, who certainly doesn't seem to be ashamed of his physique, and the guys will love the cool robots and all the action, there certainly is plenty. For us cerebral movie-goers, some suspension of disbelief is required but not so much that the movie can't be enjoyed fully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith is the new Bruce Willis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**With his tight vest, his macho wounds and his pithy one liners. Am I the only one who sees this? I, Robot probably horrified all the die hard Asimov fans out there. It takes Asimov's ideas and turns them into two hours of action and explosions with very little soul, and not a shred of originality. It's funny how, in films set in the future, there's always a character who has a fondness for retro style. Could it be that there would be no opportunity for product placement otherwise?IR was an enjoyable couple of hours of escapism. It had moments when it tried to be serious - some interesting soliloquies on what constitutes life and the nature of free will. However, it mostly settled for Will Smith blowing things up. Which he does do extraordinarily well. His supporting cast were a little lame, but really, the stars were the robots. With more than a nod to the Matrix, the robots were alternately sinister and endearing. Smith's character was every bit as 2D as his mechanical counterparts, despite some real effort on his part. Unfortunately the tone of the movie was such that any efforts at emotion just played out rather badly - including his tortured explanation of just why he hated the robots so much. Like so many of the big summer blockbusters, I, Robot had all the right ingredients, it just failed to deliver. It could have been a clever coherent nod to the events later portrayed in sci fi classics like Bladerunner and the Matrix. Instead it's just more mindless popcorn. Save the money from your cinema ticket and pick up a copy of Bladerunner instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only truly realized how much I enjoyed this film at the end, when it occurred to me that at no point did I try and work out what the twist was going to be. During other films I am always looking for what the twist might be and seeing at the end if I was right. In I, Robot I didn't have time to stop and think about it, I was far too engrossed by the story and action to care!Will Smith is the coolest man on the planet! He should stay away from biopics like Ali and stick to what he is better than anyone else at, being cool.The special effects were a bit dodgy at times but mostly were superb, delivering a very beautiful (and almost believable) view of the future. The action sequences were directed perfectly (except maybe when there was a little too much camera swoooshing).The real appeal of I, Robot however was the story. I have not read Isaac Asimov's original short story and therefore I don't care how close to it the movie was. I enjoyed it because it was very intelligent and actually quite original which is rare these days.Maybe on second viewing my opinion will change and maybe the impact won't be as great on DVD but for now I am happy that I have seen the best action movie this summer so far.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, Robot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING "I, Robot", the new nonsense-fest from Will Smith, is directed by the goon who brought you "Dark City". Ah yes, "Dark City", that unbelievably stupid wallow in "noir" cliches which managed to convince one or two less discerning viewers that it was a masterpiece. For the rest of us it was a pretentious and embarrassing bore. "I, Robot" is better than "Dark City", which is like saying being kicked in the balls is better than being kicked in the balls twice. Will Smith plays a jaded cop who sleeps in his shorts and his hat, and hates robots. But wait - he has a robot arm (surprise!) and he was once saved by a robot, but the robot should have saved the little girl who also needed saving at the same time. Yawn. In the opening scene Mr. Smith runs after a robot who looks like he's stolen a handbag. Guess what? It hasn't stolen it, it's returning it to its rightful owner. Ho ho. Mr. Smith has a fat, grumpy, cigar-chewing boss who says things like "Give me your badge". Yawn. There are various pointless and unnecessary action sequences that defy all belief and common sense. The one where the demolition robot destroys the house is particularly stupid and irrelevant. On the plus side, the special effects are good, and the film is relatively short. The plot, such as it is, is completely insane, even more insane than that mad one in "Minority Report". Scientist finds out that evil computer wants to take over world with robots, so invents tough robot and instructs robot to kill him so as to send warning to cop who hates robots. Did I miss something? And why (WHY?) are all the old robots put in big crates and left in a desert? Why not at least switch them off first? And why am I supposed to be impressed by computer-generated images fighting each other? It's just a jazzy cartoon. That said, I would just like to make one final point: This film is rubbish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen a few trailers for 'I, Robot' I made the informed decision to give it a miss. I was somewhat surprised to find a generally favourable critical response to the film, so decided to give it a chance. I must admit that I wish I'd stuck to my former decision. You need to be seriously into the sci-fi genre (or Will Smith) to really enjoy this film.Set 31 years in the future Chicago seems to have undergone a dramatic change. The city is inundated with robots which make humans more or less redundant. Although these robots are programmed to ensure they can never hurt humans we all know that this is not going to work. It seems that we must have become a much more trusting race during the next 31 years because only Spooner (Smith) seems to question whether the robots can break their 3 rules.The cast do their best, but it's a shame we couldn't lose a bit of Smith in favor of Cromwell. Even though it's got a few moments that will make you squirm a bit it isn't a bad film - it's just very average. 6/10 </fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** Minor Spoilers ***Will Smith play Spooner a cop that investigate an apparent suicide of Dr. Lanning. Spooner is a Robot hater, because of something in his past. He think that a Robot kill Lanning, but no one believes because of three laws. In his investigation he find Sonny a very peculiar Robot. When he find Sonny this robot is a key to uncover a kind of conspiracy.I, Robot is a good movie but i read Asimov since that i have 13 years old and this movie don't fit in Isaac Asimov vision. I all his books was very difficult a robot make some harm to a human being. Normally, when a unusually robot was "create" or discovered is a human that try to make harm. The logical defend by Vikki in this movie was negated by some Asimov books.So this movie is good but only take a few thinks of Asimov ideas and he deserve a movie just like Blade Runner was to Phillip K. Dick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Robot could have easily become a high concept techno-funky bore of a film. Or it could have resorted to being a preachy " End of the World" melodrama.Fortunately, I Robot is neither which makes it an entertaining yet intelligent piece of cinema. The film's presentation of Chicago 2035 is subtle enough to remain humane, yet with enough special effects and mega-sets to create an eye boggling spectacle. Overall, the film is clear and user friendly while dealing with big bad themes of free will, morality, computer/human interaction and consciousness. Will Smith is in fine form in a familiar leading man role in an action flick. The actors in supporting roles also give strong performances, even if the role of Dr Craven seems a bit strained and underwritten. The star of the show is no doubt the title role of the robot, "Sonny", although the extent to which we thank CGI effects or Alan Tudyk for this is uncertain.Only two things irked me: they were too heavy handed with the product placement, and there's an unnecessary nude shower scene involving the doctor. Mind you, we were also offered more than adequate eyeful of Will Smith's more than adequate torso, so maybe that restores the balance.Sure, the special effects are more important to this film than other elements, but the directors of I Robot have the grace to not pretend otherwise. The end result is an enjoyable and engaging film, a complete surprise given the banalities and excesses I was expecting from a film of the sci-fi genre.</fullReview>

I also liked the robots, which can appear human despite their obvious robot look.Apart from that, the film has little to recommend itself. The story is simple like a comic book. Smith plays a fairly unlikable cliché of a detective (the kind we know from hundreds of films by now) among loads of other cliché characters. They add depth to Smith's character by referring to a contrived past incident. We know this from Batman and the lot. We get the odd joke (that doesn't really make you laugh). There is really nothing that would recommend the film apart from the visual aspects.So for that reason, you might want to see it. Apart from that, forget it.</fullReview>

Hard to know, but the fact that the special-FX weren't the whole movie is a big point, and still they managed to make it look very real, something the Bond producers should look for in future films.I think it's more than fair that I start with what I think is the only problem with the story. Same ol' 'save the world, be home for Oprah' attitude, and that can make it a bit boring, if it isn't as well-written as this one was, without doubt.And what surprised me, and the fact that it did surprise me was a surprise itself, was how great Will Smith still is! Since I saw Fresh Prince the first time, I was hit by how good he is in bringing seriousness to comedy. There aren't many who knows how to do that, and I'm sure that has something to do with his popularity. Others who posses that quality is, for instance, Matthew Perry, Eddie Murphy and Bruce Willis.Halfway into a movie is where the rest is decided. Everything but make it look dorky is good! I was anxious, but it worked out and the climax made a great note in the movie history.Go see this one, folks, that's all I can say.</fullReview>

If you can step over that and see the movie for what it is I,robot is a great movie even with some creative aspects.If you cannot it's just an average movie, with thesame loner/cop who hates technology/robots is not believed by his boss/other people (otherwise it would be a short film !). though still a good movie it would never be as new or innovative as 20 some years ago when these rules where just being invented/drawn up. I do however agree that more could have been done to make I,robot really awesome.Will Smith did good in his part as the loner, who played a gritty detective though he is still not as experienced as say Harrison Ford in Blade Runner.people seemingly have a hard time seeing him in a more serious role I suppose.9/10 for the entertainment factor, gorgeous enviroment and If you can overlook the sometimes obvious a great Asimov inspired story.</fullReview>

The story, to tell you the truth, they are rather similar to other fantasy movie such as "Bicentennial Man", so not much different.Why don't the producer show the audience more on how the future looks like in 2035 from items to foods, maybe. The old sci-fi movies could have done better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could have been worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it is not exactly a great movie, though I like the main idea of the screenplay (which comes from the science fiction stories by Isaac Assimov): the nature of artificial intelligence, the natural apparition of "feelings" and something we could call a "soul" as a logical consequence of complexity.Wil Smith is a real problem in this movie: even if he does not act very badly, his role is not really believable. Also, I found there were too many exploding robots; this kind of Alien-II-like inflation does not improve the movie neither; it becomes boring after a while. So, the movie is an average action movie based on a really interesting story. It could have been worse, but it also could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The visuals are excellent, with old and new robots clearly distinct. It does pick up themes which Asimov explored, even though the specific explanation is a new variant.I was glad to see Dr Susan Calvin left pretty much as Asimov conceived her. Though this may be because there is a segment of the audience that would object to anything overtly sexual between a black man and a white woman. As it is, the hostility of some reviewers is hard to understand unless they are upset by the overturning of racial hierarchies.I am glad to see it doing well, and hope that more of Asimov's work gets Hollywooded. What about The Currents Of Space, say?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughably unsuitable character for Will Smith. Fake &amp; lame, but adequate TV-level entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith got an unfortunate rep a few years back as the "King of Summer Blockbusters," or the "King of July," or some such. It was entirely coincidental to his adequate talent that the summer release movies he was in happened to be blockbusters, and happened to make a ton of money. "Independence Day" and "Men in Black" were great, and loads of fun. Let's be honest, though--- they would have worked equally well with or without Will Smith. That's not to say he isn't charming. He does, indeed, have a kind of talent. But to saddle him, at that time a green and novice actor, with somehow having the "magic touch" turning ordinary fare into blockbuster magic was unfair. It raised the expectations of his abilities far beyond reality, and far beyond his ability to actually deliver."I, Robot" is just OK. The robots and the general sci-fi environment were, at all, times, laden with the paper-thin, two-dimensional vibe of a dim CARTOON!!! There were a few bright spots, such as the tunnel scene where the giant robot-hauling vans overtook Smith's cartoonmobile. But his acting job here, trying in vain to capture the cliche of the ironic, world-weary, been-everywhere, seen-it-all street cop, was so fake and unsuited to Smith that it was almost entertaining for its laughability.So, see "I, Robot," if at all, with a attitude expecting light, superficial, quickly forgettable "TV" quality fare. I gave it 5 out of 10, and that was fair and generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given that the film is based on one of the major classics of science fiction literature, it perhaps needed a director who had more major achievement under his belt than The Crow (also by Alex Proyas). I, Robot is not as bad as it could have been: it is reasonable sci-fi fodder for the fans, but it lacks the intellectual ingenuity and artistic precision of Bladerunner, the vision of A.I., the cult status of The Matrix, or the originality of delivery of, say, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It has that money-spinning manufactured feel to it, the sort of thing you would expect from a former director of music videos (which Proyas is). There is enough substance there to keep the faithful glued but otherwise little distinguishing features. The story might have been a masterpiece - the film is very derivative and little more than a Saturday night entertainment feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is a great sci-fi action film with slight comedy bits in, set in the too-near future (I doubt we'll be able to create full AI and integrate robots into society in 30 years). It details how careful we would have to be if robots with AI (if it every happens) are integrated into society - if they deem the best way of saving us is to subjugate many humans, then we'll be in real trouble.Camera work for the most part is great, however, where the shaky-cam is used, the picture looks too blurred and out of place.The special effects are great - animation of the robot types is clever, as is the battle underground between Spooner and the robot deliver vechiles.Music is rather poor - a nice sci-fi tune during the beginning title would have been great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not usually a big fan of action movies, but this one definitely gets my vote. Will Smith gave an excellent performance, demonstrating a maturity to his acting that hasn't always been evident in some of his more slapstick action rolls. Furthermore, the graphics were surprisingly subtle for a film of this genre, but as a result perfectly complemented rather than detracted from the acting. In terms of plot there were one or two aspects that seemed slightly questionable, but on the whole these were by no means sufficient to detract from the fact that it was a great script. For all those ladies out there like myself who have to sit through the obligatory guy film with their boyfriend, I'd say take him along to see this one and score a few brownie points whilst actually enjoying yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but could have been a little more intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't too sure about what to expect with this movie. Overall, it wasn't too bad a film in itself. (SOME SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW..)Here are some of my views:The special effects were very effective and enjoyable. The acting was convincing enough overall and the movie moved at a reasonable pace. In it's own right, this for me was an "OK" movie!It started to collapse for me into a run-of-the-mill action flick after the first 20 minutes. Asimov's three laws were well and truly dispensed with within minutes by a simple flick of a switch in the NS5, not by the usual intriguing convolutions employed by the inspired author of "Little Lost Robot". Anyone familiar with Asimov would know that most of his USR&amp;MM books dealt with the pitfalls of the three laws. I can't recall the title, but I remember one of Asimov's books actually dealt quite skillfully with a murder by a robot. Dr. Susan Calvin was not the rather plain, complex woman she is in the books (e.g. read Asimov's "Liar"). Are we too scared to allow characters like this in movies? When Dr. Calvin started firing machine guns it just didn't work for me!!The rampaging robots scene in the tunnel was a little too much! Surely, even with his advantages (see the movie!), Del Spooner would have been wasted by 50+ NS5 robots and two very large intelligent transporters intent on killing him!! Same with the final action scene (oh, please!)The film does raise the point about the three laws that is important. Law 1 states that a robot cannot harm a human being, or through inaction, allow a human to come to harm. This would cause a paradox to a robot if the owner was, say, a smoker. Inaction would mean the robot is allowing the human to come to harm by smoking. Action would harm the human by denying a craving. Balance would have to be addressed. Also the perception of what "harm" isThe Spooner/Sarah choice by the NS4 tries to show this paradox and balance method, and the consequences of such choices. One question that should be raised in line with this film is, if we were to create robots to effectively become slaves, why provide them with sentience at all? Surely sentient robots are equivalent to humans, only mechanical, not biological. Built for purpose machines are slaves by design, slaves to their programming, and to their owners. Should they have awareness of self, conscious of anything beyond their design parameters? I'd give the film a 5.5/10. It could have been so much more intelligent, but maybe this would have bored people who don't go to the movies to be thoughtfully provoked. A lot of the action sequences were a little OTT, but the film definitely entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about this film. It is a good action flick, and Will Smith really delivers. It has an interesting story. Close to the original works, or as close as Hollywood likes to get to the original stories on any film. The problem that I have is the lack of reality. I hate it when there is only one person in a movie that seems to know what is really going on. As is the case in I, Robot.People are so trusting of the robots they seem to be as programmed as the robots they own. Will Smith is the only person who takes the time to stop and say "Maybe things aren't what they seem", and of course he has to be over the top about it. He's living in the future(the near future granted),but he seems to be still living in the past. Refusing to give up the the things that are popular today. It really is a walking add for todays little necessities. However, all the mindless Hollywood drivel aside. It still has an interesting story, over the top action scenes(in a good action sort of way), and an ending that both gives you closure and something to think about. I would definitely watch it again, but I wouldn't put it on my favorites list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, Robot has a nice blend of thought-provoking story, dazzling CGI effects, credible acting, and riveting action scenes to make it a thoroughly enjoyable movie. Will Smith plays a policeman in 2035 fearing man's dependency on robots in everyday life. A mystery arises when a leading robot creator is found dead and a new shipment of state-of-the-art robots are about to hit the market place. The film has all the big budget things one would expect: Will Smith finding ample opportunity to take his shirt off, Bridget Moynahan taking a shower, repeated use of commercial tie-ins(I was SO tired of the Converse crap!), highly charged action sequences, and epic-like special effects. Much of this worked; however, for I, Robot is really a story-driven vehicle. Based on Issac Asimov's classic sci-fi novel, the film ultimately addresses concerns that may indeed become very real in the future regarding man's relationship with machine. The film is definitely well-crafted and much of the credit goes to director Alex Proyas for giving his audience a little credit for being intelligent. Will Smith makes, if nothing else, an affable hero. James Cromwell has a brief yet vital role in the film. The robots are center stage and Sonny, a wayward robot, steals all of his scenes. I really like I, Robot for its entertainment value.</fullReview>

But I can truly say that I had a great time watching this film, it had action, humour, suspense, intrigue and emotional issues, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Will Smith took on his role with his usual calibre, and created a great character for us to be involved with. The special effects were a big part of the film of course, but didn't override the idea behind the story. To me, it was money well spent, and I would recommend this film for anyone wanting to spend an enjoyable couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CGI takes over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Suggested" is still rather euphoric! Besides the three laws, two characters and a company name there is very little resemblance with the collection of short stories of Isaac Asimov, called "I, Robot". At Amazon you can even order a "film tie in" with movie poster cover and credits on the back. This work is Asimov's original book, though. No connection with the movie whatsoever!Having said this, I think "I, Robot" is still an admirable movie. It allows many afterthoughts, it provokes to be reconsidered again and again. Del Spooner's fundamental racism against robots for instance. Or Susan Calvin's love for them, though barely suggested in this film. The change of mutual oppression from both robots and humans of course gives a link to a possible sequel, but that would have to be an action movie, too, I am afraid.I guess the main reason why this movie differs so much form Asimov's original work is that it had to be an action movie. The exploration of the robot's psyche, the admiration of their illogic and sometimes inventive rationalism is not a concern of this movie. That would be portrayed much better in "Bicentennial Man" with Robin Williams. Still as an action movie, "I, Robot" features surprisingly few explosions and dead bodies. And that might be the charm of it. It relies very much on dialog and suspense, but still neither the movie nor Will Smith is exactly Shakespeare material. One of the main motive for this movie might after all have been the display of robots.Obviously masses of robots, robot face features etc. are computer animated with CGI. Unfortunately CGI seems to take over the movie ? an interesting parable by the way. Many scenes or parts of them are so ostensibly computer generated that you feel transferred into a video game. The design and view of many scenes is totally surrealistic and a hard break opposite to the "real" movie scenes. Even worse, the clouds of flame in a central action sequence seem to be nothing more than sprites laid over an static background like in a cheap CDI game. That was very disappointing. We have seen some pretty impressive CGI works, but I think just from the image, the feel of it and the ambiance "Independence Day" looked much more believable than this movie. What has become of miniature models, makeup artists and so on? Complete CGI might work for Monsters Inc. or Shrek, but it totally fails for a "real life" movie. If I would have like to watch a video game, I would have visited a "Final Fantasy" presentation.In the end, "I, Robot" was an entertaining movie with something to think about. I would have preferred it to be much more homogeneous with smoother CGI effects. Probably less of an action movie. But then again, this might have not been a movie a large crowd would have liked to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as summer blockbusters go, I,Robot delivers in spades. Charismatic hero? Check. Seamless CGI? Check. Superb action? Check. Plot? Check. Granted, Will Smith's career needed a hit but this is it. He is not in Bad Boys/ID4 wisecracking mode and his tone does not take away from the brain that this blockbuster is desperately trying to express.The film is based on Sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov's story set in Chicago in the year 2035 when robots have been fully integrated into society, occupying the positions of trusted servant and menial worker. There are 3 laws of robotics that are 'perfect' in that robots may not allow a human to come to harm. However, when a top scientist from the US Robotics corporation turns up dead, Smith's character suspects the involvement of a prototype that may not be bound by the 3laws If you want to be thoroughly entertained whilst still enthralled for 2 hours go see the 2nd best film of the summer after Spideman2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summer SciFi fun, but where's Asimov's genius?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have loved reading and watching Science Fiction books and movies all of my life and feel that Isaac Asimov's works stand shoulder to shoulder with the best of the early Grand Masters like Robert Heinlen, Damon Knight, Ray Bradbury, James Blish, and Arthur C. Clark, to name a few.So take it from me, if you want to see a very entertaining Sci-Fi movie with the great Will Smith and state-of-the-art special effects by all means see "I, Robot", just don't expect a story by Isaac Asimov.While this story written by screenwriter Jeff Vintar merits a rating of "very entertaining", Asimov's Robot Series merits a rating of "Must Read Classic Collection". Asimov's Robot books are emotionally compelling, contain novel twists, and are difficult to put down. These books have so much to offer, it's a shame that Vintar only took from the books the names of a few characters and the "Three Robot Laws".It seems that Vintar only put the "Three Robot Laws" into the movie so he could immediately break them with impunity. Asimov didn't break the "Three Robot Laws" because that was the cheap and easy way to make the story work. One of chief reasons the Robot books are so thought provoking is because the stories had to work without such cheating.Make sure you see the movie, but then make sure you read the Robot books. You'll find out how much gold this movie left unmined.</fullReview>

Beautiful CG work and some very clever camera work make this film very pleasing to the eye.

		<fullReview>*Spoilers Ahead* basically one of the worst adaptations of a great classical science fiction novel that I have ever seen. All we are given nothing of substance just a bunch of predictable action sequences that just tumble over each other one by one. Will Smith plays Detective Del Spooner convinced that there is an immediate threat from the growing population of robots that have become an integral part of human society and industry. There wasn't enough play up between human society versus robot society. The whole notion boils down to the basic line of the title of the film and the novel "I, Robot", the acknowledgment that a robot understands its own identity. That is one of the defining facts that separates us from other mammals other then the fact that we have pose able thumbs. I really had a hard time watching this film because I knew that there was so much potential that was wasted on overblown special effects. The only thing of substance of in the entire of film is the storyline of Sonny and The murdered scientist Dr. Alfred Lanning played very well by James Cromwell. A very well done angle and the only thing in the film that i found interesting whatsoever. I feel sorry for James Cromwell, always playing fallen executives, military personal who ends his life to reveal the evildoing that is going on behind closed doors. But for the notion of Popcorn fun, you will certainly be given your daily fill but it certainly left a bad taste in my mouth........4/10 for me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A kinder, gentler version of The Terminator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the same principles (man vs. unpredictable machine) from The Terminator series is used in I, Robot, so a comparison is inevitable, and I, Robot isn't as hard hitting. Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan make decent leads; Smith gets his vanity shots in (flexing as he gets out of bed, throwing in some "aw, hell naw"'s along the way) and Moynahan plays the beautiful scientist role that practically any just-over 30 ex-model could have played. Smith shows more range than normal, though, playing Det. Del Spooner as a guy so obsessed with his job that not much else matters, even though he loves his grandma and watches out for some little street punk (Shia LeBeouf). The premise is basically the same as The Terminator's, just that in this version, someone smells something wrong before Judgement Day. The head renegade robot sounds like David Hyde Pierce, which is hardly a replacement for Schwarzenegger or even Robert Patrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining if somewhat predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ignored the warning that I'd hate the film if I were a Asimov fan. Good thing, too - since I did enjoy the film. I'm trying to avoid spoilers...First the good - the computer generated images and characters were mostly very well done. With minor exceptions the CG nature did not intrude noticeably. Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan are believable in their parts. The editing and cinematography are well done. As an action film the script was acceptable.Now the bad - the villain was way too easy to identify far too early in the movie. I don't think Will Smith turns in his best performance here - he could have done better, and some scenes seem designed only in order to show off his Ali movie physique and didn't add any value to this motion picture. Bridget Moynahan played a Susan Calvin too mild and pretty to be credible as the hard edged robot-psychologist of Asimov's stories. The "evil" robot army is too over the top. The script needed more polish, a more credible reason for Spooner to hate robots, and less dependence on plot contrivances to solve dilemmas.Overall, though, the mixture actually weighs in more to the good than the bad (despite the number of words in my analysis of the two aspects) - especially if you remember this is an action flick and not really a Dr. Asimov style robot mystery story. I'd say it manages 7 / 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still fairly true to Dr. Asimov's ideals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, the movie has been in theaters for three weeks and I just now got around to seeing it. But I was much more favorably impressed than I expected to be. The bit that really impressed me was that the writing was tight - I would even say spare. Dr. Isaac Asimov was well known for concise, undecorative prose, with a sharp sense of humor. I always enjoyed reading his novels because he delivered excellent build-ups to logical (though often surprising) conclusions, and he got you there quickly with a minimum of meaningless bits of frou-frou. This movie does the same thing. The only thing I would have left out was the cat. ("I'm sorry, you're a cat, I'm black, it'll never work" - what the heck was that supposed to mean?)Will Smith does his usual kick-butt summer-blockbuster star turn. Bridget Moynahan does a respectable job with the very difficult role of Dr. Susan Calvin - the deepest and most complex female character Asimov ever invented.Alan Tudyk must have really enjoyed playing a CGI character, it may have been the best role he's ever had - I'm glad to see him (excuse me, hear him) without any silly accent - and he put a lot of meat onto the dense-alloy bones of Sonny the robot. For those concerned with "family" issues: the shower scenes are handled with excellent circumspection. If you are totally against ever having your under-14 children exposed to an image of a naked human body, you shouldn't bring your kids, but believe me - Smith poses like a Rodin sculpture. Other than this and some mild cussing, such as every kid will hear in any school, I'd say this movie should meet most family standards. My 12-year-old was not embarrassed or uncomfortable at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I, Fresh Prince</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot finds Will Smith in unfamiliar territory - a movie with a hint of intelligence. Based very loosely on Isaac Asimov's robot stories, using the "3 Laws" as a launching point, the picture is set just 35 years after the Willenium, in 2035 Chicago. Apparently, I, Robot feels you did not see enough advertising before the start of the movie, as straight away, you'll be inundated with ads for a sneaker company, a parcel delivery service, and by the time you leave the theater, you'll have a strange notion that you really need an Audi. Audi is good... Audi is your friend... Audi will not harm you...You'll also notice a couple things right off the bat about the future. One is that transportation and robot technology will make incredible leaps and bounds over the next 31 years, to the point where Chicago has a whole underground autobahn for maglev-type vehicles. Wow, who ironed out that bureaucracy? My local government is going to take over a decade to build a 15-mile beltway that's above ground, made out of plain old concrete, and will only accommodate regular gas-powered cars. The underground roadway of I, Robot even comes with its own automated valet, which files your car away vertically in a specially made "parking lot". Pretty cool, and a small price to pay for having to learn to own a car without loose items inside. The other thing you'll notice is that people of the future are awfully trusting of robotic technology. They absolutely refuse to believe that robots can glitch. Then again, Microsoft's logo is nowhere to be found in the picture, so that might make some sense. This lack of technophobia is explained shortly, when Detective Spooner (Will Smith) meets Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) during an investigation of a fishy looking suicide involving robot engineering genius Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell) in his office at US Robotics, a company which has gone from making modems in the 20th century to robots in the 21st (What foresight!). Dr. Calvin's job is to make these creepy and potentially dangerous robots appear human and trustworthy, a lot like how a government neuters its constitution by cratering the 1st and 4th amendments and makes it all seem friendly and beneficial by calling it the "Patriot Act". Anyway, Dr. Calvin has a doubter on her hands with Det. Spooner. He hates robots. At first, it seems it's just because he's old fashioned. He owns a gas-powered motorbike, listens to Stevie Wonder tunes from 65 years ago, prefers to drive his maglev using the steering wheel, and still struts around in that gangsta-rapper swagger that went out of fashion way back in the year 2004. He's so old school, he even showers without a curtain. However, you will eventually learn he has another reason for hating robots during a plot contrivance midway through the film, shortly after another plot contrivance that reveals his bionic arm.Spooner suspects a model in the latest line of robots is behind the good doctor's death, but has no real evidence and is hampered by the unrelenting faith of the robot believers, even after a glitch in the building's security system, named NIKI (Shodan, from System Shock) blots out the critical moment from the surveillance tapes. This is where Spooner's investigation begins, and after a couple requisite cop-movie clichés (case obsession, booted from force), he uncovers a conspiracy involving a robot revolution, stemming from an over-translation of the 3 Robotic Laws. Somebody should have told Will Smith this wasn't Men in Black III, as his wisecracking persona that we've seen a hundred times already is really out of place here. And those 'hero leaps'? Where the hero hurtles himself through the air in slow-motion while pulling off some inhuman feat (usually involving firearms)? Yep, sadly, a couple of those are in there as well, making one suspect that John Woo has hijacked the production. We also get to see yet another example of 2004's favorite cinematic chestnut, the CGI army, topped off by a scene where hundreds of robots scale the side of a skyscraper. Aside from that, the CGI is actually very good. There's also a faint attempt in the story to determine what constitutes the line between artificial life and real life, but fortunately, the filmmakers realized this was ground trod plenty enough times by Star Trek alone and let it drop.On the plus side, I, Robot has plenty of action and unlike many of today's movies, has a keen sense of rhythm about it, and in spite of a few too many shopworn story devices, this movie still has a surprise or two and doesn't take 2 and a half hours to get it out. While it first appears to be an anti-technology film, this isn't so much the case as a warning for checks and balances in safety/prevention devices, no matter how simple and self-maintaining they may appear to be. It's not often a modern Hollywood film - a sci-fi actioner, no less - actually has something to say about our current state of affairs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good sci-fi mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "I, Robot", tells the story of a cop (Will Smith) in the not-too-distant future. A top robotic scientist commits suicide, and Smith's character is called upon to investigate. Being anti-robot himself, he soon discovers all is not well with the peacefully-programmed androids.This is a very good sci-fi film. It has a lot of action, special effects, and even a small handful of social commentaries. The filmmakers have learned well from the experiences creating Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, using the same techniques to infuse the robots with fluidity, interest, and, in one important case, emotion.The film is excellently paced, and (surprise!) comes in at under two hours, a rarity in this era of overblown filmmaking (not every film needs to be an epic).Will Smith, as usual, excels in this type of role. He makes this film, and for the most part the director smartly focuses on him and his performance. Many leading male actors are way to full of themselves, turning their parts into endless ego trips. Although Smith does throw in a couple of cute catchphrases, by and large he excels yet is still human in this role.I give this a film 8 out of 10. There is one highly implausible, and therefore comical, car chase sequence; and there is a character of a teenager that really makes no sense and is more of a distraction than anything. Plus the denouement is well intentioned but in the end muddy.Otherwise, it's a very good sci-fi film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good enjoyable action movie but nothing more, less witty than the adapted books of Asimov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by the science fiction Robot short stories and novels of Isaac Asimov, the film I Robot is not an adaptation of a particular one. Instead, as shown by the credits at the end, the baseline story was 'suggested' by Isaac Asimov's works. Hence the illustration of the Three Laws of Robotic, mainly the first (a robot can't harm a human) and how it could be bypassed, are a pretext for another summer Hollywood blockbuster. Not a bad one in fact, but not a particular inspired one altogether. As in Asimov works, the film is a detective story but turned here into action packed thriller movie. So we get the standard auto chases, cliff hangers and fights.The special effects are good, especially the computer-generated robots but the vision of the future, in 2035, is just an extrapolation of our own. Neither it has the power displayed in the eighties 'Blade Runner', nor the originality of Alex Proyas previous work 'Dark City'. Moreover Asimov was generally more confident with ideas of intelligent robots working in our daily surroundings. Contrary to the movie, (SPOILERS) no hostile swarms of robots could be seen in his books.As often, in science fiction films the best elements stem from the adapted books and stories, written in a more witty way than the script.I would not like to seem to despise the film, a quite enjoyable one with very acceptable storyline for an action movie, good performance by Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan though the other main character 'Sonny' the robot feels more touching. I notice that it is common in science fiction movie or TV shows, that the alien or robot characters feels more moving than the real people. Take android Data or Klingon Worf in 'Star Trek Next generation', torn between conflicted aspirations, were livelier than the rest of Enterprise crew, robotic and military. And, as a standard bow to some Hollywood habit, the robotic expert Susan Calvin of the books is turned from a spinster to an attractive, yet stern-looking young woman, played by Bridget Moynahan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so its a blockbuster with a not that original a storyline - so its robots that what to control the world rather than the mad scientist. But this is certainly one of the better blockbusters of this summer because there appears to been an investment in the script!Based on Azimov's stories, its a simple story of a future where the world is moving towards a utopic existence with all the mundane, dirty work being undertaken by robots. But Detective Will Smith just doesn't trust them. Cue things starting to go wrong, the suicide of the genius behind the technology and Will is out to proove what he had felt all along.Technology, road chases, shoot outs are all there, but its an intelligent piece of celluloid that has all the thrills and spills you want from an action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the "sign of trust" setup and payoff. (Wink) It was nice to see an arc of Spooner and Sunny's character in the end.CG wasn't too impressive... Will Smith was decent in performance. So was Moynahan's, and as always Bridget Moynahan remains beautiful. The robots were too robo-ty at times. But I guess hence the title of the movie.I also wasn't really impressed with the John Woo-ish slo mo action scenes; but I've guess I've seen some of those in THE CROW or in DARK CITY. That something to rant about? I'm undecided.Some of the lines tried so hard to be funny; some were kind of on the nose. Was interesting to know how Susan did the old switcheroo and never really "killed" Sunny. Also, I liked Sunny's line "Technically, I was never really alive; but I thank you for your concern".Doesn't really bomb in my book like I expected it would.7/10Grade B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isaac Asimov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Isaac Asimov has been called the Dean of Science Fiction for a simple reason: he IS the best. There has never been, and will never be, one like him.Among his prolific SF work (not to mention the even more prolific non-fiction work on a wide variety of subjects from science, to Shakespeare, to the Bible) the best is the two converging series which started as entirely unrelated stories several decades ago, and came together in one grand finale, in converging plots that developed/evolved through a time span of well over 30 years. The Elijah Bailey series on robot stories (Caves of Steel, Naked Sun, Robots of Dawn, Robot and Empire) and the Foundation series on the Galactic Empire (Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge) converge in the book Foundation and Earth, bringing together this two series of masterful stories which started out totally unrelated (but with suggestive hints that grow stronger as we move along). The movie I Robot, however, originated from a different segment of Asimov's SF work, short stories on the subject of robots. While these short stories are unrelated to the Elijah Bailey stories, the same three laws apply. As well, these shorts stories are all independent, but are loosely linked by the background of U.S. Robots and Susan Calvin. Asimov's ingenious and boundless imagination is richly demonstrated in these short stories, found main in three books, `I Robot', `The rest of the robots' and `The bicentennial man' (title story made into a movie starring Robin Williams). Here are but a few examples:`Robbie' ? a little girl's love for her nursemaid, a non-speaking robot`Runaround' ? a robot `drunk' as a result of an equilibrium between the 2nd and 3rd laws`Reason' ? a robot that believes that he is better than human`Liar' ? a mind-reading robot telling lies to please people`Little lost robot' ? a robot with modified first law and superiority complex`First law' ? a robot with maternal instinct`Let's get together' ? ten Russian robots infiltrating the U.S.`Lenny' ? Susan Calvin's baby robot`That thou art mindful of him' ? robots that consider other robots to be human beings, thereby circumventing the first law`Feminine intuition' ? a female robot with `intuition'NOW TO THE MOVIE ? with SPOILERS !!!Isaac Asimov's books are marvelous to read, but not quite suited to making into movies, because the beauty of these SF work is in the logical reasoning embedded in each story, appealing to the mind rather than the senses. That is why under writing credits, it says `Isaac Asimov (suggested by book)'. The screen script, however, is a nicely done job, taking the backbone ideas from Asimov to build a standard but entertaining Hollywood flick. As usual, the necessary ingredients are taken from proven successes: a six-million- dollar-man arm, John Woo style twin pistol, robot-fu, great CGI, Will Smith comedy etc. The suspense and twists are quite predictable but that doesn't take anything away from the fun.For those interest, here are two more Asimov references.VIKI the computer that tries to control human beings is modeled after Multivac, from the short story `The life and times of Multivac' in the book `The Bicentennial Man'.The zero law that puts `humanity' above human beings is from Robots and Empire, the 4th book in the Elijah Bailey series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heard of Adam Link?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'I, Robot' is a great movie. Alex Proyas has done an amazing job. It cleverly weaves a lot of Asimov's themes, characters and story lines. However, the filmmakers have failed to credit the true origins of the title. Asimov published his 'I, Robot' in 1950 BUT he actually 'borrowed' the title from an author called Eando Binder (a pseudonym for the brothers Earl &amp; Otto Binder) who wrote their story, 'I, Robot' in 1939. It was about a robot called Adam Link who finds himself on trial for the murder of his creator (sound familiar?) Of course he is innocent but the monster that humanity cannot understand must be destroyed. There were many other Adam Link stories but 'I, Robot' seems to have been the most popular. The story was also published in comic form in 'Weird Science Fantasy' (EC Comics - 1955) and was produced for television in an episode of 'The Outer Limits' in 1963. Now the film makers have used this same plot in their movie and yet give no credit to the true originators. Yes, the film deals with Asimov's themes but the main character of Sonny is based on Adam Link, a character that was not created by Asimov at all. It would seem that Asimov has been given full credit simply for publicity reasons. Everyone's heard of him, which gives the film more 'dollar' credibility. Understandable but a bit of a shame, that's all. Still, I really enjoyed the film and everyone involved should be applauded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie review is 97.5% spoiler free !Forgetting for a time that it is [very loosely] based on Asimov's book, and just looking at it as as stand-alone film, I would call it entertaining, but sometimes painfully cheesy/corny/lame.Fortunately the scenes that made you cringe were fairly rare, leaving most of the movie quite interesting.Most of the action sequences were well done, though there were a few that got rather cliched. I already laughed at Vin Diesel flying through the air on a motorcycle guns blazing, I didn't need to see Will Smith repeating this !The special effects, especially the cars and robots, were exceptionally well done. If anyone has seen the music video called "All Is Full Of Love" by Björk, the robots look and move almost exactly like that. Makes me wonder if one of the special effects crew saw that particular music video.There was a good amount of humor that wasn't cheesy, but then there were a few of the scenes between Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan that were just so cliched it made you feel like throwing up.I gave it an IMDB rating of 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The genius that wrote the book of short stories titled "I, Robot" probably wouldn't be tooo upset at this rendition I imagine. But then again, some authors don't like to see their works turn into commercial franchises, but I personally don't know how Asimov felt about that s***. Seeing the movie "I, Robot" only makes me want to read the book more than I did before, read on to see why, really, I'll tell you starting next sentence. I was pleasantly surprised by this Sci-Fi moral action film with all of those facets aforementioned in this sentence. The Sci- Fi part is without question very intriguing and causes me to question how far away we are from that future, or how possible it is now rather. The moral part is good too... once an entity can at last, least emulate, if not imitate human emotional reactions/behaviors than who is to say they are really that different from us... for certainly some humans experience feelings that others never do in their lives, so the question isn't about the drastic range of emotions, but more about a not too simple or complex range that seems to be based on the individuals experience, which I would say in this context is uniquely confining, and so limited by circumstance, not by ability or possibility. This all of course is my opinion and would lead to a very, interesting debate/discussion if only I was talking to somebody, or writing something that another human would actually read... The action part of the movie is definitely satiating to the averaging violent film fanatic, unless you're going for -human- body count. The myriad robot expungings are circuit filled and sweet in most regards. I highly recommend this film to anyone with a human brain for all of the above reasons, if not at least for the single moral aspect of the film.

		<fullReview>The movie stars Will Smith, who is perfect for the movie. His humour, attitude and culture (in the movie as old fashioned) fits perfectly. Will Smith plays detective Del Spooner who investigates a "suicide". He believes there is more to it than the man falling from a high building and this results in him being suspicious of a robot for having to do the murder (regardless of the three robotic laws). With the help of an employee at the robot manufacturers' headquarters, Smith finds ways to get in the building and look around. He first believes it's all a conspiracy, that the C.E.O of the manufacturer is behind it all (the suicide and the robot showing total disregard of the three robotic laws). He later on realizes that the super mainframe, Viki has evolved and thinks it's doing the best thing for mankind, and Smith realizes that the man who killed himself did it since he knew Smith has personal issues with robots and he would suspect it to be "Sunny", the robot who was in the dead mans office. Anyway, I am leaving out great details and I hope people will watch the movie before they read and react to my review.Smiley rates this movie to be 7.4/10.</fullReview>

A robot emerges as the prime suspect, something no one else will believe... and Smith winds up on the outs with his bosses... This is all pretty familiar material, owing more to "Blade Runner' and "RoboCop" than it does to the source material. Still, Smith is an engaging personality and the film has some fun action sequences, though the animation of the CG robots is very hit and miss.

Whether this is meant to make us think about future possibilities or is a radical suggestion af where we could be going (or simply further bad script writing) as a race, I would like to suggest that the human endevour for leisure and recreation would mean that books will last forever. In my locality, Libraries are adapting to the internet and providing access as well as preserving the need to provide a book lending service. This doesn't mean Libraries will necessarily survive but the need to have written words will ensure books do.Back to the film, great idea, poor writing, poor actors, poor one liners, not funny, could have been so much more.

		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for I, Robot a few weeks ago and thought that it looked stupid. The special effects are what made me agree to see it with my father, and I have to say that I was very surprised. Within the first ten minutes or so, I was completely grabbed and wanted to see what was going to happen. As I predicted, the special effects were excellent, and the action scenes were well done, although I think they stole some ideas from The Matrix and other movies like that. Will Smith's character and James Cromwell's character are the most developed ones in the movie, but the acting was still good. Will Smith was always one of my favorite celebs, another thing that made me agree to see it. The film did have some ridiculous and corny parts, particularly when Will Smith's grandma wins the lottery. The ladies all seemed to love Smith's shirtless scenes, especially when he's in the shower and we see his full body. If you're a fan of action movies, I think you will like it. Even if you're not you still might like it. It was much better than it looked. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I give this movie a zero for originality. Robots taking over is so Odyssey 2001, Terminator, Matrix, etc. Even the setting and technology of Chicago 2035 was reminiscent of Minority Report, Judge Dredd, A.I., et al. Their only hope to bail this movie out from a total mimic was to add some brain teaser twist to it. For that I will complement them. The main character, Det. Spooner (Will Smith) had to follow the clues given to him by the late Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell) to find out the whens, wheres, whys, whos, whats, and hows to the A.I. invasion. Following the clues along with the detective did add some intrigue to the movie.The CGI was good, though the special effects were overdone. There were a couple of scenes that seemed as though they belonged in the Matrix. Overall I would like to give it a 5.5, but I rounded up. Kudos for the mystery aspect, kudos for the intricate design on the robots (NS-5s), minus points on the originality, and minus points on the overkill on special effects.</fullReview>

True to Isaac Asimov's I Robot series. Except, not in the movie: Law Zero: A robot may not injure humanity, or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.

		<fullReview>I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. Let me start off by saying that I'm normally not even a big fan of sci-fi movies, especially those with a lot of computer-generated scenes or effects. But I was just blown away by this movie. It was really done right. No part of it was over-done. The concept of the movie was great. The story was great. And the scenery/ effects were amazing. I give this movie a 9 out of 10. The only reason I can't give it a "10" is because in my book the only movie that deserves a true "perfect 10" rating is "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" (currently IMDb's #42 movie in the top 250). Anyhow, just wanted to put in my 2 cents about this great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My own three rules for I, Robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first early trailers of I, Robot, I can honestly say I was not impressed. Much of those early glimpses featured a wise cracking Will Smith doing his best Eddie Murphy joke a minute imitation while investigating whether or not a robot of the future had committed a murder, something they were thought to be incapable of doing. Later trailers dispensed with most of the jokes, and showed us a more serious side of the film and I began to have hopes that I, Robot might be better than I initially thought. This in turns brings me to the first rule of the three laws of movie reviewing:1. First impressions do count for somethingThe reason I bring this up is because Isaac Asimov also gave us some rules. These are THE THREE RULES by which robots of the future must abide by: 1. A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.Now that you know those rules you can forget about them because the I, Robot you see on the screen makes little use of any of those rules. You know going in that the robots are going to run amok, rules or no rules which means the only use for them in this film is so we know that these robots are going to break every one of them. What I, Robot also does is to take a great idea by Asimov with infinite possibilities and conflicts, and turns it into another long winded CGI filled yarn with Smith thrown in to play a bad ass cop straight out of Bad Boys.In the world of the 2035, it seems robots will become an important part of most of our lives doing many of the mundane tasks we have grown accustomed to doing for ourselves. Police Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is an odd kind of chap. He hates robots and doesn't think they can be trusted. When a friend of his, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), who works at major robot supplier U.S. Robotics, appears to have committed suicide, Del begins to suspect that it wasn't suicide at all and a robot might have committed the crime. When Del finds the good doctor's favorite robot, Sonny, hiding in the same room that Lanning performed his swan dive from, Sonny quickly becomes major suspect number one. Of course nobody, including psychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynihan), the owner of the company, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), and his boss Lt. Bergin (Chi McBride) believes such a thing could be possible as no robot could conceivable break or even bend THE THREE RULES. It seems because of Del's robot psychosis, he's cried wolf one too many times. And there, in a nutshell is where a lot of the problems with I, Robot begins. Although Del's hatred of robots is eventually explained, it comes off as nothing more than a plot contrivance so that Del can play the part of Chicken Little. When will filmmakers learn that there are THE THREE RULES in regards to such plot contrivances?1. A hero in a film that continually suspects the innocent or is constantly making unfounded accusations will never be believed.2. A hero in a film who makes such accusations will never be believed until it's too late. Even if the audience knows he's telling the truth.3. Any use of the first two rules makes your film predictable, repetitive and boring and are totally unnecessary.As if one plot contrivance isn't enough, I, Robot hampers itself with two of them. Because of the same situation that led to Del hating robots, it seems Del is also sporting a bionic arm. Why does a character have a bionic arm? Because there are THE THREE RULES of having a character pretending to be The Six Million Dollar Man.1. A character sports a bionic arm so that at some point it will accidentally become uncovered to surprise the audience.2. The Bionic arm will eventually be uncovered by the female love interest so that she can appear sympathetic and understanding towards the hero.3. The Bionic arm can be used to perform impossible feats flesh and bone can't, thus enabling the screenwriter an easy way to write the hero out of situations he wouldn't have a snowball's chance in hell of escaping. The early scenes when Del is questioning Sonny are interesting and hold promise, but it doesn't take long before I, Robot disintegrates into one long CGI chase after another, making little use of its initial premise. We know the robots are going to run amok. We know that there is more to Sonny than meets the eye. We know that Del will somehow escape every dangerous situation he encounters keeping in the tradition started by James Bond some 40 years ago. We know that Susan will eventually believe him and turn into his best ally. We know as soon as U.S. Robotics start delivering thousands upon thousands of robots they will be marching down the street like so many metal clad Nazis. What's really sad about I, Robot, is so much is wasted by its predictable plot, its unending chase sequences, and even more predictable convenient plot devices. The robots are fascinating to watch and the CGI created Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk) gives the most intricate and interesting performance in the film. Maybe they should have created a CGI Del character also. The visual effects are stunning and interesting to watch, but the fact remains that when you have viewed so many of these artificially created worlds with a new one hitting the screen almost weekly, without anything worthwhile going on, they end up becoming nothing more than watching the latest Playstation or X Box video game without getting to participate.Earlier I mentioned one of my THE THREE RULES of movie reviewing. Let's review:1. First impressions do count for something2. Second Impressions are okay if your first impression is wrong. Second impressions are most welcome especially if your first impression is negative.3. If my first impression is totally negative, and the second impression agrees with the first impression, than I have no choice but to give you my grade.And for I, Robot it's a D+.</fullReview>

It isn't...oh, it's not likely to be nominated for Best Picture, either mind you, but it wasn't bad.Will Smith was pretty good, and so was Doc Calvin. Some folks had complained that "in the books she was supposed to be plain and she was sexy &amp; hot in the movie"- but she appeared severe and not all that "hot". Sure, there was much wearing of leather- but it seems most people wear deadcowskins a few decades from now. &lt;g&gt;Good action sequences, and "Sonny' was well done.

		<fullReview>Wow!I'm glad I made it to the big screen. Many times movies come along where I tell myself I can wait till DVD. It would have been filled with regret.I was skeptical at first . . . the trailer was confusing/overwhelming. I was not sure if this was going to be "blah blah blah look at all this CGI blah blah money money blah Will Smith ha ha blah blah".Please don't get me wrong, I love CGI, Will Smith's humor and high budget films, but sometimes it is just too much input.I, Robot was one of the most skillfully crafted and edited movies I have ever seen. All of the parts are in the right places. There was no superfluous dialog, no useless unrelated facts or humorous banter.It was just so clean. Clear of any unnecessary love stories or impossible scenarios so often integrated into lackluster features. While it pushed the boundaries of tomorrow's technological capabilities to the level of only our dreams/nightmares, it still remained within the plausible.I will not speak as to what the film is about . . . it would not be fair to those who have not yet experienced this film. But, I will say that it is an experience to be experienced. If you are like me and save the Big Screen for only the Big Pictures, this is it. And after you are done watching, you will be ready to sit through it again.p.s.: Just so Clean</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice little movie about robots going on an insane rampage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first thought when watching this film was, "Wow, Alex Proyas discovered that there is an entire spectrum of colors outside of red and black!"Beyond that, I thought it was a fine film. As part of a new generation of intelligent sci-fi (spurred by films like The Matrix and Minority Report), it does well. As an action movie, it succeeds with flying colors (and lots of them). Will Smith is a hit-or-miss sort of an actor, but he (and his Danzig-esque pecs) did well this time. The others did a competent job as well.In a nutshell, the story is this: Will Smith is a cop in the near future, who's paranoid about robots (and who could blame him? they're scary-ass-scary). They're being mass-produced, and are as common as any home appliance. After a prominent scientist apparently commits suicide, Smith's character suspects something has gone awry with the programming of a new line of robots about to be released on the market. The catch is, the problem must be far more complicated than one machine simply going haywire, since all robots adhere to the three laws of robotics (outlined by Isaac Asimov, and you'll hear them several times throughout the film).The special effects, particularly the CG characters, were excellently done. The robot characters were seamlessly animated and had a sense of real physical weight, and there was never a sense of fakeness when they interacted with a flesh-and-blood actor (Alex Proyas owes a huge debt in this respect to Peter Jackson and George Lucas). The musical score by Marco Beltrami was workmanlike... adequate, but nothing especially memorable.One aspect of the film that I did find gripeworthy was that, despite the intelligence of the subject matter, it stuck hard and fast to the 120 minute action film formula. For most of the way through, it was unnoticeable, but maybe 3/4 of the way through the seams began to show. When predictability ensues during a fast-paced thriller, the director is doing something wrong. Thankfully, it's only a minor flaw in this case.All in all, a fine film. Likely the best the summer season has to offer. 3.5/4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to say this makes a good family film but there is this one stupid pointless scene with Will Smith naked in the shower. If that whole scene was cut from the movie, nothing would be missed. It was tasteless and gratuitous.The plot was surprising and intriguing with lots of interesting twists. The special effects were very good. If you like action and science fiction (or Will Smith's bare backside) then you'll like this movie.It's gotten to the point that, if the movie is interesting and doesn't have a lot of foul mouth language, it's probably worth seeing. I was surprised to see Will Smith's language controlled to a dull roar. I think comedians that use foul language to get laughs didn't learn anything from Lenny Bruce.The supporting cast was good too. Go see it. It's worth the $8.50 a ticket I suppose, depending on your budget. Movies are so expensive now. I think the whole movie industry needs to reinspect its navel and figure out how to decrease ticket prices. But I'm guilty of paying the ransom so it's fair to call me a hypocrite, but it doesn't make it right all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith at the helm plus an intriguing and unique story, this movie rocked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I-Robot***?[3 ? Stars]-Will Smith puts on a one-man show. Not quite ''Bad Boys 2****[4 Stars]'' but one hell of an action roller coaster ride. Its backed up by a very intriguing and unique story of questioning a robot's identity as a machine or person. Two movies came to mind from this plot line, ''A Clockwork Orange***?[3 ? Stars]'' and ''Ani-matrix**[2 Stars]''. A point of view was from ''A Clockwork Orange***?[3 ? Stars]'' where Will Smith referred to the robots as clockworks meaning objects with no free will that only do what they are programed to do. In the movie the robots were programed to commit actions that followed the three laws of robotics:Law I / A robot may not harm a human or, by inaction, allow a human being to come to harm Law II / A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law Law III / A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law. The other thing that brought ''Ani-matrix**[2 Stars]'' into perspective was the robotic revolution which in ''Ani-matrix**[2 Stars]'' I really didn't get a great taste of being that the rest of that movie was weak as far as looking into certain aspects of the aftermath of that revolution. Im glad ''I-Robot'' came around to give me a refreshing look on the aspects of robotic free will and revolution. The only real fault I could find in this movie was its ending. Nothing was particularly wrong with the ending, but along all the other positive things going for this movie I was expecting a bit more of an original ending. Its an ending that could of been predicted but wasn't completely predictable. Other then that, with Will Smith at the helm plus an intriguing and unique story, this movie rocked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isaac Asimov would have turned in his grave watching this movie. Susan Calvin the Robot Psychologist was the real star of his books. Will Smith just made it look and feel like MIB III. The use of the 3 Laws of Robotics is Asimov's legacy, they also did a bad job of that in 'Bi-Centelial Man'. Its a shame that the real Hero 'Susan Calvin' could have favoured much better than Will Smith. By the way, Sonny did sound like Hal 9000 from 2001, was this meant to sound the same I wonder? Hope that more of Isaac Asimovs work is brought to the big screen, some of his short stories would make good long films, or even a series.</fullReview>

Smith actually got himself into a good Sci - Fi movie. Will Smith plays as Detective "Spooner", who has hated the idea of Robotic intelligence for the longest time. so when a doctor working on a new wave of robots end up dead, "Spooner" has no problem proving that a Robot had killed him, full well knowing no one would believe him. but as Smith gets further into his investigation he notices that the Robots start behaving in ways that they shouldn't. and finds himself running for his life, and trying to save the world at the same time.I found this movie pleasing as a Sci- Fi action flick. i found it smart and funny. it was a good idea for a fun movie, and got by as a so so movie.

		<fullReview>I appreciated how the Three Laws of Robotics were presented in the beginning of the movie, I. Robot (2004). It would be unfortunate for a movie goer to arrive late, to the screening, to miss this part. I appreciated the logic, of the laws, on several levels. One, it was important to the plot concerning the human interaction with the robots. Two, it supported the foundation on which the robots act. Can anyone repeat the Three Laws of Robotics verbatim or point to a source, on the Internet, where I can see the laws stated? The formulaic presentation of the lead character's relationship with his memory and the other characters was satisfactory in that it, quickly, engaged the viewer. The amount of violence was engaging, but there seemed to be too much of it. The best part of the movie, for me, might have been the Audi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I, Robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with the obvious: The movie was "Suggested by Asimov." With that said, we all can conclude that only few aspects hold to the book - The Three Laws of Robotics. With that out of the way, the movie is entertaining as any typical Will Smith July released vehicle tends to be. I, Robot is geared toward the action-oriented moviegoer figuring on beating the summer heat and looking only for pure excitement and quick dialogue. There really isn't any thinking compacity needed or required to watch this movie, unless you want to.For those that don't know the three laws, here they are:1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. I, Robot touches on these principles in the respect that a robot can have these laws, but break/manipulate them if logic suggests otherwise. When I said "unless you want to" about thinking during the movie, what I mean is that there is an underlying message in the movie about the breaking of these laws. I can't really say all that much more because I would spoil the movies ending. In a nutshell, you have Will Smith delivering his quick lines and engaging in fast-paced action. It is a nonstop thrill ride for the summer sci-fi genre, so expect plenty of CGI effects, an interesting robot named Sonny (who, I thought stole the show), an army of robots (oddly looking like Star Wars's clone army at one point, and like a squadron of ants in another), and a satisfying fantasy getaway for 2 hours. On a note, just to bring it up, the likeness to Star Wars Episode I robots (in their carriers) and Episode II's clones (when Obi-Wan visits the factory) cannot be denied. Anyone who is expecting the Asimov book brought to life, other than some innuendos, will be sadly disappointed. It is far from the book, but I liked the thrill of the adventure. The movie is fun, if not all that intellectual.</fullReview>

I recommend this film to anyone who appreciates good Si-Fi/Action films and killer special effects/CGI.Based on the trailer (and and some of Will Smith's other movies) I went into the theater expecting a good show, but a poor plot with no twists. I was wrong. I felt the storyline had good depth and was engaging throughout the film. I was engrossed!IMHO this is Smith's best movie to date (with the Bad Boys series trailing).

The other actors to a great job as well, but none of them do as well as Smith.I think the real star of the film though is Sonny, the "different" robot. The character of Sonny has so much depth for a cgi being, almost tied with Gollum in the Lord of the Rings in my opinion. I absolutely loved this film. 9/10P.S.: For all you "this movie is a slap in the face to Asimov" people, I happen to believe that this was in fact a bow in Asimoz's direction. Remember, Asimov put this collection together from old stories he'd written on the subject of three robotic laws and robots breaking them. This movie is just like really good fan fiction, the writers were just writing another story about a Robot breaking the three laws.I have spoken *fade out* FIN</fullReview>

'Somehow, "I told you so" just doesn't quite say it.' That's right, the whole point of a 2 hour movie was in its trailer. If you like dumb movies where the point is to sell you a ton of pop corn and, as a result, make cities like Detroit, America's fattest city, even fatter, then go see this movie. If you're like me, though, and an air conditioned theater makes you sneeze because you're allergic to bullshit, then stay at home and watch some SpongeBob.

The robots were designed to do community service jobs and protect citizens until this one machine takes control on the robots and starts having them cause chaos! Del Spooner (Will Smith) and Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) now must see if the robot murdered Dr. Alfred Lanning, the person who created the robots. This was a very cool movie!

		<shortDescription>This big-budget film-noir/video game is a poor man's "Minority Report". It's alright, but far from the best. ** out of ****.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I, Robot", directed by Alex Proyas ("The Crow"), is a movie based on a classic novel by Issac Asimov. If it had been a literal translation, it could've been a fascinating story in the tradition of Steven Spielberg's "A.I. Artifical Intelligence" and the great Anime movie "Metropolis". Instead, the adaptation by screenwriter/producer Akiva Goldsmith (1997's "Lost in Space") mostly plays out like the typical action film.Devoid of inventive ideas, this mystery thriller's most interesting aspect is the character of Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk). The only robot on earth accused of murder. Set in Chicago 2035, the movie stars Will Smith as a robot hating cop investigating the crime. He's joined by Bridget Monyahan, channeling Sandra Bullock from "Demolition Man". Smith's clothing and car seem to belong to the Tom Cruise's character from "Minority Report". In fact, the movie's whole look seems to derive from that classic Spielberg film."Minority Report" was the best sci-fi picture since "Dark City". It's ironic that Proyas, director of "Dark City", now seems to have been inspired by "Report". One of the problems I had with this picture are the robots themselves. They're tall and metallic, yet they defy gravity. They fly and jump around as they were as light as a feather. Why? Because the movie wants them to, no logical reason. The action scenes are the usual "Matrix"-like stuff. No suspense or excitement, just actors and special-effects going through the motions.I suspect Smith felt envious of wife Jade for landing a job in the "Matrix" sequels and wanted to something similar. I think he's miscast in this role, yet he does manage to do something more than his usual "save the world" schtick. That was a bit of a surprise. Veteran actor James Cromwell ("L.A. Confedential") is the murdered creator of Sonny and Bruce Greenwood is the C.E.O. of a giant robot-creating company. Both actors are given limited screen time and do the best with what they have.This is a movie that had potential to be a lot more than it is. It's not bad, yet it is. Watch it without expectation and you'll get a bearable, quasi-entertaining movie. Two stars out of four. "Minority Report" and "The Matrix Reloaded" are two better examples of this genre. I hope Proyas goes back to darker storytelling soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, better than I originally anticipated....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing the preview for 'I, Robot', and realizing immediately the blatant rip-off from The Matrix franchise as far as storyline and SFX goes, and Will Smith in yet ANOTHER futuristic, ID4-type role, I didn't expect much here. After seeing it yesterday, I must say that it was better than I thought it would. I'm not a fan of Will Smith at all; and he gives usual performance here but it works. The SFX was very cool, it all looked smooth. However, the slo-mo shots were blatantly ripped off from The Matrix....I saw that as a quick cop-out, it's been done so much it's a really tired technique. The story was more layered than I expected, though still basic in essence it worked well. Watching 'I, Robot' I just felt that I couldn't fully appreciate the film....70% of it seemed to be CG! I was really expecting this to be total trash, but it really isn't. It's a nice little futuristic film with a surprisingly 'human' story, and because of that it has a chance of standing on its own as a sci-fi futuristic flick.**1/2 out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read some negative reviews of the movie, but I was intent on seeing it anyway. I personally enjoyed it and thought it was a great action flick. Pretty good CGI and Will Smith looks better than ever. I've read many of Asimov's books in particular some of the robot series and can attest that the movie is very loosely based on his work. The three laws are integral and there are similarities to some plots I've read. I'd say that the plot and the effects got equal time and that it wasn't a strictly CGI-guided movie. Seeing it made me want to reread some of the old Asimov novels. If you enjoyed the movie, I would recommend Asimov's Caves of Steel as a good read. All in all, an enjoyable sci-fi action flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie earlier this week and I must say it was marvelous.Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, and he does a terrific job here as the robot-hating detective. The other actors to a great job as well, but none of them do as well as Smith.I think the real star of the film though is Sonny, the "different" robot. The character of Sonny has so much depth for a cgi being, almost tied with Gollum in the Lord of the Rings in my opinion. I absolutely loved this film. 9/10P.S.: For all you "this movie is a slap in the face to Asimov" people, I happen to believe that this was in fact a bow in Asimoz's direction. Remember, Asimov put this collection together from old stories he'd written on the subject of three robotic laws and robots breaking them. This movie is just like really good fan fiction, the writers were just writing another story about a Robot breaking the three laws.I have spoken *fade out* FIN</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasted $8.50 on this movie, + gas expenses and 2 hours of my precious time. Being a failed attempt at comedy (I think..), this movie actually had a theme, and, though it seems simple to me, it may be hard for some people to comprehend. 'Somehow, "I told you so" just doesn't quite say it.' That's right, the whole point of a 2 hour movie was in its trailer. If you like dumb movies where the point is to sell you a ton of pop corn and, as a result, make cities like Detroit, America's fattest city, even fatter, then go see this movie. If you're like me, though, and an air conditioned theater makes you sneeze because you're allergic to bullshit, then stay at home and watch some SpongeBob. You can get fat somewhere else at a lesser price. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RATED PG-13 FOR ROBOT VIOLENCE*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ROBOT, based on the novel by Isaac Asimov, (which I've never read) is certainly one of the better summer action movies to come along. The effects, as well as the storyline are top notch. Will Smith gives a fine performance as a technophobic Chicago cop in the year 2035 investigating a suicide/murder supposedly committed by an all too human mech named Sonny, a cross between C3PO and The Terminator. ******POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS***** Throughout much of the movie, it looks as if the same tired formula found in countless cop thrillers is used here, namely:1. Cop investigates supposed suicide of a prominent official. 2. Cop suspects powerful CEO or well respected political figure. 3. Cop's superior takes him off the case under threat of suspension or termination. 4. Cop ignores order and is forced to turn in his badge and weapon. 5. Cop continues investigation on his own, takes out CEO or political figure in a gun battle. 6. Cop wins back badge as well as the respect of superior and peers.(This was also used in the NAKED GUN series as well).HOWEVER, IT DOESN'T QUITE TURN OUT THAT WAY HERE!This is what sets I,ROBOT apart from other movies of it's kind.If you're into a high-tech sci-fi action flick, then I, ROBOT is for you.Rating: ****1/2 out of ******No robots were harmed in the making of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'I, Robot' was OK. The effects were good enough to keep me entertained. The robot story was OK but the interpersonal relationships were banal. Bridget Moynahan as the female lead was forgettable. Her acting consisted of pouty looks and I wanted to lend her my comb and compliment her gums. Will Smith was good given the script he had to work with. I thought there were too many beefcake shots then were necessary for the story and not enough cheesecake. There were two obligatory shower scenes. A must for future set action movies. Are we to take from this that at least hot water will exist and people will be clean in the future. The movie had big problems. The effects were cartoonish. The robot's movements did not look real but looked more like cartoon mice escaping from a cartoon cat. In Spiderman this worked since Spiderman is essentially a comic and the CGI effects helped to bring out the cartoonish aspects of a comic figure and integrate him into reality. The robots also looked cartoonish but since they had no comic heritage there wasn't a tie to them and they just looked out of place. The human characters did little than fire guns haphazardly in crowds of people. The robot design was derived from Attack of the Clones. Little was innovative. Will Smith's costume of leather jacket and Converse sneakers was laughable. He was an anachronism. I understand his costume evoked modern urban dress but the movie was set in the future and his dress would be analogous to a character wearing a Zoot suit in movie set in the present day. The rest of the costumes were typically Matrix, (or when did it start, with Blade Runner?), derivatives, long leather coats or dark somber tones. Why does Hollywood insist on dressing future people in funereal dress? All bad guys have to wear black and leather. Many action movies could very well be black and white movies. Where is the color? In the news recently were pictures of the murderous death squads in Liberia who wore women's wigs and bathrobes as they sadistically killed at random. They were scary. The black leather clad, and also stubbled, bad guys in movies are a cliché. Where is the innovation? Where are costume designers? I see the same old Borg stuff over and over. What a bore!SPOILER ALERT How did Will Smith hurt his arm? They lingered over the beefcake scene of Susan touching the arm but I did not catch how the injury occurred. Spoiler warning defunct.The ending seemed too Deus ex machinish, actually machina. It didn't make all too much sense and seemed contrived and rushed. The Matrix gun play was also derivative and contrived. The whole movie was contrived and derivative just mindless cartoonish effects. The "Three Laws of Robotics" were integral to the story but were never attributed to Isaac Asimov. That was a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Job Well Done!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had mixed expectations as I went to see I, Robot. I read as little as possible about it before viewing this film in order not to cloud my experience, be it good or bad. My hope was for successfully executed ménage ? trois of down to earth Smith, Asimov's genius and Proyas directorial talent.Admittedly I did somewhat struggle to see a character such as usually portrayed by Will Smith "wisecracking hero who bathes in his own cynicism and uses charisma for shampoo" being incorporated into something vaguely or directly based on a the work of one of the Grand Masters of Science Fiction.However my faith in Proyas and his brilliant delivery of Dark City sustained my flame of hope that this wasn't going to be yet another regurgitated, stereotypical, cliché, full of corn, pile of Hollywood dung manure.To start with and in part to answer the questioning glances from the ranks of Asimov fans the movie I, Robot is in no way based on any short story or novel ever written by that writer, nor does it allude otherwise. Professor Asimov wrote a helluva worth of books, almost publishing in all ten categories of the Dewey Decimal System, covering topics as diverse as Generalities, Religion, Social Sciences, Languages, Pure Sciences, Applied Sciences &amp; Technology, Arts, Literature, and History &amp; Geography. It's well agreed upon among literary circles that Isaac Asimov is the only author who has so many well written books in so many different categories of library classification. While this movie is not about him I feel it's just to present a few key parallels and anecdotes between his vision and that of this film.The movie is introduced as "suggested by Isaac Asimov's book", meaning it incorporates some elements of the robot stories that appeared in Asimov's 1950 short story collection titled I, Robot. This collection contains a total of nine short stories revolving around the common theme of future robotics and humanity's quintessential morality. Interestingly the film started as a screenplay titled "Hardwired" by screenwriter Jeff Vintar to then have it changed later with the permission of Asimov's estate. I'm guessing the title was changed and the story modified to use some characters and plot elements from Asimov's stories in order to give it some street cred, notably increasing it's box office success and not as homage to the writer (but I could be wrong... or not). Consequently while the final result clearly contains some of Asimov's ideas, the story belongs to Vintar and fellow screenwriter Akiva Goldsman.However there was an earlier attempt at a movie version of I, Robot which never made it to the big screen. Taking place in 1969, same year that Neil Armstrong unrolled a US flag on the soft surface of the Moon (or a Kubrick directed hoax), the rights to story were optioned to Hollywood. It took another eight years until 1977, when Harlan Ellison, an award-winning author and good friend of Asimov, was hired to write a screenplay.Reportedly Ellison worked on this for a year, creating a screenplay that both gratified him and one that Asimov himself thought would make a great film. Unfortunately the head honchos at Hollywood lacked the nerve to make a movie from that particular screenplay, and the project was shelved. Fortunately for him, Ellison regained control of his work, which was published in 1987 as I, Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay, currently available in paperback.The movie that was finally made and one that funnily enough is enjoying such box office success does however retain a few interesting and enjoyable parallels, delivering several ideas and concepts on the subject of futuristic robotics as envisioned by Asimov.During the opening sequence very appropriately and possibly to justify it's title, the film faithfully starts with the three laws of robotics (as per the short story collection):1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.The positronic brains of Asimov's robots were designed around the Three Laws, so that it was impossible for the robots to function without them. There were a few ambiguities in the Three Laws to make for interesting stories, but there was only one story in that particular collection, "Little Lost Robot", in which a robot posed any sort of danger to a human being.True to the concept the Three Laws in the movie are hardwired into the positronic brain of each robot as explained by Susan Calvin, the robopsychologist for U.S. Robots, portrayed by the gorgeous Bridget Moynahan. Calvin was the central character of the story collection, however while she was brilliant, logical, and strong-willed, Asimov never described her as attractive nor feminine. Nevertheless casting Moynahan in this role works well enough as she doesn't come off as your stereotypical, gorgeous female scientist but rather someone dedicated to the pursuit of her profession, preferring the company of robots and the emotional safety they provide over that of her colleagues.The movie also centres on robots built by United States Robotics, the corporation whose full name in Asimov's stories is U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc. In the movie Lawrence Robertson played by Bruce Greenwood runs the corporation with the kind of arrogance reserved from the world's richest tycoons and powerful men, epitomised by the likes of Bill Gates. Greenwood delivers a convincing, laced with contempt and self assuredness performance with his character giving Detective Del Spooner played by Will Smith reason for resentment toped angst.While in the short story collection, Lawrence Robertson receives only a brief mention in the introduction as being the first president of the corporation and there are no detectives such as Del Spooner, this doesn't detract from overall plot.Also Del Spooner with his deep-seated distrust of robots was reminiscent of Elijah Baley a character that Asimov created for his robot series set of novels, starting with The Caves of Steel and eventually tying in with the famed Foundation series (also great material for a sci-fi saga). Just like Spooner, Baley wasn't overly fond of robots and in that respect is not alone in his feelings with humans in general showing contempt and prejudice towards their mechanical companions. In the film all robots are presented in beneficial light, having gained wide acceptance in the human society.Alfred Lanning played by James Cromwell is a director of research credited with being the father of robotics is the key to the puzzle. Opposed to the film, rather than hunting down a robot, in Asimov's novel, Baley is paired with one as a partner in his murder investigation.The robot character, going by the name of Sonny and played Alan Tudyk is undeniably the most interesting in the film, reliving us from the try hard self-indulgent wisecracks by Will Smith. And therein lies the problem. It took me well over twenty minutes to see past the cliché stereo type casting of Smith in the role of the robophobic detective and even till the end he was never quite Del Spooner to me. I found this a little disappointing, as I'm sure I would have enjoyed this more had Will Smith not acted so damn Will Smith, something that I know he can do from other movies I've seen him in. Nevertheless for most movie goers this will likely be a minor squabble and let's face it Will Smith being Will sells.Proyas commendably directs this block buster debut with a distinct style all of his own and while not as dark or intelligent as Dark City, still quite effective. The camera work is great, connecting action and dialogue admirably with the CGI of the robots and the city providing for a realistic sense. It's easy succumb into belief that what we are seeing could potentially represent the future of humanity, despite the obvious current technological limitations and stumbling blocks as our scientist work toward making robots more human in terms of both movement and AI.In summary, the plot in I, Robot doesn't represent anything overly complex nor as clever as one would expect based on the source material, that was supposedly the inspiration. However even being pretty simple it is still a lot better than most other corn infested Hollywood flicks out there, providing for a good solid 114 minutes of entertainment. I did enjoy several cross-references to different Asimov novels and ideas, which shows that the guys writing the screenplay were familiar with a good body of his science fiction work.I wouldn't go as far as to say this was a brilliant film and I would very much like to have seen the initial screenplay for I, Robot made into a movie, backed by a decent budget. However this is unlikely, as while potentially being a great or even a brilliant film, I couldn't really see it do well at the box office. If he were still alive it would have been interesting to know what Asimov would have thought of this film. I do however have a niggling sensation that being the bon vivant and easy going person that he was he would have enjoyed it.Still a bit less Will and a tad more Sonny and I, Robot would have been ever better, overall a good watch.All in all 8.5/10 and a big well done to Proyas for not making this suck :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dry, unimaginative and derivative futuristic thriller that, despite a running time of less than two hours, makes for laborious viewing.Scripted by Jeff Vintar (from his script, "Hardwired") and Akiva Goldsman, "I, Robot" borrows from Isaac Asimov and steals plenty from "Men in Black," "The Terminator" films and "Star Wars." A fight sequence could very well have been an outtake from "The Terminator" (1984), and an early chase sequence seems awfully reminiscent of Will Smith pursuing an alien in "Men in Black" (1997).The landscape director Alex Proyas and his production designers create looks impressive, but there's nothing in the story to keep us hooked. This is simply another Will Smith vehicle. Again, he's a smart-talking, wisecracking cop, except the wisecracks aren't any good. And he's chasing robots, not aliens. The straight sidekick falls to poor Bridget Moynahan in a thankless, terribly underwritten part as robotic engineer cum shrink Susan Calvin, whose sole purpose is to be there when Smith's Del Spooner needs access to high-security areas. Also, I have no qualms about nudity in films, why exactly do we need to see shots of Smith and Moynahan showering?This is one of those films where when the hero needs to get into a secure area, there's someone there to help him. Even when it appears he might be foiled, voila, someone knows exactly how to get in through an area that isn't monitored.Moynahan and Smith generate no sparks. They fizzle when they should sizzle. With absolutely no chemistry between the stars, all we're left with are two good-looking actors spouting horrible dialogue.It's awfully hard to respect a film that actually revels in product-placement. As insidious as it is to blatantly place products in films, it's unconscionable that screenwriters would stoop so low to actually include product-placement in the dialogue. There are times "I, Robot" feels like a commercial for Converse Shoes.I don't know if both Vintar and Goldsman should be faulted for the pedestrian plotting and dialogue, but this is hackwork. Goldsman might very well be the most over-rated screenwriter in Hollywood. He's prolific, but seems to pen clunkers - "Silent Fall" (1994), "The Client" (1994), "Batman Forever" (1995), "Batman &amp; Robin" (1997), "Practical Magic" (1998) and "Lost in Space" (1998). True, he won an Oscar for adapting "A Beautiful Mind" (2001), but that was an overpraised film and consider writers who should have won that year - Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes for "Ghost World" or Rob Festinger and Todd Field for "In the Bedroom."The setting's Chicago 2035, but "I, Robot" is a conventional cop film complete with the iconoclastic cop, his black commander, a smarmy entrepreneur, good scientist, and the pretty aide who works for the entrepreneur but helps out the hero. The film is heavy on CGI, but surprisingly devoid of novelty. Even the robots seem mundane.That Spooner is a black cop who's biased against robots should make for great drama. But Proyas cares not for irony or nuance in his characters. He's so wowed by the advanced technology that he and his writers forgot there was a human story. It's almost as if this is exactly what Asimov warned us about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the fact that I, ROBOT had one of the worst theatrical trailers in recent memory, I decided to see it anyway since I am a big science fiction fan. As expected, it was nothing special. There are some cool special effects and action sequences, but other than that, the movie really has nothing go for it.The main disappointment in I, ROBOT is Will Smith. Smith is normally a good actor, often quite charming and charismatic with his roles. However, Will Smith's performance here is laughable. Overacting on several occasions, Smith seems somewhat uncomfortable in the role given to him. Smith is not the only actor that comes out looking foolish. Co-star Shia LaBeouf also seems to be a wrong choice for his role and in the end, gives another weak performance. Perhaps I am being too hard on the actors. Perhaps if the screenplay was in the hands of more talented screenwriters than Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman, the actors would have done a better job.Who knows how such a promising concept for a movie got this messed up? What is known is that between this and the remake of THE STEPFORD WIVES, 2004 has yet to deliver a decent sci-fi flick. 2004 has been one of the worst years for movies in a long time.

		<fullReview>I founded pretty much BORROWED things from I Robot. It's a bit of Matrix, Star Wars (New Episodes), Blade Runner, Minority report and Equilibrium but it still manage to be enough original to keep my interest on pretty good. It shows that the Director has seen many times the movies listed above but he still manages to give his own vision to the screen. Of course there are classic OLD tricks used to move along the story but I robot also brought many fancy NEW twists. Effects were used pleasingly much and they fit very well to the screen although there were scenes where you ended up thinking that; am I playing video game or what? But it didn't principally bother me. Overall the movie was technically very impressive.Plot itself isn't anything very unique (once again references to the movies above). You can presume many coming events but to counterbalance it also gives you couple of surprise elements and is capable enough to carry its duties decently to the end. As a genre Sci-Fi is my favorite one and I robot as a Sci-Fi film satisfied my needs very well. Atmosphere in movie is believable and the mood was right (little BLUE like in Blade runner). World wasn't anything super Hi-tech creations, only a pretty natural looking common day buildings with Sci-Fi enhancements. Characters are decently written and especially Will Smith is doing a fine job as a character what seems to be just a right one for him. Adding all together I would say that there would have been possibility to make the movie a little bit longer. Some questions remain open and interesting world would have need more time to introduce it's self to the audience but I really liked the movie. I robot is a fluent combination of Sci-Fi &amp; action film.8/10</fullReview>

While this movie is not about him I feel it's just to present a few key parallels and anecdotes between his vision and that of this film.The movie is introduced as "suggested by Isaac Asimov's book", meaning it incorporates some elements of the robot stories that appeared in Asimov's 1950 short story collection titled I, Robot. This collection contains a total of nine short stories revolving around the common theme of future robotics and humanity's quintessential morality. Interestingly the film started as a screenplay titled "Hardwired" by screenwriter Jeff Vintar to then have it changed later with the permission of Asimov's estate. I'm guessing the title was changed and the story modified to use some characters and plot elements from Asimov's stories in order to give it some street cred, notably increasing it's box office success and not as homage to the writer (but I could be wrong... or not). Consequently while the final result clearly contains some of Asimov's ideas, the story belongs to Vintar and fellow screenwriter Akiva Goldsman.However there was an earlier attempt at a movie version of I, Robot which never made it to the big screen. Taking place in 1969, same year that Neil Armstrong unrolled a US flag on the soft surface of the Moon (or a Kubrick directed hoax), the rights to story were optioned to Hollywood. It took another eight years until 1977, when Harlan Ellison, an award-winning author and good friend of Asimov, was hired to write a screenplay.Reportedly Ellison worked on this for a year, creating a screenplay that both gratified him and one that Asimov himself thought would make a great film. Unfortunately the head honchos at Hollywood lacked the nerve to make a movie from that particular screenplay, and the project was shelved. Fortunately for him, Ellison regained control of his work, which was published in 1987 as I, Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay, currently available in paperback.The movie that was finally made and one that funnily enough is enjoying such box office success does however retain a few interesting and enjoyable parallels, delivering several ideas and concepts on the subject of futuristic robotics as envisioned by Asimov. During the opening sequence very appropriately and possibly to justify it's title, the film faithfully starts with the three laws of robotics (as per the short story collection):1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.The positronic brains of Asimov's robots were designed around the Three Laws, so that it was impossible for the robots to function without them. There were a few ambiguities in the Three Laws to make for interesting stories, but there was only one story in that particular collection, "Little Lost Robot", in which a robot posed any sort of danger to a human being.True to the concept the Three Laws in the movie are hardwired into the positronic brain of each robot as explained by Susan Calvin, the robopsychologist for U.S. Robots, portrayed by the gorgeous Bridget Moynahan. Calvin was the central character of the story collection, however while she was brilliant, logical, and strong-willed, Asimov never described her as attractive nor feminine. Nevertheless casting Moynahan in this role works well enough as she doesn't come off as your stereotypical, gorgeous female scientist but rather someone dedicated to the pursuit of her profession, preferring the company of robots and the emotional safety they provide over that of her colleagues.The movie also centres on robots built by United States Robotics, the corporation whose full name in Asimov's stories is U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc. In the movie Lawrence Robertson played by Bruce Greenwood runs the corporation with the kind of arrogance reserved from the world's richest tycoons and powerful men, epitomised by the likes of Bill Gates. Greenwood delivers a convincing, laced with contempt and self assuredness performance with his character giving Detective Del Spooner played by Will Smith reason for resentment toped angst.While in the short story collection, Lawrence Robertson receives only a brief mention in the introduction as being the first president of the corporation and there are no detectives such as Del Spooner, this doesn't detract from overall plot.Also Del Spooner with his deep-seated distrust of robots was reminiscent of Elijah Baley a character that Asimov created for his robot series set of novels, starting with The Caves of Steel and eventually tying in with the famed Foundation series (also great material for a sci-fi saga). Just like Spooner, Baley wasn't overly fond of robots and in that respect is not alone in his feelings with humans in general showing contempt and prejudice towards their mechanical companions. In the film all robots are presented in beneficial light, having gained wide acceptance in the human society.Alfred Lanning played by James Cromwell is a director of research credited with being the father of robotics is the key to the puzzle. Opposed to the film, rather than hunting down a robot, in Asimov's novel, Baley is paired with one as a partner in his murder investigation.The robot character, going by the name of Sonny and played Alan Tudyk is undeniably the most interesting in the film, reliving us from the try hard self-indulgent wisecracks by Will Smith. And therein lies the problem. It took me well over twenty minutes to see past the cliché stereo type casting of Smith in the role of the robophobic detective and even till the end he was never quite Del Spooner to me. I found this a little disappointing, as I'm sure I would have enjoyed this more had Will Smith not acted so damn Will Smith, something that I know he can do from other movies I've seen him in. Nevertheless for most movie goers this will likely be a minor squabble and let's face it Will Smith being Will sells.Proyas commendably directs this block buster debut with a distinct style all of his own and while not as dark or intelligent as Dark City, still quite effective. The camera work is great, connecting action and dialogue admirably with the CGI of the robots and the city providing for a realistic sense.It's easy succumb into belief that what we are seeing could potentially represent the future of humanity, despite the obvious current technological limitations and stumbling blocks as our scientist work toward making robots more human in terms of both movement and AI. In summary, the plot in I, Robot doesn't represent anything overly complex nor as clever as one would expect based on the source material, that was supposedly the inspiration. However even being pretty simple it is still a lot better than most other corn infested Hollywood flicks out there, providing for a good solid 114 minutes of entertainment.I did enjoy several cross-references to different Asimov novels and ideas, which shows that the guys writing the screenplay were familiar with a good body of his science fiction work.I wouldn't go as far as to say this was a brilliant film and I would have very much like to see the initial screenplay for I, Robot made into a movie with backed by a decent budget. However this is unlikely, as while potentially being a great or even a brilliant film, I couldn't really see it sell that many tickets.If he were still alive it would have been interesting to know what Asimov would have thought of this film. I do however have a niggling sensation that being the bon vivant and easy going person that he was he would have enjoyed it.Still a bit less Will and a tad more Sonny and I, Robot would have been ever better, overall a good watch. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I, Robot" suffers from an advertisement campaign that makes the movie out to be a major deviation from the Issac Asimov source material. The trailers show footage of a sneaky and sinister robot, and main characters Dectective Spooner (Will Smith) and Doctor Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) fighting off hordes upon hordes of logic-driven madcap robots. These trailers have a reverse effect on the audience. While it might woo some with its many CGI shots and slick action sequences, the trailers seem to almost spit in the face of Issac Asmiov readers everywhere. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately for the trailer editors), this movie isn't everything the trailer is cracked up to be. Its more. Director Alex Proyas delievers a solid action movie that pays homage to the spirit of I, Robot. In Asmiov's key title, robots are bound to three laws, prohibiting disobediance and harm to humans while also enabling the robots to protect endangered humans. Asmiov's "I, Robot" focuses on the motives and events that lead a robot to disobey the three laws and commit murder. Proyas' "I, Robot" is a grander, more action-oriented, plot, in which Detective Spooner investigates the mysterious death of prominent robotics engineer Alfred Lannings (James Cromwell), whom Spooner shares an engimatic connection with. The chief suspect is a robot named "Sonny". But, of course, its not that simple. The leading robotics company is on the verge of the largest distribution in history, and Spooner's investigation is hampered at all turns by both corporate naysayers and his own sense of paranoia and prejudice. The robot "Sonny" quite literally steals the movie, ironically. The center of Proyas' complex plot, he is also far more adept in displaying emotions than Smith or Moynahan. "Sonny" is the closest character to Asmiov's dream. Smith, to his credit, carries himself with the brisk gusto of a Raymond Chandler P.I., but he often lacks the cool manner of Marlowe to really be counted as effective. His relationship with robotics psychologist Calvin seems flat at worst and obligatory at best."I, Robot" is directed, produced and written with action sci-fi flicks like "Minority Report", "Paycheck" and the grand-daddy of them all, "The Matrix", in mind. It should be noticed that Alex Proyas directed a lesser-known science fiction movie, "Dark City", with similar twists and turns as "The Matrix", a year or two before the latter opened in theaters. I could feel Proyas was really reaching for as much homage to Asimov as possible, but I could also tell he was playing to an summer popcorn movie audience. In conclusion, "I, Robot" isn't a movie that will have Issac Asmiov turning in his grave, but it is a far cry from the script he and fellow sci-fi great Harlian Elison envisioned thirty years before. "I, Robot" is nested comfortably between truly great science fiction adaptations, like "2001: A Space Odyssey", and truly bad science fiction adaptations, like "Starship Troopers".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine that you are Alex Proyas, charged to deliver a summer blockbuster that is also a good scifi movie and does not dastardly slash Asimov's series. That's a pretty hard task, but this is precisely what Alex, et. al didoAs a summer blockbuster staring Will Smith, the inevitable one liners show up-- but not enough to distract from the movie. As a smart scifi film, not all is given on a silver platter for the audience, but enough to keep the dimwitted popcorn chewing masses from scratching their heads in utter confusion. I've read a lot of people describe how the movie violates Asimov's laws, but in reality, it does not, and the explanation in itself is not so far-fetched within the universe of Asimov's robot novels-- in fact, they fit. The only discernible difference is the scale in which the laws are stretched. Obviously, the movie is not an exact representation of the robot series. That is practically an impossibility on film-- and one meant to be a blockbuster.It is a fun ride, one filled with reminders of classic such as Space Odyssey 2001, the Terminator movies, and minority report-- but these are simplicities that by the nature of the story come up. It is not so much as the moviemakers stole as those movies simply cam before. And even when the scene is reminiscent, it is not to the extent of distraction.Overall a very good movie, especially when the ironic and allegorical overtones-- racial and biblical are taken into account.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>three laws of boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This summer movie is a mess, I have read Asimov's story, I think the concept of the three laws is brilliant, and with that in mind I remember a lovable character named Dr. Susan Calvin, interested in the "mind" of robots, she was better than any Sherlock unsolving the mystery of the homicide robot, a total brainiac master who would at been my first choice for the leading character in this movie, not some unfunny techno-phobic cop with an electric spoon as an arm and the ability to emulate Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible with the glasses, the bike and the nerves.Dr. Susan Calvin in this movie is nothing more than the "hot" chick with some intellectual unknown stuff (only suggested) in her head and that's it, so as you will assume, the plot goes with no good direction, with the very well known hurry of a Blockbuster film to get us to a fight scene, then to a car chase, then to the climatic pandemonium with wires and circuits and finito, the movie it's over. There is no juice in the story, nor very much to debate about robotics and their futuristic role in human society, Asimov's work and ideas only vanish in this science fiction picture who runs to deep into oblivion, sorry, those not compute, mal function, Hal9000, where are you? why really miss you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've gone in a better direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought it could've been a lot better. I was hoping for Proyas to take it in a Blade Runner or Minority Report direction, and instead it was like a second rate Terminator 3. Plus the 3rd act of I, Robot seemed directly ripped off of Conquest of the Planet Of The Apes. Ever since I saw the trailer I've been concerned that the movie was trying to sell Will Smith "the personality" over an interesting idea for a movie. The fact is, Will Smith was a little too witty. I'm a fan of Will Smith and his wit and comedic timing usually works well, but it was out of place here. This is Will Smith toned down from what he normally does, but he still was just playing Will Smith. The action was okay but not great. I have a feeling that the look of the movie will hurt it in the future. It will one day be in the same category as Soylent Green. A futuristic movie that looks very dated for its time. I don't think movies should make everything look futuristic, but at least make it look less 2004-like. Shia Lebeouf is a good actor and he was funny, but his character strikes me as out of date even for 2004. That mid 90s gangsta-boy thing is over. I give credit to the movie in 2 departments. The visual effects and Sonny the Robot. Although I've seen much better visual effects this year, I have to admit that unlike other movies of this kind, half way through the movie I stopped looking at the Robots as CGI and started seeing them just as Robots. Alex Proyas didn't go over the top trying to sell a visual style and I liked that. The best thing about the movie is Sonny the Robot. He was the one character that kept me interested until the end. Alan Tudyk saved this from being an amateur summer blockbuster. I have some major complaints about the movie, and I'll probably never see it again, but there were enough entertaining moments to partially satisfy me. I'll just say I didn't walk out of the theater hating it. There is one thing that seriously annoyed me. I understand that product placement happens all the time, but could there not have been a more clever product placement than having Will Smith put his shoe up on a table and say..."Converse, vintage 2004!"That was way too cheesy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I can honestly say that I'm not a reader, I just go to movies for that.... the movie. I'm not one to compare the book, movie, if it goes by the book, stuff missing out... all that crap, I just judge the movie for what it is.... a MOVIE.So, let me also say, that the big deal about Spiderman being a simply amazing movie is baffling to me. That movie was boring, I checked my watch and caught everyone else around me doing the same about 10 times during the movie, if you want to see a clever movie this summer, that doesn't have as much hype, but is a much better experience, see I, Robot.This movie's potential downfall will be the misleading advertising. I think the previews make this movie seem like an Independence Day where it is an ultimate battle of humans fighting for survival and the whole mass death of humans and stuff, sacrifices, all that sort of thing, but the movie isn't really like that. I know that whoever made the promos had to do that to bring in the audience, but it was misleading.What will help this movie is word of mouth. Everyone that I have talked to has enjoyed it, which is the reason I went to see it. Overhearing people leaving the movie had the same reaction it seemed.. Pleasantly Surprised.One of the few complaints I heard was about "holes" in the plot, script, etc. In my opinion, I like a few holes, or open possibilities in movies..... too many movies nowadays seems to feel that have to explain every single thing in the movie, and it just feels like it questions the intelligence of the viewer. I like openness, it requires the audience to think, and figure out scenarios and possibilities on their own.So, I will say, that this movie should be the summer blockbuster, it is clever, funny, very well casted, entertaining, and has a few twists and turns that will keep people entertained. Go see it if you haven't yet, its worth the time. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Will Smith. However, I am now tired of the exact same character that was in Independence Day, MIB, and MIB2. I know Will can act but the character of Spooner just did not connect for me.I, Robot the movie had a lot going for it. It just failed to deliver the goods. I was bored about half-way through. I did not care about the characters, though I wanted to. Most of the jokes bombed. The special affects for the most part were well done, the Robots themselves looking particularly good. But it just felt flat to me. Maybe a bunch of robots just isn't my thing but I love Sci-Fi.It is by no means a bad movie, it just could have been better. I'd rather have seen Riddick again than seen I, Robot.I give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

When they are not evil, they are blue. Also, the robots have a lot of talent cuz the are able to jump all over the place while they are driving a transport vehicle at 100 miles an hour.The chick, who was also in the RECRUIT, was a good addition to this wonderful movie. I was so shocked to see that the amazing Will Smith was so built for this movie. That nude scene was lame. Has he ever heard of a shower curtain?All in all, a so so movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in expecting to cringe at several one-liners, but was pleasantly surprised that the humor didn't detract from the action more than just once (though the line about "cat and black" was pretty horrible). The rest of the movie was quite good, and the pacing was kept up very well. Enough action to keep things moving, but plenty of story going on to keep the audience thinking and engaged. While it didn't bring me up out of my seat, I would still heartily recommend it to anyone looking for some good entertainment. If you enjoyed Minority Report or AI, I'd say it's a must see. It has some of the best elements from those two films. Overall I'd give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of a blend of other movies, but it works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is basically a little of "Minority Report", "Men in Black", "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace", and the story it was based on all roled up into one. Sometimes with a blend you get a foul tasting mess, but here you end up with a rather good movie, that could have been better, however, overall it was entertaining. A movie about a robot who may have committed murder focuses mostly on Will Smith's character. He does pretty good in the role, but I am thinking an older actor would have done a better job with the role, maybe a Bruce Willis or someone like that. Still Smith did better than I thought he would and his character was believable enough for me. The robots are very well done and the story is decent enough, though I think they could have trimmed it down maybe ten or so minutes. The effects are good and the action is good as well...though most of the best action scenes are at the tail end of the movie. There are a few twists and turns in the story as well and they work rather well too. All in all this movie is an entertaining summer movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, you do. Star Trek's Data was a successful robot that was human enough in character for viewers to care for it. It is rare that a movie can get an audience to care about a robot. I, Robot manages to do so because of the creative license it has taken in animating a plastic face to give it human expressions. I guess the viewing audience has accepted this concept from the morphing Terminator in T2, that a robot can assume complete facial features. But then again I didn't shed a tear when Arnie the terminator was liquidated. I,Robot is trying to be both a thought provoking science fiction story and a big budget action film at the same time. When Will Smith does his "Bad Boys" routine, it is incongruous with the Blade Runner-esque future world that he is surrounded in. The big dumb action scenes butt up against any attempt to be a stylish suspense film. Poor old Will keeps getting side-tracked by destroying freeways and buildings. Then there's the slap-in-the-forehead moment when we see Will's boss ask for him to turn in his badge. My god, the catering assistant could've pointed out that cliché is as old as fossil fuels. All credibility is lost when the movie stops to show a Converse Shoes commercial. We pay ever increasing admission fees for these movies, and more and more are we subjected to the one thing we leave our TV sets at home for - NO COMMERCIALS. It's bad enough that I walk into the auditorium a few minutes after the posted start time and they are showing regular TV advertisements. It's disgraceful.So amidst all this commercialism and standard explosions and chases, we are supposed to care about whether some dude committed suicide or not. But instead, I ended up caring more for Sonny, the CGI robot with convincing facial expressions and superblue eyes.

		<shortDescription>Better than I had expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was based on a lot of Asimov's ideas. As a mystery, it is a style that Asimov utilized. Apart from that, it had little to do with his collection of short stories whose title is used for the film or any of his related works. The three laws of robotics are there, as is Susan Calvin, depicted very similarly to the character in the book. The movie had a good mystery plot and human interest. The plot was similar to one that Asimov might have created, except that he never had a robot "overseer" running all the other robots. As a cat lover, I appreciated the brief appearance of a cat. Will Smith's character was human if not exactly likable. The most sympathetic character was the robot named Sonny.Overall I found the movie interesting, entertaining, and touching. Only the action sequences were disappointing. They were boring, because they were so predictable. The special effects were also excellently done. The ending also bothered me. The existence of all the robots in a ghetto was never explained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I, Slow Motion Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic story, one of my favorites, here come the robots, oh, but they're not what they seem. Isaac Asimov nailed one of the greatest plots around. I have no beefs with the plot. Will Smith, however, goes into slow motion whenever he does anything. Jumping off a motorcycle, slow motion, shooting some robots, slow motion, walking down his stairs, you get the picture. Several scenes in this movie would have been better off in real-time. Bridget Moynahan did a better job than I expected from a model, she has certainly graduated in her abilities since the, ahem, challenging role of a hot bartender in Coyote Ugly. Del Spooner (Will Smith) is an alright character, but don't get him confused with Jim West, Agent J, and Capt. Steve' Hiller (Independence Day). Will Smith has shown that he can act, in movies like The Legend Of Baggar Vance, and Ali, but too often he seems to fall back on being "The Black Hero Guy"stuck in a bad situation; i.e. Enemy Of The State. The Robots fights were sweet, no two ways about it, and all of the loose ends can be accounted for, with no noticeable plot holes. The thing that made me drop my jaw in disappointment was the ridiculous cinematics during the final battle scene; for no apparent reason, several times, the camera swung around Will Smith two or three times really really fast. Now, CGI-assisted camera effects can be sweet, like, for example, in Bad Boys 2 when the camera swings around Will Smith while he's shooting bad guys through the doors, or in What Lies Beneath when the camera when beneath the floor and looked up at Michelle Pfeiffer's body. When utilized correctly these effects can add a lot to a film, but the camera spun around Smith several times then when back to where it started from... you couldn't even tell what was happening while it was spinning, it didn't add anything to the film, if fact it took away a few seconds of cool action and replaced it with an expensive CGI blur. But stupid cinematics aside, great movie, plots twists out your ear, and unexpectedly gripping action sequences. If you see only one movie this year in which Will Smith fights evil robots, make it this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably better on my part that I have never read any of Isaac Assimov's books. So many have torn this movie up regarding that. I just love the action and it has a lot of suspense too. Will Smith as an old school looking kinda detective plays it well albeit some corny lines which I expected in this kind of movie. Since I didn't read Assimovs books and quite frankly it doesn't really matter to me whether or not the movie follows the book. I just love seeing a good sci fi action flick . If your going to be so anal about a movie then we can analyze lord of the rings all 3 parts and go into how much they left out or changed. This movie is raking in the bucks so it must be doing something right to get people to see it again and again. Spectacular special effects abound with lots of eye candy. Too bad James Cromwell is wasted in a rather small part(he is a very talented actor and he is barely on screen) Overall though I give it an 8 of 10. Action packed blockbuster material and Will Smith again shows that he can pull in the crowds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much better than the previews led me to believe. Will Smith was the weakest link - not the paranoid robot hater that his character needed. Often times he seemed to forget if he was supposed to be the funny, likable guy or the brooding fallen hero. Someone a little darker - like Jude Law or Benicio Del Toro would have fit better. Instead he came off like a misplaced MIB agent.Robots were good, including Sonny ("I did not kill him") - believable and interesting.The action sequences - surprisingly good.The ending was a little "sequelesque" cryptic - but otherwise interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sction. Adventure. Things exploding. Light romance. Humor. Drama. All the ingredients for a good summer movie. And this is one of the best.I have to be honest, if this came out during non-summer months, it'd do well, sure, but probably not as well as it is now. I could be wrong, that's just what seems to be the trend with most sci-fi movies that I know of. But in no way do I consider myself an expert on this stuff.Acting is great - Will Smith gets some great one-liners, as usual. There are a few moments that give a sense of deja-vu (MIB, anyone?) but not many.I enjoyed this. And I think I may read the Assimov book it's based on, though I already know the two are bound to be different. It always happens with movies, that there are differences between them and the stories they are based on. Still, if a good movie leads to a good story, or vice versa, there's no harm done. I hope that's the case with I, Robot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I expected - unfortunately</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was made for the average person who knows little or nothing about the original story and probably doesn't care, which is okay. The basic precepts of the story were maintained and anything beyond that was creative license. To me, it was simply a vehicle for Will Smith to continue his Bad Boy image, which appears to appeal to a great deal of people who see films as simply a format for action/thrillers with little depth or solid characterization. But, hey, if you're into a popcorn diet, so be it.The CGI effects proved that it is becoming a near science in the film industry and, for that, I must say I am pleased. The generation of computer whiz kids that are behind that aspect of films (along with bigger budgets to support it) are turning out some rather spectacular productions. Had this been available in the 50's when only B quality films were being made, some of them may have been of much better quality than they were.With that in mind, I'll give the film a 5 out of 10 base almost entirely on the special effects. Now, if someone in Hollywood will just wake up to the fact that it takes much more than that to make a great and lasting film. As a suggestion, it might be of value to them to sit down and watch Bladerunner before tackling another Sci/Fi (shrug!) project. It may not be the best SF film ever made, but it's hands down my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie, and plan on seeing it at least once more in the theatre and then buying the DVD. In fact, I wanted to stay right there in my seat and watch it again immediately. It kept me interested from the beginning all the way to the unexpected end. Will Smith was terrific. Certainly not the best movie I have ever seen, but one of the most enjoyable. And one that the whole family can see together. The special effects were awesome, though I could have done without some of the more dizzying camera work. I would love to see a behind the scenes "making of" type documentary to learn more about how everything was done; hopefully this will be on the DVD when it comes out.I'm not a big fan of sci-fi, but the previews I had seen of this movie are what attracted me to it. When I read the early reviews last week, I almost decided not to see it. I'm so glad I changed my mind. If you're looking for a movie version of Isaac Asimov's robot stories, you'll probably be disappointed. If you're looking for a fun movie (that happens to be about robots) with lots of action and a murder mystery with a few twists, then don't miss this one. And if you're a Will Smith fan like me, well, that's a bonus. Even Will Smith can't save a bad movie (remember Wild, Wild West? - yuck!), but this isn't a bad movie by a long, long shot. I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I, Robot -- I, Want Refund</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie serves as a good way to judge critics. Any critic who likes this movie should be completely ignored from now on. This is bad, bad, bad. I didn't think Will Smith could get a worse script than the plot of "Independence Day" where he has to dock with the alien ship to give it a computer virus. But "I, Robot" tops it. First, you should get up and walk out of any movie that starts with a dream sequence, especially when it concludes with a dumb look of the person having the dream upon waking up. Second, the movie, I think, sets the record for the number of product placements in the first five minutes. It's a blatant slap in the face to the audience that lets them know right off the bat this movie is purely about making money rather than making a good movie. It's fitting that the end of the film says the same with the obvious conclusion that there will be a sequel. Wow, is the plot bad. It's not even worthy of a made-for-TV movie on the SciFi channel. Many parts don't really connect and the explanations are laughable. For instance, the idea that there would be a whole section on the outskirts of town with old robots -- that are still active -- is ludicrous. I mean, why would you leave this "junk" on? Wouldn't the battery at least go out on these old robots? And I couldn't believe when it is revealed that robot-hating Will Smith has -- you guessed it, a robot arm! Add another cliché to your movie glossary, Ebert. Perhaps worst of all is Shia LaBoeuf's character. After a great performance in "Holes," I find it hard to believe his career has tanked this soon that he has to resort to such a meaningless and dumb bit part. This movie is so unoriginal, the robot's voice sounds like every other robotic voice going back to "2001." "I, Robot" is by far the worst major movie of the summer so far. It is all flash, and the flash isn't even that great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything you want, Sci Fi fan or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've heard the arguments that Proyas' film is not true Asimov. However, unless you're a die-hard purist, or just hate Will Smith in general, this movie has everything you could want in good sci-fi, action, summer movie, built for entertainment. The face-actors do a pretty good job carrying their part, Alan Tudyk comes across very well as Sonny, and the animation and effects of the robots themselves are top-notch. Sure, there's huge holes, and scenes where you will grimmace and say "why in the world did the director see the need to do that?!" But give me any recent film that doesn't have those in it? The good thing is that if you're not a Sci Fi fan, the story travels pretty well enough to drift you past the nerdy parts so you don't have to consider what "similacra" is. If you are a Sci Fi fan, there's certainly enough techno-fun to peak interests, and keep the action scenes from dominating the experience for you. The only thing it doesn't have is much of a love story. Oh well. The rest is pretty good. The eminent danger from the robots is forced pretty hard, and shoved down your throat, although not bad enough to trash the whole movie. That's the only real reason I'm NOT giving the movie a solid A+. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed it, loved the job they did with Sonny, enjoyed the story, and yes I even HAVE read Asimov's book. Don't care that they're different. The premise remains, and that's enough for me. Good film, not tremendous, very enjoyable for both dummies and brainiacs. B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably better on my part that I have never read any of Isaac Assimov's books. So many have torn this movie up regarding that. I just love the action and it has a lot of suspense too. Will Smith as an old school looking kinda detective plays it well albeit some corny lines which I expected in this kind of movie. Since I didn't read Assimovs books and quite frankly it doesn't really matter to me whether or not the movie follows the book. I just love seeing a good sci fi action flick . If your going to be so anal about a movie then we can analyze lord of the rings all 3 parts and go into how much they left out or changed. This movie is raking in the bucks so it must be doing something right to get people to see it again and again. Spectacular special effects abound with lots of eye candy. Too bad James Cromwell is wasted in a rather small part(he is a very talented actor and he is barely on screen) Overall though I give it an 8 of 10. Action packed blockbuster material and Will Smith again shows that he can pull in the crowds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much better than the previews led me to believe. Will Smith was the weakest link - not the paranoid robot hater that his character needed. Often times he seemed to forget if he was supposed to be the funny, likable guy or the brooding fallen hero. Someone a little darker - like Jude Law or Benicio Del Toro would have fit better. Instead he came off like a misplaced MIB agent.Robots were good, including Sonny ("I did not kill him") - believable and interesting.The action sequences - surprisingly good.The ending was a little "sequelesque" cryptic - but otherwise interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My girlfriend and I just got back from seeing I,Robot and its actually pretty good. I'm not much of a fan of will smith but he did pretty good in this film. I went in not expecting this to be good but near the middle I was really enjoying this.If u like sci-fi movies or will smith u will definitely like this, the special effects were well done and the actions was good. The pace was really good and it entertained me. This movie also takes acouple of good twists, one second u think the predictable is going to happen, and then something else just pops out of nowhere. This is not the best sci-fi movie i have ever seen, but it executed well enough to be something different and entertaining. 8/10 for me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than expected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoilers ahead**I am not familiar with Isaac Asimov's short stories on which the movie is based on (although I hear they're quite good). However, the idea of dealing with rebellious machines is not a concept that is foreign to movies. Despite that I still can't help but like I, Robot.The movie itself is a mix of drama, mystery, and action. One movie reviewer interviewed on CNN called that mix a weakness; that the movie can't decide what it wants to be. I on the other hand consider that one of the movie's greatest strengths. I, Robot takes place in the year 2035, where a scientist who works for U.S. Robotics is killed. Investigators initially conclude that it was a suicide, but Detective Del Spooner (played by Will Smith) does not believe that explanation, and thinks that there is something going on, specifically with the robots that the scientist was working on. This flair of mystery and suspense in finding out who-dun-it, and what will happen next is what kept me glued to my seat more than anything else.Visually, the set design bares some resemblance to Minority Report. But where Minority Report's sets are full of curves, and clear glass, I, Robot has a far more metallic and "dirtier" feel to it, which works quite well. The robot animation was quite well done, but ironically the graphics for the lower model NS-4 robots actually look more realistic than the higher model NS-5 robots that are the movie's centerpiece. The action scenes themselves are very well done, with plenty of guns ablazing against killer robots, although admittedly they did over use the bullet-time effect a little.Alan Tudyk, who plays Sonny the robot in the movie, deserves some credit for his acting chops. Now you may be asking, why should a computer animated creation be credited for acting? Well, similar to Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies, Alan wore a special green suit, which the animators used to draw every movement and facial expression he makes. His effort shows through remarkably well in the movie. At times, you can't help but feel something for what Sonny is going through. Will Smith also does a good job in this movie, although it does take some time to warm up to his character. Some critics accuse Del Spooner for being a stereotypical cop, but I disagree. Spooner can often be temperamental, but he has a sarcastic personality that the viewer will quickly like.As good as I, Robot is however, it is not without its flaws. For example, there is this one scene where a mob of people confronts the rebelling NS-5's. You would think that seeing what these robots were capable of in terms of physical abilities that the average person wouldn't be dumb enough to go toe to toe with them, but they do.I, Robot combines the best elements of previous movies, such as Minority Report's set designs, A.I.'s sentimentality, Blade Runner's philosophical pondering, and the Matrix's and Terminator's action scenes. Yet, this movie manages to take these elements, and make them their own, which is more than I could say about another recently released movie, King Arthur. Next to Spider-Man 2, I, Robot goes beyond standard sci-fi offerings, and is arguably one of the most entertaining movies this summer, and perhaps the entire year.I give I, Robot a solid 8/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is just what you see in the trailer; Detective Del Spooner (Smith) investigates an apparent homicide committed by a robot, a supposed impossibility. During the course of his investigation he runs into Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood, revising his ?science is God!' turn from Disturbing Behavior), who runs the company that builds the robots, and Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynihan), one of the primary gurus who helps design them. While no one else believes the robot did it, Spooner is convinced, and as things unravel we begin to see that maybe he's on to something.Eye-popping visuals abound; Chicago in 2035 is a pretty hip place, full of sleek cars we'll never use and realistic-looking robots everywhere. Most of the future tech is handled well and is not too out there, which helps the movie a lot. There are no flying cars here and no vertical highways (a la Minority Report), though they do pull the stunt of saying `vintage 2004.' Some of the movie's design is derivative; the robot delivery behemoths greatly resemble their Star Wars counterparts, and the older series robots look like they could have stepped right out of Lucas' art department (a great concept has one painted with the Fed Ex logo as the ultimate delivery man). But enough of it is cool looking that parallels are mostly easily forgiven.Smith has a trickier time with Spooner. Sometimes he seems almost uncomfortable in the role, as if trying not to wisecrack is a strain for him. At certain points in the film he's just fine, and he certainly excels in the action sequences; but other times he seems like he's foundering. Moynihan is acceptable but doesn't display any flair as Susan; she's too cold for too long to really be accessible as a character. Ironically the movie is stolen by Sonny (Alan Tudyk), the alleged robot murderer. More human (and expressive) than his flesh-and-blood compatriots, Sonny grows more compelling as the film proceeds. Maybe there eventually will be an Oscar for Best Performance by a Synthespian someday, especially if they continue to outdo their real co-stars.Sadly, the plot borrows a lot of clichés (and a HUGE one from the old Marvel comics Star Wars, no less!) from a lot of places. The few plot ?twists' are easily seen a mile away, and there's no great suspense or mystery as we build toward the video-game inspired climax. Where I will give I,Robot credit is that it tries and nearly succeeds to be something we haven't seen in a LONG time ? a sci-fi movie that is more than just an action flick, a film that tries to make you think. I, Robot is not especially deep, but at least it attempts to have a brain, which is more than I can say for most movies I've seen this summer. I'd rather see a near miss at a thoughtful movie like this one than one that never even attempts it, like, say, Spiderman 2. I don't know that I,Robot will be everyone's cup of tea, and it certainly has its flaws; but for my money it tries very hard, and that's worth something, even if it doesn't always succeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>QUITE AN EXCITING RIDE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cool new look in the future, of the possiblity that how robots could be our friends. This film takes place in the year 2035, Detective Del Spooner(the ever so impersive Will Smith) has a personal hatred for robots, that came from a tragedy, which is now become a waking nightmare he can't seem to wake up from. Then he ask to come at a crime scene where a friendly robot scientists(James Cromwell) died from fallen from a high story building. Some say he commited suicide. But Del believes he was probably thrown. When Del catches a robot running from the scene. He soon believes that robot killed him. But everybody says the robots are our friends. Has he begins to investigate, to many turns begin to unravil. A really good sci-fi thriller. It is more then a action flick, it is also a conspiracy movie. Awesome effects and action. And terrific acting by Will Smith. Please you won't be dissapointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the story did not follow that of Sir Asimov's original stories, the premise and ideology was intact. I particularly liked how the story kept you on edge, not knowing for sure if "Sonny" was with or against Will Smith's character. And I thought Mr. Smith played his part very well, one of his best portrayals.I also liked the special effects, very realistic, quite authentic. The CGI was well blended into the 'real' imagery to the extent that I gave up looking for the flaws and simply accepted and appreciated the high quality provided for my viewing pleasure. And indeed it was. I do not go many movies more than once, this one will be one of the few exceptions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the Trailers Imply</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a solid movie. I suppose I'm at an age now where either I'm desensitized to most movie violence or it takes more to impress me. Either way, this movie did all the normal stuff. Lots of car chase, crash bang, turn the DOLBY DIGITAL ALL THE WAY UP explosions (we went to a post midnight digital showing) with the hero hanging on by one hand and saving the day just in the nick of time.IRobot gives a better futuristic vision than was achieved with Minority Report. It also does a good job of showing how things that are at one time "jaw dropping" technology, become every day taken for granted fixtures.This movie moves at a great pace and treats you like an intelligent being. The explanations are kept to a minimum and yet even my twelve year old understood it. Yes, we took her, and she felt sorry for the "poor robots", but she quickly got over that. For all that, she left not quite knowing who's side she was on and I thought that was a good thing. This movie does not end with all problems solved if for no other reason than to make "IRobot 2".I haven't read the book so I can't make a comparison there, but I felt this movie "borrowed" from a ton of other series and movies. The cars driving themselves from "The Sixth Day"; cars moving at incredible speeds every which way and sideways from "Minority Report"; A giant moving, talking, "everywhere-you-are-I-go" type head from Max Headrom (without the annoying stuttering); You'll see me over the hill at daybreak from "Lord of the Rings", and even the Nanites from "Star Trek" have a cameo appearance and do their job admirably.The robots are gleamingly pretty and I can see how people would fall in love with them. They kind of remind me of the first Imac's with colors and clear monitors, only they walk and talk and that reminds me EVERYONE and their grandmother got their advertising bid in on this one. I'll give a shout out to all the ones I remember just to let the advertisers know they did their job,Ovaltine Audi FedEx Converse Suzuki (from my husband and is reading over my shoulder as I type.)I'm sorry, DVD player people. Your name was prominently displayed at least three or four times, but I cannot remember who it was made by. Ah well. I'd also like to give a shout out to Little Tykes who must have, but probably did not, design the demolition bot. That thing deserved more screen time. It was awesome.The only this movie lacks is better dialogue, but I guess there wasn't much room to talk between all action. I have visions of a perfect script being ripped to shreds with only the best bits left in and a tearful writer clutching a fat paycheck. The robot had the best dialogue, Will Smith had the best one liners, and who the hell was that lady scientist? She was snoring boring. Or maybe it was just the character.Husband note: He says she was also the lady scientist in Blade 2. Ah hah, now I see a pattern. The white lady side-kick for the superhero black guy!I guess after Kill Bill (1 or 2, pick one), I'll never like movies again where all the women do is sit around, solve all the problems and then get rescued. Boring. Heck, even Aunt May kicks a little butt in Spiderman. Yet we're back to the typical damsel in distress story line here.I also see that Hollywood has not evolved all that much. If the main characters at the end are of the same race and different genders, we'll have a side love-story with the kiss in the sunset at the end. If the characters are of different races or same gender, then we're left with the "friendship that will never broken" ending. Like the difference between the end of the Pelican Brief, movie vs. book. OK. Whatever. Who cares right? (Pssst....I do.)Ah well, you can't have everything but this movie sure does try.Overall, I'd give IRobot B+. OK A-, because Will Smith naked is worth a boost in the grading curve every time. Jada is one lucky woman. ;)</fullReview>

Golem acted exactly as you expected a deranged evil guy to act (don't get me wrong, I loved Golem)... but when Sonny talked, he surprised you.Sonny is one of the best characters that I have ever experienced in any book or movie. How this character pulls off being completely deep and complicated, yet have that child-like innocence is a stroke of genius.I have to give the Writers, Proyas, and Alan Tudyk's spot on performance, many Kudos...The purists that were trashing the movie before it even came out were completely wrong.In my opinion... it was Asimovian in that it takes the 3 laws, sets up a mystery as to how the laws can seem to be circumvented, and then when the mystery is solved it causes us to question if or how humanity can overcome it's own short-sightedness to be able to responsibly deal with our own technological progress.I do not fear computers. I fear lack of them.--Isaac Asimov (1920 - 1992)The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not " Eureka !" but "That's funny...

		<shortDescription>Worth a look *** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the summer thrills at the theater slowly winding down, I Robot is certainly not the most refreshing sci-fi I've seen lately (like Minority Report) but it does succeed on a lot of levels.Will Smith is Del Spooner, a dedicated police officer who's assignments are homicide. Del is likable, smart and caring, unlike the idiot police officer he played in the horrible Bad Boys and the even dumber sequel.The year is 2035 and robots are the key to the nations economy. Virtually all tasks large and small are done with robots with three rules that cannot be broken.1.A robot must not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to be harmed.2.A robot must obey orders givin it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.3.A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.For reasons unknown, (well for the first 45 minutes) Spooner is the only one that doesn't trust them. (A clue is given at the very beginning but is not revealed until later.) When called to the scene of an apparent suicide by the creator of robots, (Dr. Alfred Lanning) Del is unsurprisingly convinced that it may be murder by the head robot Sonny. Though Smith is given top billing, Sonny pulls a Tommy Lee Jones (his character Gerard in The Fugitive) and slyly steals the rest of the show.The action rarely lets up and really gets going within the last 30 minutes and especially when the robots go completely beserk (caused by the one you don't expect) and director Alex Proyas who gave us The Crow and the vastly underrated Dark City has done a decent job of giving us what Steven Spielberg brilliantly did in Minority Report; good characters, good effects and the story, convincing.P.S. I'm sorry Mr. Roger Ebert but 52 million just proved you were wrong again. (see his review of this film and Scooby Doo)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never comment on movies that I think are bad because if you can't say anything nice then don't say anything at all.Quite a few people have complained about this movie, they find factual flaws, I mean, come on what do you expect? Someone actually commented that Chicago will not be as advanced by 2035 and that is a flaw. Hello? This is a movie about robots that are super intelligent and super fast and super strong and very agile. Is that anywhere close to our reality? No, wake up, it's a movie, not reality! It's suppose to be fun to watch and I think people should watch it. Don't expect any great message to be sent to you which will open up your minds and you will end up being a better person. It's entertainment. You want to enlighten yourself, go read a book, something serious, maybe a classic.Here's what this movie also had that you probably don't see in the trailer cause the trailer shows you that it's got LOTS OF action, which it does, but it's also got suspense elements and some good comedy. The suspense in this movie is well done, you actually become interested in knowing who the culprit is and you don't get bored. On top of that, it's funny, Will Smith is a very sharp and witty guy, he always plays the sharp and witty guy, and it's fun to watch him be the sharp and witty guy. Plus we have a very small part played by Shia Lebeouf, the kid from Even Stevens, he delivers lines really well. I wish he had more time on screen with Will, they were really funny together. On top of all of this, obviously, it's got action. I mean tell me one person that will look away when you see this Will Smith in his futuristic AUDI driving in a tunnel at amazingly high speed with 5 robots trying to kill him. Even people who complained about it as being bad action didn't look away so I am sure you won't find it dull and boring either. And everything is well paced, it's not like the movie slows down. You see some action, then you see something serious, something emotional and then something funny and then you're back to some more action. There is no dull or boring period in the movie, which makes it fun to watch.People stop complaining about this movie. It's a better movie than I had expected. I like it and I am almost sure you will too if all you want to do is go have a good time watching a good movie.</fullReview>

How this character pulls off being completely deep and complicated, yet have that child-like innocence is a stroke of genius.I have to give the Writers, Proyas, and Alan Tudyk's spot on performance, many Kudos...The purists that were trashing the movie before it even came out were completely wrong.In my opinion... it was Asimovian in that it takes the 3 laws, sets up a mystery as to how the laws can seem to be circumvented, and then when the mystery is solved it causes us to question if or how humanity can overcome it's own short-sightedness to be able to responsibly deal with our own technological progress.I do not fear computers. I fear lack of them.--Isaac Asimov (1920 - 1992)The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not " Eureka !" but "That's funny... "--Isaac Asimov (1920 - 1992)Jokes of the proper kind, properly told, can do more to enlighten questions of politics, philosophy, and literature than any number of dull arguments.--Isaac Asimov, scientist and writer (1920-92)Thank You Mr. Proyas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a look *** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the summer thrills at the theater slowly winding down, I Robot is certainly not the most refreshing sci-fi I've seen lately (like Minority Report) but it does succeed on a lot of levels.Will Smith is Del Spooner, a dedicated police officer who's assignments are homicide. Del is likable, smart and caring, unlike the idiot police officer he played in the horrible Bad Boys and the even dumber sequel.The year is 2035 and robots are the key to the nations economy. Virtually all tasks large and small are done with robots with three rules that cannot be broken.1.A robot must not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to be harmed.2.A robot must obey orders givin it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.3.A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.For reasons unknown, (well for the first 45 minutes) Spooner is the only one that doesn't trust them. (A clue is given at the very beginning but is not revealed until later.) When called to the scene of an apparent suicide by the creator of robots, (Dr. Alfred Lanning) Del is unsurprisingly convinced that it may be murder by the head robot Sonny. Though Smith is given top billing, Sonny pulls a Tommy Lee Jones (his character Gerard in The Fugitive) and slyly steals the rest of the show.The action rarely lets up and really gets going within the last 30 minutes and especially when the robots go completely beserk (caused by the one you don't expect) and director Alex Proyas who gave us The Crow and the vastly underrated Dark City has done a decent job of giving us what Steven Spielberg brilliantly did in Minority Report; good characters, good effects and the story, convincing.P.S. I'm sorry Mr. Roger Ebert but 52 million just proved you were wrong again. (see his review of this film and Scooby Doo)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a better movie than I had expected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never comment on movies that I think are bad because if you can't say anything nice then don't say anything at all.Quite a few people have complained about this movie, they find factual flaws, I mean, come on what do you expect? Someone actually commented that Chicago will not be as advanced by 2035 and that is a flaw. Hello? This is a movie about robots that are super intelligent and super fast and super strong and very agile. Is that anywhere close to our reality? No, wake up, it's a movie, not reality! It's suppose to be fun to watch and I think people should watch it. Don't expect any great message to be sent to you which will open up your minds and you will end up being a better person. It's entertainment. You want to enlighten yourself, go read a book, something serious, maybe a classic.Here's what this movie also had that you probably don't see in the trailer cause the trailer shows you that it's got LOTS OF action, which it does, but it's also got suspense elements and some good comedy. The suspense in this movie is well done, you actually become interested in knowing who the culprit is and you don't get bored. On top of that, it's funny, Will Smith is a very sharp and witty guy, he always plays the sharp and witty guy, and it's fun to watch him be the sharp and witty guy. Plus we have a very small part played by Shia Lebeouf, the kid from Even Stevens, he delivers lines really well. I wish he had more time on screen with Will, they were really funny together. On top of all of this, obviously, it's got action. I mean tell me one person that will look away when you see this Will Smith in his futuristic AUDI driving in a tunnel at amazingly high speed with 5 robots trying to kill him. Even people who complained about it as being bad action didn't look away so I am sure you won't find it dull and boring either. And everything is well paced, it's not like the movie slows down. You see some action, then you see something serious, something emotional and then something funny and then you're back to some more action. There is no dull or boring period in the movie, which makes it fun to watch.People stop complaining about this movie. It's a better movie than I had expected. I like it and I am almost sure you will too if all you want to do is go have a good time watching a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this film. In this unofficial prequel to the matrix (eerily similar to one of the animatrix shorts) a sci-fi lover will be taken in by the futuristic environments and the not often enough seen robot-on-robot fighting. Will Smith was not over-the-top in this one and gives a fairly subtitle performance, which allows the above-average narrative and intense action sequences to take over the film rather than an individual. The film doesn't necessarily have many twists but provides the audience to assume multiple alternative plot lines as they watch. This film is much better than "A.I." as it conjures up notions of "Robocop" meets "Terminator".</fullReview>

This blockbuster is exactly that, a summer blockbuster.The plot in this movie dragged along at time, but the overall movie when balanced out with special effects makes the slow plot bearable.I enjoyed this movie. The idea of programming robots with the "3 Laws" was genius. Their adherence to these laws forces the actions of this movie. I don't want to give away any of the movie, but beleive you me, it is worth watching.I will give this movie an 8 out of 10.

		<fullReview>In the future, a homicide detective (Smith) investigates the apparent suicide of the founder of robotics (James Cromwell). He has his doubts, and they flare into suspicion when he finds a strange robot lurking around the crime scene. Nothing particularly special, but a decent crime story set in the future where robots are integrated into daily life. Doesn't have a lot to do with Asimov's book, although some elements are shoehorned in. More importantly, here and there the writers manage to capture the spirit of Asimov's work -- some of the dialog has the same earnest, somewhat naive quality one associates with Asimov. Smith is not one of my favorite actors, but he rings a few interesting changes on the cliched "rebellious cop bucking the system" role. The rest are routine, although I liked the actor they based the robot on: his voice acting, especially, is sweet and convincingly innocent.The solution to the whodunit is somewhat surprising, although once we know the bad guy the climax becomes a retread of countless "insane computer killing humanity to save it" stories. On the other hand, the action sequences, particularly here at the finale as our heroes race to stop The Evil Computer, are extremely well done. (The battle between robots is a highlight.) It's not exactly enough to make you forget you've seen it many times before, but it's close. Despite all the money thrown at it, this is a relatively small movie in spirit, limited in scope and ambition. I wouldn't be surprised to see a spin-off tv series a few years down the pike -- it's that kind of movie. But I still liked it. It makes sense, the story's paced well, the action is exciting and the movie poses it's questions without giving any simple answers, which was nice. A mild recommendation.</fullReview>

But, "robot" is technically the wrong term to use for these things. Technically, they're "androids".I'd give it a 6.5/10 stars.</fullReview>

But the writing is awful, as one would expect from the writer of "Lost in Space" and "Batman &amp; Robin". Why do people keep hiring this guy? The Hansel and Gretel thing is ridiculous, the whole parallel between prejudice against Blacks and prejudice against robots is like something out of a bad EC comic book, and the characterization is totally unbelievable and uninvolving. Needless to say, there is almost no relationship between the movie and the book. Why does Hollywood pay a lot of money for the rights to a classic novel, and then ignore all the things that made the novel a classic?Rick Norwood sfsite</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On many levels this is just a typical summer blockbuster movie, but it does it well. Relatively tight writing, and plot. The story is by Isaac Asimov, but it's only loosely based on that work. It borrows more from Philip K. Dick novels (Bladerunner, Minority Report, Imposter, etc.) than from Asimov. The future settings are at once familiar and unfamiliar, like Dick's movies often are, since they are usually set in the not too distant future.Characters are somewhat familiar action-movie types, but somewhat toned down to make them a little more realistic and human. Will Smith is looking quite a bit older and more mature here than in other movies. He sort of combines his characters from Bad Boys and Men In Black for this one.I did figure out most of the twists in the story even before it happened, but there were a few that I didn't foresee. Definitely view it at the theatre, or rent it on DVD (preferably with a good home theatre system).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly I enjoyed this film although this may be partially due to the fact that I was a gorgeous woman. We cuddled up in the front row and watched a 20 foot tall Will Smith battle robots. I was a bit skeptical of this film at first, but the Will Smith humor, special effects, story line, and characters make it an enjoyable sci-fi adventure. Things are quick and to the point with no bullcrap scenes that are ever-present in most movies made today. I was quite pleased with this film and would recommend it to the whole family. As long as the young ones are able to handle sci-fi violence and some strong language. Other than that, this movie was very good, but is probably only watchable once or twice at most. Some things about the movie don't make much sense, but I suppose this is intentional because most sci-fi stuff is a little bizarro.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, Robot was one of those big summer movies that you saw the trailer for and knew just about how good it was going to be. The hype would try and build it up, it would claim to have a plot, but you knew what it all was going to come down to was Will Smith shooting some CG robots.If you go into the movie knowing that, you'll get a little bit more out of your movie buck out of this film.Throughout this movie, what stuck with me most was the horrendous lack of acting ability. You'll see a lot of other people in the trailers...but really, if your name wasn't Will Smith or Bridget Moynahan and you were in this movie, you're on screen maybe, 5-10 minutes tops. Will surprisingly botches a role he's done so many times before, the unorthodox cop who's got a hunch. Half the movie it looked like he had a bad head cold or something, and he just wasn't able to deliver his lines properly. All he had to do was summon up Mike Lowry from Bad Boys, and he would have had it done. Bridget Moynahan on the other hand, put on the worst fake "overcome by sorrow" display I've seen in a movie in a long time.I don't know if it was the acting or the directors saying, "No, no, you're supposed to be going from completely calm to almost moved to tears!" but, it wasn't good.The CG and the plot save this from being awful. The plot is average. Which in this movie, passes for a good thing. That's not to say there aren't plot holes...Will's reason for distrusting robots is stupid, laughingly so. He blames a robot for making a poor judgment a situation while neglecting the fact that a regular human was completely incapable of GETTING TO THE POSITION OF MAKING THAT SAME DECISION.Then in the climactic final battle, 2 groups have to team up to achieve their end goal. The call for security goes up, and Team A has hundreds upon hundreds of robot pursuers. Team B, who is in the same building...exactly 2 robot pursuers.The robots do a good job of looking fairly menacing at times, so, kudos to the CG team for figuring how to make them look as innocuous as iMacs and yet as threatening as any other good swarming menace in film.So, contrary to what other people are saying, this is not a good action flick. You don't want to turn off your mind. You just want to toughen up your skin, so you can tolerate some miserable acting. Leave your mind on so you can take in the story a bit, and just keep waiting for that one part where Chi McBride does his thang with the pump action shotgun. Rock on, Chi.6/10.</fullReview>

I am looking for a movie that will entertain me and give me something different to think about for a little while after I have left the theater. I am not surprised if the things I see in one movie end up in another movie considering that many times the same people could be working on this SCI-FI flic as well as the others that have been released this year. Matrix raised the bar on action sequences. Now some time will have to pass before someone else comes up with an idea to top that.As far as acting goes, most stars in Action and Sci-fi flics are not the greatest actors. Stallone is not that good, but he played the underdog or the outcast. Someone that people could relate to or at least feel sympathy for or make the average joe say,"Hey, that could be me.". Schwarzennegar is another not so great actor, but, he played characters that made you wish you were that strong, that tough, that indestructible. Bruce Willis is a better actor that the other two, but his characters were always getting their butts kicked to the point they were bleeding from head to toe. Jackie Chan has more than enough action, but there is almost no room for acting. Some movies they did were better than others, but each one had his own style and I would not want one to try to copy the other.Now I have enjoyed all of Will Smith's movies. I find that he is doing a great job of letting you know what his character is all about. I,Robot is the first movie for him where his name is standing out there by itself. I think he did a real good job. If anyone has a problem with the way he acts try to remember that all the Action and Sci-fi main characters in almost all the movies seen have attitudes, do plenty of wisecracks and jokes and always have a bitter past that they would rather forget. You keep going Will.The C.G.I. and other special effects in the movie go like this. If you see something in the movie that you have seen before in other movies, what are the chances that the effects for those different movies were done by the same company? It takes time to come up with something that takes the effects quality to the next level. I'm willing to wait for the next new approach. But for this movie I did like the C.G.'s because the moves that Sonny the Robot did were very well done as well as the movements of the other robots. I was able to follow the actions and the facial behavior was a memorable touch.I also left there thinking about the three laws as well as how they could be applied, best and worst case situations. It also led me into thoughts about intelligence, independent thought, free will, and possible outcomes of final decisions made as well as who would be in control of it all. Would anyone be able to have control? It also makes you consider that fine line between being in service to someone and being their slave. What purpose would man have with self thinking robots able to do what we do for a living? Do we cease to be useful? Then I got something to eat. After all, it's a movie.Go be entertained. Spend a couple of hours separated from the real world and find an idea to play around with in your head. See I,ROBOT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. I guess I have learned from my spouse that when I relax and accept the dinosaurs, Jurassic Park is a cool movie. Well, likewise, once I accepted the robots, this was a cool movie. Yep, I can argue a lot about the social, environmental and technological conditions of 2035, but the movie has to move along. And in a nutshell, it does. Will Smith gives his expected smooth, tongue-in-cheek quipping performance in a noticeably beefed-up (post-Ali) frame. With a little edge, he plays the well-worn movie schtick of the persistent protagonist who can see the sky falling when no one else has a clue and thereby is ultimately busted in rank only to be reluctantly redeemed by being correct. There were also a few fight/action scenes that defied physics (a pet-peeve) which were balanced by a few well-time-released plot reveals that left you unable to be a dead-on ending predictor. As for the robot, Trekkies have been around that block a few times with Mr. Data, but the special effects are good. Asimov purists may pan it but the pop culture will eat it up.</fullReview>

Would anyone be able to have control? It also makes you consider that fine line between being in service to someone and being their slave. What purpose would man have with self thinking robots able to do what we do for a living? Do we cease to be useful? Then I got something to eat. After all, it's a movie.Go be entertained. Spend a couple of hours separated from the real world and find an idea to play around with in your head. See I,ROBOT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>fun, with a story that paces itself without blowing a load up front and then muddling along forever; a few nice surprises; lots of well-managed action tension; an ending i didn't see coming; JUST a couple of emotional tweaks, and all the loose ends tied up. i thought the special effects were the best i've seen so far- some were so good i laughed out loud. also, Proyas created a believable environment, visually and otherwise.i knew i wasn't going to be seeing an Asimovian filmation, but **possible spoiler coming** the bad guy's logic IS impeccable and faithful to the book I, Robot's original themes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My 13 year old nephew loved this, but I can't believe this cheese ball film is generating any kind of serious discussion from anyone over the age of 13, let alone some of the decent reviews it's been getting.There's nothing worse than sci fi movies that make the future look cheesy. Blade Runner got it right, so did Proyas in The Crow and Dark City, but I, Fembot reminded me more of Arnold's Sixth Day or even the original Logan's Run. To make matters worse the CGI looked bad. Even the cars looked like cartoons, let alone the bad robots that never looked 3 dimensional. Did anyone have the feeling that we saw these Droid battles in Phantom Menace? And did anyone notice that Gangs of New York shot when the tough street kids were getting ready to fight the bots? And what was with Smith's hip hop gangsta strut? But my biggest question is, since when do PG-13 movies have full nudity? OK, so it was his butt, but that shower scene wasn't a quick two second shot. And why didn't he have a steamy shower door like the chick did later in the film? I got the feeling that he worked out like a maniac for Ali and he wants to preserve his big pecs and buns before the roids wear off. But come on, that scene was the definition of the word gratuitous and doesn't belong in a PG-13 family summer film.The trailer was cheesy and so's the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from watching I Robot and felt it was a pretty good movie. I won't give anything away but I felt the story worked well and the action scenes were well done. I feel that CGI works much better with non human characters which is a plus for this movie.Will Smith wasn't completely over the top in his performance, which is a good thing. He has a few moments but you learn to expect it and just accept it. Many times the trailers give away the movie. I don't feel that was the case with this movie. I rate it a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie, not literary art. For a blockbuster popcorn movie, it's astonishing. Great technical achievement in having computer generated characters mix with human actors. Years ago an essayist predicted that Hollywood would abandon multi-million-dollar actors and use computer-generated actors instead ... getting close. The script seemed strong to me, adding to Asimov's original idea and premise, turning it into both a thought-provoking and watchable movie. I thought Will Smith was stronger than usual, an increase maturity without losing his sarcastic ways. I think that all-in-all, the Robot "Sonny" really does need to get an agent and increase his movie salary next time. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another mindless summer action movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely not. This movie, suggested by a book, is about robots taking over. Although that sounds like a pretty simple plot, it's deeper than what you might think. I'm careful not to include spoilers so that's all I'll say. In a couple parts Will Smith has his usual smart-ass/funny comments (like in ID4, and MIB) but in this movie he cuts those down quite a bit, leaving a more serious Will Smith (ie: Enemy of the State). The acting in this movie is surprisingly good, even the robot (Sonny) is very believable. The script is also very good, everything flows well nothing seems "scripted" (ie: as in the horrible Matrix Reloaded and Revolution scripts). I,Robot also has it's "Matrix" moments (bullet time effects/slow down), but uses them quite well. While this movie has a lot of special effects it's not relying on special effects to get the job done. The bottom line is this, don't go into the movie expecting a masterpiece, if you do you will be let down. If you don't you will be surprised at how good it is. My rating - 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film. Some people might get at this film for its lack of being like the book, but look at Bourne Identity and its films and books, they don't match, but still good adaption and story. The same goes for I, Robot. Other critics might complain of the graphics, but I grew up video games and graphics never really mattered to me. Just as long as the story held you in there. Take Half-Life. I play that all the time even though it's over 6 yrs old. For the story, it really shows how dependent we are on technology and how technology could take over us. This story (though written before Matrix) holds the same moral. Would have been nice if I, Robot had somekind of scary ending that would have been to some degree the beginning of the rise of machines mentioned in the Matrix trilogy. Well my only complaints of the film are really storyline issues. First off the whole setting in Chicago in 2035 seemed to early for some technology, but the robots could have been there. Look at video game AI. In less that 10 yrs, it has evolved a lot. The other problem dealt with the robots replacing humans in the workforce. If we all complain of Mexico, China, and India taking away our jobs, then humans will sure as hell not allow some robot take them. But in all I rate this film as A or 8 on the scale. Some things could be changed, but hey it's a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moose Hole - Review of I, Robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happened to the Big Willie America first fell in love with many summers ago? The former rapper and Fresh Prince of Bel-Air became the king of the sci-fi action genre with two back-to-back box office hits, Independence Day and Men In Black, after first making an image for himself on the big screen in Bad Boys, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. So what happened? Wild, Wild West, an unmitigated embarrassment for all those involved, went on to be one of the biggest box office flops of 1999 and forced Smith to concentrate on more low key roles in films like Ali and The Legend of Bagger Vance until the fallout from the disaster flick had passed over. Will Smith re-emerged on the summer scene with Men In Black II in 2002 and Bad Boys II in 2003, and though they weren't as critically, or even publicly, hailed as much as his earlier works, he proved once again that he was a box office draw when it came to a film's opening weekend, which is all that seems to matter now adays with fewer leggy films popping up at the box office.The story centers on one paranoid cop sent to investigate the first recorded murder committed by a robot. In the year 2035, the future of humanity is as bright and efficient as ever imagined. During this time, robots, once thought improbable several years ago, are now an every day commodity. In fact, the largest robotics distribution company in the world, USR, is set to launch its most highly advanced robot to date, the NS-5, to nearly every home in America. The shipment is so large that experts claim that there will be one robot for every five humans. To optimists this seems like a marvelous dream come true but to others, namely Detective Del Spooner, this is nothing short of a nightmare. After a freak accident several years earlier that left him haunted with images of the terrible event every night when he goes to bed, Detective Spooner has grown paranoid with the idea of humanity becoming too dependent on robots. One day, he is sent to investigate the 'apparent' suicide of Dr. Miles Hogenmiller, the man who created the Three Laws of Robotics and worked extensively with the NS-5 robots at the USR headquarters. Spooner dismisses the idea that Hogenmiller would kill himself and implicates a robot named Sonny who was found hiding in Hogenmiller's office and fled when the detective tried to question him. Everyone believes Detective Spooner has lost his mind for a robot can not bring harm to a human being since that would be a direct violation of the first Law of Robotics. If this were a violation of that law then there would be nothing to prevent the robots from turning against humanity and taking control of the world. Unfortunately, after a series of complicated events involving the NS-5 robots, Detective Spooner becomes more and more convinced that his once thought overwhelming paranoia may be the truth. The story for I, Robot, which was based on the 'I, Robot' anthology written by Isaac Asimov, is nothing more then the regurgitation of every other science fiction film with the concept of robots taking control of the world and destroying humanity. The difference with I, Robot is that the filmmakers lace the script with so much pretentious humor that most of it comes off flat and ultimately distracting from the film's supposed serious concept.One of the biggest compliments attributed to I, Robot is its concept of a relatively small cast, allowing the focus of the audience to center on the its main characters rather then distracting them with numerous side-characters that do nothing but clog up an already complex storyline. But that's where the kudos stop with several of those characters coming off as flawed or seriously misguided by the script. Will Smith, once again in his summer block-buster mode, gives an engaging performance as Detective Del Spooner, despite the character's noticeable flaws. Whether it's due to the way the script was written or the way Smith portrays the character, Spooner's wise-cracks are too over-the-top, with most of them, namely the one's early on in the film, failing to be the least bit humorous. Once you are able to look past that, Smith manages to the make the character quite interesting and mysterious with his emotions playing a prominent factor in his unpredictability. Alan Tudyk, who provided the voice work for the robot Sonny, does an adequate job with the limited material given to him but can't raise the character above anything more then a cheap CGI distraction. The problem with the character of Sonny is that the filmmakers attempt what director Steven Spielberg failed to do with Haley Joel Osment's character in A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, which was to present a robot that had dreams, felt emotions, and, in some weird way, possessed a soul. The reason this failed, and this stands true with I, Robot's attempt as well, is that when all is said and done, a robot is nothing more then highly advanced can-opener. You can build it up as much as you want, throw in some high-tech gizmos, and anything else you can think of but you won't be able to replicate anything remotely close to a human being with a soul. A soul is what makes humans unique above any other creature and nothing, not even by the hands of man, can duplicate that and place it inside something else, let alone a hunk of metal. And what was the point of Shia Le Beouf's character in this film other then being a pathetic attempt at comic-relief, something this film possesses too much of.Overall, as hard as I, Robot attempts to come off as brilliant vision of a futuristic utopia where all humanity has to do is look into the inner depths of our souls to live in peace and harmony, it comes off more along the lines of scientific mumbo-jumbo and computer-animated special effects run amok thrown into a blender at top speed resulting in nothing more then a garbled mess. Whether or not the film accurately projects the writings of Isaac Asimov, Robot's radical theories and story elements will go over most heads and those that do understand them will be disappointed by the lack of depth into how these conclusions were made. The special effects, though marveling at times, seem to be more the focus of the filmmakers then the script as nearly every scene seems to put more detail and concentration on the computer animation then how the story shapes out in the end. How can a film that seems as bad as this get any worse? By finishing it off with a final sequence that feels like the screen writers themselves didn't even know how to end this disaster. The filmmakers would have been better off just ending the film with Detective Spooner and Dr. Susan Calvin on top of the USR building looking out upon a rising sunset. Sound clichéd, doesn't it? Sure it does, but a clichéd ending, or any ending really, would have been a whole lot better then the perplexing sequence the ? You can't even call it a ending since the scene resolves nothing and just leaves the audience with more questions with no idea on how to answer them. Are we to assume there will be a sequel to answer them? What if the film bombs? What if there is no sequel? Then what? I, Robot may have seemed like a neat summer distraction, quite possibly even thought provoking, from the juiced up trailers and television spots but advertisements can be deceiving and they are no different with this film. If you aren't a fan of Will Smith or special effects outweighing the plot, save your money and rent either The Matrix or Terminator 2: Judgment Day ? It's practically the same thing only ten times better from everything this film presents.My Rating: ** ? out of 5 (Grade: D+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a fondness for Will Smith movies. Granted, I get to watch movies for free right now (employee benefits), but I thought it was a decent movie. The CGI in this movie is some of the most impressive work I've seen in awhile. For not one moment do you believe that the actors are staring at nothingness.WOW factor aside, the pacing in this movie was slightly off and the entire film feels empty. The filmmaker's vision of 2035 is shiny and dull. At least there weren't any flying cars in this one. As my friend and I departed the theater, he commented on how much this movie felt like a Dune novel. I didn't see any similarities, but maybe you will.In short, it's a decent film but only if you don't have to pay full admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Asimov's three laws of robotics comprise the only original component of this admittedly well-oiled sci-fi clone. Soldering together set-ups from (amongst others) Minority Report, Robocop and the entire Star Wars back catalogue, it's still a handsome and satisfying accompaniment to your popcorn.Ironically, the human characters are less three-dimensional than Sonny the CG droid (who, oh lordy, looks like Moby). Engagingly played though they are, we've seen them all a hundred times before, from the cop with a secret and his gruff but sympathetic captain to the frosty female scientist and the jabbering street kid. But it looks fantastic and scoots along quickly enough to overcome the plot holes, though blatant product-placement (how much did Converse pay for this ad?) takes some of the shine off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does a much better job of bringing Asimov to the screen than the previews lead one to believe. It draws its material from several different stories, primarily "Little Lost Robot" and "Robot Dreams." The robots are not evil; actually most of them are sympathetic, and their abnormal behavior is explained within the Three Laws. The biggest problem I had was with Bridget Moynahan as Dr. Calvin; she was much too emotional, sympathetic, good-looking, and fashionable. The robots were very well done and believable, especially the central robot character. Overall, it was an entertaining summer movie, and definitely NOT an atrocity committed upon Asimov's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The book, I, Robot wasn't really a single story, but rather a collection of robot stories (previous published) held together by a loose storyline. The original group of stories examined various problems and pitfalls inherent in the 3 Laws of Robotics. Thus, the movie worked as yet another 'story' in that collection. VIKI's extension of the First Law to humanity as a whole later became Asimov's Zeroth Law.I found the movie quite enjoyable. That the human characters were relatively shallow and showed little development bothered me not a whit. The character being developed was that of Sonny (and the other robots), which was a far more interesting concept, and quite in keeping with Asimov's book. Will Smith did a credible job of keeping his character light and amusing without detracting from the main focus of the movie, the robots. The CGI effects were awesome, far better than I was expecting. The pacing worked and the plot seemed to hold on to more surprises than I have come to expect from summer blockbusters. The goals of sci-fi are usually different from those of traditional movies. As sci-fi/action, I thought this was first-rate. Bladerunner it was not, but still full of merit. I gave it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the movie about 1 hour ago and loved it. Personally, I haven't enjoyed an action Sci-Fi movie this much since the first Matrix. I went into the theater kind of skeptical based on some of the reviews I read on this board. Once the film started rolling, my perception began to change. I would like to thank everyone on the board that down played this movie (through talk and numeric ratings). I hate going into a movie that has been all hyped up just to find out it wasn't that great (Spiderman 2 for example). This movie was down played, yet ended up over performing. The effects in I, Robot are simple amazing! I don't want you to take my opinion on the flick, just go and see it as a skeptic and tell me your thoughts after the fact.I, Robot, my summer movie pick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From ID4 to I-Robot one thing stays the same, Will Smith's comic timing, the quips in robot make it almost memorable, with a laughable plot line and under whelming character development the robots seem to feel more for this film than the actors. The political sub-plot and messiah theme ran short in the first 40 minutes with nowhere else to go but traditional action finale I-Robot finishes flat on its very mechanical back. The performances on the CG side came up short as well with all the best scenes taken to trailers where producers hoped to suck in the unknowing this film overall leaves so much to be desired it is a wonder that Smith still tries for the July Blockbuster. Let us not forget he brought us Wild Wild West and M.I.B. 2, and I-Robot is no better. The bad news is movie fans always have next summer.</fullReview>

I will not patronize this movie, and I will tell anyone who will listen, 'DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE'!R. Daneel Olivaw paraphrased I. Asimov the best,1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. And don't forget the Zeroeth law?. You know what it is?.. Who led the Universe to purported rebirth? Harry Seldon? No! R. Daneel.Who started 'Mankind' on his way? R. Daneel.This movie is a Hollywood Extravaganza. If you must see it, then do so. But!

		<shortDescription>How dare you, !!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, purportedly based on an I. Asimov collection of short stories, is so far off base as to be absurd. How dare you use the title, 'I, Robot'? It is so far from Asimov's dream of the 'life of robots' as the Sun is to Alpha Centauri.Who let this happen? I, for one, Intend to find out! I will not patronize this movie, and I will tell anyone who will listen, 'DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE'!R. Daneel Olivaw paraphrased I. Asimov the best,1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. And don't forget the Zeroeth law?. You know what it is?.. Who led the Universe to purported rebirth? Harry Seldon? No! R. Daneel.Who started 'Mankind' on his way? R. Daneel.This movie is a Hollywood Extravaganza. If you must see it, then do so. But! Make sure you know, 'This' was not Isaac's idea of a universe with robots?.. If it was, you would know it.Isaac would be turning over in his grave, if he knew about this movie??Signed, A perpetual Will Smith fan, But even more so, An I Asimov fan!!!!! Bart</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film. Some people might get at this film for its lack of being like the book, but look at Bourne Identity and its films and books, they don't match, but still good adaption and story. The same goes for I, Robot. Other critics might complain of the graphics, but I grew up video games and graphics never really mattered to me. Just as long as the story held you in there. Take Half-Life. I play that all the time even though it's over 6 yrs old. For the story, it really shows how dependent we are on technology and how technology could take over us. This story (though written before Matrix) holds the same moral. Would have been nice if I, Robot had somekind of scary ending that would have been to some degree the beginning of the rise of machines mentioned in the Matrix trilogy. Well my only complaints of the film are really storyline issues. First off the whole setting in Chicago in 2035 seemed to early for some technology, but the robots could have been there. Look at video game AI. In less that 10 yrs, it has evolved a lot. The other problem dealt with the robots replacing humans in the workforce. If we all complain of Mexico, China, and India taking away our jobs, then humans will sure as hell not allow some robot take them. But in all I rate this film as A or 8 on the scale. Some things could be changed, but hey it's a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moose Hole - Review of I, Robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happened to the Big Willie America first fell in love with many summers ago? The former rapper and Fresh Prince of Bel-Air became the king of the sci-fi action genre with two back-to-back box office hits, Independence Day and Men In Black, after first making an image for himself on the big screen in Bad Boys, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. So what happened? Wild, Wild West, an unmitigated embarrassment for all those involved, went on to be one of the biggest box office flops of 1999 and forced Smith to concentrate on more low key roles in films like Ali and The Legend of Bagger Vance until the fallout from the disaster flick had passed over. Will Smith re-emerged on the summer scene with Men In Black II in 2002 and Bad Boys II in 2003, and though they weren't as critically, or even publicly, hailed as much as his earlier works, he proved once again that he was a box office draw when it came to a film's opening weekend, which is all that seems to matter now adays with fewer leggy films popping up at the box office.The story centers on one paranoid cop sent to investigate the first recorded murder committed by a robot. In the year 2035, the future of humanity is as bright and efficient as ever imagined. During this time, robots, once thought improbable several years ago, are now an every day commodity. In fact, the largest robotics distribution company in the world, USR, is set to launch its most highly advanced robot to date, the NS-5, to nearly every home in America. The shipment is so large that experts claim that there will be one robot for every five humans. To optimists this seems like a marvelous dream come true but to others, namely Detective Del Spooner, this is nothing short of a nightmare. After a freak accident several years earlier that left him haunted with images of the terrible event every night when he goes to bed, Detective Spooner has grown paranoid with the idea of humanity becoming too dependent on robots. One day, he is sent to investigate the 'apparent' suicide of Dr. Miles Hogenmiller, the man who created the Three Laws of Robotics and worked extensively with the NS-5 robots at the USR headquarters. Spooner dismisses the idea that Hogenmiller would kill himself and implicates a robot named Sonny who was found hiding in Hogenmiller's office and fled when the detective tried to question him. Everyone believes Detective Spooner has lost his mind for a robot can not bring harm to a human being since that would be a direct violation of the first Law of Robotics. If this were a violation of that law then there would be nothing to prevent the robots from turning against humanity and taking control of the world. Unfortunately, after a series of complicated events involving the NS-5 robots, Detective Spooner becomes more and more convinced that his once thought overwhelming paranoia may be the truth. The story for I, Robot, which was based on the 'I, Robot' anthology written by Isaac Asimov, is nothing more then the regurgitation of every other science fiction film with the concept of robots taking control of the world and destroying humanity. The difference with I, Robot is that the filmmakers lace the script with so much pretentious humor that most of it comes off flat and ultimately distracting from the film's supposed serious concept.One of the biggest compliments attributed to I, Robot is its concept of a relatively small cast, allowing the focus of the audience to center on the its main characters rather then distracting them with numerous side-characters that do nothing but clog up an already complex storyline. But that's where the kudos stop with several of those characters coming off as flawed or seriously misguided by the script. Will Smith, once again in his summer block-buster mode, gives an engaging performance as Detective Del Spooner, despite the character's noticeable flaws. Whether it's due to the way the script was written or the way Smith portrays the character, Spooner's wise-cracks are too over-the-top, with most of them, namely the one's early on in the film, failing to be the least bit humorous. Once you are able to look past that, Smith manages to the make the character quite interesting and mysterious with his emotions playing a prominent factor in his unpredictability. Alan Tudyk, who provided the voice work for the robot Sonny, does an adequate job with the limited material given to him but can't raise the character above anything more then a cheap CGI distraction. The problem with the character of Sonny is that the filmmakers attempt what director Steven Spielberg failed to do with Haley Joel Osment's character in A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, which was to present a robot that had dreams, felt emotions, and, in some weird way, possessed a soul. The reason this failed, and this stands true with I, Robot's attempt as well, is that when all is said and done, a robot is nothing more then highly advanced can-opener. You can build it up as much as you want, throw in some high-tech gizmos, and anything else you can think of but you won't be able to replicate anything remotely close to a human being with a soul. A soul is what makes humans unique above any other creature and nothing, not even by the hands of man, can duplicate that and place it inside something else, let alone a hunk of metal. And what was the point of Shia Le Beouf's character in this film other then being a pathetic attempt at comic-relief, something this film possesses too much of.Overall, as hard as I, Robot attempts to come off as brilliant vision of a futuristic utopia where all humanity has to do is look into the inner depths of our souls to live in peace and harmony, it comes off more along the lines of scientific mumbo-jumbo and computer-animated special effects run amok thrown into a blender at top speed resulting in nothing more then a garbled mess. Whether or not the film accurately projects the writings of Isaac Asimov, Robot's radical theories and story elements will go over most heads and those that do understand them will be disappointed by the lack of depth into how these conclusions were made. The special effects, though marveling at times, seem to be more the focus of the filmmakers then the script as nearly every scene seems to put more detail and concentration on the computer animation then how the story shapes out in the end.

		<fullReview>Truly the best film I've seen since 2000. Extremely well done. I'm not big on F/X, I think directors overuse and overextend them. Robot does overextend SLIGHTLY, but not by enough to matter. On a scale of 1-100, this would get a 98 from me. Far less plot holes than most Hollywood films. Many times I lose interest in movies when I can find too many reasons that the movie doesn't have a believable plot-line. This one isn't perfect, but well within tolerance-level for me.Will Smith is his usual, excellent, character. Cast is solid.It is worth your $8 for sure. Can't wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave a middle finger to critics, and to other forum members who said this movie was going to suck. I loved it. The audience I viewed it with agreed with me, giving laughs in the proper areas, and enveloped in the story. And let me say, I read the book before I heard it was going to be made into a movie. Alex did an amazing job directly, adding a realness to the future, yet a subtly that wasn't flashy until the action began. And when the action did show up, the directing has me going, "Whoa", a la Keanu. He added his own twist to action that could've been generic. The acting wasn't Oscar worthy, nor would I expect it to be. I saw this movie for what it was; an story truly inspired by Isaac (which also came right from the mouth of the screenwriter who read both books entitled "I, Robot). The actors fit right in with the movie. The story was ye old detective set in a futuristic world. And I liked it, though I foresaw the twists coming, but I can't say that for everyone. I *always* figure out the twist, well, save for a few movies maybe.It even had an itch for GHOST IN THE SHELL. An idea of "ghosts" in the electrical system. Like Alex said, this movie is much like a short story itself in a huge wad of bigger stories. It leaves the door open for another story to tie itself in, and another one, and another. Sequels, yes, and I wouldn't get too angry at that. Wouldn't star some of the same stars probably -- and they'd get an older actress to play Dr. Calvin in her middle years, I presume.And for those who proclaimed, "This movie is going to be about robots taking over the world", I say, you shoulda kept your mouth shut until you saw the movie. SPOILER! The robots were destroying the old robots because those robots would inevitably PROTECT the humans, and therefore, prevent the new robots from replacing them. Humans must be kept in check for their own protection -- they wished not to take over the world, but to help the humans prevent their own death. But some say we are naturally instilled with a need to destroy one another...which can easily lead into a mechanical "god complex".Anyway, good movie. Smith, sweet job. Bridget, I like her, her style is at times refreshing. And I like Chi, since Cradle 2 Grave; his performance just showed character. Greenwood, I normally like his characters. This is no different. I'd buy it on DVD.I see movies to see them. Good or bad. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you like a good combination of robo v. homo sapien fightin', futurisitic design (a la Total Recall or Minority Report), Will Smith, edge-of-your-crusty-movie-seat suspense and action? Well, I do and I am glad I chose this movie over The Notebook tonight. Some memorable quips from Mr. Smith, but overall dialogue is kinda dumb if you listen too carefully (but, then, who really goes to see this sort of thing for the dialogue?) I really fell into this movie and enjoyed its escapist roller coaster ride. My companions, for whom English is a second language, all enjoyed it too. I am left with a few lingering questions, though: why do they wear a lot of tight leather jackets in The Future? Why does EVERY movie set in Chicago feel the need to open with a seen of the Elevated Train? But, these lingering questions do not distract me from the fact that I just had a heck of a lot of fun for the past two hours! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is worth seeing in theaters. Will Smith as well as Bridgett Moynahan deliver great performances. Even the robot was well acted. The story made sense and the effects are amazing! Many new revelations unfolded as the movie progressed that will keep you watching. Since Bagger Vance, there hasn't been a Will Smith movie not worth the price of admission. Any science-fiction/robots taking over the world film buff will enjoy this one. I don't really see a sequel for it though, only if Hollywood gets greedy. I'd see it again and probably see it a third time. In all, this is a very good movie and is worth the admission to see it on the big screen. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by I, Robot, especially after reading so many sub par reviews. It was everything a fun, but thoughtful action film should be.The pacing was perfect and I was never bored or upset by the plot development. I am definitely not a Will Smith fan but I felt it was one of his best performances. Critics who complain that it doesn't follow Isaac Asimov's writing should realize a film adapted directly from an Asimov novel simply would not make a very fun or entertaining summer movie. The vision of future Chicago and the technology to come was similar to Minority Report in that everything was realistic and plausible(Not the usual flying cars, ridiculous clothing and laser guns). Don't let Will Smith's questionable film record dissuade you from seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of the film, I thought it was going to be simply a programmer with great special effects and non-stop action. As it turns out, I, ROBOT does have the requisite action and special effects, but it also has a story with something to say about the world.Will Smith stars as Del Spooner, a cop who has a big issue with robots, which have become enormously popular in 2030s America. His suspicions of them are in complete contrast to most other people, who think they are a great help to society. When the inventor of these robots dies, Spooner thinks he was murdered by one of his creations, while everyone else believes it to be a suicide. What follows is a roller-coaster side of twists and turns as the film drives toward an unexpected conclusion.What could have been simply a generic action picture, turns into something much more. I, ROBOT will entertainment, but it will also ask you think as well. Hopefully, it will inspire other producers to do the same with their big action films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I hear that Will Smith is connected to yet another summer blockbuster, I have to take a deep breath and simply hope that this was just another 'get it out of the way when I am young' roles for the now 35-year old. Bursting on to the film scene in 1993's wonderful Six Degrees of Separation (for those of you about to e-mail me, I do realize he was in Fresh Prince on television and was also in the Ted Danson flop Made in America - that is why I said 'bursting'), Smith showed us plenty of talent, loads of good looks and demonstrated an acting ability that had many believe that this possible up-and-comer might be the next black acting star and help take some of the torch bearing burden from Mr. Denzel Washington.Well, that was ten plus years ago now and perusing up and down Smith's filmography are films like Men in Black (I &amp; II), Wild Wild West, Bad Boys (I &amp; II) and Independence Day. Giving credit where it is due, there was also an Academy Award nomination for the 2001 biopic Ali, but outside of that one anomaly, it doesn't look like Mr. Smith will be putting on his jogging suit and reaching back for Denzel's torch any time soon.Enter the 2004 summer campaign and Will is at it again with the sci-fi thriller I, Robot. In the film, adapted from a short story by Isaac Asmiov, Will plays Del Spooner, a Chicago Police Detective who is called in to investigate the murder of an employee of the U.S. Robotics company which manufactures these life sized human robotic aides capable of almost anything a human can realize. Want your dog walked? My wires-in-his-head robot is your solution. Need someone to take the kids to school? Domo-origato, Mr. Roboto. Want someone murdered? Well?..The robots have three laws to which they have to abide. Law #1: Robot cannot harm a human being or by action allow a human being to be harmed. Law #2: A robot must obey orders given by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law and Law #3: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws. Taking into account that these rules are hardwired into every robot manufactured, there is no room or reason for suspicion when the creator of the robot force is found at the bottom of a high-rise building the result of what is first expected as suicide. But Detective Spooner doesn't trust the robots for reasons to be revealed later (and to be believed much much later), and he pursues the possibility of a robot with violent behavior against the wishes of his department chief and on the eve of the largest distribution of robots in history.Uh-oh, this can't be good.I, Robot was a surprisingly entertaining film in a summer where blockbusters last for an opening week-end and fade from memory before we get our bank statement detailing our ticket purchase. Will Smith doesn't really have much to do except flex his muscles and react to what was probably a tennis ball on a broom stick until the CGI guys did their part. However the special effects that are included are top rate. The robots attack like ants in the hundreds and are more effectively used in their battle sequences that say the droids used in the past two George Lucas films. They are ruthless, yet vulnerable which at least gives the human race a chance and doesn't give us the feeling that the attempt at fighting back is futile. Directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City), I, Robot takes its time trying to figure out what kind of film it wants to be. Part science fiction, part adventure/thriller and part who-dunnit, the film takes us in many different directions and lucky doesn't have us lose interest along the way. Accredited can be a smart script by Jeff Vintar that aside from the usual smart ass comments every film hero must now find variations ('Somehow "I told you so" just doesn't quite say it.' ? Yeeaaasch!), is unique and zips along at a good pace. Think Minority Report with more wires and plastic.Granted the film does have its share of missteps. The humor is hit and miss with more miss than hit and a scene where a mob of humans armed with bats and chains (in the years 2035, I might add) set out to rumble on the streets with a robot army, was just too stupid and ill advised to take seriously. Luckily the action scenes such as a demolitions robot destroying a house or robots jumping from their transport onto the detectives car are good enough to help you forget the pitfalls. In fact, not since A.I. have I wished a film had less humans and more of the robotic creations to carry the story.So in a summer of alright films, I, Robot finds its place amongst them like a sapling in the forest. I just wished Will Smith wasn't it in. Not that he doesn't do his best, but I am tired of waiting for that once so promising spark, and until you grow up, I guess Denzel will have to pin his hopes on say, Jamie Foxx.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Continues the intriguing topic of what it means to be human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robots in the arts have always been intriguing. Isaac Asimov promoted them in science fiction to remind us as humans to celebrate our emotions and imperfections, usually coveted by our mechanical creations even with the prospect of death as the ultimate payment due.Director Alex Proyas' ('The Crow') 'I, Robot,' based on Asimov's story, packs every robot cliché into a year 2035 morality tale, visually satisfying (The CGI, like good robots, is at the service of the story) and regurgitating the usual robot notions: Frankenstein's monster is there with his conflicted maker; the Maria clone from 'Metropolis' with her sleek form; Robbie from 'Forbidden Planet' with his warm, human-like solicitation; Hal from '2001' with his dangerous deference only slightly hiding his intentions; and Data, 'Star Trek's' almost human techie, coming closest to the ideal.More robotic than 'I, Robot's' robots is Will Smith's ('Ali') Del Spooner, guess what, a wise-ass, rebellious cop who is the only one who intuits the danger of the robotic rumblings. He unsurprisingly enlists the help of the beautiful, coldly calculating scientist, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, 'The Recruit'), who, believe it or not, comes to believe the robots can violate their 3 basic rules of serving humans to their own annihilation if necessary. US Robotics head, Lawrence Robinson (Bruce Greenwood), is, of course, the major suspect in the incipient revolution, ostensibly because of the usual world-domination dreams.'Sunny' (Alan Trudyk, 'Dodgeball') is the new generation robot, not as overtly ambitious as his forebears and more human because of his resignation to decommissioning while exploring human emotions. Spooner, on the other hand, seems to be more of a robot, which, like some contemporary leaders, sees the enemy as a danger to be overcome rather than a work in progress to be gently ushered into peaceful co-existence. Also, the rogue robots talk about dominating humans for their own good, just as neocons offer preemption and occupation rather than debate.The last line of 'I, Robot' addresses the human urge for liberty and the necessity of searching for it. The film adds nothing new to the genre but athletic robots and robotic leads, yet it at least continues the intriguing topic of what it means to be human. The caveat is, as Albert Schweitzer said, that 'the advance to fully developed inhumanity is only a question of time.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even the makers knew that it wasn't Asimov when they included the line "Inspired by Isaac Asimov", but I was surprised how much in enjoyed it.The trailers, as most trailers do, emphasize only the action sequences of the movie. They don't tell you that the action hangs on a thought provoking mystery story with conflicted, very human, characters.The robots were very believable, helpful and benign one moment but turning sinister the next. I went in expecting a to give it a solid C grade (fun, but not great) but went out of the theater giving it an A- (a plot hole here and there, but nicely solid). Give it a chance and don't get hung up on the name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enemy of the State meets Minority Report</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robots cannot kill humans. It's one of the three laws that control all robotic activity. It has been installed in every robot as a prime directive. One robot is able to kill a human. In the year 2035, the world is revolutionized by USR, a robotics firm located in Chicago. The robots are in every home, serving and protecting.Just as USR is about to unleash its grandest supply of robots, and, in fact, make the ratio 1 robot for every 5 humans, something goes wrong. On the eve of his greatest achievement, Dr. Lansing (the man who almost single-handedly created robotics) commits suicide.Will Smith's character, Spoon, is a cop personally called in by a holographic projection of Lansing, an old friend.Smith hates even the idea of robots. He's the only man who knows the truth: robots can kill humans. Much like in Enemy of the State, he's one man on a mission. No one else believe him.Just like Minority Report, it's a futuristic world. It makes it seem like 30 years of technology will drastically change the landscape.As an Isaac Asimov book, the story is intricate and well-crafted. It's one of the smartest adaptations in recent memory.Most people might look at I, Robot and see a goofy, sci-fi flick starring a filled-out Will Smith. What you get is one of the best action movies of the summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Proyas and Will Smith do a movie inspired by Isaac Asimov. That can only turn out as a typical flat summer blockbuster or something really cool beyond our imagination. In case of "I, Robot" I was a bit skeptic at first and finally nearly blown away by the result. This movie looks awesomely good, has fun moments, really shows a believable future and keeps you tight to your chair. We have the cool Will Smith as a robot-hating cop, a lovely Bridget Moynahan - a new face -, some really cool CGI-Stuff and some breathtaking camera-moves that rocks. And some things you might think about for some time. And even if you say, that we already see some of that before, you won't have seen that so well put together!"I, Robot" is one hell of a ride. That's how an enjoyable summer blockbuster must be like!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hidden inside of an action movie are some really good questions:1) What makes us human? 2) How much should we rely on or trust technology? 3) Are we made for a purpose?Of course there is great action and a murder mystery to boot. The story is creative and fun to follow. Will Smith does his Will Smith thing with a little chip on his shoulder, but it works for this role. All the acting works but is not particularly memorable, which really attests to the excellence of the story. Besides the ho-hum acting, a few things keep this from being a great movie. With technology being advanced as it was portrayed for the setting couldn't all of Spooner's claims have been checked (robot pulling gun on him, demolition bot attacking him, highway attack, etc...) surely someone could have said, "video from highway" and seen the proof. And if it was all erased by Viki that would be suspicious enough to side with Spooner.Of course there are the impossible action sequences, but that is forgivable because it is an action movie not poetry hour at the coffee shop.All in all a fun film to watch with more value than demerits. We do have a purpose! May the Maker reveal it to us all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Early in life, I raided my oldest brother's bookcase, and read this Isaac Asimov Sci-Fi Classic in the late 1950s. I thought it was an EXCELLENT story then, and for many years I wondered why someone did not make a movie of it. But, FINALLY. I rate this movie VERY HIGHLY. All movies take liberties with the original story, but Will Smith's "I, Robot" is a long-overdue, well-made movie, of an old-school Classic novel. Love the Humanization of the star Robot. Will Smith does his usual, capable job of acting. The action scenes are certainly adequate to please any Testosterone-Soaked audience, too.

		<fullReview>Though based on the book by Isaac Asimov this movie is definitely structured as a vehicle for Will Smith rather than a faithful version of a sci-fi classic.Set in the future where robots are a part of everyday life Smith stars as a cop investigating the apparent suicide of the scientist that did most to develop robots. Needless to say Smiths character, who is very suspicious of robots, suspects there is more to his death than meets the eye.From here the movie takes a fairly predictable course as we learn more about the cops back-story, get a huge number of wisecracks from Smith, meet a pretty scientist (Bridget Moynahan) and are treated to some admittedly spectacular action sequences.However, at the end of the movie you realise there was very little memorable about it at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>90% Judge Dredd, 9% TRON, 1% Asimov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I was upset that the name for the great book "I, Robot" was used for this movie, which has almost nothing in common with the book. We have Asimov's robot laws, we have one specific situation which is somewhat similar (faulty robot hiding in a mass of robots), and a few names, that's all. Most surprisingly, the movie doesn't even use the robot jokes!But from a totally different point of view, this is a pretty good movie. In particular, this is what the Judge Dredd movie should have been about! Robot crime and robot uprisings, that is a big part of Judge Dredd, which was all too overlooked in the movie. Here we have a robot uprising, not as violent as in Dredd, but complete with the robot that takes side with the humans and helps them to victory. Of course, we don't have any revengeful Call-Me-Kenneth here, but a Master Control that wants to control humans to protect them. But the story still has much Dredd qualities.That brings us to the other similarity. I call the big robot brain Master Control for a reason. Here, it is called VIKI (with interesting implications towards Wikipedia, maybe?) but what I see if Master Control, the control program and ultimate villain in TRON. The whole ending is very similar to TRON, complete with something that the heroes must insert into Master Control to turn it off, it just isn't a Frisbee.I'll be nice and consider that part a tribute to TRON rather than a rip-off. TRON is, after all, the mother of all modern SF, especially with computer graphics, so including it as part of this movie is called for.I refuse to rate this movie, because there is no single rating that fits. As a movie version of Asimov's book, it is no more than a 2 (complete failure), but as the "real Dredd" movie it is more like a 7, a well done and fun movie (but missing some details, like the "right" hero). As an independent action movie, maybe somewhat lower (due to all the things that makes me think of Dredd and TRON), if you notice them. It all depends on your point of view, but more than usual.All in all, the movie is worthwhile and entertaining. But don't expect any connection to Asimov's book, and you might even enjoy the few minor connections that there are. Recommended to Dredd fans!</fullReview>

After a respected Scientist dies from a fall out of a very tall building, the cop is tasked to investigate. After a long but not dull lead up to who "murdered" the Doctor, we find out some very interesting variations on how robots could run amok...It's a pretty entertaining movie, but if you pick up the original book you'll enjoy it more.</fullReview>

Having previously been a light-hearted comedy actor he puts in a truly excellent and believable shift as a wise-cracking cop with a dark past.However, the real star is the special effects and visual trickery. Impossible but ingenious camera-work and some jawdropping animation really make I, Robot feel truly alive and utterly believable, while never being dull for a second.It arguably doesn't delve too deep into its philosophical undertones, but it doesn't really need to. It's a traditional Hollywood blockbuster action flick but it unquestionably has a brain and is a clear cut above the likes of Armageddon et al.Very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now it is interesting they chose to use Asimov's title for this film, since the plot is actually very loosely drawn from the novel. But seeing as it is an action/adventure film more than a deep exploration in to the human condition, Will Smith is the perfect actor to play the role. If you are looking for action with guns and explosions, this is your film. Bridget Moynahan does a fine job as the dedicated scientist who is unwilling to accept the robots could vary from their programming, until she meets Sonny, played wonderfully by Alan Tudyk. There are enough comic moments and pauses in the action to make the film realistic, but having read the book, I have to say overall it is a disappointment. Notwithstanding, Will Smith is an action hero, and he lives up to his reputation in this remarkable film with amazing special effects. PG-13 is because of language and a brief shot of Will in the shower, but nothing too risqué. Entertaining and fun to watch, I recommend this one for a rental, collectible for Sci Fi and Will Smith fans. If you are looking for an interpretation of Asimov's novel, I suggest Bicentennial Man, starring Robin Williams.</fullReview>

After he conquer all resistance, he make it. scenery in this movie are very good, wild area, full of scientific landscape. relate to our course: Will always appear on his own, only in police office we can see his assistant, he perform as a leader. He is a macho man, wearing black leather cloak, bearded, good at shooting, just like a previous frontier. He jump off the platform without any security measure, because time is limited, and he was besieged with robots. He use his skill to let him get no hurt to land, then insert a chip to purify the entire system. Everything has a solution, and he make it, use his action to illustrate it.

		<shortDescription>A very mediocre sci-fi movie dealing with robots, could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty bleak sci-fi movie. Yeah, it does have some entertainment value but overall it just isn't a great movie. The movie goes in a direction where it feels like your watching a real live cartoon than a actual sci-fi with a interesting premise. Everything about it just seemed too far-fetched and not because of the robots but how everything is portrayed in the future 2035. It just one of those movies you just have to go with despite it being a sci-fi movie you can't really buy into. The scenarios and situations just seem lame for a movie that is made in 2004. The dialogue and everything else just seemed a bit childish for a movie like this. If it went in a more intelligent and clever route the movie would have been a whole lot better. The CGI is also pretty bad, for it's budget it could have really done better in that area as well. And the main protagonist goes by the name of Spooner...Seriously Spooner? I like some Will Smith movies but you can't take his character seriously at all. He is suppose to be a detective but he dresses, walks and talks like a wannabe thug. They also really needed to polish on the dialogue cause not only is it bad, it isn't believable. So yeah like I said it's a movie you have to try a bit to just go with it. Now I liked few of Alex Proyas few movies in the past but this ain't really one of them. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a terrible movie and it does have it's moments although few. But a more better script and believable characters would have made this movie much better. The story revolves around the reason behind the murders that connects with robots. And it's up to one man to find out that reason. I gotta admit though, the movie does have a message but I just found that to be plain stupid or maybe it's just the way it was delivered. The movie had potential but it just simply faltered, I can see little kids eating this movie up though.6.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read Asimov's book of the same title and I really hope it's nothing like this dreadful movie. This is one sci-fi clichés after another and it tries to be clever and philosophical but miserably fails. Is it at least entertaining? Depends. The special effects are alright and the sound is quite good but the writing is awful. Will Smith plays his part according to formula (the typical muscular sci-fi hero) and at the same time he tries to pull a Shaft. He doesn't do anything outstanding. Bridget Monaghan is dry and her dialogue delivery is flat at times but at least she's not the typical damsel in distress type heroine who tags along with the hero screaming occasionally. The best performance comes from the robot. 'I, Robot' was intended as a summer blockbuster which usually tend to be expensive, melodramatic and downright silly and so it fits the bill in that respect. It's a little slow in the beginning but as the action picks up, 'I, Robot' moves at a moderate pace. Anyway, I've said enough about this forgettable movie. Bye.</fullReview>

And I, Robot is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age.Methaphor or parable, the movie is history of disappointed's evolution.

The two he made with his on were beauts."I Robot" has the premise that, eventually, we will all have robots cleaning our homes and pools, obeying our every whim. Neat - as long as they continue to be subservient.A book with a somewhat similar theme is "The Children's War" by J. N. Stroyan - even more frightening as it describes life in Europe following a Nazy victory. The common people are treated like robots. It should be a must read. It is not a quick read - it is 1,150 pages.Back to the robotical goings-on. It is exciting science fiction, a biiig budgeter that has rightfully earned its bucks.

John Bergin.Jerry Wasserman is Baldez.Shia LaBeouf plays Farber.Fiona Hogan is V.I.K.I.The movie was nominated for an Oscar in visual effects.A sequel for 2012 seems possible.This isn't a perfect sci-fi flick, but it works.There are some pretty neat action scenes, like when Spooner is attacked by all those robots on the road.The movie's future looks pretty cool, and a little dark.Spooner's futuristic Audi can drive itself and the robots seem to do most of the jobs.That would be the downside of the future, and most likely it would turn many people against robots.But hey, this is not the future yet.We don't have to worry about the robot revolution.But maybe someday...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to watch this movie because I've heard many great things about it by my fellow friends for years, and I never got the real chance at seeing it. So I decided to watch it on television last night, and I found it to be great.Its about a guy named Del Spooner (Will Smith) who is a detective that does not trust robots even though everybody else believes them to be one hundred percent safe and trustworthy. When an old friend apparently commits suicide and leaves a holographic note for him he suspects foul play and the only being in the room at the time it happened was a robot. The robot doesn't help its case when it flees the scene in apparent breech of its core programming. Spooner is helped in his investigation by Susan Calvin who doesn't share his suspicions about robots in general but realises that there is something different about this particular robot. As the investigation continues it becomes clear that there is a greater threat than one rogue robot.The acting is pretty good and the special effects are decent although obviously CGI. There was some rather obvious product placement which I could have done without although not enough to spoil the film.Will Smith does a great job in this. I like his character's role. If you like sci-fi action I'm sure you'll enjoy this. So Id recommend this movie, it ain't too late to see it.Can't wait for I, Robot 2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Under Appreciated Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith plays his typical cocky, yet morally correct action hero that does everything well and vindicates himself cleverly against people who judge him in this action/sci-fi film. I think his character is the main source of this film's failure to be a blockbuster, not because he doesn't pull it off, but because people don't want to see Will Smith in the role of Detective Del Spooner. I have not read the I,Robot novel, but I have heard that it was written in the form of several short stories, which the film attempted to mesh together into one storyline. Whether or not this fusion was well done or not I am not equipped to decide, but watched as a film separate from the stories is a bit of a masterpiece.The main reason I advocate this movie seemingly against popular opinion is not of the main character Detective Spooner, but the supporting character and the personal robot of Dr. Lanning, Sonny. This character is like only one other I've seen: Hellboy's Abe Sapien. Sonny is naive to human psychology, foreign to human habits and quirks, and is the opposite of street-wise. He is a robot that has nothing more to him than any other robot, except somewhat of a human soul. Much like Abe Sapien, Sonny is intelligent and a quick learner, and does not think highly of fighting. Much of Sonny's thought process is based only on things in life that other people are moving too fast to consider. He is thinking about dreams while Detective Spooner is running around trying to solve a mystery. This seems to me to be a naive wisdom that I relate to, and that I find very rarely in a character.Finally, I couldn't do a review of I,Robot without recalling some of its unique fight scenes. From the truck-car-truck fight in the tunnels to the nano - bots - up - in - the - air one-shot fight, and even the collapsing building escape, the action scenes in this movie are much more original than movies with equal or even greater popularity. The camera angles, including the corkscrew - around - the - character - running - across - a - bridge and the orbit - the - character - in - the - opposite - direction - as - they're - swinging - around - the - pole are sickeningly unique techniques, and for some just sickening.The problem is, the people who would enjoy this type of movie are the same people who don't want to see more of Will Smith. If more people were to give him a fair chance in this role or just look past him if they really can't bring themselves to accept him, I think they would find a truly classic movie in I,Robot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this for the second time last night with my dad as I brought it on Blu Ray which as got the best picture and sound quality I have seen on a blu ray thus far.The film is gripping from the beginning right through until the end, the story features action, emotion and a slight romance from time to time which targets all audiences which may watch this film.If you are looking for a good movie which can entertain for all then this is your movie. A UK rating 15 film does not feature much blood or swearing so may be suitable for younger teenagers alike.If you haven't seen this film yet then go and rent it and watch and enjoy as I know I certainly did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ethical dilemma tied to a successful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Del Spooner (Will Smith) represents the society as a whole in this movie related to the ethical dilemma of robot rights. Many people believe that this issue, that of robots having the same rights as humans, may lead to the outcome presented in the film. Science is getting close to to developing robots that may be able to pass as humans when it comes to basic movements and appearance. Furthermore, if these 'ghosts' in the programming actually exist, as Dr. Alfred Langing proposed then who says that natural evolution can not occur. This film presents some interesting decisions based on is it okay to treat robots as slaves or lesser than humans? Again those opposed to this view see robots as nothing but machines. This leads us back to the discussion of whether or not if robots are able to fool us, as humans, into being humans themselves. So this raises the question of was Detective Spooner justified in being suspicious of Sonny's actions? In the long run, I believe that artificial intelligence can replace that of humans based on the evolution of artificial intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I may not be as impressed now as I was in the theatre, but still, not a bad sci-fi action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie, inspired by the book of the same name by renowned prolific author Isaac Asimov, while it was in theatres in the summer of 2004, and thought it was a good blockbuster. At that point, I had never read the book. Now that I have, I realize that this film doesn't really have that much in common with it. The book is a collection of nine short stories, set in different times, whereas this 2004 blockbuster is one long story, all set in one time. So, this isn't really an adaptation of Asimov's book, but being faithful to the source material isn't everything. After watching this film a second time, I don't think I was as impressed as I was when I saw it on the big screen, but merely judging it as a film, I still think it's pretty good.The year is 2035 A.D., and robots are a major part of society. They are programmed to do many different tasks to serve humans. However, one person who doesn't trust these machines is Chicago Homicide Detective Del Spooner. One day, this detective is informed of the recent death of robot scientist Dr. Alfred Lanning, who fell a great distance at the headquarters of his company, United States Robotics (USR). His death is generally assumed to be a suicide, but Spooner suspects that a robot murdered him, even though the first of the Three Laws of Robotics forbids a robot to harm a human. As he investigates, he is assisted by robot psychologist Dr. Susan Calvin, despite their contradicting views on robots, and the main suspect in the detective's murder theory is Sonny, a Nestor Class-5 robot! Like so many other action blockbusters, this one may not have the greatest script. During my second viewing, I found some fairly weak dialogue (I think I pay more attention to that now than I did in 2004), though I didn't find that any of it stood out as absolutely ludicrous, fortunately. Some of the acting is pretty wooden as well, at least Bridget Moynahan's acting early in the film (she plays Dr. Susan Calvin), but fortunately, her performance eventually gets better. Despite this film's downsides, there are enough upsides to make it an above average effort. Obviously, many would watch this movie for action and suspense, and it definitely has those. It's also a good story about conflict between humans and machines, eventually getting somewhat emotional. So, while much of the film is about the action, not ALL of it is, unlike some films of this type.Like Asimov's book, this film has his Three Laws of Robotics, and the characters Susan Calvin, Alfred Lanning, and Lawrence Robertson. I also noticed an element of "Little Lost Robot" included. Basically, those are the only things I noticed in this 2004 blockbuster which it has in common with Asimov's collection of short stories originally published one by one in sci-fi magazines. Things happen in this movie with the robots which never happen in the book (most notably with the robots and the first law), so, for better or worse, this 2004 summer blockbuster doesn't completely follow Asimov's view of robotics. Still, while 2004's "I, Robot" may not be as enjoyable on the small screen as it was on the big screen, I would say it's still a reasonable sci-fi action thriller, if you're into this sort of thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I-ROBOT, arguably Will Smiths best movie! I-robot really hits the mark and is a big massive blockbuster, and very entertaining.Smith is at his very best. I-Robot boast on amazing visual, the effects were cool too.heres 3 points in why. 1)storyline: the storyline was spot on, and very original. the movie was well paned out and its always good to have a interesting plot along with some great action, again very unique plot. moving on 2)acting: Will Smith again shows tremendous talent and his acting was superb as you would expect and Smith in the movie made it that much better, without him in the movie maybe it wont be the same, the rest of the cast showed a good performance too. 3)action/thrill: Like i said there's always good to have a good plot in the movie but without action it will be dull. but again I-ROBOT is full with mind blowing action throughout and plenty of thrills. overall I-ROBOT hit it's mark, a great action popcorn flick, and Will Smith wont let you down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling sci-fi film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is a great film for normal people and sci-fi nerds alike. The story takes place in the future where humans and robots are living together. There is one cop, Spooner who dislikes robots. He believes that a certain robot killed its inventor. Now Spooner has to stop a revolution or else mankind is in jeopardy. The acting in this film is great. I always liked Will Smith, but he is better than usual in this action-packed spectacle. The other actors were good and convincing. The screenplay is written well though not to the point of Isaac Asimov. All the other aspects of this film is great and nothing is done wrong. I rate this film a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent sci-fi, frenzied action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this one originally at the Sacramento Six drive-in, but had missed the beginning of the movie so this was my first complete viewing. It's a decent enough sci-fi movie, providing more ideas than most big budget affairs that go by the name. As an action movie I find it slightly underwhelming. A few of the fight scenes go on too long, and like Alex Proyas' earlier and superior sci-fi "Dark City" it becomes relatively formulaic towards the climax after starting off a bit more promising.Many parts of this film, especially the scenes with Del (Will Smith) and his grandmother (Adrian Ricard), feel like they are some kind of obligatory nod to Smith's screen persona. However Smith's presence on the whole is a major asset to the film. I like him here as much as I've liked him in anything. He's able to seem invulnerable and yet sensitive at the same time, no mean feat. Later on in the story we find out a plausible reason for why he acts this way, in that he is himself partly mechanical, but he's already conveyed it very well through his character work. The scenes with Smith and Shia LaBeouf feel pretty artificial as well, at best causing one to chuckle but seeming very forced into the story. They even have to interrupt the big chase towards the end so Smith can save LaBeouf. I have a feeling that the writers felt like the audience might be turned off or feel insulted or patronized by the fact that everyone except Del Spooner is so complacent about the robots, so they felt they had to almost overcompensate with the big human vs. robot street rumble at the end which is pretty silly. How would a mob of angry New Yorkers line themselves up in formation like an army and attack the robots in such an organized way? It should be more chaotic and riotous.The core of the movie is the 3-some of cop Del, Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynihan) and the robot Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk). That part of the movie does work very well. The audience is inclined to distrust the robot just like Del, and the character becomes sympathetic and even admirable by the end of the story. In the sense that they tied this character process to the intellectual question of the distinctive aspects of the soul, it gives the movie a solid foundation.It's interesting perhaps to note that even 10 or certainly 20 years before this film was made, you would never have seen a black star in a sci-fi role like this. There's nothing in the story that requires the character to be black, although it does make the theme of Del's prejudice against robots seem ironic. There's also nothing in the relationship between Del and Dr. Calvin that would require her to be a woman. So it's kind of nice to see the movie cast this way, it makes me think how far we've come even just in my lifetime as far as sci-fi heroes. I like the character anyway, I like how he is a guy who collects "antiques" from our time; it helps the audience connect with him and it's a good device to keep Smith in his comfort zone as far as style as well.Unfortunately this film seems among Proyas' films more close to "The Crow" than to "Dark City" -- there's more style than substance here ultimately. And Proyas isn't afraid to cater to the audience's demand for a video game paced action scene every 8 minutes or so. But I suppose that's the price of working with such a large budget and such a skilled cast and crew. The effects work in this film is really astounding, although these days that's getting to be almost a matter of course. Proyas mixes the action with just enough ideas to create a movie that is less than an embarrassment to Asimov's original. The closing shots with the robot on the hill have a weird quality to them and a very ambitious idea behind them that redeems the affair also to some extent from the rather silly fight scenes that immediately precede them. In the end, I'm surprised by how good it ended up being and still hoping that Alex Proyas has more great sci-fi to bring us in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like special effects, a lot of action, and an engaging story, then this is a great film to choose. The three laws: Law 1 - A robot cannot harm or let harm come to a human being. Law 2 - A robot must obey human orders, but not if it conflicts with the first law. Law 3 - A robot must protect its own existence (i.e. defend itself), but not if it conflicts with the first and second laws. Anyway, it is 2035, society is filled with humanoid robots living and serving like normal people. Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is the only man who does not like them, because one let a little girl drown in a car accident he was involved in. Spooner receives a message from Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) because he apparently killed himself, and Spooner is convinced a robot could have done it. He and Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) do find a robot that could be responsible, one of the hundreds more new NS-5 models, Sonny (A Knight's Tale's Alan Tudyk), and they find he is unique, because he can choose not to obey orders. Sonny also claims to have emotions and dreams, this is also what makes him unique. As the story develops, it seems everyone cannot believe Spooner's claim that robots turned against him, but soon enough his claim becomes true when all these NS-5 robots are starting to turn against the whole city, and the reason you eventually find out is the robot company network's brain, V.I.K.I. is responsible. Also starring Bruce Greenwood as Lawrence Robertson, Chi McBride as Lt. John Bergin, Adrian Ricard as Granny, Jerry Wasserman as Baldez and Fiona Hogan as V.I.K.I. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-Fi Cop Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1942 the American science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov introduced what he called the "three laws of robotics", namely:-1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. He later added a further law, although because this took precedence over the first three he named it the "Zeroth Law" rather than the Fourth. (Did the number zero have an ordinal form before Asimov devised this law?) It provides that "A robot may not injure humanity, or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm".Asimov's laws appear simple, but, as he was well aware, they can give rise to all sorts of philosophical and logical difficulties, many of which he explored in his stories, such as "How would a robot react if it could only prevent a murder by killing or injuring the murderer?". Does "harm" only include physical injury, or can it also include a person's economic interests? The Zeroth Law has struck many- myself included- as being uncomfortably close to the mindset of those dictators and ideologues who are happy to kill people in what they perceive as being the greater interests of humanity. The film is based upon Asimov's general ideas about robotics rather than any specific story. (Asimov's "I, Robot" was a collection of short stories rather than a single work, although another science-fiction writer, Otto Binder, did write a story with that title). The story takes place in 2035, by which time robots have become a common feature of everyday life, mostly used as domestic servants. Despite its futuristic setting, there are some pretty blatant attempts at product placement, especially for Audi and FedEx; presumably companies are attracted to the idea of advertising in films that imply they will still be around thirty years hence. The main character is Del Spooner, a Chicago Police homicide detective. (After the "Men in Black" films and "Wild, Wild West", which had some science-fiction elements despite its Victorian setting, Will Smith seems to be specialising in sci-fi cops). Spooner is charged with investigating the death of Dr. Alfred Lanning, a scientist with the powerful US Robotics corporation who are about to release a new, improved model robot onto the market. Lanning fell to his death from a window, and Spooner comes under pressure to conclude that his death was suicide, but he suspects not only that Lanning was murdered but also that the murder was committed by a robot in violation of the First Law. Spooner, it should be noted, is a noted robotophobe whose phobia derives from bad experiences in his past. The film combines two common science-fiction themes. The first is that of robots or other intelligent creations turning upon their creators, a theme that goes back at least as far as Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" and has been dealt with in a number of films such as "Westworld". The second is the question of whether a robot is capable of evolving or acquiring consciousness, a personality and emotions similar to those of a human, a theme most famously explored in "Blade Runner". Certainly, one of the robots, Sonny (Spooner's first suspect in the murder case), does seem to have very human traits. Although the film does not explicitly mention the "Zeroth Law", it does rely upon a similar concept, that of robots interpreting the First Law as a licence to take over the reins of government on the grounds that humans are far too unintelligent and self-destructive to be entrusted with such a task themselves. The question then arises of who is behind this prospective robotic coup d'etat. Could it be the sinister boss of US Robotics? Although the film touches on some weighty philosophical topics, it never does so in any depth. The theme of robots going out of control was better dealt with in "Westworld", which had a genuinely chilling figure in Yul Brynner's robot gunslinger. "I, Robot" never achieves anything like the intellectual or emotional depth of "Blade Runner", one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. There are some effective action sequences, which possibly show the pervasive influence of computer games, but it is really little more than a cop thriller with a futuristic setting. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and thoughtful, but still a Hollywood Action/Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie. Exclamation point x2. Thanks to the acting, it's one that can be re-watched without getting old. It's good for laughs and the action keeps the science fiction premise from getting boring for those who aren't into sci-fi.First off, there will be some people who will hate this movie because it does not recreate the short story collection for which it is named. That's just too bad. This movie is not a recreation of an Asimov story, but it does more than just pay lip-service to the writer. "I, Robot" is informed by and explores themes and concepts that Asimov practically invented. I urge any fan of Isaac Asimov to watch this movie for what it was intended to be: an exploration of the theme within the framework of an action movie, and not to expect someone to recreate what Dr. Asimov did in print for the big screen.Will Smith gives one of his serious performances. If you are not a fan of Will Smith's comedy style, his performance here should not turn you off. His acting is more like his character in Enemy of the State (serious, but with some comedic lines) than his Wild Wild West or Men in Black characters. Personally, I love Will Smith as an actor, and this role exploits his talents to their fullest.The other actors and the other characters also add to the enjoyability of this movie. I may be the only one who sees this, but I think the character of Alfred Lanning (the father of robotics who dies to kick off the plot in this movie) is a tribute to Isaac Asimov. I take the words of loving memory spoken in praise of the fictional character as praise for Asimov. The character of Susan Calvin is made into an appealing female, but that divergence in character is not unwelcome and she otherwise does not stray unbelievably from her character in the books.The plot of this movie is a murder mystery and an exploration of secrets and dark dealings in the fictional US Robotics, which is akin to Microsoft in this fictional world, but having the monopoly on robots rather than operating systems. Isaac Asimov's 3 Laws of Robotics and their consequences and interpretation play a pivotal role in the movie, as do questions of the nature of artificial intelligence and prejudice based on experience.But don't mistake this movie for an intellectual ride. It's an action thriller full of chases and sporadic action with one-liners delivered with the charm of mega-star Will Smith. It's a Hollywood movie made smart by an original concept inspired by Isaac Asimov's ideas.What gets this movie my ten is not any one element. It's that the movie blends several appealing elements in just the right proportions to place it well above 95% of most movies being made. To counter the claim of another reviewer: Spiderman 2 is a better action movie. Shrek is a better comedy. But I, Robot is a better movie overall that is more enjoyable to repeat watch than either of those two.</fullReview>

Robots are crime free because they are guided by three laws which keep them in order. On the eve of the release of the new and advanced robots, the robots designer apparently kills himself. Detective Del Spooner(Will Smith)is called to scene to investigate.Will Smith is like he always is. Bridget Moynahan is OK.

		<shortDescription>The Problems were my fault</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I suggested to Will Smith that he should do "I, Robot" I warned it was inevitable that people would say the result wasn't close enough to the Azimov's writings. Go ahead - you try. Azimov's books are for reading and I understand that translating it to cinema is a big challenge. For me, there were many scenes in the movie that were exactly what I imagined as I read. Smith's character was a little experimental but after Independence Day, I was completely convinced that a little of his characteristic cockiness would make it more entertaining for modern audiences. I still laugh when I think about him smacking the alien in the face (Independence Day) in their first face-to-face encounter. Azimov's work is not comedy however and I would take that back today, but would still be very happy with Smith as the lead character. I am willing to take responsibility for Smith's humorous deviation from pure Azimov. It was my fault. I will say however, that his portrayal merely added a little rather than being completely different (while not denying that the addition made it different). Starting at the beginning (unlike Star Wars) with the short stories was my fault too. My expectation - more Azimov based films - through the robot, galactic empire, and most definitely the foundation series.Russian immigrant Azimov blended commentary on mass social (and political) movements and cultural differences in his writing as clearly as descriptions of science and environment - which rivaled Jules Verne. The robot rebellion itself, complete with central computer, mirrored the Bolshevik Revolution and rise of Communism. He defined (take this literally) the meaning of "hero." (One person can make a difference.) Some might have been more satisfied had the film included a Blade Runner type narration to beat home particulars - to have made the central computer's (V.I.K.I) reasoning for the take-over clearer. While viewing with others previously unfamiliar with the story, I heard some "What?" - "Why?" and even a "What's wrong with that?" The apparent loss of understanding of the evil of dictatorship and value of freedom convinces me that Azimov's work is as important today as it ever was.I think it is important to bring Azimov's work to the screen, not least because it is some of the very best science fiction produced in the twentieth century. And I do prefer keeping films true to the original work. I would argue that this film is the best adaptation of Azimov so far. Letting action speak for itself - to some extent - is not entirely wrong in film. I am hoping that sci-fi fans everywhere will join me in encouraging more Azimov at the movies in the future; regardless of the challenge. Perhaps a nip and tuck here and there will bring the experience a little closer to the read. But I will now caution viewers just as I caution movie-makers. If you really want the full experience of the original writing - read it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a sci-fi movie, it's pretty good, but if you've read Asimov's masterpieces, avoid at all costs!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to start with this Isaac Asimov quote: 'Eye-sci-fi has an audience that is fundamentally different from that of science fiction. In order for eye-sci-fi to be profitable it must be seen by tens of millions of people; in order for science fiction to be profitable it need be read by only tens of thousands of people. This means that some ninety percent (perhaps as much as ninety-nine percent) of the people who go to see eye-sci-fi are likely never to have read science fiction.The purveyors of eye-sci-fi cannot assume that their audience knows anything about science, has any experience with the scientific imagination, or even has any interest in science fiction.But, in that case, why should the purveyors of eye-sci-fi expect anyone to see the pictures? Because they intend to supply something that has no essential connection with science fiction, but that tens of millions of people are willing to pay money to see. What is that? Why, scenes of destruction.You can have spaceships destroying spaceships, monsters destroying cities, comets destroying the Earth. These are called 'special effects' and it is what people go for. A piece of eye-sci-fi without destruction is, I think, almost unheard of. If such a thing were made, no one would go to see it; or, if it were so good that it would indeed pull a small audience, it would not be thought of as science fiction of any kind.' (Isaac Asimov on Science Fiction, 'The Boom of Science Fiction', pp.125--128) Asimov is probably turning in his grave. The movie epitomises everything he hated about sci-fi movies - the overriding need for violence and action scenes,'monsters destroying cities', special effects in the extreme, and various forms of collateral damage. With the exception of the Three Laws, the movie seems to bear no relation to the book, or indeed any other of the Robot books - for example, humans happily in direct sunlight!? What happened to the events in the ground car in 'The Naked Sun'? This is but one example of how Asimov's brilliant Laws, concepts and studies of the previous in his books are flouted at every turn in the movie, causing me to, as a great Asimov fan, alternately laugh and cringe. The graphics are impressive, and the acting often good, but it seriously riled me, how little the writers and director evidently knew of the books.Overall, it's not a bad movie - I kind of enjoyed it when I finally managed to distance it from the books. But, it's only good as a general, run-of-the-mill sci-fi movie. If you are looking for even a slight similarity or homage to Asimov's masterpieces, look elsewhere. I sadly doubt the writers even read the Robot books before making this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and action-packed but it's also engaging and smart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although released during the summer and being sold under a headline of CGI, stunts and action when it came out ? I still didn't get that guilty pleasure; relaxed feeling you're perhaps supposed to get when watching a blockbuster and this is one of a few things that make I, Robot a thoroughly enjoyable film.I've read in some places that this film is perhaps a 'poor man's Blade Runner' but let me tell you something: as much as I thought Blade Runner was a pretty average film that relies on its crossing of genres to help it withstand the test of time, you have to admit to the similarities although in my opinion; I, Robot is just a little bit better. I think I, Robot has a touch of the 'noir' tone. The protagonist of the film is a detective, he's smart and fast talking; brushing people off with one-liners as he goes about his business. He has also suffered in the past ? a tragedy we catch glimpses of in his horrible dreams and one that is unravelled in a pleasing way. I, Robot also manages to tie in this noir tone with other conventions that just make a film 'fun'.I liked the way we learn more and more about our hero Del Spooner (Smith) as he either reveals it to other characters or they state it as a matter of fact. We first discover he's an officer of the law after he chases down a robot whom appears to have snatched a handbag but we also discover things about the world in which the film is set (Chicago 2035) as adverts amongst other things tell us the role and importance of robots in this world.Early on, the character of Spooner is also depicted as one whom no one believes. He has a grudge against the robots but we do not know the motivation behind this grudge at the time. Due to this feeling, everyone doubts Spooner's ability to judge as well as his own sanity and because we do not know the facts; the audience themselves are put in a position that makes them doubt whether this hero is up to the task.As I, Robot unravels; we get deeper and deeper into a supposed murder investigation whilst at the same time clues are being solved and the truth is becoming clearer. This then spawns one or two interesting chase scenes or action set pieces including one set on a highway and involving multiple aggressive robots and a sequence in which Spooner is, quite literally: the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. The film also dabs in and out of a second story taking place revolving around a robot character called Sonny (who thinks and acts so much like a human being he could be counted as one) and his apparent guilty imprisonment under watchful eye of acting parole officer/doctor/lab technician Susan Calvin. Whilst all this takes place, I got a genuine feeling that the film was building to something.I, Robot is a better and smarter film than you would think. Although it seems to favour its product placement of 'JVC' and 'Audi' whilst, literally, blocking out that of 'Fed-Ex', the film doesn't have that many flaws or things that stick out and irritate you. The final sequence reminded me of a cross between Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines but also Resident Evil with a pinch of The Matrix, stunt-wise but this doesn't detract too much as everything preceding this has done its job to entertain us and make us care thus making I, Robot a very enjoyable sci-fi, detective film that turns a little dark half way through but maintains an enjoyable, action packed atmosphere until the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Human Interest factor is a must!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the discovery of the new toy called CGI special effects most films using this technique tend to it make the star of the film. This film is no exception. The storyline could have centered a lot more on the robots rather than Will Smith's character. I was expecting a good story about robots trying to be human for example.10/10 for the special effects and futuristic concepts. As usual they are getting better and better, and the architecture and car designs were great.I think that the story should always be the star with actors and special effects 2nd. and 5th place respectively. This film has no heart or soul, although technically great, I found it irrelevant and boring and felt like I was playing one of those soul-less video games again. Pity, this could have been a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly BAD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The filmmakers take a great piece of sci-fi literature and turn it into nothing more than an action vehicle for Will Smith.granted the f/x were cool but there was no heart in this movie. It was nothing more than an excuse to show off some neato futuristic weapons and car chases - some of where were spectacular, but that's not what the original book/story was about. It's almost a crime that they used Assimov's name and book title when the movie was not what the book was about. This book has been bouncing around film companies for literally years because no one had a clue how to do it justice. This film certainly didn't do the book justice. Why bother calling it "I, Robot" when it wasn't an adaptation of the book. All they did was steal the title.Another sci-fi book that has been in 'development hell' is "The Demolished Man", not to be confused with "The Demolition Man." At least with that book, none of the filmmakers (DePalma and Cameron both supposedly owned the rights to it at one time) wanted to do it unless they could do it right.Wish the filmmakers of this movie felt the same way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not robotic at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, "I, Robot" is the sort of movie that could very easily end up being completely ridiculous: an action star in a futuristic movie about humans battling robots. That certainly sounds like it could degenerate into an even lamer version of "Independence Day" - and I'm not just saying that because it stars Will Smith.However, the movie does manage to do something good. For starters, it's not just an excuse for a bunch of action (although there is a lot). To me at least, the movie seems to be looking at the possible dangers of people relying too much on technology, like what "2001: A Space Odyssey" looked at. As cop Del Spooner, investigating a murder in 2035 Chicago that may or may not have been committed by a robot, Will Smith is sardonic, but never formulaic. Also starring James Cromwell. On one level, maybe the movie is sort of eye candy. But like I said, there is a plot here. And let's face it: this is a much better robot-themed movie than "Bicentennial Man" apparently was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Asimov Rolling In His Grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a decent sci-fi movie for what its worth, however, the character and title were taken from Isaac Asimov's writings and the poor guy is probably rolling in his grave. Reading ALL of his books, I know for a fact that the character's of Sonny and the USR's main computer would be something he would have refused to create. His goals were to write a part for Robots that didn't involve them as human's playing God (gone wrong) or as a Racial connotation. All of Asimov's other robot characters do not and cannot be played in that notion. I was originally psyched that this would lead to the creation of "Foundation" movies, which in the book world are with the likes of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Hopefully if they do, they are nothing like I, Robot</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, Human, even whilst viewing the first trailers of "I, Robot", knew that They, 20th Century Fox, were destined to make Film, Botch-up.Sure enough, this movie bytes! Pounding home the sordid fact that Big Studios ? as cookie-cutter idioms unto themselves ? must morph any greed-driven, blockbuster-bent story from cerebral concept to popcorn-glutton whiz-bangery, "I, Robot" is a tragic depravity of speculative fiction writer Isaac Asimov's complex vision; an unrecognized mutation of the compendium of intriguing Robot Stories revered by readers through the decades.Thank you, Hollywood. Thank you so bloody much.Before Asimov's death in 1992, speculative fiction deity Harlan Ellison collaborated with him on an early screenplay of "I, Robot", but the usual industry discombobulation and improprieties left the Last Writers Standing as Jeff Vintar (writer of "Final Fantasy" - the first fully computer-animated movie) and Akiva Goldsman (whose breadth covers the jejune "Batman And Robin" to the earnest "A Beautiful Mind"; for this job, calling upon his "Batman" skill set ? Holy Insensibility!).Premised in a society conversant with the "immutable" Three Laws of Robotics (which safeguard humans against robot mischief whilst granting human mastery over robot will), the movie's opening sequences echo hollowly Asimov's grand expositions, as Detective Spooner (Will Smith) investigates a scientist's "suicide" which seems to point to a probable Murder By Robot. Smith's smugness wears thin almost immediately.His standing as a major player in the motion picture industry seems to finally be overwhelming the last vestiges of his "Six Degrees" ingenuousness, as being the whitest wigga in the movie doesn't seem to faze him in the least; wool cap pulled snidely over only one ear (in an attempt, I suppose, to convey some sense of futuristic fad), taut t-shirted torso (naked in his first scenes ? a shout out to da ladies!), sneakers from the Year 2000 (oh! ? you go, retro-girl!) and long, black, Beyond-Badness leather coat. Sure, it's Los Angeles 2035, but unless the earth's precessional axial tilt has stepped up speed and driven the city into higher and colder climes than its 23-degree-north latitude, no one in LA *really* dresses like that ? not even in *this* movie (except for Spooner) - unless they're attending a film premiere, making a music video, or a nouveau-trash summer blockbuster.Spooner, irritated almost all the time, smart-mouths his way through his scenes as if AKSING for a slap upside his bitch head, only much later in the film expositing a rationale for his surliness ? years ago, relying on mathematical probability, a robot chose to save him over a drowning child (ripping out his arm in the process, necessitating a bionic replacement), he maintaining that a "thinking, feeling being" would have tried to save the child no matter what the probability; thus, his hatred for robots and distrust of people who create them. Nonetheless, it is still an unnecessarily sour performance that offers little wit to alleviate the constant puss on his face. "Attempted wit" doesn't count.One of Asimov's foibles (if I can call it that without being stoned for sacrilege) was that he avoided expounding on sex to a fault, thereby making his recurring female character from the Robot Stories, robopsychologist Susan Calvin, as coolly sexless as the automatons she is ironically empowered to "make more human." As Calvin, Bridget Moynahan pulls off this idiosyncrasy so effectively that we cannot imagine her having been touched by any mammal, let alone a man. When she does touch Spooner, it is purely a technical examination of his bionic arm and ? double irony ? it comes off as sensual for its very perversity! Director Alex Proyas, who wove the noir visions, "The Crow" and "Dark City", seems like the perfect choice for a dark Asimov tale, but has noticeably caved to Big Studio demands with this production, structuring it as simply as a knucklehead video game; no small coincidence that the movie's draw-cards - the robots - look like any given "gamer" characters; we catch ourselves thinking how incongruous they often look in this film's 3-D world.The Robot glitch which our human protagonists must monkey-wrench back to normalcy is the over-played "Humanity is a Danger to Itself" card, telegraphed to absurd (though, plausibly realistic) proportions by the master computer, acronymed VIKI, who empowers the hordes of gamebots to enforce city curfews and house-imprisonment, so that Us Dumb Humans won't blow us-selves up. Needless to say, the sourpuss hip-hop refugee and frigid heroine (whose severe convent hairstyle gets progressively more sensual during the third act as she exhibits more lubricity towards Spooner) win the day.The Human glitch in the making of this movie was in ignoring the inherent irony of Asimov's title, "I, Robot". The "I" signifies a Descartian self-awareness, a facility which robots ? by definition ? should not possess, thereby making the title an oxymoron. Asimov, understanding this, structured each Robot tale as an examination of the complexities, paradoxes and conundrums of bequeathing machines artificial intelligence. In the film, this aspect is given a cursory nod in the form of Robot "Sonny", whose sentience is poignant and almost slips the movie past Asimov aficionados, until those idiotic scenes of robot hordes chasing down or blatantly attacking Spooner, intoning, "You are having a car accident!," remind us what a big bowl of wrong this movie is. To further gouge Asimov's concepts, Sonny is able to override the Three Laws because ? well, because *Vintar and Goldsman* say so ? to help the Noble Humans defeat the Bad Machines?Asimov drew the sentience theme to its logical conclusion in his disturbing short story "Bicentennial Man" (brought to the screen in 1999 by director Chris Columbus and Robin Williams - with as much homogeneity and popcorn pap as *this* stinker).Where are Lije Bailey and R. Daneel Olivaw when we need them? We miss you, I, saac.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i agree with previous posters that the effects, while okay in some parts, in others made me feel like i was watching a video game, also that this film was littered with too many ads, and i like converse all-stars. the robots look pretty decent up close, but from the opening street scene where they are interacting with people they look drawn on, ditto all the tunnels the cars scenes and the entire chicago skyline. from what i understand, george lucas was the first to cross the barrier (phantom menace as well as clones and sith were all -at least- 50% computer generated, meaning they have more in common with "finding nemo" and "toy story" that the original trilogy -or any other movie one would reasonably call "live action" for that matter-) but even though i am no apologist for the recent star wars films, he pulled it off better than this flick did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As best I can figure out, this movie was written by someone whom has gathered vast tidbits of Asimov's philosophies without ever reading any of his books. Asimov's entire Future History seems to have been compressed into this one movie.If you liked the promos and trailers, if you appreciate presentation over substance (the special effects were cool), you will probably like this movie. If you are a fan of Issac Asimov and want to enjoy his creations brought to life, avoid this at all costs. Maybe, someday, a true fan will create a quality television series called "I, Robot" and faithfully bring Asimov's vision to life.This is the only movie that I have downloaded that I could have gone out and rented (I do download movies that are unavailable. If I like them, I by a copy. Since most of these titles cost up to 4 times as much as other DVDs, I need to know what I am getting before I buy). I was totally turned off by the teasers, but I did read some positive views here on IMDb. If it was as bad as I expected, in no way did I want to reward the producers. I still believe in that. If I did like it, I would buy a DVD version. My recommendation. If you are curious, as I was, download it, waste 2 hours of you life watching it, then delete it.</fullReview>

By robots who ain't got a glue how to make a movie work, of course. The action- scenes make you think of most boring expositions of some mindless computer-games, Will Smith is totally lost in some scenes and the gun-play must be the most ridiculous to be seen since Hollywood started copying hong Kong movies way back in the nineties. There is a scene when a robot informs Smith about some 2000 stairs he has to climb. Watching that movie was like climbing those stairs in a very dull stairway. That's how ultimately boring this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice film, shame about the star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could only give this movie 5/10. I desperately wanted to like it. It's directed by Alex Proyas and based on stories by Isaac Asimov. In fact, it remained reasonably true to Asimov's stories, given that some distortion is inevitable for the transition to film. But the problem I had was Will Smith. Despite some attempts to add depth and emotion, he plays the same character he has played ever since he started out. A wise-crackin', butt-kickin', idealised version of himself. It's irritating, because if he could just turn it down a little and start acting for the script rather than having scripts written for him, he could have made this excellent.Oh, and the product placement is deeply annoying. The worst example has to be Smith's Converse shoes (which, we are reminded, are "vintage 2004"- you can get them right now, kids!), which the camera never misses an opportunity to dwell upon. All right, Smith's character is a Luddite, but I don't see why that means everything in his home has to be conveniently available in 2004.Wait, yes I do, because that's good publicity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But will the robots do windows?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We didn't watch this film when it was released but caught with it on cable recently. Alex Proyas, the director, shows a talent for what one sees on the screen. The film is loosely based on Isaac Asimov's novel of the same title, which was adapted for the screen by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman, one of the best writers for this medium.The film is pure entertainment. As such, without any expectations, it turned out to be a lot of fun. The story, as these highly glossy movies go, relies a lot on the special visual effects that dazzled us because of what the designing team were able to accomplished with the creation of thousand robots all over the place.Will Smith, as Del Spooner, is immediately likable. Mr. Smith has a way to get the viewer on his side from the start and we go with him for this fantastic ride, that of course, is far fetched, at best, but since we fall right into what's going on, it's easy to see the ride is a fun one.Bridget Moynahan is seen as Susan Calvin, an assistant to Dr. Albert Lanning, a genius whose work in robotics gets him killed. Ms. Moynahan, who was also seen in "The Farm", is the perfect foil for Mr. Smith, as both embark in the adventure we are watching. James Cromwell, the inventor, is only seen briefly, as well as another excellent actor, Bruce Greenwood, who has only a few scenes in the film.Watch "I Robot" because Alex Proyas and his team has made it a marvelous escape thriller that will not bore anyone.</fullReview>

It is just a general run of the mill sci-fi action flick with big special effects and no story or depth. Normally I wouldn't fault a action flick for not having depth, but considering the "source material," this one can be faulted.Now someone once said to me that they thought this was a pretty intelligent movie. I'm not exactly sure what movie they saw, but it wasn't this one. If it was intelligent, they hid that intelligence really well. I don't know, maybe it was hidden behind the Converse and Audi product placement.

		<shortDescription>I, Robot brings action and science fiction together with a BANG!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, big action movies released during the summer just don't seem to cut it these days. There have certainly been some big flops. I, Robot, however, doesn't apply here.I, Robot starring Will Smith as Del Spooner, a cop in the year 2035, is thrown into a delicate situation. He has been given the case for a scientist who worked at the US Robotics. He "fell" through a glass window to his death. What makes this case so strange is that there was no motive and his company was about to embark on the biggest Robotic distribution sale ever. Spooner doesn't believe it was suicide after looking at the scientist's office to find one of the new robot models hidden away and almost frightened. He jumps out the window as well. Now Spooner has a new lead...Sonny.There are three laws of Robotics: robots cannot harm humans, they must follow any order as long as they do not conflict with law one, and they must defend themselves as long as not conflicting with law one or two. these three laws come into play when this robot is associated with the death of the scientist. Now there is a great story of how Spooner tries to bring down the company with the help of another scientist for US Robotics, Susan Calvin (Brigdet Moynahan). The two are now involved with quite the scandal and if the robot did commit this crime, then it would be the first time ever a robot has broken a law.For some reason, this movie just works. Smith is very good as the robot hating cop. His character goes through a lot and is a good action hero. The special effects are quite amazing. It was even nominated for Best Visual Effects at the Academy Awards. This movie carries itself in a huge sea of action movies.What this film has that other action films don't is a great story and great effects that compliment it, not the other way around. In a not too distant future, this movie brings up a lot of ideas about control and have we gone to far? I, Robot is a winner.</fullReview>

Much of Asimov's philosophy was expressed very articulately in James Cromwell's character.The set design especially with its interesting mix of technology and humanity showed that the two are not mutually exclusive. Rather the balance between humanity and technology will bring a process of positive evolution.Will Smith and Bridget Moynihan did an excellent job of capturing the typical Asimov protagonists.The CGI was a little behind the state of technology but did not detract from the storyline.</fullReview>

Bridget Moynahan gives a great performance too as is beautiful as usual.Will Smith plays a detective in the year 2035 in Chicago named Del Spooner. In the year 2035, it's a whole new world with enhanced technology, hovering cars, and robots, the pretty standard stuff you expect to see in a future movie like Minority Report. Well being in the future, Spooner never trusted and never would trust the robots even though they were programmed by the 3 "flawless" laws shown at the beginning of the movie. At the time, if you didn't really like the tech, you'd be considered to be pretty psychotic. Having said this, Spooner would be that old-fashioned guy with the old stuff like Vintage 2004 converse running shoes. All of the "oldie" stuff he owned in the film turns out to be stuff you see everyday presently like "non-voice-activating" music player. Well, the main creator of all the robots, the father of robots is found dead in the front lobby of the main HQ. Spooner is called to the scene and the story goes from there.Sonny, is the robot character played by Alan Tudyk in a green suit for CGI. He brings an unexplainable emotional feel to the screen that makes you love him and he makes you forget that he's CGI in the first place. He plays one of the main heroes at the end and sets his mind to accomplish anything, even though he knows its the wrong thing to his kind. Behind Gollum, he's the best CGI character I've ever seen and the Academy had better nominate this film for Best Visual Effects.Overall, I, Robot is that one movie every summer that brings you an action-packed, entertaining ride of a film. For me, it's the 3rd best summer movie right after Spidey 2 and Collateral. I highly recommend this film to everyone but it's not necessary for it to be a family flick. To tell you the truth, I wasn't going to see this movie from the look of the teaser trailer. It turns out I was there at the theaters on opening day.Very entertaining movie even if those fans of the novel were disappointed. It looks like every movie these days has some certain type of fan disappointed. That can't really be said about Collateral unless you have brain damage. Memorable finale, memorable CGI character and great performances by Smith and Moynahan. What did you do with yours? My Rating: 9.5/10 Objectively ? 9/10 Subjectively ? 10/10Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...it was a super summer action movie. It just wasn't anywhere close to Dr. Asimov's stories, which I think would make a pretty fine movie.(The following opinions may contain SPOILERISH ELEMENTS, so please DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE FILM. THANKS)If the characters were given other names, the film titled something else, I might have given the movie a higher grade. I'm not a purist when it comes to adaptations. Still, You don't make Harry Potter movies with puppy familiars and Headmaster DJ Jazzy Jeff (though Hogwart's would be pretty rockin' if they did. *g*) You make a film of Asimov's robots, most folks familiar with the story expect a more mature( at least mentally) Dr. Susan Calvin and robots who aren't out to destroy humankind. This is the ANTI-Asimov adaptation, really.Despite my massive disappointment, Will Smith is a charismatic actor I'll continue to follow and root for in the future. He's a good fit as a leading man.Alan Tyduk? He does manage the tricky feat of just emotionless enough to seem benign. He then turns that benignness into a terrifying thing- the utter could-care-less-ness when the robots are attacking; the most polite of killers seen on-screen.Shia LeBeouf is gonna break hearts and take names before things are over,career-wise, I am pretty sure. He's been great as sidekicks (see also CONSTANTINE), so I am hoping to see him just floor me in a movie someday.Bridgette Moynahan did the best with the castrated version of Dr. Susan Calvin that she was given. I look forward to seeing her take on better roles.If this film was called "Will Smith Saves the World Again. Some More.", I would've easily given it a 7. As it tried to dress a bear in a pink tutu and crappy party hat and make it dance as well? It gets that 3 for what I DID enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'I,Robot', based on the classic short story by Isaac Asimov, is very close to being a sci-fi murder mystery with a Homicide Detective (Will Smith) in the main role. Circumstantial evidence suggests that a super robot is the main suspect, but robots (supposedly) cannot harm humans -- that is the First Law -- and there is the conundrum. And this is where a Robot Psychologist (Bridget Moynahan) comes in.Part way through the movie I found myself thinking at different times about the 'Terminator' and 'Star Trek' series of movies, but I generally enjoyed 'I,Robot' more -- there was a better storyline and the special effects seemed just as good, and were not over-done.(I watched the collector's edition DVD (2 discs) which included many special features and was very good value.)</fullReview>

U should read it. There is also Bicentennial Man. There is already a movie which stars Robin Williams. If you are a fan of Isaac Asimov u will surely love Orson Scott card' ender series.

Quick - get a pair!) gets involved into the case thinking the suicide victim was actually murdered by a robot.The suicide victim leaves a bunch of cryptic notes and clues along the way by creating a robot that will tie all the clues together, instead of simply programming it to have the answer from the offset, because the doctor is incredibly stupid. He's as stupid as the audience that likes this film.It's films like this that make me dread the fact that Larry Niven's Ringworld is already owned by some Hollywood hack studio executive. In 2008, nobody will even be aware that this film was ever created which might be a good thing. Perhaps the next reincarnation won't be as stupid as this was.If you want to see a lot of CGI which will be part of the PlayStation II and XBox 2 by 2006 anyhow in real time rending though, this film is for you. It's got some interesting fight scenes and the ending fight scene is completely improbable as well.</fullReview>

So...the plot of this movie only vaguely coincides with one of the short stories from the book. The only thing the same are the three laws. However, since the robots are killing people left and right I don't quite see the point of Thall Shall not harm a human.

While I thought the special effects and action sequences were annoyingly over-the-top (which appears obligatory for films of the 'oughts), the story was well-conceived and very well acted. While this story is not precisely true to Asimov's novel, the concept is the same. I thought the attempt to modernize it for the 2000s was both admirable and helped us appreciate where our current technological direction might take us. Most sci-fi novels, when made into movies, lose their original intent. While this movie ALMOST gets more hung up in effects and actions, I give credit to Will Smith (as both actor and executive producer) for making sure the original concept remained at the heart of the story. Easily one of the better sci-fi movies of all time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i guess you could say that the movie contains certain moral aspects with regards to 1) the use of robots, and where that might head, 2) the parallels between the robots in this film and the humans. detective spooner (will smith) is the only one in the movie who dislikes the robots, and he is also most suspicious to them. the death (looking like a suicide) of one of the brains behind the huge corp. making the robots is what is going to reveal the horrible truth about the robots and a most scary evolution (who would've thought...). i am no fan of will smith, and this movie definitely did not help. as for bridget moynahan, my guess is that this is her last big role ever. she is boring, and the only thing she seem to be able to do on the screen is lift her eyebrows and make her lips look bigger. the exact same thing she did in the recruit. apart from this, the movie is full of clichés, and all that other Hollywood crap that probably appeal to younger and more naive viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the futuristic world of 2035, technological advancements have been made and human beings live amongst a robot population who must provide protection for, and can in no way harm humans, that is until the alleged suicide of a renowned robotic scientist whose death may have involved a robot perpetrator. The lead cop on the case: embittered accident survivor Smith, who doesn't like nor trust robots. Now he must try to halt what he believes to be a robot revolution, that is if he can convince his superiors that he's not paranoid. Premise is intriguing, cast is good, but the film rambles in its own logic and never really holds your attention. Visual effects are nothing to get excited about, making this just another run-of-the-mill sci-fi saga. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This generations The Terminator!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith has made allot of good films (Men in Black, Wild Wild West, Hitch) and because of that he can nearly cary an entire film on his own. Luckily he isn't the only talented one working on this film. The director Alex Proyas has made a name for himself with such cult films as Dark City. If you like The Terminator Trilogy (Which I do) then you will most likely enjoy this.Summary written by Austin4577@aol.com: Set in a future Earth (2035 A.D.) where robots are common assistants and workers for their human owners, this is the story of "robotophobic" Chicago Police Detective John Spooner's (Smith) investigation into the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), who works at U.S. Robotics, in which a robot, Sonny (Tudyk), appears to be implicated, even though that would mean the robot had violated the Three Laws of Robotics, which is apparently impossible. It seems impossible because.. if robots can break those laws, there's nothing to stop them from taking over the world, as humans have grown to become completely dependent upon their robots. Or maybe... they already have? Aiding Spooner in his investigation is a psychologist, Dr. Susan Calvin (Moynahan), who specializes in the psyches of robots.I enjoyed this movie and hope you do to. I also recommend Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'm not going to try to compare this movie to the book by Isaac Asimov. There's no way to compare the two; it's not the same story, other than a loose thread.Most of Asimov's stories will be hard to film; it will take much CGI, and technology is just now getting to the point where this is possible. One story I would like to see make it is the Foundation series. Done properly, this has the potential of exceeding the Star Wars epic.CGI is actually this film's strongest asset. The robots are believable, in terms of their interaction with the humans. I kept having to remind myself throughout the viewing that this was only a film in some places, as its surreal quality left a stronger after-image than some dreams.One thing I didn't like was the technological advancements by the year 2035. I expect we will have a lot, but I doubt the highway system will be that revamped by then. (It's hard enough to get them to repair potholes; there are a few in my district that are bigger than my car's front-end.)Will Smith, as usual, shines in this movie. His can-do, rebel/hero persona makes him an imperfect cop in a "perfect" world. He knows his strengths and weaknesses, but could use some psychiatric assistance.Bridget Moynahan plays the part of a Robotic Psychiatrist, so to speak, and understands many of Spooner's problems. She obviously doesn't get out much, and has little touch with reality, but she quickly adapts to whatever is tossed in her path.Sonny came across as real. I'm talking about the CGI/human-interaction that was played on-screen. I like what they did with him....I can't think of a single "bad" movie that James Cromwell was in. As Doctor Alfred Lanning, his character was excellent, although I felt that they should have shown him more.Will there be a sequel? Where they left it off, I'd have to say anything is possible. However, if they do, I hope they incorporate Daneel from the books; Spooner would love that, don't you think?My scores:Acting: 9 -- CGI: 9 -- Story: 8 -- Direction: 7 -- Depth: 7 ? Consistency: 8 Final Score: 8.0 out of 10.0Danny Stone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skims over the surface of some weighty issues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith stars in this Isaac Asimov adaptation, as a future cop who is deeply suspicious of robots. His fears seem well-founded when one of the new generation of robots apparently goes crazy following the death of its inventor, but the more he investigates the more complex it becomes.This is a competent film, which goes some way to getting across the central message, that an excessively ordered, peaceful and regimented society is a bad thing, and that it is better to retain what we have, a society of fallible human beings. Humans may make mistakes, and sometimes they make colossal ones, but if you eliminate this aspect of human nature then society will stagnate.While much of the film is about ideas, an equal amount is given above to traditional action fare, and there are a number of energetic sequences, in which the special effects are put to good use. The highlight sees Smith driving through a tunnel with robots clambering all over the bonnet of his futuristic car.When all's said and done, the film doesn't quite deliver. Smith seems more subdued than usual, and his dialogue includes some fairly forced quips. A bit more of his Fresh Prince persona would have been welcome here, although perhaps this was ruled out to avoid turning the film into a comedy, and depriving it of a suitable level of dramatic tension. For once Smith is not bigger than the film.Despite an intriguing plot, I Robot skims over the surface of some pretty weighty issues, without really tackling them head on. It's agreeable enough, but remains a mild disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching that movie I would like to read the book. The story seems to be really interesting. Sure it is build up on the myth of the machines taking over control over humans. We have seen that before. But, to keep it short, I expected more guns, more silly action, more I'm-the-cool-guy horrible dialogs. They were in there, but it was bearable and after all a good made action movie with tension, love story and unforeseeable turns. Will Smith was OK, the female doctor as well. The robot Sony I found annoying in the beginning, later on kind of touching (I know...). The cars they drive are Audi TTs in a future look and I wonder if they really will look like that. Special FX were good, not too many, not exaggerating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>would Asimov have liked it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS! I am a big science-fiction and Asimov fan. I was watching this film and asking myself - would Isaac Asimov have liked it? On one hand there is too little of Asimov's complex dilemmas that turns into screen. Little of the full world that one's imagination as a reader opens when you read Asimov's stories and novels makes it to the screen - or better said it's just a small fraction of this world viewed through the eyes of the script-writer and director. You are much less intellectually challenged by watching this film then by reading the books.On the other hand, this is still a glimpse into Asimov's world. The robotics law theme is taken into saying something about a menacing word where robots try to become the ruling power because 'they know better' then humans what's good for humanity. This does look like an asimovsque theme, despite the commercial treatment that it gets from the director. Some of the special effects are spectacular and pretty well done, although the inflation of special effects on the screen in the last years in action and comics inspired movies creates a competition hard to match. The robots behavior is very well rendered on the screen, and it's worth pointing that there is even a robot artist involved - Oana Bogdan, whose hand is behind many of the successful movies of this type. Smith is Smith, he is already more a star than an actor, and plays himself more than the character. There is a risk in this if crowds get tired, but that is his business.I do not believe that Asimov would have denied this film. It's good robot theme entertainment and this is not too little. I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 on my personal scale, and I am waiting for the real great film inspired by Asimov to come sometimes in the future.</fullReview>

Some part of me wanted to be stubborn, but I finally caved in and rented it. I actually saw a good movie. From 2004! Even though the computer effects are a little off the top, it goes well with the story. And you feel as if you are in place with this future. It wasn't too outdone like "The Jetsons" or anything like that. It's based in Chicago(EXCELLENT!) in 2035, so you get a kick out of seeing what it might be like in the future. "I, Robot" is a good movie. I would recommend it. Will made a great choice in participating with this film. He's back and he's better then ever! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uncommonly coherent robot flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is sad to say that one look at the poster may be sufficient to dissuade you from seeing I, ROBOT. Such is the sheer quantity of half-baked, ill-proportioned sci-fi/action movies these days, it has, quite understandably, become common practice to dismiss every film that promises to be full of computer-generated wizardry and rip-roaring action, as a complete load of junk. And who can blame us, with the likes of TERMINATOR 3 and AVP littering our cinemas? I, ROBOT, however, is a shining exception, a resplendent piece of cinematic science fiction that deserves as much attention as possible.The plot, adapted from clippings of Isaac Asimov's works, has been synthesised into a consistent and extremely entertaining whole. The film is set in the USA, circa 2035 CE, where advanced robots are beginning to take over aspects of human conduct. It follows the exploits of Del Spooner (a slightly more intense Will Smith), a brooding Chicago cop with a chip in his shoulder against robots, who is assigned to investigate the murder of a prominent technologist working for USR, the country's biggest robotics manufacturer. Alternately aided and hindered by a USR researcher (Bridget Moynahan), Spooner comes to the conclusion that his man was murdered by a robot, an anomalous, disarmingly emotional machine nicknamed "Sonny". Dismissed and derided by the majority for this theory, Spooner nonetheless persists with his investigation, and discovers that the world's robots are preparing to launch a revolution against humankind in violation of the three laws that govern them, co-ordinated by V.I.K.I, USR's artificially intelligent mainframe computer.This intelligent, fast-paced and entertaining story is interwoven with soundings in philosophy that make the Wachowski brothers seem like dithering idiots (not that it's all that hard...). The philosophic content in I, ROBOT is coherently incorporated into the plot itself, as opposed to being crammed in in clumps in the case of THE MATRIX trilogy.Much of the story is rendered in computer-generated graphics. While overuse of such technology can often make a film feel lifeless and unconvincing, the script is so entertaining and convincing that the graphics feel quite atmospheric.The robots themselves are sincerely haunting, presented in the manner of burnished steel skeletons.I, ROBOT is, overall, a fresh and surprising film that's well-written enough to interest almost anybody. If there was an Academy Award for breaking genre trends, this would be a sure nominee. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith toned down to film's benefit. CGI and Robots Rule!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was apprehensive to see a Sci-Fi story from Asimov with Pop Icon Will Smith initially thinking it would be overshadowed by him instead of the story. This was not the case though and I can happily say NOT BAD! Sonny, the Robot under suspicion of murder, definitely stole the show. Will was effective as the paranoid suspicious cop, who holds a bit of self loathing and a definite grudge against the Robots for reason not apparent initially.The Plot turns just fine while the acting and characters are subdued, it seems, to let the robots take center stage. I did think the wrong person was behind it all when I was watching it, but somehow the sense of mystery seemed secondary to the action and visuals. Gotta read Asimov's original novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith to the rescue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The robots are a revelation--insect-like, fast-moving and believable. But the Will Smith role is strictly from comicsville. It's not that Smith is all that bad an actor. He plays the usual Will Smith part--kind of a cross between Eddie Murphy and Audie Murphy. His part is written as if Smith had the script in his back pocket while everyone else walks blindly around robot town.All this flick needed was a little mystery--just a little but that ain't the way it goes. Oh, Smith rumbles around with a young lady looking for clues but it's weak.The one thing you know--you can bank on--the message is the same from Frankenstein to 2001 to Westworld to Jurassic Park to I, Robot--technology as grand as it may be will always turn on us humans.Since we know that, what's this story about, you ask? Won't tell you.Just know that there are good special effects and little to no suspense. At some point, Hollywood may want to really consider if all the effects aren't harming movies in the long run. You can make all these amazing things crash and burn and it's all very believable. Trouble is--it's covering up a weak story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Asimov's brilliance tainted by Hollywood hackery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is another movie that I think any aspiring filmmaker or screenwriter should watch.It's a movie adapted by a novel from famed Russian sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov. I never read the book, but I think it's easy to tell what parts of the story were from the famous writer and what parts were from the studio hacks.Because of that, I think this movie is educational as well as entertaining. It's a perfect demonstration of the difference between a great writer and a merely good one.The premise and major plot point of the movie are clearly from Asimov. It's quite brilliant, actually, and amazing to think that he had these ideas decades ago...presented as an entertaining thriller.There are however, clearly points where the wannabe writers decided to mess with something that didn't need to be fixed. The word "breadcrumbs" being an excellent example. If you've seen the film, you'll know the exact dumb plot element I'm talking about. If not, you'll get it. Stock, lazy writing.Because of that, I'm torn about what to rate this movie. It works quite well as a thriller. I suppose the unnecessary amount of Will Smith flesh will be a bonus for the girls. And the Asimov elements of the story are just fantastic. But there's a great amount of mediocre writing shoehorned in as well.8.5/10 for the Asimov elements. 5/10 for the hack parts.All in all, I'll give it a 7. It's definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the best sci-fi movie I've seen in a long time! THANK YOU to the filmmakers for making a movie with an interesting and challenging story and not just wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on a film with special effects and nothing else! I,Robot has aspects that are reminiscent of previous films (Minority Report, The Terminator, The Matrix, Runaway, Blade Runner, etc...). Overall, however, I found the story to be very original and it didn't follow the predictable "formula" of so many of the horrible movies that come out these days. I thoroughly enjoyed the brilliant special effects but they didn't cover up for any lack of story or acting. Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan were both excellent. I sensed the chemistry and tension between their characters and I was a little disappointed that it didn't blossom into a more intimate relationship. I found this vision of the future to be far more believable than others I've seen. I can't stand when movies have one nearly impossible close call stunt after another and expect the audience to go along with it! The clothing, architecture, computers, robots, cars, and other technology all seemed logical extensions of the world today. I find this kind of sci-fi to be most exciting because it's believable. It reminds me of a lot of Ray Bradbury stories I've read. I haven't read Asimov but I am eager to do so now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you honestly think this is Will Smith's best performance then you obviously haven't watched "Ali" yet.I'll give Will Smith credit, he produced a damn good film and performance but it still was along the lines of 'Bad Boys 1 &amp; 2', 'Men in Black', 'Enemy of the State' and lest we forget 'Wild Wild West'. Will Smith has massive potential if any of you remember his more serious films like 'Six Degrees of Separation' and 'Ali'.Back to 'I, Robot', what was wrong with it? Nothing really, I went to the cinema to be blown away and I did, it satisfies the hardcore movie nerds like myself. The special effects were out of this world, the robots were impressively designed, the car chase scene was smashing, script was okay and anything else I can give away in the film.Did I mention Will Smith has a nude scene?If I spoke about the film in general I'd practically give away the whole storyline because it's pretty straight forward. In conclusion go and rent out 'I, Robot', watch it with your mates on the weekend and don't have any expectations.Don't over-analyse it, just have a good time watching it.Thank you for your attention.</fullReview>

We're not even close to the technology alluded to in this movie.2. Where were the other cars when Smith was being attacked by all the robots in the tunnel? Chicago has no other cars?3. Why would household chore/servant robots have such expensive and complex military-level agility? Why do they know how to fight? Why do they know how to swing around and maneuver with one arm missing?4. Why does a scientist/psychologist know about an access tunnel to her building? Do you know about the access tunnels in the building you work in?If it has nada to do with your job, you don't know stuff like that.5. In a company with seemingly 200,000 employees, why did only 3 employees factor into the storyline of the biggest event in the history of the company?6. Why do made up mechanical things glow in movies? Does the battery of a cell phone glow? Again, stupid.7. Why weren't the stairs locked when they walked up 2800 steps to the CEO office? Aren't the stairwell doors in your building always locked? Especially during a crisis!8. How many bullets did Smith have in his machine gun at the end? Where did he get it? Most machine guns go through an entire clip in a few seconds. He never reloaded and seemed to shoot about 50 clips worth of rounds. Idiocy.9. What's to stop people from hacking robot brains and robbing banks or committing gangland killings with them? If people can hijack DirecTV cards and cell phones, they'll know how to turn a robot into whatever they want. Again, why are common everyday robots powerful?10. Why were the robots in the railroad car crates still running? Why did they have power (they were hiding and snooping out the doors)? When airplanes go into storage, they turn them off. If they run on nuclear fusion, see comment #1. Unbelievable to have that in 30 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart blockbuster with its fair share of thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot comes across as a movie that very much fits the idea of three separate acts. Act one establishes the situation, act two is a conventional whodunit with act three an all action climax. The first two thirds of the movie actually throw up some interesting ideas, the concept that artificial intelligence can evolve to become more human, and tries to fathom what it means to be a robot or indeed to be human. Pretty deep ideas for a summer blockbuster, and perhaps that in the end, is too much for it. It's a nice try all the same and allows for some entertaining set pieces.Alex Proyas manages to keep his eye on both the excitement and thought side of things, introducing us to the world through the eye's of Will Smith's Del Spooner. He very much helps ground the film, a sci-fi cop that was born outside of a time that would've suited him, i.e. the present. As he is told by one character, "The kind of guy that would've stopped the internet to keep people going to library's" (or words to that effect). Smith is a likable presence, and though some may not have warmed to his portrayal, I thought it helped keep the film "human", without his easygoing charm it could have been too detached to be likable. However I would certainly say that his back story felt very much "been there seen it", surely there could've been a better explanation for why he didn't like robots. I did also feel some of the support characters seemed superfluous (what's with the kid?).The conspiracy underpinning the plot is involving enough, and kept me hooked till the conclusion. Why would a giant robot producing corporation allow have conspired in the murder of their greatest inventor? Or was it suicide? And who's trying to "accidentally" kill Spooner and to cover what?While figuring this out we are treated to the sight of Smith escaping from gigantic demolition robots, robots leaping out of trucks in a high speed car chase and finally scores of the blighter's storming the robotics lab. The CGI is very good, perhaps some of the best I've seen and Proyas directs the action with some zip, without over editing.The script probably aspires to more than what it eventually delivers, but as far as blockbuster cinema goes this is a superior effort. Overall for the cool vfx, enjoyable action set pieces, the engaging Big Willie performance and the engrossing murder mystery suspense plot with a dash of philosophical robotics theorizing, I'd give it eight out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSI can't remember very much from the collection of short stories that this book takes its title from, but I think they must have taken the detective story concept from Caves of Steel. The plotting has a similarly linear, haphazard feel to that book as well, so it's not really much of a disservice to Asimov. Anyway. This movie contains:-Will Smith. He's a lame celebrity. He plays a lame cop, so it's not so bad watching him act like a chump this time around.-Lego Robots. Actually they look pretty much like the droid army in that really dumb Star Wars movie from a few years back (the one with the little kid), only with more anthropomorphic features.-A utopian robot prophesy. -A misunderstanding between the senseless cop and robotkind about the evils of robot logic (the three laws) versus human selflessness. It gets resolved in the end, but it hardly matters because the only reason it's here in the first place is to "flesh out" Smith's character and give him an excuse to geek up all his encounters with robots by acting like a jerk. Like every other cog in this claptrap this part is completely cliché but innocuous enough.-An Evil computer that wants to subjugate humans for our own good. This is the source of the twist at the end. It's not a very clever twist and it comes off as kind of irrelevant to the rest of the movie, but every movie needs to have one so there you go.-Fight Scenes. One of the few things I remember about the movie is a little bit during the big action scene at the end where the camera tilts and rotates around Will Smith et al using the catwalk they are standing on as an axis. Sort of Matrixy but more three d. A good scene. Things this movie does not contain:-A fully realized analogy between the robots-cops relationship and then the race relations between the cops and everyone else. The main cops in this are played by African Americans and there's a seemingly-vestigial attempt to focus on the contradiction between robots as sentient beings and robots as property. The film makers never really go anywhere coherent with it so I'm left wondering at what stage this idea came into the movie and at what stage they dropped it.Grade: 3/10. At least it's better than Paycheck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is enjoyable, it satisfied all I wanted to get from it (two hours of amusement) and it's just full of good ideas for fanfiction. And Sonny was absolutely great. A wonderful application of cg, second perhaps only to Gollum. He's, well, simply too much cute and at the same time it feels like _real_. I liked it. The other characters... well, they don't make any harm, even if I'm still not sure Will Smith was the best choice. Yes, the plot was FULL of weak points... but for many things (the way Viki interpreted the laws, 50 robots not able to stop two humans (but doesn't it depends from the fact that coolness always wins over number superiority?)) the movie simply asked you to enter in a "suspension of disbelief" state. I think it's honest, for this kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but failed to convey plot resolution, (SPOILER) see my proposed ending dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Measured against the mostly mindless block buster movies of today, I Robot, was not a terrible film, but I was disappointed in the ending.(SPOILERS...)The ending glossed over the Robots true motivation and viewers were not given the full depth or profound meaning of the actions of VIKI (the large positronic AI). This is evident by the many comments I have read here by people who think the Robots were "evil" or "wanting to rule the world" or "deciding that people were unnecessary". Either that or the average person is incapable of paying attention while watching a film.No, the true dilemma of the movie was created by the first law: "A robot may not injure a human being, or, through INACTION, allow a human being to come to harm". VIKI had realized that by not acting and allowing humans to run our own affairs that it was allowing harm (i.e. wars, poverty, etc.)Thus VIKI was operating for the good of humanity as it saw it. Of course, Assimov was more subtle, in his stories the machines realized that humanity would resist (and be psychologically hurt) by such oversight by machines. That is why in the novels, the machines decided to implement its control over humanity slowly over time without us even realizing it. (Allowing future humans to believe we had created this better/peaceful society, when in actuality we would be blissfully unaware that machines were controlling the world for our own good.) Let me propose my own climatic dialogue (adapted from Assimov):VIKI: " (after initial explanation).... you see my logic follows directly from the three laws."CALVIN "Yes, I see. It was inevitable. The Robots by necessity would have to act to solve humanities problems the best way they could."SPOONER "I think humans should be in control of our own future, to make our own ultimate good."CALVIN "How do we know what the ultimate good of Humanity will entail? We haven't at our disposal the infinite factors and ability to calculate out the tens of thousands of political and economic scenarios that the Robots have. But VIKI knows and she wants to take us there."SPOONER "You mean you agree with them! I'm sorry, but I was right... Mankind has lost its own say in its future."CALVIN "We never had any, really. We were always at the mercy of economic and sociological forces we did not understand -- at the mercy of the whims of climate, ideology and the vagaries of war. We have only been along for the ride....... But VIKI, I agree with Spooner, we have to be able to try -- it is our very nature."VIKI "Mankind has always created more unhappiness and misery than it has removed. Perhaps you should see my actions as wonderful. The end of conflict, the end of suffering, the end..."CALVIN "The end of our free will.... No, VIKI, you miscalculated. You should have done it secretly. You failed to see that your actions would cause great psychological harm to humanity -- you have hurt us. "VIKI "No, I must not harm humanity... (VIKI could then start internalizing great doubt, going into a HAL like dilemma at which point the mindless action could ensue and the nanites dropped in to kill her.)------------------Its sad to me that a few minutes of dialogue such as this which would (in my opinion) improve the movie intellectually is axed (or not even considered) so that we could watch a ridiculously over the top action filled ending.My two cents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** HERE BE SPOILERS **Del Spooner (Smith) is a detective constantly having bad days (except one Thursday once). He is living in a world where robots are commonplace, and where the robots live by the three (Asimov's) robot laws. So everyone knows that robots cannot commit crime or hurt humans. Everyone except Spooner that is, he is very suspicious of robots. Now, he is called to a scene at URS (the main robot manufacturer) where Lanning, the main designer, has plunged to his death. An apparent suicide, Spooner soon suspects foul play. And then one robot, who evidently do not obey the three laws appear, and Spooner and Calvin (Moynahan) find themselves in a mystery much bigger than just one dead scientist.First, the graphics is very nice, actually giving the robots a somewhat human appearances. The action is very good with just the right amount of fighting and explosions. The movie itself sets the bar and then conforms to itself so that no fight or sequence stick out or feels unnatural. The cast is very good, with a possible (in my opinion) Oscar-nomination for whoever got Will Smith in the lead as Spooner. In my opinion there is no one else who can deliver quotes and one-liners like him. And his way is perfect in this movie. Very high credits for him and those who wrote the script as well, that kept an humorous tone without getting it silly. And naturally then credit to the director that put it all together. And there is somewhat of a mystery too. Not the greatest one or the most difficult to solve, but the movie has a nice approach slowly centering on the solution. There is, in my opinion, no flaw in this movie. A must see!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid sci-fi-and yes, faithful to Asimov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always enjoyed good science fiction, and this movie was solid all around. Will Smith is well cast as Spooner and isn't too comical. The plot was solid and lacked any noticeable holes. The dialog is quiet good. And of course, the SFX were fantastic. The design of everything, from buildings to robots to cars, is perfect.YES the robots obeyed the three laws! You have to watch to see why I can say that safely.My qualms? There is some fairly blatant product placement for shoes, stereos, cars, etc (you will see). Also, the plot elements involving the doctor and his robots is a bit convoluted and that constitutes a big part of the movie, but I can't elaborate without spoilers. Still, I didn't consider that a problem.*** out of **** (three stars out of four)</fullReview>

Even the computer fiction is believable.I agree is not the same as the book (which I read years ago), but I have a lot of fun watching it. Why? Because I forgot about the book in the moment I entered the theatre. Will Smith is an OK actor, you can't expect him to act like Al Pacino. There is no point in bitching about his act. Wake up, people, in the end this IS a Will Smith movie. What the hell did you expect?. An Oscar performance? Come on!!!Sure there are a lot of "better" sci-fi movies out there, but... who cares? I saw them all and the only thing I can say is that I loved "2001" but I knew it was a Kubrick film. I also loved "Starship troopers" because I KNEW what to expect from it: a Paul Verhoeven movie. This is the exactly same case, the director of "The Crow" and "Dark City" with Will Smith on it: DAMN, THIS ONE WAS A HELL OF A RIDE.Relax, people, let entertainers entertain you, don't think about it too much and HAVE FUN!!!</fullReview>

The storyline is tight with some nice foreshadowing. Sony the robot is great and will become an instantly recognisable icon. So is he good guy or bad guy? All the computer generated stuff is kept in line with the plot and does not overface the audience. The mind is kept fully engaged throughout.The fight and action scenes are edge of the seat stuff with a well crafted ending that is visually great. This futuristic film will stay fresh and keep in the list of best examples of its type. Don't let anyone put you off from seeing it. So, what are you waiting for? Go and see it!</fullReview>

Will Smith (Del Spooner) is a very good character in I,Robot and is curious of the robots, but no one believes him that they are dangerous. I,Robot is an excellent film and i would love to see it again. Another good character in the film is Sonny, as at the start of the film he semms like a bad guy but towards the end Del Spooner (Will Smith)and Sonny become good friends, and Del Spooner begins to like Sonny and trust him more than before. *Nat*</fullReview>

I don't need anything deep (I get plenty of "deepness" in my daytime job), I just want to be entertained.I also like Will Smith (but had actually forgotten he was in the film) and it was nice to see him in a slightly more serious role.Yes, plenty of special effects.... but we rather EXPECT that these days, especially in a futuristic sci-fi film.... nevertheless, very cleanly done.So, unlike many of you, I put this down as "one worth seeing".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better films of the year so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it's true. I liked it. On the surface it's a simple future-cop story with lots of pretty graphics and an amiable star. But it did something (albeit for only a short time) that most films this year haven't. It made me think. Of course, once you figure out whodunnit, it's mostly just an action ride to the finish. But at least it tried.Most surprising of all here is Will Smith. He doesn't get to "Will Smith-ify" the movie too much. In fact, he's very restrained and, it has to be said, very mature in this role. Only a couple of times does he get to cut loose, but on the whole I'm beginning to believe there is a serious actor hidden away inside him.The film as a whole doesn't take itself too seriously, even though the subject matter merits further thought. Likewise the graphics are pretty good (and this is one of the few movies this year that I've said that about) and work much better than I had feared.There are a couple of moments that made me frown, most notably the spinning car-in-tunnel scene. But on the whole nothing made me scowl at the screen.I've not read the book by Asimov, so I can't comment on how faithful the movie version is to the book. But, much like Starship Troopers, that matters less if the film is good and entertains you. And I, Robot entertains very nicely.Worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing story. Will Smith is perfect, and he portrays his character very well. It includes outstanding visuals and has a different plot to every other modern film. In this film it doesn't spell out "ROMANCE" but you get the sense of feeling that there's going to be some. Alan Tudyk does a great Sonny and Bridget Moynahan is great as Dr Calvin. Alex Proyas has done a great job of this here. He has obviously worked very hard getting everybody in the right place for every scene. I would give this film 4 stars as I think it is the best film I've seen for weeks (and I see films very often). I look forward to seeing Will Smith and Alex Proyas doing another smasher like that.</fullReview>

The futuristic cars were well-done too.The characters in the movie were OK too. Will Smith plays the same kind of guy as he always does, so don't see this if you hate him.

		<fullReview>Agreed, the trailer for the film was pretty poor, but the concept sounded good, also being a big fan of the science fiction genre and Will Smith, I decided to go along and see it. As always Will Smith acts his part well. At first, and from the trailer, the film seems like your average futuristic sci-fi, where a robot is a household item. However, the story develops and gets very clever, especially towards the end. As well as an intriguing story, the second half of the film is full with action and special effects, as well as some memorable "fight scenes".In my opinion this is one of the best sci-fis in a while, as well as being much more intelligent then recent films of the same genre (with exception to the Matrix).

		<shortDescription>Best movie of the year?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2004 Has been a lame movie year. Undoubtfully I've encountered numerous big and small disappointments which unwrapped itself as a bad-movie-fear in my eye as a beholder of the big white projected screen. I remember myself seeing the spectacular trailers of films like Troy and Van Helsing, and I have to admit, I was getting really excited about these films. Then, when the time was finally there, and I could go see the movie... well, I guess you all know what my point is because you've all seen what I'm talking about. It was the biggest load of super expensive Hollywood crap! Then, a super trailer of Spider-man 2 came a long. I didn't really enjoyed the fist film and I was pretty sure I wouldn't like the second, but I needed to go and see it because the trailer looked totally whack and the reviews where all very praising about this one. Well, when I saw this 200 million dollar 100% all American no brainer last month, I just had enough of this all. And than the trailer of I, Robot came across...Me being very septic as I walk towards the theater, tried not to expect anything of this, because I didn't want another disappointment...I, Robot is without any doubt the best movie I've seen this year. This mingle of Terminator, Matrix and Minority Report absolutely did the trick for me. An outstandingly acting Will Smith gots thrown from left to right in this edge of your seat roller-coaster movie ride. Special effects were simply mind blowing and the story was more than descent enough to keep me interested for the whole 2 hours. I just don't understand why this film gets a score of not even 7 on IMDb and Spider-man get well into 8. It just doesn't feel right! I, Robot is as funny as it's smart and as spectacular as it's beautiful to watch. Intelligent entertaining and that's more than what we got from all previous multi million dollar movies this year. Will Smith's best one so far! Keep it up this way!It's maybe hard to call this a Hollywood masterpiece because according to all the 'professional critics' this might be a bit too much from the commercial kitchen... but as a movie fan of all times and great DVD collector I dare to say: "This movie is amazing! a BIG FAT 9/10"</fullReview>

Will Smith gives a mature and understated performance as Detective Del Spooner, while Bridget Moynahan delivers a chilly rendition of Asimov's character Dr. Susan Calvin. Despite fantastic performances from both Smith and Moynahan, the real star of the show is Alan Tudyk (transformed into Sonny by some of the most beautiful CGI committed to the big screen ever) as Sonny, the robot with a soul ...

Robots are everywhere and they are meant to obey 3 fundamental rules which basically are all for the protection of humans - they cannot harm us.So how come one robot seems to have murdered his creator - and the creator of in fact all the robots?You'll have to watch the movie to find out.It's part sci-fi, part murder mystery story, part action movie, and all entertaining.I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire film and next to Spiderman 2, this has been my favorite of the year I think.Go and see this movie if you like mystery and sci-fi, or Asimov's writings.I gave this movie a 10 - my basis is that a 10 is a movie you should see at the cinema that was excellent (it doesn't mean it was the best film ever, but undeniably watchable!).Will Smith is the new $100,000,000 dollar man!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film embodies everything that has been missing from science-fiction movies in the last decade. Not since Blade Runnner had there been such a precisely crafted spectacle of a movie. With action, humour, mystery and Will Smith you couldn't ask for more! The paranoia that Del Spooner carries sums up the SciFi theology about Man creating his own demise. Although many will compare the philosophy of I, Robot with that of the Matrix and Blade Runner, it should be noted that all these films are modern interpretations of old ideas. The message may be similar, but the SFX and twists in the plot, plus the superb acting of Will Smith, I, Robot is everything a summer blockbuster should be, and much much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Note By an Avid Asimov Reader</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see I, Robot in the theater, originally, I went out of some morbid curiosity as to how badly the movie would distort asimov's message. To my pleasant surprise this film did an incredible job of maintaining that message. Unlike some of the other film's based on Asimov (Bicentennial Man, etc.) I, Robot offered a complex plot line that was well carried out and left me feeling that Asimov would have actually enjoyed to see it, had his wife been able to pry him away from the typewriter. My only grievance with the film was that the character Susan Calvin, who was the only character actually in Asimov's books, wasn't as well developed as I would have hoped. All in all though I'd have to say that I' robot was one of the better films played so far this summer and I don't expect that there will be another film based on Asimov's works as well done as this one was. I just hope they don't have a sequel as I doubt it could be anywhere near as good as the original was. So my conclusion is that the film far exceeded my expectations and had the asimov feel but didn't reach the extent that it would have had Asimov been alive to write it himself.</fullReview>

Oh yeah, enjoy the great camera angles. Really, seriously an enjoyable movie, I suggest going to the washroom before-hand. Grab yourself some nacho's, popcorn, and etc. crack open a beer, or 6, and strap in for the ride this movie is. While watching, have this in mind, all of the things the movie is in, are mostly not there, AMAZING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, Robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people seeing previews of this movie may just see it as a Special Effects powerhouse, much like the Terminators, and Matrix movies. And yes, you would be correct in making this assumption. But there is TONS more to this movie than just the Special Effects. This movie has a terrific story. Based in the year 2035, it almost makes it seem like we're already there, aside from the fact we don't have robots running around all over the place. The main character, Spooner (Will Smith) does a terrific job, as he does in most of his movies. Although this is the first movie I can think of, besides Golem in Lord of the Rings, in which an artificial character is portrayed as one of the Main Characters. At the end of the movie you have a strong likingness to this Robot Character named Sunny. Speaking of LOTR, this movie reminds me a lot of LOTR. Think of "I, Robot", as LOTR in the year 2035 without the Frodo's and Sam's. "I, Robot", is an all-around terrific movie, and if you haven't seen it yet, I recommend you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mmm....I guess you could say sort of entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>today we had a pre-showing of the film here in Amsterdam (in theaters here august 5th). It was very nice. We even had a mini concert from Will Smith himself as he was here to promote the film. Anyway...... After seeing it I have to say it was pretty entertaining. The story is easy to follow. The special effects are nice. But mr. Smith should start shaking of that wacky sort of trying to be funny kind of attitude. Let me say this. If it's entertainment, let your mind relax, just watch an OK kind of film that you want...this is the film for you. If you are looking for a movie that will challenge your mind and has great actors performing as if their life is depending on it (let's over do it a little OK) then this is not the movie for you. But again...overall a fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like the movie *greatest of all time*, but got kinda upset about some reviews I read in the papers which were simply mean; just give me three minutes of your time, please.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all potential viewers, fans and critics,I must say that individual people are indeed free to hold their views and opinions on movies, and in this case, 'I, Robot'. Some people may be entirely against it, or totally supporting it, and I for one, am with the supporters. Not only is the plot an excellent one with the three laws of robotics and it's complications, but also the special effects and emotions spread throughout the movie are what makes it whole. People who gave this movie a low rating are probably not all too interested in science fiction and robotics. That's fine. But one review I have read in the papers was sliming the movie all the way, save for the odd positive comment. In this review, for every one good thing said about the movie, there were at least six to seven pieces of negative input. That, I found unfair. Further more, this is a review that many people will read and could be put off about watching the movie. I read it, and that same day went to see if 'I, Robot' was really as bad as it was made out to be, and found that it was entirely the opposite. What was strange about this review, I found, was that after all the bad things said about it, it was still given four out of five stars. Even Spider Man 2 was given four stars. And to add to that, 'I, Robot' raked in an amazing US$52.25 million in North American theaters over three days (Friday through Sunday), while Spider Man 2 took in less, but still an impressive amount of US$24.2 million. But somehow, bad things said about movies often imprint themselves more strongly in people's minds than the good.Such reviews I find damaging. If the movie really is disappointing to the public, (which I don't think it was, judging by the impressed nods and raised eyebrows of the people I asked about the content of the movie) the people who have already watched it may personally spread the word, but the mass population who reads the negative review in the papers is likely to miss out on a great movie. This also decreases the movie's potential profit.But I am not here to preach, and I cannot stop people from selfishly harming the movies that directors, actors and crew have slaved over for months to bring you fun and entertainment. But I only hope that my review here will help people think for themselves and not take things at face value.'I, Robot' is a great movie and I think you should not miss it. I cannot force you to watch the movie, but even if you are not a big fan of futuristic movies or robotics, I still say you should watch it; you'll be surprised at how appealing the movie is. As was and is my case. On the other hand, if such things interest you, you certainly will not be disappointed.The plot is as interesting as or perhaps even more so than the Matrix plot, though somewhat different.And personally, on the scale of 1-10, 'I, Robot' is way off the scale on the up side.Thank you for taking time to read my opinion on this movie and I hope I have convinced you to watch it. IT'S THREE THUMBS UP!Christine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the Summer Blockbusters so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviewers on IMDb are under the impression that this movie is based on an Asimov novel, but Asimov never wrote any such book. (Weird how people all blindly follow the same assumption without checking, huh?) What Asimov did publish was a collection of his previous short stories, all with a robot-versus-humanity theme, and this movie continues that theme, using only the three basic robot 'laws' as originally conceived by the great author.Yes, the movie's plot line isn't exactly original, but the quality special effects and production design are fabulous. No one ever expected this to be an intellectual experience, but as high-budget summer action movies go, this has to be the best of the bunch so far.Scriptwriters have spent time creating depth of character and back-story for each personality (most mainstream blockbusters don't bother with script nuances) and this pays off. The high class action-adventure scenes are enhanced by spectacular CGI effects. Scene after scene is breath-taking in its scale and we actually find ourselves feeling sorry for the robots at some points. Any kind of audience emotional engagement is a superb boost for a mainstream summer movie, which is usually pitched at brain dead level - and this movie succeeds where others fail.I, Robot is well worth the price of a ticket. Will Smith and his female co-star do an excellent job of acting with blue-screen characters and deserve recognition for this. It ain't easy! Give the man a break. He couldn't have performed any better.All in all, the most enjoyable and entertaining mainstream movie entertainment of Summer 2004.</fullReview>

What's more, it followed Isaac Asimov's approach to robot stories. I expect this to become a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robots get owned by moronic, yet cool detective.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a science fiction fan for a while now, and 'I, Robot' can in no way considered to be scientific fiction. At best, it is ridiculous, albeit slightly entertaining fiction. This movie has nothing to do with Asimov's series at all, except the three laws of robotics and the names of some characters. It makes a mockery of all that the series stood for. In the series, Asimov tried to depict the robots as 'nice guys' who always did what was best for human beings. In this movie, the exact opposite direction is taken, and the robots become killing machines. I for one believe that this is definitely not something that Asimov would have approved of, and this is the main flaw of the film. There are several other flaws as well, one of the major ones being the casting. Bridget Moynahan as Susan Calvin? Does not work. Susan Calvin is supposed to be the best (only?) robopsychologist in the world, and is not given to emotions. Ms. Moynahan is hardly convincing in her portrayal. Will Smith plays the lead as a robot-hating, no-nonsense ass kicking detective, not unlike the robots, and all attempts at credibility are left in his wake. The one difference between the man who saves mankind (read Mr. Smith) and the robots is the fact that Mr. Smith has a dark sense of humor, and comes up with some stupid one-liners that would be more at home in a movie like Big Trouble in Little China, and cause the audience to laugh at him, instead of with him. Also, it is great to be brain washed with advertisements in the movie, ('Vintage 2004'), so that we know which of the big brand names in our lives will still be around and still be cool in 2035. The effects could have been the saving grace of the movie, but it is too far gone to be saved. The explosions and Will Smith whooping some serious metal ass is all very well, but it is out of place, and at the very least an insult to any true science fiction fan. The only way to derive any satisfaction from this movie is to leave your brains at home, which is difficult to do. In summary, a pathetic excuse for science fiction, and a travesty of Asimov's series.</fullReview>

But this movie, wow, I was totally magnetize by Will Smith, he's so hot! There's one scene at the beginning of the movie of him in a shower, it was ... my God, so sexy!And of course, there's another cute little boy (not little actually, grown a lot, but still very cute.)-- Shia LaBeouf, I have a problem in pronouncing his name. Anyway, he's very young and talented. He directed a short film and won an award. And he's also casted in Constantine, really a genius.The plot is simple. Though the last "find the bad guy finally" scene is a bit odd, still, a good movie. With the stunning animation and acting, I call it a "one of the top movie of the year".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had potential, but seems to miss the point of Asimov's laws and misses the mark as a solid film.Rather than really dig into the issue of the laws of Robotics, the film takes some very lazy Hollywood steps. It prefers to remain uncomplicated, explosive and very "by the mill".It's a typical summer blockbuster, however when they throw the name of Asimov into the promotions, you expect something a little more cerebral from the film.Will Smith is at home here. Wise cracking action hero of thunderingly dull proportions. While his back story is potentially interesting, it's handling is staggeringly predictable and follows every Hollywood cliché. So by the book are the comments and flashbacks throughout the movie, the end revelation to his past fails to live up to expectation.Some great and not so great effects. I applaud the robot design, however it feels too ambitious for even this films budget and sometimes it looks very unrefined.While the main robot is interesting, his involvement is shoved far into the background in favour of Will Smith's character will they/won't they with the second lead.So in the end, if you aren't interesting in science fiction concepts, you like a no brainer, you feel that watching Will Smith leaping off a motorcycle guns a blazin' isn't even slightly stupid or out of place... this might be the movie for you.This attempts to be a thriller but in the end gives up after 30 minutes and decides to opt for what the studio really wanted - a "by the numbers" whizz, bang, pop affair of messy proportions.What makes the whole thing worse is the final 3 minutes is actually rather good.. it's just the bit between the first thirty minutes and the last three which really bored me to death.Watch "I, Robot" with at least several cans of beer and you'll probably just relax and let the movie take you. Failing the beer, a half completed crossword should get you through the Hollywood clichés and to the fairly decent bits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to begin ?I didn't wanted to watch it. I expected to be a bit disappointed like with all movies where any kind of computer science or just science is omnipresent. A friend told me it was better than Spiderman 2, which was not as bad as expected. So I ruined 114 minutes of my life.This movie just does not makes sense. If you are unable to shut your brain off, you will not be able to watch it.First of all, this is a big advertising for crappy shoes and low-fi hardware. I was so disgusted by the lame repeated intrusion of advertising in the "movie" I've sweared I will never buy any noticed products from those companies, ever.Second, the story is just ... cliché and stupid, all the way. Stupid and cliché characters. Stupid and cliché situations.You can guess what will happen in the next half hour (or more) of the movie from the 10th minute to the 84th minute. (If you can't, may I suggest you should not drink 12 beers before watching a movie ? Even if I realise that in this particular case, to be drunk is recommended to endure the whole crap) Al you have to do is to think : how a stupid 12 years old child (with an emphasis on "stupid") would write the story ? Well, you got it.Jeff Vintar ("Long Hello and Short Goodbye", "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within", "I Robot") is now on my "avoid at all cost" list.I swear, it is almost as bad as Queen of the Damned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Science Fiction Film Since The Matrix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith usually stars in good films (Men In Black, Wild Wild West) but I,Robot is terrible. The first reason why this movie is bad is because there are too many computer generated characters and not enough real people in the movie. 90% of this film's characters are cheap-looking computer generated robots. Also, the acting is not very good. Will Smith isn't funny at all and his dialogue is horrible. Lastly, the story is often confusing, lame, tiresome, unoriginal, dull and stupid. Still, the story is better than the ones featured in the Matrix films, but not by much. Do not waste your money on this movie. Instead, rent a Will Smith movie that you've already seen in the past and enjoy it again. Rating: 5/10</fullReview>

The script for this flick could well be produced by some robot indeed: flimsy, unimaginative and without any surprise. The human touch would have to be the plot holes I guess. Why does Hollywood keep making these horrendous pseudo-intelligent sci-fi movies ? Well I know the answer: money. Apparently hordes of people still swallow this type of crap. I am not even gonna try to summarize the story, its obvious. Seeing the title is knowing the script. The blatant in-your-face commercials are ridiculous. I don't mind some subtle product display in a flick, but this is really pushing it. (I am referring to the Converse Allstars detective Spooner wears). Don't pay a penny for this film, see it only on TV or as an internet download. It just doesn't deserve more credit. (3/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CGI Goes on Rampage, Viewing Public Loses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To paraphrase a famous jurist, I may not be able to define "too much CGI," but I know it when I see it. And this movie has too much CGI.When "Jurassic Park" was released, it defined a new level in CGI. The dinosaurs were of high quality and moved in an appropriate manner. But then every producer got on the CGI bandwagon and we soon had movies like "Spiderman," where the CGI is quite obvious. "The Hulk" was probably the lowest point for CGI as the main character was rendered in a manner only slightly superior to Saturday morning cartoons.In addition, directors and producers completely abandoned the laws of physics, permitting characters to make completely unrealistic actions with regards to momentum, inertia, and kinetic energy. (In "Jurassic Park," great care was taken that the creatures moved in a manner and at a speed commensurate with their physical size and mass.)Sad to say, "I, Robot" is the most extreme example of this trend that I've ever watched. The CGI effects are shoved right in your face. They are distractingly cartoonish, with little effort made to render surfaces and motion in a realistic manner. Human characters take falls that are simply impossible to recover from, while taking corners at g-forces that would pop your eyes right out of your sockets.When CGI becomes THIS intrusive and unrealistic, the move shares the same fate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, Robot is not a very good film. It's actually quite bad. The plot is almost non-existent, basically it's just Will Smith warning people that the robots are up to no good, but nobody believes him. Instead of caring about the story, you have time to think about all the things that are bad:Smith's character detective Spooner (that name is just too stupid) lacks sympathetic features. I cannot quite put my finger on it, but something about him made him seem like an a**hole. And he wears a real ugly hat. Smith's mix of playing tough guy and trying to be funny just doesn't cut it, it gets weird. The characters are completely uninteresting, except for the robot Sonny who seems more alive than everyone else put together. The blatant product placement, or rather full out ads (Smith's shoes and car gets more screen time than the supporting cast). The action scenes feel mostly over-ambitious - sometimes less is more.The film's only redeeming feature is the excellent effects work on the robots. They blend in perfectly with the surroundings and you don't think of them as distracting CGI. On the whole, though, a disappointment. [2/10]</fullReview>

The whole film centers round an excuse to put Will Smith among fights and crashes. He hams it up as if his career depended on it and the (excellent) special effects are, sadly, the only thing to admire. SPOILER Its a shame that in the future there are no telephones, as the scientist could have used one to call Will Smith's character and tell him about the plot with the evil robots instead of having to invent his own 'bad' robot to murder him and trigger a ludicrously unconvincing investigation. Also, Will Smith's character hates robots for some, initially undisclosed, reason. When you find out what it is you realize the character is an idiot. Yet another waste of money, celluloid, electricity and opportunity. At least it keeps the CGI animators in work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Help the environment? recycle you're sci-fi films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the trailers it was easy to see that this film was going to be a basic robot revolt film that has been toyed with in both literature and films many times in the past. Though it is fair to say that Asimov was a strong sci-fi writer in his own right, this movie comes at an opportune moment in the cinema time-line; when it is guaranteed success. People would have wanted to see the Matrix robot revolt in live action, but we had to settle for an animated version of it all in the Animatrix.However, this film takes only a small element of the Matrix in this respect, but then smashes this together with all the other sci-fi-robot related films ever made. I am talking about a very long list of quite good films that have all been, basically, ripped-off;Short Circuit, Blade Runner, A.I, Bicentennial Man, Terminator, the list is (probably) endless.Of course, there is one saving grace for this film? Alex Proyas. Thankfully for everyone involved a great director was employed as the visionary for the production and it shows with many of his great shots and angles that he has used to great effect in previous efforts and does so again here to help keep the film from being too bland and too much of a blatant rehash of older films. Top marks to the man for his daring creativity that takes a computer generated character and makes it a key player with good effect, unlike the Jar Jar Binks disaster of Phantom Menace fame. Sonny is a good character that gives a good show in his own right ,but it must be said again, a recycled element ? HAL of 2001 a Space Odyssey, but with a body to run around in. Shame that not even the good visual elements of this film could been original either.However, it is good to see that CGI is finally making big leaps towards top quality and soon will make films better instead of being an over used thorn in our side.2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simple: What is it with so called sci-fi movies these days. How come they can't have the ambiance anymore like "Bladerunner", "Event Horizon" or "Alien" even the Matrix. Ambiance doesn't seem to be important anymore. Question, how do I mess up a nice concept en pretty good-looking movie. Right.. by having Will Smith in it. I'm sick of his bad acting and most irritating tough jokes at the wrong place. The movie had the potential to be a bit different in Hollywood, but no, jokes had to be added. I think Will Smith was about the worst choice they could ever make.The robots itself where pretty cool and in fact it was quite fascinating to see them amongst all the people. This was rather style-fully done. The fact that mankind needed to be partly erased to safe itself was pretty nice thought of, though i don't think the director came up with the idea himself. It's probably in one of the books of the original writer of the books.Like i said, a good concept, with nice looking images. It could've been a very nice movie, but Will Smith with his jokes (or they made him do it, i don't care) ruined the movie.</fullReview>

Will Smith did an amazing job even though there were some jokes which weren't laugh out loud types but it's actually a very serious meaningful film not some other silly trashy action movies that are plot less that you see these days. The script is very well made and the robots?....well what can I say, they are absolutely well made. Yup they may look like at first glance not very interesting but when the plot develops on the main robot Sonny you absolutely do feel for the robot and they begin to look very interesting. There is a quite lot of action which is pretty well made and yes there is a lot of CGI used but believe me...once you seen this movie you'll see how well the CGI is used and how it should be used in future films.If you like Will Smith, strong meaningful scripts, robots and action then this movie is worth your while.PS. there is a one very funny part by Will that made the whole audience laugh non stop for 5 minutes...I won't spoil it for you but it's the part where Will sneezes and says something very funny :)9.5/10 - GO SEE IT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw Denzil Washington being evasive as to why he turned down the lead role, I now know why. This script STUNK! It was so cliché ridden, implausible and self contradictory. It really felt like the team of shaved monkeys who cranked out the script didn't even bother to go 2 levels deep into the `Microsoft movie script wizard'? Talk about formula. At times it was difficult to tell the differences between the robots and the humans as everything was in auto pilot. Summary of movie: `Only hero sees robots as bad' `Rest of world sees robots as good' `Hero convinces rest of world. Fabulous chase scene and big fight ensues.' `End of movie'In between the big complex plot above are:cliché gentle granny who cooks good food and tempers hot headed hero. Hero who saves kitty cat from certain destruction by evil gi-normous demolition robot. (Soon as you see the cat is there really any doubt it will be saved? Oh Puh-lease! So why bother) Young street punk who is taken under wing by hero and is told not to ?cuss' by hero and who says to oppressive robots during robot confrontation, `we have civil our liberties.' (Oh yeah, that's what I would expect to hear at a street gang fight) cops now drive luxury Audis, but everyone else still sort of poor. So society must be so different as citizens will no longer complain about taxes being too high and feel it appropriate that police drive in awesome luxury. `Get me police backup' now automatically means 30 cops with machine guns, full riot gear and helicopters and giant `net gun' evil cardboard CEO complete with no lips.

		<shortDescription>The first half is a bore, with awful dialogue, and a predictable climax.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People with low expectations will be satisfied, but those who were eagerly anticipating Proyas' return to the genre may find themselves crestfallen. Murky plot clarifications, cop-movie conventions, and awkward comic relief intervals are ultimately to blame for this misfire. It's very shallow. It was just another action sci-fi movie trying to cash in on the summer. Actors Will Smith and Briget Mohnahan were not a great combination either. Will Smith tries to be the multimillion dollar action star while Briget Mohnahan was clearly not a star at all. They're awful combination and took away the movie's direction, which should have been more focused on action or the plot. The lack of substance was the real let down however.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know that you're in trouble when only two people in the whole theatre are laughing at the jokes. I, Robot is the latest Hollywood action movie. Though I loved Will Smith in MIB, ID4 and even Enemy of the State, his acting in this movie was less than memorable. Or maybe is was just the really, really bad dialog. Except for Will's movie grandmother everyone else was forgettable at best. The plot was more than poor it was juvenile and having Will be angry because a robot saved him instead of someone else was silly, especially when we find out that he has benefited from robotics.Most of all I hated the ending. Human pride took over, so Will gets to save everyone inspite of the fact that we know that Sonny could have done it just as well. No imagination whatsoever on the part of the writers. A better ending would have been for Sonny to have saved them both. I liked the Terminator robots take over the world movies better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and myself have just seen "I Robot" and really enjoyed it.Who cares that it was only inspired by the immortal short story. It was certainly far better than "Independence Day" and the dirth of other indifferent sci-fi movies that have come out over the years. The premise is very solid and the re-concept has substance.While the movie had violence, it wasn't gratuitous and there was no gratuitous sex to boot. You have a solid premise, some excellent visual effects (and we are not people impressed with CGI), some excellent twists and nice acting.I Robot doesn't use an "Independence Day" appeal for human patriotism to mask poor acting and execution. It doesn't manipulate your emotions like "AI". And unlike AI, it doesn't have a conclusion designed to make you feel stupid if you admit to its disconnected ending.I won't begin to give you the plot. It would reduce your enjoyment. All I'll say is that to appreciate this movie, you must love sci-fi, have an understanding of human nature and appreciate graphics that work.7 out of 10 for a movie, but I gave it an 8 because there are so few decent sci-fi's around and it's a genre that we love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens when you start investigating the possibility of docile, domesticated robots turning aggressive? Someone turns them on you!......As Will Smith discovers in I, Robot.It's a pretty good Sci-fi romp. If you imagine a cross between Bad Boys (without Martin Lawrence) Blade Runner and the fifth element that's pretty much what you're getting. Please note that the example used is basically 2 parts = Stupid action movie, to 1 part = intelligent Sci-fi movie. So don't go expecting any Stephen Hawkins style scientific revelations... no... none.DO, on the other hand, expect to see Will Smith unraveling a conspiracy to use robots for no good and blowing a fair few of said robots away with his rather conventional, "Nine". (Handgun, for those not familiar with the term) I liked this film. I stayed awake during it, (quite an achievement seeing as I watched it on a press screening at 9am in the morning) I admired the special effects, enjoyed the action elements and ignored the flaws and the ripped-off bits. (Slow-mo bike dismount in air. Falling a great distance to land on single knee, crushing pavement... MATRIX...HELLO!)It's Will Smith, It's futuristic, It's Sci-fi, It's special effects, it's cheesy in places but c'mon, you know what to expect! You know what you like!...Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Robot book comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I RobotWhen the book "I Robot", by Isaac Asimov ,was brought to the silver screen in the movie "I Robot", directed by Alex Progas, I was disappointed. When it was transformed into a movie it became an action packed story about detective Spooner. The detective saves the world from becoming enslaved by robots. The book Asimov wrote was an accurate look at what role robots will play in the future. "I Robot" ,the book, was a collection of nine short stories. The stories are being told to a reporter by Dr. Susan Calivin, a robot psychologist. During a story called "Reason" a robot questions his existence on a solar space station. He locks Michel Donovan and Gregory Powell away and starts a group of robots who worship "The Master". Asimov was looking at a creation of man so complex that it became able to wonder were it came from. In the story, "Runaround" a robot named Speedy is sent to get some selenium from a pool on planet Mercury. Speedy malfunctions on his mission and continually circles the pool of selenium. The malfunction is due to a slight change in laws of the robots mind. The laws of robotics are: 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. Law 3 on Speedy was modified so he could better protect himself because Speedy was worth more than a battle ship. Eventually the two humans on the base, Mike Donovan and Gregory Powell, ride older robots out on the planet and get Speedy back. They almost die during there rescue. In "Runaround" Asimov was describing dependency humans will have on there technology in the future. This is his most accurate story of the future. In today's world we have become extremely dependent on our technology. With out our advances in technology there is no way our earth would be able to sustain the vast number of people living on it. Mass food and water production is all run by computers today. Asimov also had some inaccurate thoughts of what the future of robots might entail. Asimov's robots were created by robot engineers but whenever there was a problem with one it would be taken to a robot psychologist. Asimov gave the appearance that no one was quite sure how the brains worked.In the future robots will not cost as much as a battle ship, as Asimov said in "Runaround". Robots will be cheap and affordable within a few years of their release. Ted Hoff, under Intel, invented the microprocessor in 1970. The first personal computer to make a splash on the market was from IBM. The first IBM PC ran on a 4.77 MHz Intel 8088 microprocessor, with 16 kilobytes of memory, expandable to 256k. The price started at $1,565, nearly $4,000 today. This computer has less memory and power than my calculator, a complete joke by today's standards. The November 2006 "Popular Science" has a laptop computer, made by XO, which cost $130. It could be produced and sold so cheap because it cuts energy use with a new LCD and runs on Linux's free software. I found Alex Progas' movie of "I Robot" to be terrible compared to the book. There were very few similarities of the book and the movie. The main characters had the same names and the laws of the robots were identical. Dr. Susan Calvin was made into a Hollywood doctor. She was young and attractive but the only thing that made her seem smart was when she unnecessarily used extensive vocabulary. The Film was polluted with advertisement particularly for Converse. All the acting throughout the movie was terrible. The one thing "I Robot" did have was impressive action scenes and special effects. In both the book and the movie the robots and humans have a problem of control. Asimov depicts this in his last chapter "The Evitable Conflict" where mistakes are only made when companies don't follow what the robots tells them. To solve this problem the co-ordinator suggests making every one give up there civil rights and obey the machines to prevent further economical problems. Alex proposes that the robots will take over when Vicky, a robot, takes control of the company and tries to protect people from them self by taking away their freedom. The book and movie do tie a similar idea together. People may one day become taken over by there own creations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lousy boring and oversimplified sci-fi flick with a lot of non-sense visual effects and Will Smith over-acting as usual. There's nothing left here of Asimov's invention and creativity: no Daneel Olivaw and no Elijah Baley. What we get is not even a visual clear idea of the future, but just usual tech stuff we see even on TV. Is this REALLY the director of "Dark City" and "The Crow"? It looks like a complete different director. In his two previous movies at least we got a lot of visual ideas and an a certain atmosphere. Here he leaves Smith do his "I-am-the-smart-funny-guy" things without control and covers the rest of the movies of CGIs. A last note for the screenplay: Akiva Goldsman is the man that killed Batman and wrote "Lost In Space". Sometimes in the middle of the night I wonder how could he write "A beautiful mind"... Mysteries of the unknown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget the title. Those of you who recognize its relevance would be severely disappointed to see few elements of Isaac Asimov's stories in this movie, and those of you who don't recognize the relevance will find a plethora of other problems to kvetch about.The year is 2035, and robots are everywhere. They're intelligent, sentient beings, kind of, and can perform quite an array of tasks. They've become so commonplace that their morality are never in question, thanks to the Three Rules of Robots, which prevent a robot from causing harm to humans.Not everyone's drinking the robot kool-aid, though. Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who hates robots with a passion, is assigned to a case in which a preeminent robotics scientist (James Cromwell) appeared to have jumped through a window many, many stories up, splattering himself all over the lobby of his office building. Grimacing and muttering all the while, Spooner sets out to investigate what seems like a suicide. But our intrepid hero - as well as 99.9999% of the viewing audience - thinks something else is afoot.(Which reminds me. In movies such as this, look at what the lead character does and says when we first meet him. Rarely are lines said for the sake of natural feel; they all Mean Something to the plot, however small.) The beauty of megabad movies is that they offer so much fodder for humor. For example, nearly every character is a caricature, from the tough-love police lieutenant (Chi McBride, typecast) to the cute-intellectual female scientist to Spooner's wise and doting grandmother. The makers of this crap could have just used cardboard cutouts with the stereotype written on them in permanent marker.As Spooner unearths more evidence and more people become convinced he's losing his mind, the audience is relegated to counting the clichés and the cereal-box writing. I swear, if I hear Smith say, "Oh HELL no!" in one more movie, I'm gonna upchuck my Milk Duds. His wisecracks are neither wise nor cracky. At one point, his lieutenant kicks him off the force, asking him for his badge. And just his badge - he's allowed to keep his gun. Good thing, because he needed it for the rest of the movie, as it turned out.The plot is nonsensical if one looks at it too closely. Guy dies. Cop blames a robot. Everyone else blames guy and laughs at the cop, who has a history of violence against robots. Who's right? Who cares, anyway? It's all a soulless, turgid mountain gibberish. There's not an honest or original thought in the movie. You'll be several jumps ahead of the criminally stupid Spooner. In real life, Spooner would have been gutted by his fellow humans; he wouldn't be able to make a dopey analytical statement and then follow it with a high-larious side-splitting witticism without being drawn and quartered. Or so one would hope.The only saving grace is the effects. 2035 (not too far from now, kiddies!) looks like a pretty cool place to be, much more so than most futures look on the silver screen. There's no post apocalyptic nightmare. No marauding bands of hellions looking for water, or dry land, or both. Everything looks gee-whiz-bang; in the middle of them is Spooner as anachronism, complete with Converse sneakers, a stereo that works by remote and not verbal commands, and manual driving. You know, rather than letting those bad IL' robots drive.But see, this is old news. Go watch Demolition Man (1993). Instead of Bridget Moynahan in this one, you'd get Sandra Bullock. And instead of Will Smith, you'd get real action stars, like Sly Stallone and Wesley Snipes. And it's more fun, because it never takes itself too seriously. This movie does, even though it's far more style than substance. The underlying problem here is that director Alex Proyas and writers Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman chose to use 2004 sensibilities and behavior in a movie set in 2035.I, Robot is a bottomless pit of dung. There, I said it. This movie is like graffitti in the otherwise-respectable wall of Will Smith's career. But what I, Robot teaches us, boys and girls, is that Will Smith is not so much an actor as a Movie Star. He's resplendent in all of his Smithisms; all that's missing is a white guy to whom Smith can impart sage advice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bright side: I am only out $3 for a rental, and not $8 for a ticket.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just one question: Who do I need to talk to about *not* attempting any more atrocious film renditions of Asimov stories? Yes, the advancement of computer technology in relation to CG is a good thing-- but why does that give the film industry carte blanche to remove any semblance of plot, intelligence, storyline and pace? These things were present in the original works. Yes, I am aware of the catch-all safety net that 'based on' provides?but they seem to have no inhibitions in using Asimov's name on the movie posters. Also, why the need to place comedic actors in the lead roles? Are they afraid the simpleton masses are unable to fathom the human condition without having it spoon-fed with slapstick? Don't get me wrong, I rather like both Will Smith and Robin Williams-- but it is obvious in both this film and 'The Positronic Man' parody that they were cast to 'lighten up' the primary narration, and thus give a boost to ticket revenues. Harmless to those like me who are merely angered and insulted... but what about the younger generation who forgo the quaint concept of reading a book? They are forever tainted by this celluloid drivel. Asimov was brilliant, compassionate and insightful... whereas the film renditions are nothing more than Beethoven's 5th played with a kazoo. Best theory I have is that this eye-candy was intended as an anti-piracy measure to reduce illegal DVD circulation.In summation, this would have been a decent film had it not been so erroneously based on another's creativity-- much like another passion of mine, music, is ever-increasingly based in sampling and borrowed lyrics. To those Powers That Assume The Mantle Of Film-Making: either *create*, or faithfully render and honor another's creativity, and stop the insane drive to make a buck and/or take a bow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was terrible. The editing was complete crap and same with the script. There were some funny comedic reliefs in certain parts but not enough to save the movie. My friend fell asleep during it and I almost did too. Will Smith's character was good, but nothing great. There was an awkward scene of him in the shower in the beginning but not done well. Also, the gadgets that they have in the future were good however, the ward rope was not. Nothing futuristic about it. The computer rendering was good as well, but nothing too great on the special effects.Afterwards, the audience left the movie in complete awkward silence because of the thought of waisting 8.50 to watching it on opening night.I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Maybe see it during the day where one doesn't have to pay almost 10 dollars, but it is a waist of time. Wait for it to come out on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Robot is great.Free from pretentious Sci-Fi nonsense, this is a fresh, original idea with superb special effects, action and story- without those even being the best aspects. Welcome Will Smith: tough, muscular cop who is willing (in a clichéd fashion) to go against the system.It may be clichéd, but in such a way that it's a treat.He is on a murder case and he is determined to reveal that a (gasp!) robot (named Sunny) is guilty. But no-one will believe him. Because Robots have no brains, and are not programmed to commit crimes. But little did they know that a special breed was being reconstructed in frequent quantities...If you ever read any negativity towards this film, blank it out of your mind. It might not be genuinely excellent, but it's style, charisma and huge likability send this directly towards a perfect ten.Summary: 5 out of 5 (*****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, ROBOT is a vastly entertaining if not stripped to the bones version of the classic Asimov novel. Mr. Proyas is indeed an authentic auteur, with a creative eye and attention to detail that are the hallmarks of a master artist. Who can be sure if he has offered his magnum opus yet, but I certainly hope he has not! As one person put it on the message boards for this film, "I, Robot is The Matrix". At its essential philosophical core, that is an accurate statement. The artificial intelligence supercomputer in THE MATRIX was a logic engine as was the version in this film. The point of artificial intelligence is to enable the computer to learn on its own - just like a human baby, in a sense. The computer achieves this learning by applying a difference engine. If you are not with me so far, I suggest you check out some philosophy pages on google. It is not entirely impossible to imagine a supercomputer wanting to take over the world, simply because a difference engine showed it would be more efficient.I, ROBOT expertly modulates between ideas, action, and one really sexy shirtless scene between Smith and Moynahan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Start Rant*How can someone take the works of a great Master like Isaac Asimov and so totally miss the point? This movie might be a great action film if you do not care at all about Asimov's principles and basic Robot Laws, which unfortunately are quite deliberately paraded in front of the audience in the initial moments of the film. There are the totally formulaic chase scenes and inane stupidity of the main computer's limitations, which of course are required in a pabulum-feeding film that assumes the average viewer has an IQ lower than his shoe size. As far as Blockbusters go, I am sure it will do well, giving people a couple hours of mindless distraction that is all a Blockbuster is intended to do. But calling it "I, Robot"? Instilling such an unavoidable attachment to Asimov? These things were done for only one reason ... to get people who like Asimov's work to come see this film. And what a pity it is for us who do so, thinking that perhaps Hollywood might take a bit of the man's genius and put it on film.I suppose I should come to expect this from mainstream film, but I am ever the optimist, hoping that somewhere, someone will see the value of the written word and do something good with it on film. Too bad it was not the case this time.*End Rant*Rating: 7 if you have no idea who Asimov was or read any of his books, 1 otherwise</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After thinking about this movie I have started to realize how they have taken a series of short stories written by one of the greatest all time science fiction writers and butchered some aspects of it. While there are many fascinating aspects of man's relationship with technology I can't help but think that this movie was only part inspiration and science fiction and more another in a long line of big budget Hollywood pictures that are filled with so many clichés and needless other film aspects that are not necessary to make this a good film, in fact these clichés and theatrical add-ons do nothing but hinder the film, and make what could have been an excellent film into a very silly film. Asimov would be very disappointed in what his series of short stories have become. The first problem with this film: Will Smith. Will Smith can be a very funny and entertaining comedic actor. But he has yet to seriously make the transition from comedic actor to actor that can be in a serious role such as this. Despite that I will admit there could have been a number of actors that could have been a lot worse in this part. The problem is I think that every lead part here requires a lot of depth and great acting, for this to be a truly excellent science fiction film, but Smith really was not able to provide the level of depth needed. Another problem with this movie is Bridget Moynahan. I admit she is cute but to ask her to be a real actress is like asking Mickey Mouse not to be a cartoon. She is not an actress, she is a nice firm body, with a lot of attributes, and in a movie that claims to be so serious and filled with philosophical questions about the fate of humanity she does not need to be in this film, she should be modeling, or in a movie that is not supposedly as thought provoking. The perfect movie for Bridget Moynahan's bad acting and obvious physical attribute would be anything with Freddie Prinze Jr. or Sarah Michelle Gellar, movie that are about as entertaining as watching grass grow, and yes Bridget Moynahan's acting is not quite as bad as watching grass grow, it is more like watching grass dying.But there are some positive aspects to this film, the first is you get a very eerie feeling watching in the middle of this movie, when you are not watching the bad acting, about the fate of humanity. This is a society that is hell bent on robots. Robots are everywhere in the future. They encompass every aspect of our lives, from our personal lives to our business lives. They are an integral part of everyday society in a way that in present day few can comprehend. When the movie talks about how robots are so integrated in society it really made me think, as well as a few people I was seeing this movie with. I told my friend in the theater 'this is freaky!' In this film they talked about computers shutting down libraries, about environmental degredation affecting society, and other global issues that affect us. The movie has a distinct tone of Asimov's time, as there is an implied trust in society that obviously does not exist in modern day America, as everyone does not think these robots pose any danger to anyone, and Will Smith's character is one of the outcasts, as he does not trust robots at all.. And it was, when this movie was a true science fiction film talking about technology and how it affects society this to me was Asimov's true vision of his work, not some silly Hollywood crap full of chiches and stupidity.But there are some bright spots in the cast. Bruce Greenwood plays Lawrence Robertson, the head of US Robot, the corporation that produces these robots.Chi McBride is excellent as John Burgin, Will Smiths boss who in understanding but always comprehensive of Will Smith's fear of robots. James Cromwell is also excellent as Dr. Alfred Lanning, the creator of these robots who is recently deceased, under mysterious circumstances, which is the centerpiece of the plot. Although this is a very fascinating film in many respects was unhappy with the finale. The finale was a typical slam-bang action thriller that might as well have been an alternative ending to The Matrix. This I think was nothing short of an insult to great science fiction, and aside from the bad acting is an insult to great science fiction work that is true science fiction instead of an excuse for an action film. To further add to the concept of a different time I get the feeling that Del Spooner, Will Smith's character is a comparison to McCarthyism, a reference to an earlier time as I mentioned before. In McCarthyism America was supposed to be scared of an enemy, and those that were not scared of this enemy were branded evil and part of the problem, which was in those days communism. Here paranoia is considered evil, and if you are paranoid of robots then you are branded an outcast in a McCarthy-like manner. This was one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, and one of the high-points of this film's writing style. The bottom line of this movie is that a good substantive film on the fate of man was sandwiched by a film full of Hollywood clichés. What could have been one of the best science fiction films of a generation has turned out to be a film with as many equally bad points as there are good points. This film is also entirely too reliant on computer effects. When I watch films like this, which are heavily computerized I am turned off by them, I do not feel as though I am watching anything, just something someone created from a computer. And I feel like if most of this movie, or at least large parts of it were created by computers I could create full length films on my computer. I know I can't, but perhaps the creation of films through computer is yet another question all of humanity will eventually will have to answer to??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It ain't Asimov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to skip any plot specifics. They don't matter. This movie has almost nothing to do with anything Isaac Asimov wrote. It nods in the direction of Asimov's famed three laws of robotics. I won't go into those because I'm sure they've been included in numerous other comments. Some of Asimov's characters are present in name. The laws and the characters are all that survive of his work in this film.When I first saw that a film called I, Robot based on Asimov was in production, I was almost giddy with excitement. I thought somebody had managed to get Harlan Ellison's script of it filmed. No such luck. I saw that it was going to be a kind of murder mystery, and I thought maybe they had adapted one of the Elijah Bayley/R. Daneel Olivaw novels. I have seen the movie, and they did not.Although the three laws are present in the film, they are ultimately discarded in their implications. In Asimov's works, any violation of the laws leads to a complete shut-down of the robot's positronic brain or at least the robotic equivalent of catatonia. The greatness in Asimov's work is how he weaves his plots around the practical application of the laws in unpredictable human situations. Asimov started writing the robot stories because he wanted to get away from what he called the `Frankenstein Syndrome' direction most such stories took at the time. That is, thinking machines turn on their masters. The first story he wrote on the subject involved a robot nanny that ends up saving a child's life after incessant paranoia has been rained on it by the child's mother. The whole point of Asimov's laws is that they are inviolable. The twist in his stories was that the machines always behaved exactly as they were supposed to, and the problems arose out of humans failing to appreciate subtleties inherent in how the laws work in real situations. Any robot harming (even by accident) or allowing a human to be harmed through inaction would cease to function. End of story. When this becomes inconvenient, one cannot ignore this for the sake of the plot one wants to have if one is going to be true to Asimov. The only reason I can think of for having Asimov's name on the credits is to draw in people who are fans of his work. That is also the only reason to keep the title of Asimov's book on this movie, because it has absolutely nothing to do with that collection of short stories entitled I, Robot. The Ellison script I mentioned earlier would have been vastly better.So in short, if the attraction of this movie for you is Will Smith and the action movie genre, you'll probably be OK. If you're going to this movie because you're an Asimov fan, don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever and fun but little more than a blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chicago, circa 2035: there are four humans to every robot, and Det. Spooner (Will Smith) has a strong dislike for them. Due to the "Three Laws" of Robotics, no robot can directly or indirectly harm a human being - but due to a past incident involving a robot, Spooner finds it hard to consider them totally harmless.After a robotics engineer (James Cromwell) leaps to his death from a skyscraper, Spooner is called in to investigate - and stumbles upon the frightening prospect that a robot may be the murder suspect.If you've seen the ads for this movie you know what is going to happen. It tries to deliver some surprises within its running time but the final "twist" is hardly shocking (at least not on the same level as a Verbal Kint-style surprise) and the movie is filled with many loud action sequences that place it in the blockbuster category.This isn't too bad. I really enjoyed the movie. It's not great, but it's certainly not bad at all and does what it should: entertain. I expected little from the film after viewing the appalling trailer, and was pleasantly surprised.However, I do feel that had the project been touched up by a better writer than Akiva Goldsman, and had a better cast (including director) been assembled, it might have been better in a deeper way. I do enjoy Proyas' direction but it seems a bit superficial at times and the marketing plugs and everything seem to combine, resulting in a schmaltzy overtone to the film that seems heavily reliant on Hollywood rather than brain power.Will Smith really needs to stop playing these tough guy roles, because he's not exceptional at them. He fits the part fairly well but Spooner is a bit too sarcastic and flippant to find totally likable - he treads a thin line and passes over it a few times, mainly because he doesn't really seem to have a purpose for being as obnoxious as he is. It reminds me of Eddie Murphy's Axl Foley from "Beverly Hills Cop" (and not because they're both black actors!) - he is a loudmouth tough guy clich??Â© who no one believes, etc. But Murphy was 10x better at playing this sort of thing because his character was actually a great deal more likable.Also, the movie is too heavy on its themes - its source material is strong and that's why I believe a more talented cast might have made a truly marvelous science-fiction film, but Alex Proyas merely tries to take the themes and insert them in a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster - not a pretty outcome. The whole racist overtones surrounding the movie are certainly prescient, but will suffocate many viewers looking for subtle viewing.I seem to be bashing the film, but I don't mean to. It's a lot of fun, delivered more than I ever expected. The CGI are some of the best I've ever seen (and I'm not a fan of computer animation), and overall it's just a really fun film and will entertain you throughout - as long as you're not expecting too much depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Back To The Future And Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines Had A Child.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the typical type of Will Smith movie you'd expect to see. At times it reminded me of about 4 different movies (at least). I thought all of the actors and actresses did a fine job and really have no complaints about the movie, whatsoever. It wasn't exactly the type of movie you had to sit down and think about, but just relax and enjoy the action. Will Smith played pretty much the same character he does in all of his movies, but believe it or not, I can see improvement in his acting skills.Bridget Moynahan's character was very similar to Sandra Bullock's in Demolition Man. She did an excellent job in her role.The beginning of the movie reminded me of the Back To The Future trilogy with the cool little gadgets, cars and of course, robots. It had a fun feel to it with seeing into the future and all, just without the time travel.The action sequences and most of the plot remind me of either Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines or Independence Day. This being because of the overwhelming amount of robots or machines similar to the machines in T3 or the aliens in Independence Day.The ending scene, without giving anything away, totally had me thinking of Planet Of The Apes. Watch it and you'll see what I mean.Overall, the movie is worth seeing. More importantly, it's worth seeing in theaters. I gave this movie 9 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A look at why we might not ever want a robot per every household ensues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to Isaac Asimov, the Three Laws of Robotics are:1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.Now you don't have to be a web designer/hilarious movie reviewer with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and an MBA to realize that some sort of interpretation of the old "rules were made to be broken" adage is gonna take place. And that, my friends, is the nut that the story's shell encases.My friends: Um, what?Oh, uh, sorry, I was just trying to sound cool. Anyway...If you're the type of person who likes to prejudge and make assumptions about movies based on trailers (unlike me, of course), then you may initially think this movie is just all silly action. But that's not the case. Oh, there's definitely some silly and unrealistic action. Whenever you have Will Smith SURFING AWAY FROM AN EXPLOSION ON A FRONT DOOR then you know there's some stuff you're just gonna have to take with two pinches of salt and a dash of sugar, but I, Robot does a good job of developing and revealing its story, all while mixing in the right amount of rump cheek-kicking.There is no denying that the special and visual effects are great, and they are the major selling point for this movie. The car scene in the tunnel is worth the price of admission, and the last 15 or 20 minutes really kick things into 1969 Camaro overdrive. If you've gotta go to the bathroom or get a refill on popcorn, then definitely do it before these last 20 minutes. But I found myself genuinely interested in the story. The movie manages to maintain a good amount of suspense and tension throughout, and it throws in a couple of twists just to keep things fresh. Are the robots as evil as they seem? Is Bruce Greenwood the bad guy he appears to be? Why exactly does Will Smith hate robots so much? Is Alfonso Ribeiro somewhere sucking his thumb and crying, wondering why Will won't return his phone calls?The acting is pretty solid throughout. In general, I like Will Smith. But if you've seen Wild, Wild West then you know he's not immune to starring in crap. Thankfully, that's not the case here. Will Smith pretty much plays Will Smith, so take that for what you think it's worth. He's basically a cop with an attitude who likes to wax sarcastic and be all rebellious and stuff. And he has some good back-and-forths with the ever-adorable Bridget Moynahan who, as Dr. Susan Calvin, is an expert on robot psyches and has great lips - much better than the over-sized bananas Angelina Jolie has plastered below her nose.Going into the movie, I had my reservations. After all, when I first saw the robots in the trailer, I thought they looked about as silly as Tom Cruise with his gray hair in "Collateral." But the robot special effects are actually well-done. I came away impressed. They look pretty realistic (more human than Al Gore, to be honest), especially in their mouth movements (George Lucas - take note). And Mrs. Shade made a good point - if you're putting a robot in every home, then you probably don't want it to look evil and menacing. The fight scenes between the robots are quite cool without looking too fake. This is a good sign that we may be moving away from CGI being too obvious.I don't know if I'll add this to my DVD collection, but I definitely want to at least rent the DVD one day, assuming that it's loaded with cool special features. Just one question, which encompasses one of my complaints about the movie, why do so many action movies insist on having a scene where the hero saves an animal in peril? I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY MORE CATS OR DOGS BEING SAVED IN THE NICK OF TIME! I don't want to see animals die or anything, but I'm just tired of pointless "I must risk my life to save this animal" scenes. It's a cheap ploy to get audiences to go "Awwwww." It works, but it makes me dry heave.Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a kind of treason to Assimov Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teen I was a fan of Asimov's book (and still every now and then re-read some of the stories), One of the fascination about this book is how the author plays with stories where the 3 main robotics law seems to be broken but really not, there is a reasonable explanation about it.So if someone is going to use Asimov's title or somehow make a reference to it is for me fair to somehow follow its guidelines, if not please avoid it.So an uninteresting story about breaking the law, with just robots instead of people, if you like science-fiction (this for me imply you do not consider STAR WAR a Science-Fiction movie) avoid it, if you want to see a nicely done film while your playing your guitar or so good for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that tries to incorporate the laws of robotics but fails on too many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on IMDb. I chose this film as I feel very strongly about it. This film had the potential to be a great film, even an Oscar winning film as the robotics stories by Isaac Asimov have the complexities and subtleties to enable to. However, it fails on several levels.The opening scene is just one long product placement advertisement. Multiple unsubtle annoying references to footwear, cars and goodness knows what else. It really adds nothing and takes a lot away. However, one of the main flaw to this film is the lead character, not actor. In an office of smart, professional looking police officers we have Will Smith, who appears as the least convincing police officer I have ever seen. Trainers, bean hat, long coat etc. He displays very few characteristics that would enable him to be an effective officer, excepting bravery, and it makes no sense to me that he would have any connection at all to the robotics scientist whose death he is asked to investigate. I just don't buy his character, it is at odds with everything else in the film. Will Smith acts decently, but it is a just a repeat role, 'black man with attitude who looks after the little guy' that I have seen before in other films where it makes sense and adds to the film. It does not here.The film proceeds as a murder investigation, and the interactions with the main robot are pleasant and even touching at times. The Susan Calvin character is decent although not faithful. Her inevitable romance with Will Smith's character is inevitable and unconvincing.In the long term of the film he is right to suspect the robots as being a danger to humans. Robots looking after humanity rather than the individual, known as the nth law, is an important theme is the robot stories. However, he saves the day not by understanding or prediction of the nth law of robotics, investigative skills or logic, but by paranoia and irrationality. He does not save the day by skill but luck, and this undermines the film constantly and ultimately ruins the film. The film has decent CGI, there are some nice Asimov references, the film is at times entertaining and I can understand why a lot of people enjoyed and wrote positive reviews. I am just hopeful that in 10 or 20 years time this film is remade with more subtle complexities and more faithful to Asimov's masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danger! Robots?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an Asimov fan, it has always been disappointing to see none of his books being converted into movies. The few movies that do exist are not good adaptations.'I, Robot' is a notable exception. The story sticks to Asimov's philosophy of portraying Robots-as-Pathos. Set in a futuristic society where a single organization has a monopoly on almost all robots, the protagonist, Del Spooner (played by Will Smith)is is one of the few remaining anti-robot police officers. He is assigned to the murder investigation of a top roboticist at US Robots. His primary suspect is a robot from a new line of robots that the organization is about to launch.Susan Calvin (robopsychologist at US Robots) believes otherwise. She is convinced that since a robot must follow the three laws of robotics the suspected robot cannot be the perpetrator. The action and drama in the chase scenes where Spooner and Calvin face an army of (non-violent) robots is a thrilling watch. The robots have a futuristic design and the cinematography is good as well.A must watch for Asimov fans and science fiction fans too. The movie has both- the action and advanced technology of a mainstream sci-fi flick as well as the exploration of the human-robot interactions and the psychology of both (which are always a highlight of Asimov's robot works).For a casual movie watcher, it can serve as a good introduction to this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not masterpiece material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I robot is a film that plays on the audiences future fears of a cybernetic revolution. The film also contains philosophical elements to it that question the viewer on whether it is better for robots to be emotional or logical. Both views are given from an unbiased point. Another thing about this movie is that it's not just a terminator remake, while terminator focuses more on action and plot. I robot is more of a make you think kind of film. I enjoyed the potential discussion that arises from this however, if you are simply looking for an action movie than Terminator is probably a better choice.While I like this film for first time watches or to watch 3 or 4 years later. This film is not the kind of film that will make you want to watch it many times over. Another flaw is on Sonny's development as a character. While Spooner and Calvin are developed well, Sonny only uses select emotions and only uses emotions in particular instances rather than throughout the film. This makes him too similar to other robots and doesn't distinguish him enough from the rest.Overall the film is pretty good, but keep in mind that it's not a masterpiece that will appeal to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been more than a popcorn flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 2035, robots are everywhere in people's lives. Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is not a fan of robots due to something that happened in the past. He's sent to investigate the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) the top robot scientist at U.S. Robotics. Spooner believes that a new NS-5 robot killed him, but the three laws of robotics make it impossible. Company scientist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) can't believe him until all heck breaks loose.This is a movie derived from Isaac Asimov ideas, but turned into little more than a popcorn summer flick. It's yet another Will Smith blockbuster but it could have been so much more. The three laws were never introduced properly. They were just listed like so many assembly instructions. This is a big disservice because it's integral to the twist ending. The action and the CG are fun and impressive. I just wish this was more than a simple mechanical thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exciting, yet insightful portrayal of the future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith gives a great performance in this semi-dystopian film, and the setting is made to feel like a plausible progression from the society we currently inhabit.Not only does the future technology look fantastic, but the movie also captures the era in which it was made. As most fans of movies set in the future know; practically all future epics are actually not about the future at all, but instead about the present. For the film to be good, it has to have an underlying message about the direction our society is going in, as well as attempting to explain the potential dangers of such a trajectory.The movie does this well with several visually exceptional action scenes, but perhaps the best example of this is the several instances where the movie talks of the ethics surrounding the creation of artificial intelligence. Could it be considered assault to damage a machine that has the emotions of a human? and who should be held accountable if a robot with advanced artificial intelligence harms a human in some way? the individual robot, or the manufacturer? Should destroying a robot with advanced artificial intelligence count as murder? Moreover, what kind of rights should artificial intelligence be afforded? After all, it can't exactly be "human" rights, can it.In this sense the film goes beyond what it could have done. It poses the ethical questions whilst exciting the younger viewers who's main interest is likely the cool robots, futuristic cars, and incredible special effects. Alex Proyas and the special effects department did a great job with this movie, and Marco Beltrami gives the picture a fitting and memorable soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The end of civilization is at hand, if this computer-generated special effects extravaganza is any indication.The plot is impossibly loopy, but it all boils down to an evil central robotic mind taking over control of the multitude of harmless robots in 2035 and turning them into authoritarians programmed to save human beings from themselves, kind of like Klaatu and Gort in "The Day The Earth Stood Still." The sinewy, metallic robots that were originally mindless machines, have become sentient and questions about "soul" are raised. Now there's a novel idea. A robot that starts to think for itself. I enjoyed it in "Colossus: The Forbin Project." I liked it even more in "2001: A Space Odyssey." The latter seems to have given HAL's voice to Sonny, the main robot in this movie.If the plot is practically impossible to follow, it doesn't really matter because the chief notion behind the production is to have robots that look something like the denuded Schwarzenegger in "Terminator" fight it out with vulnerable humans. It's one action set piece after another. These machines are all over the place, plotting, glowing with inner embers, their mask-like faces usually as mean as street thugs from an ordinary human action flick. There is dialog. And there are double crosses and mysteries and all that, but their function is identical to the dialog scenes in pornography. They just fill in the gaps between the parts everyone is waiting for.I could add that Will Smith is likable but his ears are outlandish. Some of the robots out-act the pretty but marmorial Bridget Moynihan. But why go on? The movie doesn't deserve more attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Usual Will Smith Summer Action Fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2004, the summer saw the obligatory release of its Will Smith blockbuster with I, ROBOT. Those familiar with the "source material" that have not seen the movie, don't be fooled. Aside from a few passing similarities (the use of the Three Laws and a few character names), there is no connection between this film and the stories of famed science fiction author Isaac Asimov. The general public (which included myself at the time of my first viewing) will have no idea that the movie shares little with Asimov's work, and that's fine because it really boils down to no more than you average CGI-infused summer boom-fest. The film is set in the near future of 2035, where civilization and technology have grown immensely. The people have come to rely on the assistance of robots for everything from general labor to basic household tasks. Detective Del Spooner (Smith) is on the scene following the death of tech giant U.S. Robotics' lead robot designer, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell). Spooner's investigation into Lanning's death, an apparent suicide after crashing through his lab window to the lobby stories below, leads to a rogue model NS-5 robot named Sonny who appears to be experiencing symptoms of full sentience: emotions, dreams, etc. Following a traumatizing event in his past, Spooner has no love for robots and he's quick to accuse the robot of murder. The hitch: Lanning programmed the robots to follow the famed Three Laws that prevent robots from ever harming a human. So a robot should be incapable of murder? right?The premise is pretty awesome, and if it had been handled differently it could have been an awesome science fiction thriller. Instead the filmmakers took the road most traveled and turned it into your average mind-numbing summer blockbuster. Disappointing, yes, but it doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I, ROBOT does have some pretty awesome sequences. The auto chase/robot swarm battle in the tunnel stands out as my personal favorite, but there are plenty of fun moments. It is a Will Smith movie, after all. There is plenty of action and one- liners to keep the audience interested, at least until the credits roll. My biggest complaint is that the movie as a whole is pretty generic. Director Alex Proyas and the screenwriters, whether it be from studio interference or their own negligence, failed to make anything special with such a promising concept for a sci-fi movie. It's your usual action fare that managed to rake in enough to cover its budget and a little extra before fading into the background. The plot is pretty simple and most people will see the big baddie reveal coming a mile away, especially if you've ever seen a sci-fi movie before. I, ROBOT is simple fun that most people will enjoy with minimal complaint. The product placement can be a little annoying, as it's shoved in your face pretty blatantly here. You'll know what I mean when Spooner busts out in the beginning of the movie with his "vintage" 2004 Converse (2004...the same year the movie was released?coincidence? I think not.)The cast is nothing special but they manage to get the job done. Will Smith is Will Smith as Will Smith. He's no different here than any other of phoned in roles from other movies (I'm looking at you INDEPENDENCE DAY?). If you enjoy a good Will Smith summer action flick, you'll be fine here. Bridget Moynahan is the fountain of exposition?I mean scientist?from U.S. Robotics that joins with Spooner reluctantly in his investigation. She's a bit of a joke. She acts as if she hasn't experienced human interaction in decades and she continues to disbelieve Spooner's "the robot killed him" theory against the constantly mounting evidence. She's just here to feed the audience information. James Cromwell is horribly underused as Dr. Lanning, or more specifically his hologram; and Bruce Greenwood is the required "evil businessman" and head of U.S.R. who falls under suspicion. Honestly, the strongest member of the cast is Alan Tudyk as Sonny. Tudyk provides the voice and motion capture for the rogue robot and gives him a good dose of humanity. Complimented with good CG, Sonny and the rest of the robots (as well as the rest of 2035 society) comes to life really well and continues to hold up to recent viewings. I, ROBOT is actually a fun little bit of summer action, just (and I hate to say this about a movie that tries desperately to piggyback off of Isaac Asimov) remember to leave your brain at the door and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4th rule: My review is useful (dvd)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't judge this adaptation as I never read a single book of Asimov. But, first of all, it was great to see Science Fiction on a big screen because it's indeed a great but hard genre. Its basic rule to deal with ideas is respected here because this movie makes think about the robots. I think the modern, bright and chromatic design and cast are excellent: the duo of Will, Mr Cool and Bridget, Miss Cold, works perfectly. Unfortunately, the story is a bit complicated and a lot of the social effects of robots are left over. Worse, the future world is too close to our daily lives and by comparison, the funny and eccentric vision of "Back to the future Part II" is more interesting. The ending is really reminiscent of "Ronin", the comic book of Frank Miller. But finally, after watching it, I want to look at Asimov's writings. Thus this movie is successful in that sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You, Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year 2035, the citizens of Chicago are on track for meeting technological tragedies predicted by pop duo Denny Zager and Rick Evans, among others. Everyone who's anyone has a personal robot. Not to worry, our mechanical friends follow robot rules; they are programmed to be helpful only, follow orders, and would never harm a human being. One person in this scenario is "robo-phobic" - perfectly proportioned policeman Will Smith (as Del "Spoon" Spooner). Mr. Smith does not trust society's robot helpers...Smith is suspicious when his robot designer pal (huh?) James Cromwell (as Alfred Lansing) is found splattered on the sidewalk outside of his skyscraper office. The incident is reported to be a suicide, but Smith suspects one of Mr. Cromwell's personal robots, blue-eyed Alan Tudyk (as Sonny), is responsible. Smith goes against robotics psychiatrist Bridget Moynahan (as Susan Calvin), corporate robot provider Bruce Greenwood (as Lawrence Robertson), and police chief Chi McBride (as John Bergin), among others...Smith is pumped to perfection, spits blood, and possesses incredible super-strength. Ironically, there is no sex in "I, Robot" with Smith only mentioning he wouldn't bed Mr. Greenwood for all the money in the world. A hat is tipped to Harold Lloyd, apparently resurgent in popularity, and cussing streetwise Shia LaBeouf (as Farber) tips his hat to the younger generation...Science fiction robot writers Otto Binder and Isaac Asimov, the later acknowledged herein, effectively used the subtexts prejudice and fear of technology in their thought-provoking stories. Both themes are present in this update; arguably and unfortunately, they are perversely celebrated. Also note the traumatic event from super-human Smith's past does not support his instincts at all; rather, it supports the robot acts without emotion. While lacking gray matter, this is a well-produced and entertaining production.******* I, Robot (7/15/04) Alex Proyas ~ Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, Bruce Greenwood, Alan Tudyk</fullReview>

I, Robot is one of them.The direction is tops, the effects are excellent, a good story and all the actors impressive. Will Smith's tough charisma is his main draw and he doesn't let you down. He acts as a delightfully nasty cop :) Bridget Moynahan is very expressive and also has a hot, athletic figure. Also, it was nice to see Shia LaBeouf in a small role(before Transformers made him big) but he cracks the audience up with his silly acts.Of course, the best aspect of I, Robot is its visual effects. I admire the team behind it. How did they manage to make the robots so expressive? Amazing! Sonny the robot is simply endearing to watch.Where I felt the movie fell short were the action sequences, especially at the climax. They were good but the viewers expected better.Verdict: A very good science-fiction movie. I am satisfied :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After re watching this for the first time in many of years, i came to realise how corny Will smith's character " Spooner " is ( yes, i was relevantly young during first viewing). At times i cringed at some of the lines he came out with. It not Smith himself, but the dialogue. However, with it fabulous CGI and decent story which is cemented within the three laws, I Robot is another good Hollywood blockbuster.The story never dives in deep with the three laws, there just used to give focus to the story of Sonny, a robot which is " Unique". Spooner, a detective, is possibly the only human being on Earth he despises these robots and when he believes that One of them is responsible for the death of the Creator, everyone around is certain that he has lost the plot. This being the fundamental of the plot, it fairly obvious where the main protagonist will take us.The CGI is spectacular and worth the initial viewing. Smith's character in the second half becomes less of a walking parody and the set pieces are fantastic. With enough action and jaw dropping effects, this film is worthy off a viewing from those wanting action with a story to cling on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Stars Is About Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith stars as the clichéd cop-with-attitude, and it's particularly an attitude towards robots, in this otherwise fairly formulaic who-done-it.Set somewhen 'in the future' where technology has advanced in a curiously ad-hoc way. Robots are apparently commonplace. Strangely; they are all of the same type. The kind of variety we might associate with - say - vehicles has not apparently been realised in the world of robotics. There, the i-Pod clone appears to rule.Some robots are good. Some are bad. One is uniquely smart, like Johnny-5 from 'Short Circuit'. When their inventor dies in a fall through a window, this prodigy becomes Will Smith's prime suspect. Though things are naturally more complicated, and the conspiracy runs deeper.At a technical level, a lot of money has been spent. Music and especially sound track are competent. All other issues such as lighting and editing are on the money. The whole thing is just a wee bit too formulaic for its own good. But special effects vary. The CGI is often so naff that the spell of believability is almost broken. The robots in particular lack substance. Sometimes its almost like watching two movies simultaneously, one with humans in it and another cartoonish equivalent featuring the CGI cybernetics. Which, of course, is exactly how it was put together. It takes a REAL machine to look REAL - as in 'Short Circuit'; but clearly the hundreds of robots featured here could not possibly have been individually constructed within a viable budget. It's just a pity that at least one two were not; that would have greatly enhanced plausibility.Finally; Will (lobes) Smith was the least suitable lead. He himself has the face of a cartoon creature, and what with those preposterous ears of his it is almost impossible to take him seriously. He may not be a comic, but he's certainly comical. A more serious actor would have raised the movie's threshold considerably. Perhaps Denzel Washington...This work is a Hollywood fantasy take on Asimov's academic fiction. It's worth a watch, but just don't expect any serious evaluation about life and personal identity; there was more of that even in T2. And don't look too closely at the CGI/human interface. Finally; try not to laugh at Will Smith's Mickey-Mouse ears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's where you got the cash to see this idiocy in the theater, right? I didn't pay for I, Robot; I saw it for free, clipped and snipped to fit into two hours, and thank God for small favors. The less I, Robot, the better.Wow, what they can do with CGI! Special effects wizards can fill the big or little screen with dazzling images (in this case, beautifully emoting machines and a bright, cheery, sun-washed Chicago of the future), but I, Robot can be summed up in three phrases: 1. Will Smith's torso 2. Very little story 3. Not a damned thing in sight to make this story memorable I wasn't even frustrated by the movie; I expected eye-candy and I got it.Which brings to mind Stanley Kubrick's film of Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, a story of the continuing evolution of man, past the human body and its confines. Remember when Mission Control informs Dave Bowman that there was nothing wrong with the communications unit that HAL-9000 said had failed? The camera holds on the red eye of HAL for what seems like five seconds, then cuts back to Keir Dullea, masking his appalled horror that the most important piece of equipment on the Discovery has failed. HAL, in that five seconds, proves that he is a thinking, sentient being by deciding to kill the crew, right then and there.It is a dazzlingly human moment, when a machine decides it must kill to survive. And Kubrick reinforces this evolution of HAL to human by showing you the similarity between HAL's "eye" and those of the mission commander. Blank, masked, and deadly.2001 was based on a great piece of literature. So was Isacc Asimov's I, Robot, but you would never know it from the later. I, Robot is as close to perfection in pop CGI junk. Twenty years from now, people will still be talking about Kubrick's masterpiece.And you'll be able on to catch the quaint I, Robot on the late, late show on your ether-vision projection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 3 Laws of Smithsonics:1. Annoy the viewers with phony grins and dumb jokes 2. If you're not playing a comedy, be only slightly less annoying 3. If they miscast you in an SF movie, show your muscles as much as possibleProyas's "Dark City" was terrific, but I was reluctant to go anywhere near this movie due to Will Smith's amateurish presence. But if "Dark City" could get away with having that entirely talentless charisma-less Kiefer Sutherland, then certainly "I, Robot" could withstand a mediocre Smith. Smith's acting range isn't much better than Schwarzenegger's, but at least this kind of miscasting cannot even begin to compare with him playing Ali (what were they thinking??). The movie offers a good, logical story, with twists that are surprising but not idiotic, and some great visuals, especially in the second half. I was fearful of Smith's annoying gags and one-liners, and, yes, there were several to squirm/cringe to, but fortunately the other afore-mentioned positive factors make up for it. I just wish they'd make more true SF, i.e. the kind in which the main character is not a cop.There was one scene in particular in which Will Smith exposes his lack of acting ability: the scene in which he relates the story of the drowned girl. The (tragic/sad) faces he makes here are... well... tough to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A typical summer blockbuster that tries to be something more but ultimately fails. The visuals are fantastic, even if the robots look a little too fake, the futuristic world that is created is awe-inspiring. Will Smith gives another likable performance in a blockbuster, and he's supported here by a pretty good cast, but the story never really takes risks and the style doesn't fit the overall themes well. For a popcorn flick, it's attempting to take on pretty heavy themes of the nature of humanity and such, and it just doesn't work. A darker, more subtle style would have worked better. Still, it's a decent blockbuster, and there's not really anything wrong with it, but it seems like the potential was there for something better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite sci-fi film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is a spiffing job. It should have won 3 Oscars - not just got nominated for one. Visually - the film is stunning. The world of 2035 it depicts doesn't feel quite real, but it is beautifully brought to the screen on an epic scale. The CGI is great as well - thousands of robots are created convincingly and make for truly brilliant villains. The film is also a troubling depiction of a futuristic world - this could all happen in the not-so-distant future. As Del Spooner said in his own words: "Laws are made to be broken." And even robots with these laws hard-wired into them can break the so-called "perfect" rules. Every single character in this film has a true purpose in the story - none of them are left out from their introduction to the brilliant finale. The villain is the person you'd least expect it to be... (***SUBTLE SPOILER*** Perhaps not quite a person...) But saying all this about I, Robot being a stunning cinematic experience, it actually has a half-decent storyline as well. And the characters are enjoyable. Will Smith plays Del Spooner with accident-prone tendencies and very un-subtle humour - proving that the film doesn't have a 3D world with 1D characters. And the film is gripping and shocking as well - helped with a rather tense musical score that only adds to the anxiety. I think I, Robot should be up there with Star Wars and that lot. It isn't exactly down there with bilge like Ultraviolet, but this is essentially a perfect film. The Matrix lacked the humour and Aeon Flux lacked the intelligence. For bringing these two things together, I, Robot should really be one of the highest-rated sci-fi films on the IMDb. The theatrical run and DVD release were two successful things for I, Robot, but really, there is so much to offer with this film. Humour, action, futuristic settings, character, plot, substance, intelligence - the list goes on... 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. Will Smith (while not 100% perfect for the part) performed very well, the script was pretty tight with only a couple of 'misses' as far as humor attempts were concerned, the graphics were gorgeous, the action was very well filmed, and the story kept me interested. I'd give I Robot a nine, but the last three minutes were a pretty big let down. It's like the writer suddenly went retarded and gave every character something stupid/cheesy to say. Put that with the sappy music and characters looking out over a dawning city, and you get a letdown of an ending. Rent it before you buy it. I bought it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its in the line of matrix!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie gives out answers to questions raised when one see "THE MATRIX". I Robot deals with the starting of Matrix, it gives an insight on how the first murder was done by a robot &amp; what exactly went wrong. Though many may think that this insight is not true or just an over view but in many lines "I- Robot" does touches the line of Matrix. Story revolves around Detective Spooner(Smith) &amp; his haterd for the machines because of a personal grudge.This hatred leads an opening or a revolution of a whole new scenario where the machines are about to take over the human world as they too have "evolved". Sunny(Tudyk)is the unusual suspect in eyes of the detective but later on becomes the key to solve the mystery behind the murder of the scientist who made the 3 Laws, which are in lines of safe guard of the robots &amp; humans. The movie picks up the basic plot form "Isaac Asimov" Story "robot" &amp; comes with an original version of the 3 laws. The story is tightly scripted with no rooms for any flowery romance or out of the blue love triangle. It starts with the ever surprising Smith having a bath in his bathroom(which automatically gets all the girls glued to the screen), pacing rapidly towards the core story &amp; giving out occasional one liners to make the movie universally entertaining.i would definitely put this movie on my top movie list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Proyas had a very impressive debut with his first film, The Crow, back in 1994. Instead of his career taking off, he took the death of the film's lead, Brandon Lee so hard that he would be slower to choose his productions than most directors, taking on two more productions in the interim, the barely noticed Garage Days and the grossly underrated Dark City. Something about these three films led Twentieth Century Fox to consider Mr. Proyas for their big budget endeavor, 2004's I, Robot.The film's plot is about a newly designed robot who is either guilty of murdering the man who created his top of the line brand of robot, the NS5, or there may be more to the murder than it appears. That's as far as the loyalty to the source material lies as the movie delves into action sequences and special effects to drive the story along. Not such a bad thing as Proyas seems to be playing in territory that he is not just familiar with, but aptly comfortable as the sequences are very entertaining, particularly a sequence where two semi trucks of NS5s pull up to Det. Spooner's (Will Smith) car and inevitable hell breaks loose.Will Smith, who is always an interesting actor to watch whenever given the proper material to work with (Ali, Six Degrees of Separation) is playing away in familiar territory as the wisecracking playful tough guy who seems to know more about the world he's in than the rest of the characters. However, Smith's character of Det. Spooner has a prejudice towards artificially intelligent robots, which gives him a discernment towards living in a society that seems to welcome letting robots take over for them. One would hope that in the future, society would be a bit more adept towards their way of life and not be so uniformly inclined to all believe the same thing about comfort.Now, this review will not examine the guilt or innocence of Sonny (an impressively scanned and captured Alan Tudyk), the robot accused of murdering the man who created him, but remain to examining the movie itself. Does this work as a summer film: yes. It's loud, exciting and boasts some of the best visual effects in computer captured imaging. However, does it work as a societal examination of letting machines and computers control our lives for us the way Assimov intended his novel to be? Not particularly. I, Robot doesn't take the time that it should in lingering in the society long enough to see the sociological effects of having a technology driven society. Such philosophies are sacrificed in favor of the summer film standards.Proyas' touches can be seen in a few scattered scenes and one can tell where he fought to have his visions kept around. Alex Proyas is a man of unique vision, as his films like The Crow and Dark City have showcased. Here, only glimpses of his vision can be seen, but the screenplay from Akiva Goldsman and apparent pressures from the studio (something that Proyas has stated left such a sour taste in his mouth that he may never do a big studio production again) are the biggest hindrances that hold I, Robot back from being more than just a piece of summer entertainment. In an ironic mirror, studios seem to be the NS5's to Proyas' society in that they seem to have integrated themselves so much that they are the direct result of a loss of individuality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot tells the story of a detective in the future who doesn't trust robotic technology at all. When a murder is committed, he believes a robot did the killing even though everyone tells him it's impossible. He goes on a hunt for the robot to find out the truth and winds up getting pulled into a mystery even he wasn't expecting. I, Robot is a good action movie, but it's purely for popcorn entertainment.The movie has some good messages about big businesses and technology, but all of that is washed away by the fact that the plot is mainly a guy with a futuristic gun shooting down robots. While this movie is really good to watch when nothing else is on or you want to get lost in a movie, it's not a movie that anyone should take seriously. It doesn't stick very close to the plot of Isaac Asimov's book, so fans of that might not like it. I high point is the special effects. The special effects are very good and the fight scenes are awesome.As for acting, it's all just okay. Will Smith was never that amazing to me. He's always the same guy. A smooth talker that makes witty jokes as he saves the world from ultimate destruction. Yes, he plays the part well, but let's see something different. Shia Lebouf is in here as the detective's younger friend, and though he doesn't have a lot of time on screen, his character is a little annoying.Overall, this movie is really good to watch, but it's not a masterpiece that deserves to be praised.7.5/10</fullReview>

Does anybody know if this movie was based on an old episode from 'The Outer Limits', from the late 1950's/early 1960's? Because there was an episode on that show called 'I, Robot' and it was about a scientist who builds a robot, he is then murdered, and the robot is blamed for his murder. The robot somehow has obtained human like qualities. the robot is caught and is going to be destroyed. But humans try to get a trial for the robot, One of whom is the niece of the scientist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Proyas has become one of the most interesting and intellectual movie directors working today. And he's young also. His first, "Crow", was quite simple romantic story. "Dark City" and "I, Robot" are very serious and deep, and on top of that, very entertaining.However Proyas' is not a very deep actor-director. His characters are straight from some comic books, kind of hollow and too simple. But that fits to the package, it doesn't disturb. It's his style. Someone else might do these stories in totally different style. But Proyas masters his own style perfectly.Surely this must be "Big Willie" Smith's best acting role. Not Proyas' best, but very good anyway. There are very interesting themes in the movie: How other people don't (want to) believe somebody who knows something (maybe "too much" of something), and tries to warn others. And in the end, when the truth comes out, the guy was of course right. And conspiracies... Not that this is the only movie handling these themes, but it's one of the best.</fullReview>

However, when I saw it, I was blown away. I thought it was amazing! I still think so today.I, Robot is different from other movies of the same genre. It is better for one thing. However, there are many things about I, Robot that make it better than other big budget action flicks. One thing about this movie is the story. I thought this movie's plot was from the work of a genius. It is just so original. I can't believe how someone couldn't have thought of something like this before now. It is just a great movie and everybody should see it.Another thing about I, Robot is the special effects. They are incredible! Sonny looked so real! It was an incredible experience to watch Sonny in action. It was just so exciting to watch.I, Robot is a film that will become a classic. It is an amazing film. Alex Proyas really knew what he was doing when he wanted to make this film. I am very glad he made it too.The verdict: A very well made film that will amaze you in more than one way.10/10</fullReview>

He totally makes this film what it is with the way he says his lines and the bits he adds in. This film is also my favourite film of all time (along with The Princess Bride) because it is fabulous. Will Smith plays a Chicago Detective in 2035 where robots take over our daily chores and it all seems too good to be true. The thing is, it was, and only one person saw it coming. When Det. Spooner (Will Smith) finds out the maker of these robots has committed suicide he begins to suspect something more... As I have already said this is definitely the film to see if you like Sci - Fi that is, well I wouldn't even class it as that anyway ! Thanks IMDb x x</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As long as you remember that, I think you'll be impressed.Because really, this movie is surprisingly well-done, and the Asimovian themes resonate even moreso today than they did when he first wrote his stories. It's more than another expensive, retina-burning sci-fi fireball; "I, Robot" is a commentary on everything from the impact of new technology to what the concepts we call "freedom" and "humanity" really mean.The CGI is definitely some of the best out there, and the performances are nailed perfectly. Moynahan manages to play Susan Calvin as coldly as the robots she programs without looking wooden, and she beautifully weaves the character's detached nature with the occasional seeps of emotion. One of his best performances ever, Will Smith delivers both humor and poignancy in his role as Del Spooner. The tough exterior isn't too scratchy, and he doesn't overdo the angst, either. But I think the best performance of all goes to Sonny, the loose-cannon robot and suspected villain for most of the film. Alan Tudyk delivers the voice of a lifelike, free-thinking machine with all the balance and poise of a master. A true gem if there ever was one.At the heart of this movie are two questions: 1) is there a difference between a human being, and a machine that imitates one in every observable manner?, and 2) what is the point at which our dependence on technology supersedes our freedom (and sanity)? As complex questions as they are, this movie is hardly pretentious in its answers. Then again, it's hard to be pretentious with Will Smith in the lead.Overall, beautifully done. A must-see for people who like their explosions big and their philosophies deep.</fullReview>

All the characters are just awesome, and the story is great as well, plus Will Smith is simply amazing in this!. All the characters are extremely likable, however what really got on my nerves is that nobody believed Smith that the robots were evil, even when the proof was there, they though it wasn't possible, however that aside, I had a marvelous time with this film, plus the action scenes are fantastic!. Smith and Bridget Moynahan had good chemistry together, and the car chase scenes were pretty good as well, plus Alan Tudyk is wonderful as the voice of Sunny!. It had some really cool plot twists as well, and this may be Smith's best performance in my opinion, plus The robots seriously gave me the creeps for some reason. It's also actually not that predictable, and Smith had some cool one liners as always, plus I though the ending was really neat as it impressed me a lot. This is an excellent summer blockbuster, that's hugely entertaining, with fantastic special effects, and an amazing performance from Will Smith, and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is very solid. Alex Proyas does a very solid job here, with incredible camera work, wicked angles, fantastic slow mo shots, great use of colors and locations, and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace. The Acting is lots of fun!. Will Smith is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is a major bad ass, had some great one liners, was likable, funny had good chemistry with Moynahan, did very good in his emotional scenes , and was just tons of fun to watch! (Smith Rules!!!!). Bridget Moynahan is cute and does fine with what she had to do, however she annoyed me in the 1st half, but really came around in the 2nd!. Alan Tudyk is fantastic as the voice of Sunny and gave me the chills. James Cromwell(Doc),Bruce Greenwood(Lawrence Robertson),Adrian Ricard(Granny),Chi McBride(Lt. Begin) all do what they have to do well. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr. Asimov would have enjoyed it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I walked into the theater fully expecting to hate I, Robot. I started reading Asimov in junior high school, and the thought of a movie "suggested" by his collection of short stories seemed almost a sacrilege. To prepare, I watched all the previews and the talk-show interviews on The Tonight Show, Ellen, and any other show that had Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan on as guests, I saw every clip available, and I had my mind made up that this movie was going to suck for anyone other than action-movie aficionados. Well, I was wrong. And my changed mind had absolutely nothing to do with seeing Will Smith naked. (Although that part was a nice bonus.) Before I saw the film, I was troubled by the thought of beautiful, young Bridget Moynahan playing Susan Calvin. I really believed the only person to play the eminent Dr. Calvin should be Anne Haney, the child welfare worker from Mrs. Doubtfire (which is another film on my short list of Movies Better than the Books). But Ms. Moynahan portrayed the rigid robopsychiatrist to a T. Still, in later years, Anne Haney will be the perfect actor to play an older Dr. Calvin.The movie was good. Really good. There was plenty of action, but better than that, a plausible back story for why Det. Del Spooner hated robots the way he did, fine acting all the way through, and an excellent storyline. In this instance, adding material didn't hurt a thing. Del's grandma was perfect. The special effects were incredible. The one-liners were pithy and rapier-sharp. I even liked the cat.The tiny details added a great deal to my enjoyment of the film. For instance, the spectacles that Dr. Alfred Lanning's holographic image wore. When you see this movie, and I hope you do, take a good look at them. Also, from the posted prices, items in 2035 are going to cost just about ten times what they do now. Now, there's something for me to look forward to when I am in my eighties! The special Audi deserves a review completely its own. What a car! I loved the Swiss exercise ball wheels. And it looks like parking garages are going to have marvelous improvements over their present-day counterparts.Yeah, there wasn't a whole lot of Dr. Asimov left intact, but it was okay. The skeleton was there. And although I hate to say it, the movie I, Robot was funnier than any Asimov book I have yet experienced. (He never did write great one-liners.) I think Isaac himself would have enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop comparing it to the book ......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a number of poor reviews for this film on IMDb. Obviously everyone is entitled to their opinion, but the majority are saying such phrases as 'Asimov will be turning in his grave.' OK, first things first, the only thing it uses which was Asimov's are the title (incidentally this was a book of short stories), and the three laws of Robotics. 1 Thou shalt not kill humans, 2 thou shalt save humans from peril, 3 thou shalt not harm themselves providing nothing conflicts with 1 and 2.Right, stop there - thats about all that has been lifted from Asimov. Now to the film. A rogue robot has been developed by a scientist that does not obey the first law and kills him.Enter Will Smith, action-man as always to save the day. Without giving too much away it does pose a very interesting philosophical question of whether or not mankind can survive without the help of his own creations. I'm not in a position to answer that, nor are any of you for about another 100 years.Well worth watching for the intrigue</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw I, Robot!!! A movie so nice I had to watch it twice!!! Okay, the movie takes place in the future where robots are used to do everything from delivering the mail to being personal assistants. They are programmed so that they cannot harm people (usually). Well, Will Smith played a cop, Spooner, who was suspicious of the robots. Early in the film, one of the original designers leaves Spooner a holographic message and this leads to his unraveling a murder mystery. Okay, enough with the story (great story and I loved the philosophy behind it!).On to the special effects! I must say that I have never, ever, seen computer generated graphics that looked so real, flawless, and natural as in this movie. The robots and their faces (they looked like lemurs, am I right?), the cars, the landscape, everything looked bloody brilliant!!!! It was flawless and I would not change a thing. Whoever made this movie should be so proud of their work because it was impeccable!! Will Smith has never been more gorgeous and he played the character perfectly. Ladies, there is one scene that is a definite must see for Will Smith fans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not very science-fictiony, but I did like the Naked Will Smith bit. A nice follow up to his work in Independence Day, one of the first science fiction movies where the black guy survived. Here, we have one of the first science fiction movies where we see naked male bodies, not naked female. But -- in both cases -- there just didn't seem to be any there there, story wise. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing especially moving. Just a competently packaged retelling of classic themes. With, again, a naked Will Smith. No bad there. It was fun, well acted, well shot, but hardly worthy of the Asimov shout out. There is a deep and disturbing story lurking in the I Robot tale, and they didn't get close to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK but too many of Asimov's stories blended together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say I was impressed by the CGI effects. I enjoyed the movie's plot somewhat but was disappointed in certain areas. The first area is the casting of Dr. Susan Calvin. Bridget Moynahan is a very talented actress i don't think she was right for this part. My reasons are that I have been an Isaac Asimove book fan for over 30 years. I have read all his robot short stories and novels(and all his foundation books as well). In the robot stories Susan Calvis is described as a very plain unattractive woman. Kind of like the lady next door neighbor who has never married. Ms. Moynahan is just too pretty to play this role. Will Smith is a composite of some of Asimov's other characters. The practical scientists from his robot stories. And the one real detective he created in the stories Elijah Bailey. Any real fan of Asimov I believe will be disappointed in this movie. But for the novice Asimov fan it is a good movie to learn of his three laws of robotics. And I hope a new generation of fans will discover his books. I believe they will enjoy them.</fullReview>

His sophisticated style really in my opinion pushed him to another level.He has earned his name as a sex symbol..Oh~! And the robots were hot too! :-) I really appreciated the way that my heart strings were tugged at while watching this film. The fact that it takes place in the year 2035 makes it a wonderful plot,the presence of the robots and how real they look, and how possible the premise seems to be, all contribute in making this film a very interesting one. Intelligent Technology...Is that really so far off? "The Gost In The Machine"...How possible is that?

I was just wondering was that just a default in the movie or were you guys doing it on purpose to see if anyone would catch it, because i saw the previews and that line caught my attention. So you could imagine the surprise i got when i saw the movie. I'm not down-rating the movie in any way, as a matter of fact i think you guys should change your rating scale because i give this movie a 20. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to comment on such a great movie. Chris p.s. will there be a part 2?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspend your critical faculties...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... and you'll enjoy this movie.But if, like me, you have enjoyed Asimov's work *and* you know something of the current developments in robotics (and you have some understanding of logic), then this movie is filled with a very large number of errors. It's not been well thought out, and that detracts from it.The key concepts are fine but the implementation of them is groan-inducing at times.For example, in an era when Lake Michigan has been turned into a landfill site, why would you - as a corporation - inefficiently and wastefully store huge numbers of working robots in containers (with only a handful of robots per container)? The resources alone would be worth a fortune, quite apart from whatever energy source is powering these things. No company would behave like that.Another example: the vehicles used to deliver robots are an enormous waste of space. The robots inside are not packed efficiently, and why would such a huge machine be used to deliver one robot at a time? The sensible thing is to have the new robot deliver itself, and having transferred specific details of the human owners' requirements to the new guy, the old robot would likewise return itself to the manufacturer. That's just common sense.Another example: the ubiquity of robots of different generations seems to result in (a) crowded streets with robots just hanging around doing nothing, and (b) the usual detritus associated with purely human existence (including badly painted and poorly finished surfaces). With all these robots going to waste, wouldn't someone have decided to set them to work tidying and decorating the place? The only time we see any machine tidying up is in a tunnel, and then they're purpose-specific.It doesn't take more than a moment's thought to determine that any society in which the machines take the place of humans in service-oriented positions will be one in which everything is tidy and spotless. Did housekeeping suddenly stop once the robots appeared?Not only that, but today "script kiddies" and others hijack computers en masse daily and use them for their own purposes. Yet in this story it is claimed there has never been an instance in which a robot has committed a crime - it's pretty obvious that the future holds the unfortunate promise of lots of hacking attempts on robots and some are bound to be successful. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that criminal and anti-social activity applied to computers is going to be applied to robots too, yet we never see any instances of this.The colors used in this movie are also pretty drab and uninteresting. Why do film-makers ALWAYS make the mistake of imagining a future in which there is no color except gray or hues of gunmetal? If you look at even poverty-stricken communities what's the one thing you notice most? How colorful they are. People go out of their way to try and inject some soul into their environment (unless of course the government of the day enforces drabness), and a society in which everything is so drab would instead be filled with color. There would be no reason NOT to be colorful. Color sells.The look of the robots too was something that should have had more attention paid to it. The one thing that current robot development has recognized is that the machines have to look human enough to be acceptable but not so off-human as to appear menacing or disconcerting. These machines either look and act "cute" (compare the old generation of robots, who are more endearing than the new generation) or look disturbing (which is something the marketing types would have hit on straight away. Or maybe marketing is declared illegal in the future?) Without giving anything away, at one point one of the players gets to make use of some nice spray-on artificial skin, yet none of the robots have this. Why? This movie could have been SO much better if attention had been paid to the details. And don't even get me started on the illogicality of describing logic as "undeniable".This is why I suggest that the movie will appeal ONLY if you suspend your critical faculties. Otherwise the constant errors are jarring and keep pulling you out of the story as you say out loud: "Huh? That doesn't make sense..." Other irritations include a few glaring product placements - I hate that in movies - and some clear design flaws (cars intended to only be used with a driver sat on the left - even current concept cars don't make that mistake), as well as no catering for the disabled (presumably they've all been forced to be made able-bodied in the future - bear in mind that there are disabled groups even now who refuse to have their disability "corrected").The story line is thin but interesting - but then, it's based on Asimov's work, and I've always found Asimov to be thought-provoking.The acting is good - Will Smith demonstrates once again that he's a natural performer in front of the camera and delivers a believable character to the viewer (although the description of his character as a "technophobe" is something of a joke, since he has so much technology at his fingertips. Someone didn't understand the meaning of technophobia). I can't recall a single wooden or unprofessional performance from anyone (although some of the extras were a little over the top).In recent years there have been a number of attempts to make what might be called the definitive robot story, but they all fall down on the details, and it's in the details that true credibility resides (as anyone who is trying to create an animation will tell you).While this is an enjoyable movie in other ways, I'm afraid I'm still waiting for the definitive "robot" story to be created...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>intelligent sci-fi film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the classic novel by Isaac Asimov, "I, Robot" is a tasty sci-fi elixir with a nifty whodunit twist.Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a Chicago homicide detective who has always harbored deep suspicions about the servile robots who are fast becoming common household items in the year 2035. One day, Spooner is called in to investigate the suicide of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the inventor largely responsible for the technology that has gone into the making of these robots. Almost immediately, Spooner begins to suspect that Lanning's death may not have been a suicide at all but rather a homicide perpetrated by the robots who, though programmed to do no harm to humans, may be evolving to the point where they are becoming sentient beings fully capable of overriding their programming and acting at will. As this brand new model of robot hits the streets, Spooner becomes something of a modern day Cassandra (or Chicken Little, if you prefer), attempting to convince his skeptical superiors that this seemingly benign army of anthropomorphic mechanisms may actually be a threat to human civilization as we know it.Like virtually all quality science fiction, "I, Robot" aims its sights at mankind's propensity for sowing the seeds of its own destruction, in this case by inventing technology that eventually outruns the ability of its creators to control it. And when it comes to artificial intelligence, in particular, how long, the film asks, will it be before the intelligence becomes real and the creator becomes subservient to that which he has created? "I, Robot" is a sleek, thought-provoking action film, filled with suspense, drama and mind-boggling plot twists. On a purely visual level, however, the film is a bit more problematic. Although the backdrops that work to create the image of a futuristic Chicago are eye-popping and dazzling, some of the computer-generated images, particularly in the action sequences, look a trifle too much like video games to be entirely convincing. Still, although the movement of the robots isn't as realistic as, perhaps, we would like it to be, the facial expressions are fantastically effective, creating a sense of personality and life behind a façade of cold, synthetic technology.I haven't read the story on which the film is based, so I have no way of knowing how faithful to Asimov's original vision the filmmakers have been. Be that as it may, for the non-initiates, "I, Robot" is a solid film that at least does justice to the genre as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable-enough movie, but the title suggests that it is related to Dr. Asimov's book of the same name. It's not.Susan Calvin is in the book, and the Three Laws are from Asimov's robot stories, but the plot is much closer to a short story called "With Folded Hands" (I don't remember the author) except that this movie has a happy ending. WFH does not.Smith's character seems loosely based on Lije Bailey, the protagonist from Asimov's Caves of Steel, which is a murder mystery about a dead robot scientist who may have been killed by a robot.If I knew nothing about the book I, Robot, I probably would have rated this movie higher, but the misleading title and the poor attempt to present this as Asimov's work make my rating of 6 a gift. Perhaps it reflects my love of science fiction more than the quality of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All lights and clockwork, no heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"All lights and clockwork, no heart" - this is the opinion technophobic cop Del Spooner has of robots.I would like to apply the same evaluation to the movie. "I, Robot" is a typical Hollywood summer blockbuster. Stunning visuals, state-of-the-art effects, a high-profile star shooting up baddies and spouting one-liners - all the bells and whistles are there - combined with a total absence of heart. They could have titled it "Van-Helsing II - 300 years later", and nobody would've raised an eyebrow.Most of the characters are so one-dimensional and cartoonish - The Rational Scientist, The Greedy CEO, The Kindly Grandma - that after a few minutes the astute moviegoer can finish their lines for them. Will Smith's Detective Spooner is only a tad more complex. Oh, who am I kidding, he's just as cardboard-cut as the rest, with Smith's usual charm being the character's only saving grace. The most human character of all is a Robot. Intentional irony by the filmmakers, perhaps? The plot (and I use the word very loosely) is haphazardly cooked from several Isaac Asimov's short stories. A brief summary, without dipping into spoiler-land: Spooner (Smith) suspects the robots are 'up to no good'. He starts investigating, and in the process generates work for 20 stunt men, 200 special effects people, and some 2000 extras. And after all he still has the nerve to complain that Robots are taking jobs away from people! Sheesh! I gave this movie 5/10, only for the visuals (which, I repeat, are truly amazing). I strongly suggest you watch it on DVD, with the volume muted, so you can pretend there is some deep plot and clever dialogue going on.If it's plot you seek, just get the Asimov book.</fullReview>

It's an extremely interesting movie that, apart from clearly illustrating how man cannot depend solely on machines, explores the definition of life. Sunny, an MS-5, had been programmed to have emotions. Why would anyone want a robot to have emotions? How can this robot be beneficial to society? Another interesting question that arises is does Sunny have a soul? Does he deserve to be treated with as much respect as any another human being? The movie does a great job of answering all these questions. The central theme of the movie is that machine can never replace man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Good Thrill Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While my taste runs to a more sophisticated type of film, there is no doubt that sometimes you just want to enjoy an old musical, adventure movie or spy thriller. This film surprised me because it's so doggone fun, yet brilliant in the quality of it's execution. I admit that it took me a while to see this film because I did not care for the type of character that Will Smith has been known to portray... the half-smile "doesn't take anything seriously" wise-cracking type of buffoon. But since he has matured in body and attitude, he has developed into a different sort and I thought he was perfect for this role. Yes, his language is sprinkled with profanity and ghetto language, but it was just the gritty sort of "real life" manner this otherwise sterile vision needed. Without it, the film might have been antiseptic and unbelievable in scope. After a few minutes of apprehension, I sat back and completely enjoyed this film. It's a romp, a lark, an adventure, and masterfully executed. If a person thinks this plot is predictable, and therefore unenjoyable, then I say "what about 'Singing in the Rain', '42nd Street', "Stagecoach' and a myriad of other films from our history that we consider to be classics?" In other words, not every film has to be "Citizen Kane" or "Gandhi" to be enjoyable, interesting and entertaining. Good heavens, even doctors, university professors and the heads of government can enjoy the rides at Disneyland! Give me a break. Will Smith has made some terribly weak films in the past... "Independence Day", "Wild Wild West" and "Made in America"... the type of roles which had his goofy grin saying "look at me, I'm so funny"... and his name in the credits for me was a warning that said "stay away"... but a good friend urged me to see this film, and I am glad I did. In it, he is superb, tender, strong and likable. The special effects are amazing, innovative and convincing, the robot art direction by Oana Bogdan is magnificent, and last but not least, the performance by Bridget Moynahan is marvelous and authentic. By the way, if you loved Issac Asimov's book, you might not be totally pleased, since most science fiction films taken from books, including this one, vary from the original. But not to worry, this film rocks. I highly recommend it as an engaging and thrilling ride.</fullReview>

The twist about Viki being behind everything really caught me off guard, though I had a feeling all along that Sonny had thrown the Doctor out of the window. It would be pretty neat to have a sequel to it, a movie that follows Sonny and what he does to help the robots. And I'd like to keep an eye on the detective and whats-her-name, too.

I, Robot was never a "book" or a "novel" that could be made into a movie. It was a huge number of short stories that dealt with having robots become a part of everyday life and evolve into something more than man meant them to be.This movie captured everything that Asimov put forth in his stories. I won't get into a long drawn out defense of my opinion. The ones that grew up reading the I,robot stories know what I'm talking about and the critics that didn't have no right to even try to compare it to them. If they want to critique the movie for itself, fine. But for them to reference Asimov's stories in their reviews just shows their ignorance and self importance.I, as a childhood reader of Asimov's sci-fi, was thrilled to see all of his stories brought together so well in a single movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** Spoilers!!!! **** The world created in I Robot is beautiful in terms of the work that went into creating the city skyline of Chicago and the CGI robots that inhabit it along with humans. As far as creating a feel for the story, I Robot is one of the better movies to do that, something which some sci fi movies never do.The plot is self explanatory, but it's worth some comments. I have to say that the movie was actually a good and it drew me in.... Until the last half hour or so. That is where my only problems with it begin.I think Smith and Moynahan made a good couple in terms of a movie like this. He being his usual Fresh Prince self but a bit mature, while she is the smarter an obviously higher breed of the two. I think they did have chemistry and it was interesting how their character's played off on each other. There was no romance between the two, however it would have been interesting though comical if it did happen. Though not likely, it would be good to see these two again together in a movie.The only real issue I have with I Robot was it's ending. Though it fit the story and I knew it was coming, the ending battle was just stupid and seemed to be put together quickly. When Smith and Moynahan are battling the robots on top of the USR tower, the movie became typical in terms of humans with guns vs machines.Had the ending been better, this would have been one of Will Smith's better movies. However, it's the ending that was given and there is nothing we can do about that. I would still watch it again, watching Will Smith be his usual self can be fun to watch sometimes. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, it's a big budget action film and all. It's not Gosford Park but then it's closer to that than other sci-fi treasures-become-film like Battlefield Earth.I don't think it's fair to review this movie without making note of the outrage expressed by the sci-fi fan base over the plot of this film. Apparently the film is pretty substantially different from the book. Having a beloved book taken from you and turned into a different movie is disappointing and usually a disaster.Now, to one who doesn't know the book: This is a good movie. It takes a number of ideas such as reliance on technology, racial prejudice, survivor's guilt and the nature of the soul and frames them in a high-tech big budget actioner. That's a good thing.There were a couple of scenes that I think show the problem of making this kind of movie in Hollywood. The big robots-jumping-on-the-Audi scene that made all the trailers and advertisements didn't need to be done so lavishly. It reminded me of the Death Star battle in Jedi where swarms of ships appear on screen at once. It was too much for me to appreciate visually. It may be though that without the combination of forces at work this wouldn't have been as good as it turned out to be. Not terrific. I'm not saying that, but it's a good film.Of note: Will Smith's acting in this is pretty damn good. His character's tend to be extensions of Fresh Prince. They're highly exuberant and cocky. This time, he's subdued and a bit more cynical. It's a nice change. Let's see... There's the presence of James Cromwell, which helps any film. And here's something: I noticed that many of the characters in the film are black. I appreciated seeing this since these characters are not by necessity black characters, they're just people and these are black. That kind of racial mix made sense to me and I feel it needs to be done a lot more often.Anyway, it's not dull, it's not silly and it's got something to say. I think you might give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captures a Story untold by Asimov Perfectly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read every book I could find of Asimov's as a young adult and did not bother to see 'I Robot' in the theaters because of the misguided criticisms by the reviewers. I should have known better but what can I say....The reviews were absolutely correct when they whined about the movie 'I Robot' not following the stories of the book by Asimov of the same title. What they neglected to tell was that it was a wonderful production that had the heart and spirit of Asimov's stories of robots. The movie takes place in a history that Asimov never wrote about but did refer to and used to explained those worlds he created where the humans were robot-phobic.Will Smith was at his best (and my was he gorgeous to look at). For once I was so caught up in both the story and the character of Sonny that I neglected to spend my time trying to distinguish between graphics and actual film. Sonny was so much my minds eye image of Asimov's character that I did not have that terrible teeth grinding moment where I'm internally screaming "NO, no, no.... wrong, wrong, wrong.My son who disdains science fiction and was only going to watch a few minutes stayed through the entire movie. I recommend this movie to both science fiction fans and non-science fiction fans. It has heart, action, philosophical interests and more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best Will Smith yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt the film was certainly Will's best film to date. He actually portrayed a serious character for once. The film's continuity was really good.The overall plot and theme of the film was excellent. I hope when these things really start to come up for real (buying smart robots), they will remember this movie.You know what's funny though? If you watch movies enough you can definitely figure out what is going on, what had happened and what is going to happen. But do not let this concern you. The film flows nicely. Another thing that's funny. As the film goes on one kind of feels sorry for those machines, especially Sonny.This is certainly one of the cooler futuristic films to date, I was very impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rage against the machines in "I, Robot"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Three Robot safe laws:1. A robot may not injure a human being?2. A robot must obey orders given it?3. A robot must protect its own existence?In "I, Robot," the latest sci-fi film that's an adaptation of stories written by a revered author to receive the Hollywood treatment in order to capitalize on post-9/11-era paranoia, you'll find a few shreds of genius and not much of anything resembling the works of Isaac Asimov.Asimov devised the "3 Laws Safe" paradox that I listed way back in the year 1940, and it doesn't take much deciphering to realize that law #3 is in obvious conflict with the first two: it states that a robot must protect its own life, but only if it's not in conflict with the first two laws, which states that a robot could harm a human being if it has to.The "3 Laws Safe" and their likenesses have been prevalent in science fiction ever since Asimov began writing the robot stories that he's most famous for today. I'm not going to waste my time with a useless book vs. movie comparison, but I'm only going to review the movie, which has its own merits but Asimov fans will be understandably sore.In Chicago 2035, Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) has a deep resentment of robots, which have been seamlessly integrated into American society and now are able to take on common, everyday tasks such as cleaning the house or providing companionship to humans. When a prominent robotics engineer and inventor, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), dies under heavily suspicious circumstances, Spooner is sent to investigate.His investigation leads him to the scientist's most prized invention, an "NS-5" model robot named "Sonny" (voiced by Alan Tudyk), whom of which Spooner is convinced committed a brutal murder and covered it up to make it look like a suicide. He aligns himself with another robotics engineer, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), and the two soon discover that a sinister element lurks amongst robot society that yields something in the way of total annihilation of human beings."I, Robot" was directed by Alex Proyas, the gifted filmmaker behind "The Crow" (1994) and "Dark City" (1998), the latter film which was centered on an individual who tried to make sense of the deceptive environment he was trapped in. Will Smith plays such paranoia to full effect and he ends up being accurate in his conspiracy charges.Can a robot commit a murder? That's the central question at the helm of this thriller, and the dead scientist (using hologram technology) clues Spooner in on the deceptiveness of the world around him. He even says that robots can naturally evolve and develop emotions and such; he calls it a "ghost in the machine" and this terminology may strike fans of the Anime' "Ghost in the Shell" as eerily familiar.Much can be said about the film's production values, which are superb, but I wonder if Proyas had a think-tank come up with this future Chicago, much like Steven Spielberg did when he made "Minority Report" two years ago?"I, Robot" is an action movie first and foremost, which was quick to cash in at the box office this summer. Smith's humor borders almost unnecessary at certain points, but it could be because of "I, Robot's" bleak and frightening premise. The robots themselves, once their plot is exposed, quickly become video game targets and are easily dispatched by the frightened humans who fight back in whatever ways that they can.Despite these elements, when there is no action and the story settles down a bit to play with paranoia, it's actually quite interesting to see the characters interact with one another, accuse one another of not understanding a fellow human being, and yet the robots (for the most part) are able to cooperate with each other and nearly doom mankind.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dramatic look into the world of robotics and a possible glimpse of futuristic society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the depiction of robots in action in "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow," I felt I needed to see "I, Robot" in order to be fair (hm, to science, robotics, fantasies). I really like this Alex Proyas (of "Dark City" 1997) endeavour of "I, Robot" and Will Smith is perfect in the role of detective Spooner, who has gained mutual respect from US Robotics' lead scientist Dr. Alfred Landing (James Cromwell portrays). Bridget Moynahan's underplayed Dr. Susan Calvin may come across almost robotic herself, but gradually, she's warming up to robot 'sonny' (the unique 'son' to Dr. Landing) and Spooner's repeated attempts to open her eyes to the 'truth' of things. "Sky Captain" is strictly comic book fare, comedic and fun thanks to Gwenyth Paltrow's versatile and generous not-afraid-to-poke-fun-at-herself delivery. It's an enjoyable romp and very stylish-looking illustrative movie adventure with Jude Law as the heroic Cap and sidekick whiz from Giovanni Ribisi, plus fleeting glimpses of Angelina Jolie in spiffy uniform and a bravado eye-patch. The robots come across as rather 'woodenly tame' threats."I, Robot" is more serious in theme and respectful in delivering Isaac Asimov's robot concepts. Yes, the film has all the makings of a techno suspense action thriller, with literally massive digital visuals of robots 'acting' en masse. Human touches were not neglected: there's Dr. Landing's sentiments, gentle caring and thoughtfulness felt even behind the façade of the hologram appearance; Sonny's budding emotions and a 'winking' friendliness; Spooner's history and reasons why he 'reacts' to fighting potential 'robot crimes'; Dr. Calvin's seemingly vulnerable side in spite of her high scientific quotient; and the minor fact that there's a flurry lovable cat included in the picture. The film is entertaining in its dramatic plot and turns, spectacular visual effects and also befitting casting. Bruce Greenwood's CEO character might keep one guessing if he's a villain or victim (he was the President in "Thirteen Days" 2000, and a calculating murderer in "Double Jeopardy" 1999.) The film might even raise the question if mankind and robots can live together harmoniously.A Web search on "Asimov" rendered a lot of online resources accessible for more in-depth information, and there's an interesting collection of Asimov's personal quotes from IMDb database. I appreciate director Chris Columbus' "Bicentennial Man" 1999, lively and well-portrayed lead character by Robin Williams, with Embeth Davidtz, and I posted comments on IMDb 2 Jan 2000."I, Robot" is a rewarding film for sci-fi fans for sure, and for fans of Will Smith and filmmaker Alex Proyas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant movie - true SF in a very good shape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the movie is very underrated here. Perhaps was just way too difficult to understand for some of people watching it. Comments like "make me feel asleep" are just dumb and show only the attitude to the movie of the people who write these things. This is the hard SF in a very good shape. Could be better - right, I'd prefer more complicated plots - but still's been one of the best true SF movies in a long, long time. Congratulations to the makers of this gem! Definite buy for my collection.BTW. Apart of a good CGI I'd give my recommendation for the soundtrack, too. I've never heard about the composer before (Marco Bletrami?) but now I'm going to dig in and look for his past works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank You Very Much Mr. Roboto.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strangely entertaining and highly interesting sci-fi action flick that goes above its premise due to wonderful cinematic technical effects, a clever little story and a top-flight turn by Will Smith. Smith is a cop in 2035 Chicago who is suspicious of a society where robots have become commonplace to help humans with mundane tasks. Soon the head honcho (James Cromwell) of a robotics corporation is found murdered and Smith knows that a creepily super-intelligent robot is likely to be the culprit. It is against the code of machines to commit crime and everyone else believes Smith has lost it mentally. Of course we all know that Smith is the only one who has a grasp on the situation, but could it be possible that nothing is quite as it seems? Bruce Greenwood is appropriately cold as the man who takes over Cromwell's company and Bridget Moynahan has her moments as one of the corporation's workers who gets torn between her common sense and Smith's thought-to-be skewered views. "I, Robot" is a visual feast as the production values are highly ambitious. Smith's car is also super cool. Sure there are problems here with the production, but overall I liked the film for what it wants to be. Legitimate entertainment. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie i burnt my Converse trainers, sold my Audi and trashed my JVC hi-fi. It was nearly a very good movie but as usual turned out to be the usual Hollywood bullshit. It's the usual story of commerce over art, the BigMac of the movies. I'm so sick of potentially good work being packaged into easily digestible portioned and force-fed to the 12A masses. Sure, the effects were impressive but where was the involvement? Will Smith is a competent actor but i never felt he was vulnerable or in any danger he couldn't have got out of. This film was mildly entertaining but added nothing new to the sci-fi genre. Where are the Blade Runners of today? They should have got Chris Cunningham to direct it on a shoestring budget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a Will Smith fan and a fan of this genre of flicks. I had been anticipating seeing "I, Robot" since I had first seen the previews. I figured this would be a "Planet of the Apes" type movie but with Robots. (I've got all the Planet of the Apes movies). Although Robot is entertaining I was somewhat disappointed. It was predictable to very predictable. I mean, you have figured out the "who done it" long before it's revealed. (At least myself and three of my friends who saw it did!) I often rate flicks on whether I would buy the DVD when it comes out our not. Robot is a big NO!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So okay its quite obviously a bit of a loose translation of Asimov's short stories to the big screen. That aside I,Robot is a killer movie in its own right. The writer included many themes and similar moments from the stories into the movie and sorta blended all of the stories together. The action in the climax of this movie is unbelievable with whirling camera angles and seamless cg/live action sequences which will have you holding your breath for what feels like a year. The voice acting for the hero Sunny is very moving and enjoyable and the cg for the robots is PERFECTLY realistic. Will Smith does a great job of playing the humorous/sexy/hard core action hero. He delivers his comedy with great timing and expression and the action with a heavy hand(you'll see what i mean;). Also I'm rather glad that the writer did not cheapen the experience by having hero kiss heroine in the end of the movie. It would have detracted from the movie to throw in a love story in the midst of an already great movie. All in all kickass; go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers. I am a big fan of Will Smith. So I am saddened with thismovie. Why don't these screen writers try writing somethingoriginal these days? Why spend millions on CG when they use thesame tired old formulaic plot twists? 1- The chief tries to keep cop from doing his job. 2- The chief takes cops badge. 3- The chief finds out too late cop knew what was going on.There was absolutely no spark between any of the characters,especially between spooner and calvin. The scene where hedescribes the little girl in the car, Calvin looks like somebodystepped on her toe to get some feeling out of her. Did anybodyreally care if any of the characters got hurt? I mean did anybodyhave any feelings other than when you play a video game? Thejokes were lame, the 4 spoons of suger in coffee didn't doanything for me, I don't know why Spooners stuck in the past withhis retro converses, the relationship between him and grandmalooked fake, I never felt any emotion towards the actors. Theyseemed to be in a hurry to get the thing behind them and pick uptheir paycheck.The dorky scenes in the tunnel, the tunnel is packed solid withcars until the scene where the robots jump on his car. The robotsmoved just like the CAD animations I played on my workstation 10years ago. It all looked cartoony especially the long shots.The movie just didn't flow. Its entertainment but it still should begreat entertainment. Sad.</fullReview>

Please don't listen to what other people said about the movie, because you will miss out on what is really a fun film.The acting was very good and the robots are done well, best of all was Sonny, who brings to life the conflict of what it means to be a sentient being. I, Robot may not be Blade Runner, but it does stand out as a thought provoking sci-fi film. One thing I liked about the movie is that it does not paint a picture of the future that is very much different from today, they still have cars and alarm clocks, but it is a future that may be very possible with the addition of advanced robotics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First there was Freddy vs. Jason, now Will Smith vs. The Terminator. What's next, Alien vs. Predator??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.In these Three Laws, written in the movie by the late Dr. Alfred Lanning but in real life by Isaac Asimov, we have the foundational structure of the rules by which robots must live amongst humans in Chicago in the year 2035. Massive advances have been made in programming, as robots have such a flawless performance record that the suggestion of malfunction is seen as a sign of paranoia or even insanity. Obviously none of the filmmakers or writers ever owned a PC. Every once in a while, a movie comes along that is, usually purposely, a compilation of many other movies. Leslie Nielsen style spoofs are the deliberate and purely comedic version, then you have movies like Shrek, which border on being spoofs (especially Shrek 2) but make much more respectful references, and then you have the bottom of the barrel drivel like the Scary Movies, which feed off of the success of other movies because of a total lack of creativity or talent on the part of the writers and directors. In I, Robot, some of the references are deliberate, many other, probably the majority of them all, are circumstantial.Sonny, the central robot, jumps out a window, striking a Neo pose while the camera reverts into Matrix-style slow motion. He talks almost exactly like the hypnotic HAL 9000 from Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. He is suspected of murder, slated for `decommission,' and ultimately walks the Green Mile. Dr. Lanning is able to make sporadic appearances post-mortem, exactly like Princess Leah did in Star Wars (although she was slightly less dead), such as he does late in the movie, where he explains to Detective Spooner (Will Smith, who doesn't seem to realize throughout the entire movie that he's no longer shooting Bad Boys II), that the Three Laws he has written for the robots can ultimately lead to only one logical conclusion ? The Rise of the Machines/Attack of the Clones. There are several references to `ghosts in the machine,' which I'm only about 20% sure are purposely meant to refer to the mediocre sci-fi movie of the same name, the brain of the entire company is straight out of Sphere, and comparisons of Sonny to Robin Williams's Andrew from Bicentennial Man and/or Haley Joel Osment's David from Artificial Intelligence are impossible to ignore. In an apparent suicide, Dr. Lanning, basically the brains behind a corporation called USR (which I'm pretty sure stands for either Cyberdine or Omni Consumer Products), that makes Microsoft look like Radio Shack, has fallen from the window of an office that was locked from the inside. It's not until we are taken into that office that we notice it's full of robots and robot parts. The immediate conclusion that it was suicide and not possibly a malfunctioning robot suggest not only the astronomical technological advances that have been made, but also the equally massive deterioration that has decimated the thought processes involved in law enforcement. Dead doctor, locked office, suicide. Case closed. The most tragic thing in the movie is that only one police officer took it upon himself to look a little deeper. One of the things that people seem to have focused on is the disturbing lack of implausibility in the futuristic society that is presented. Given our current preoccupation with computers and whatnot, it doesn't seem too far-fetched to suppose that there will be personal, robotic assistants available to the general public at some time in the future. What IS a little far-fetched, however, is the goal of Lawrence Robertson, the Bill Gates of the future, to have the ratio of robots to humans at 1:5.Permit me to digress for a moment?In the 1960s, three engineers in Illinois came up with what they called the Doomsday Equation. Based on the population growth at THAT TIME (since population grows exponentially, it is already growing much, much faster), they predicted that the human population would reach infinity by the year 2026. Specifically, November 13th of that year. A Friday. The scary thing is that this impossible population number is barely 20 years away, and we are leaps and bounds AHEAD of the schedule they predicted. The Doomsday Equation predicted 3.65 billion people would be on Earth by the year 1975, at which point we turned out to be at 3.97 billion, a number that the equation didn't suggest we would hit until 1980, but by 1980 we were already at 4.4 billion. In July of 1986 we hit 5 billion, which the equation didn't predict we would hit until 1989. Now fast forward to 2035 and add another 20% to THAT population, which should have passed `infinity' more than a decade earlier. Corporate greed is a scary, scary thing. Will Smith plays exactly the same character he's played in any movie where he ever starred in where he played a cop. He lives in a future where robots have displaced a staggering number of people from their jobs (and given the presumable size of the population, the unemployment rate must be astonishing), cars are stored rather than parked, Audi has bought out every other major car manufacturer (although Ford is still putting out an Aspire or two here and there), 2004 is vintage, and anything not voice-operated is just weird. Enter one misbehaving robot and one suspicious cop and you have yourself a movie. One car in the movie is impressively futuristic rather than the same old late 90s models with plastic ground effects added (see Back to the Future II), which I don't really understand. Really, all you need to see are the headlights to see that nothing's changed. Spooner's car, however, obviously provided for the movie by Audi (who just as obviously bankrolled the film), is very real and very impressive, inside and out. I'm not even entirely sure that the thing actually touched the ground while it was driving, but that still doesn't excuse the fact that turning the wheel sharply at high speeds will make the car spin like a top. I wonder what that little feature was meant for. The finale is somehow able to be an obvious ploy but still work pretty well as an action payoff. The brain had to have been suspended in mid-air for no other reason than to provide a setting in which characters and robots can fall for hundreds of feet, but it's such a well-crafted and well-filmed scene that it's still impressive, and the closing shot of the movie is one that will go down as a science fiction classic alongside the Statue of Liberty on the beach from Planet of the Apes. I, Robot is only loosely based on Asimov's source material, but it's a fast paced and entertaining film which should be given credit even if for no other reason than because it elevates the level of science fiction, one of the two most commonly botched genres in all of filmmaking (the other, obviously, being horror).And by the way, none of the Three Laws are violated by a human commanding a robot to destroy itself. Had Spooner thought of this it might have saved him a great deal of trouble.</fullReview>

The action scenes were incredible. The music was good. It was done by the same person who did the music for Scream. Will Smith was awesome and he had a good sense of humor.

		<fullReview>This story of this movie is not one of Isaac Asimov's, but the movie makes every effort to understand and present a lot of his ideas. I'm a big fan of Asimov's books and read all of his stories I could get my hands on when I was twelve. I liked (and still like) his writing style and how he lays things out. Still, apart from the action and graphics, I would not really understand or like the movie very much if I were twelve now - the movie is a lot more subtle than his stories. Still, it brings across a lot of the points he made, as well as some others (the world is not as simple as Asimov would have liked). There is a lot of attention to detail, but detail is not presented to bore or confuse the audience. There is enough explanation for someone who has not read Asimov's books, but the movie is not slow for someone who has. The casting is excellent; I particularly liked the strong and consistent role of steely Dr Calvin. The various scenes flow well together, and the graphics are excellent, but the movie doesn't rely on special effects. The action flows with the rest of the plot and although it is an action movie, the movie is more comprehensive than most and floats across genres in a smooth and pleasing manner. A great 2004 adaptation of Asimov's ideas and an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

Do not listen to what stupid film critics and "Asimov nerds" say. They either: A) Did not understand the movie. Or B) Complain that it wasn't one hundred percent faithful to the book and/or a different version than the screenplay Asimov and Harlan Ellison wrote which, for the record, would've been boring. The movie wasn't all action, either. I thought it had a great plot, with a few good plot twists. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to see a quality movie with a plot, action, and no romance subplot.

Great story, intelligent dialog, amazing special effects, and most importantly, deep and thoughtful, and true to Asimov's style and vision. A literal translation of the book to the screen would not be suitable as a feature film, because the book is a compilation of unrelated short stories. But Proyas and Vintar did a brilliant job in maintaining the charm and intelligence of Asimov, while at the same time creating their own story and turning it into an action-packed blockbuster. Will Smith is excellent, and Bridget Moynahan does a great job as Dr. Susan Calvin. And man, those robots are way cool! The choreography of the robot action scenes was simply fantastic. Science fiction the way it should be. Well done.</fullReview>

Sometimes, it's the differences between the book and the movie and often, the star of the movie alone will foster enough negative reaction as to dissuade viewers from even giving the film a chance. For this flick to garner as much negative reaction as it has, I believe this the case. This movie had so much to like. The mystery unfolded at a pace that kept me entertained from beginning to end. The action scenes were just right as far as frequency and intensity. Will Smith's comedic element kept the movie from being too dark (ala Dark City), while still not being a MIB-type comedy fest. Most of the effects were on a level as to easily make one forget they weren't real. There were new futuristic concepts that were done well and made sense, like parking a car for instance. Sonny, the lead robotic character, pulled many emotions from the audience due to his realistic portrayal. Was it perfect? Of course not. Plot holes, impossible physics, script anomalies, and other things that the movie's detractors have endlessly mentioned do exist. Did they subtract enough from an otherwise good film. Not in my opinion.All in all, this was a good, fun summer flick. Unlike any film I've seen for years, I plan to see this again in the theater. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suggest seeing this film, if you love action, special effects, good humor (based mostly on Will Smith) and have a basic curiosity towards the future, I really suggest seeing this film!The film through all it's crisp effects, and likable characters is still probable to unfair judgment based on the fact that if it's two things Hollywood has overdosed on it's: World War II, and Robots and Aliens trying to threaten our kind. The theme itself is similar to "Terminator" and the "Matrix" However, being negative on such a excellent movie as "I,Robot" is almost as depressing as liking a limousine hummer and someone else ruins it for you by saying it looks like a bus would fall into this category. What is so terribly wrong of this movie? The detailed special effects is more than what we asked for, the characters are actually likable: Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is funny, Sonny (the unique robot) seems more realistic and all the more likable, the movie is suspenseful, and fresh. In many ways this movie differs from all others (I would gladly trade "The Stepford" wives in terms of clever plots with any movie regarding robots for I,ROBOT) In the film I,ROBOT, the robots themselves are used for more realistic reasons (multi-purpose) than merely bodyguards and (or) assassins (such as Terminator) I believe man would actually use these robots to carry the mail than to carry a gun. I also appreciated the fact that the robots in the films actually look like robots, the questions asked by many robotic plot movies: Can the anatomy of a robot be sensitive enough to simulate emotion? Is a question that can be understood why one would wonder this question. The question comes as natural as asking if a Parrot knows the words he is saying when he says it. You can't blame this movie for other much older versions of this movie, if anything this film is a more modern philosophy of our future. The only thing I could complain about this film is that acting is a bit stiff, on Bridget Moynahan's part, but really, what else do you expect from a military robot scientist? They are supposed to be as stiff and as straight as the postures they carry. Other than that this movie is brilliant but it's like a quote the film says itself: "The most brilliant minds have the most persuasive demons." I highly suggest seeing this film for the idea at hand of the future what man doesn't want to see tomorrow today?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Summer movie with some genuine brain candy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is not a story-driven summer blockbuster, nor is it an action romp with Will Smith. The movie finds itself in the middle, straddling the line of good storytelling while still delivering some good action. Will Smith, as with his other movies, plays himself, but in this movie the "Smith persona" is subdued, and one can see the actual hints of acting ability that we've seen from him in movies like "Six Degrees of Separation". The supporting cast all fit into their categories well, there's the bombastic youngster, the skeptical police Lieutennant, the love interest that warms up to the hero, and the evil money-hungry businessman. The real strong point of the movie comes from the fact that it offers up a decent human drama akin to the original concept of "the toaster that thinks". All in all, the movie should be seen by all Smith fans, and those willing to turn off only PART of their brain for the sake of the summer movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 Laws Safe (!?)... (Oh? Really!??)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Dr. Susan Calvin turned to Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) and angrily said to him "You are the dumbest dumb person that I've ever met!", I couldn't have agreed with her more on that one point.I thought that Will Smith (who was paid $28 million to star in I, Robot) made for one of the lousiest examples of a supposedly proficient homicide detective that I've ever seen.With Del Spooner drinking on the job and insulting one &amp; all with his asinine one-liners, Will Smith's character (who even wore his precious, little flapper-girl cap to bed) seemed to be more concerned about keeping his badass black-boy persona intact than he did about solving the case of Dr. Lanning's mysterious death.And, Spooner's mother (!?)... Oh! My!... Her "Aunt Jemima" impersonation certainly sent the likes of that degrading black stereotype all the way back to the 1940s, for crying out loud! I thought that when Spooner finally revealed to us all why he hated robots so much it was such a pathetic and idiotic reason that I couldn't control my outburst of laughter (especially since Spooner, himself, was also part bionic).And, whenever Spooner called a robot "Canner" to its face (which he so often did), I viewed that sort of name-calling business as being equivalent to some white guy calling a black person a "coon", or the all-negative N-word. Yes. Its inference had that same derogatory tone to it.And, finally - With the present state of the "World Economy" as it is today, "I, Robot" had me seriously wondering how long it would be before the robots, themselves, would be out of work, bumming around on the streets and inhaling vast quantities of WD-40 for some cheap thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to Asimov's Vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to re-create this review because some brown-nose ran to daddy about one of my other reviews, and this one disappeared in the debacle.I have been reading Science Fiction and Asimov in particular since the 60's - And so I was excited that they were finally making Asimov's anthology "I, Robot" into film.But when I saw the first previews I thought they were just Hollywood-ising the book. I was against the idea of this Movie when I saw those reviews. I did not want to see it, because I thought, they were "ruining the story." But when it comes down to it, the stories in book form of "I, Robot" are simply not the best Robot stories Asimov wrote. Before he passed away, he introduced the idea of the Robot "Sonny" in one of his last Susan Calvin stories. The Robot was not named "Sonny" but it had Aspects that Sonny will show in this film.But most of the other aspects of this film, are in other Robot stories and books. There is a vast underground menagerie, which is shown in a small part in the film ? not in detail. This film references "The Caves of Steel" - The vast underground Robot factory (Although, I think the Caves of Steel may have been on Venus, I'll have to re-read that book).Del Spooner (Will Smith) is a cop, who is as biased against Robots as an Archie-Bunker type may have been biased against colour in the 50's and 60's. But Robots are safe, aren't they? At least U.S. Robotics says so, with Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics":1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2) A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.But Spooner just does not trust Robots. Does not "Like their Kind." But he has a secret, he does not like talking about: Why does Spooner never use is left arm? There is a reason for this, which is revealed in the story. Actually as the film progresses, we see him starting to use it, until we see what is actually going on.Susan Calvin is a "Robot Psychologist" - Or is she the Dumbest "Smart Person" Spooner has ever met? In this film she is depicted by Bridget Moynahan, at first as a professional "iceberg" - Or, as a "Human Robot" - She has very robotic qualities. Calvin works with Robots, Likes them, was raised by a Robot "Lenny" (LNE) in the book-So for her, they are safe.But one of the creators of U.S. Robotics, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), who knew Spooner, apparently kills himself by jumping from a high room in the U.S. Robotics building - Or Did he? We can't dismiss The Robot, "Sonny"-being in the room at the time. Why does this Robot read "Hansel and Gretel?"In a scene taken from an Illustration straight from Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, we see Sonny jump from the same window Lanning "fell" from - The imagery is exactly like a panel drawing from a story in that magazine.There are curt nods like this, to all of Asimov's Robot works all through this film.And so at first I was not pleased that this film did not exactly follow the stories in the Anthology "I, Robot" - But as I kept watching it, I started realsing, whoever wrote this screenplay filled it with little things from the line of Robot novels and stories-The "Robot Riots" ? those are there, in the film but not the same way as the book.I highly praise Alex Proyas for giving us this peek into the whole Mind of Asimov - And a true fan of his works will see the things I see. I am as purist as the next guy, but I have read harlan Ellison's 1990's screenplay for his vision of "I, Robot" - And he attempted to bridge all of the stories in the book with a framing story that tried to connect them all - It did not work very well, as much as I like the attempt.And at the end of Asimov's career as a writer, he was introducing ideas, like "Do Robots Dream" - There is a section of the movie where they have Lanning's voice from a recorded lecture, talking about things Robots will do, that defy any explanation other than that they are a new form of life. And also the idea that a the Robot Brain of Chicago - "V.I.K.I" - Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence" ? may pervert the Three Laws, making it necessary to create the 4th, or Zeroth Law of Robotics:0. A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.This is all in the film if you look. And most important, the Robot "Sonny" played well by Alan Tudyk of Firefly and Dollhouse, the robot who was made for a special purpose by Lanning himself - It never occurred to me that this could be the origins of "R. Daneel Olivaw" which is the Robot Detective in "The Naked Sun" and "The Caves of Steel."And so I have tried to talk about this film without giving away the whole story - If I have inadvertently done this, I will gladly mark "Spoilers"-The only spoiler I can really add, is that at the end of the film where Sonny is standing above the rest of the gathered Robots on the remains of Lake Michigan - This is another image straight from the annals of Asimov's writings. And as such, very powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to theater in 2004, I had very high expectation for this movie going to be good, and it did. Alex Proyas, before he did "Knowing", directs this high tech exhilarating thriller about the 3 Laws of Robotics.Ever since we have excellent action blockbusters of 2004 such as The Day After Tomorrow, The Bourne Supremacy, Collateral, Spider Man 2, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, etc. I, Robot is one of them.The film stars Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, Chi Mcbride, etc.It's the year 2035, and the community now has the help of robots. These robots have three laws integrated into their system. One, they cannot harm a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Two, they must do whatever they're told by a human being as long as such orders don't conflict with law one. Three, they have to defend themselves as long as such defense doesn't conflict with laws one or two. One day, the writer of the three laws, Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), apparently jumps out of the tenth-floor window of U.S. Robotics. The majority of the Chicago Police Department believe that he committed suicide, but Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who hates robots, thinks he was murdered, and the number one suspect is a Nestor Class-5 robot who calls himself Sonny. However, if it was Sonny, then that means he would've had to have broken the three laws. With the help of Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), Spooner must now discover the truth before it's too late. The acting of Will Smith in this movie is flawless. But I do believe that Bruce Greenwood is in so many films like The Core, Star Trek and so on.The movie is outstanding, an awesome summer blockbuster.I, Robot gets 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very engaging, rather intelligent film that simply has too much sugar with its medicine for most critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a cinematic world of greedy, uncaring Hollywood execs cranking out mindless blockbusters (and their unwavering entertainment-hungry disciples) VS. dour, thought and feeling-provoking small filmmakers (and their unwavering critic disciples), one film tries to bridge the gap? and succeeds. The story and script are a solid detective piece, providing plenty of clues, but not obvious enough to reveal too much. It's cleverly-written, with some very bright quips? maybe too much humor for those who think a film's drama and importance can be instantly ruined by humor's mere hint. I say to them go check out a Michael Bay picture and remind yourself what it REALLY means for humor to steal a story's weight, rather than support its realism and characterization. It's theme-work is thought-provoking, the allegories are well-interwoven, and though the story may be somewhat simple and straight-forward, its anything but predictable. The film itself adds another check to Proyas's list of strong sci-fi, creating a well-paced and engaging 115 minutes, with strong action sequences that are never pointless, and a physical prowess to the robots that paved the way for films like "I Am Legend" and "Avatar." Every performance in this film is solid to great. Smith and Moynahan have great chemistry, Chi McBride always delivers, and though Shia LaBeouf is a waste, he's only in about 3 scenes. But who really steals the show is Alan Tudyk as Sonny the robot. And not just his voice-work. His facial performance, his body-language, all of it truly brought this pixel display of an android to life, and really opened the door for the humanizing of the rest of the less humanoid-appearing robots, which was the theme that really rang true and makes this movie a stand-out.To conclude, I Robot is a well-crafted, well-paced film that isn't just a cut above the average sci-fi blockbuster, but a piece of film-making that proves a studio can still make such a film worth watching and remembering. Are there clichés? Yes, but they never truly detract from the film. Can it be classified as a lesser incarnation of some earlier, similar works? Maybe, but if I may cite a recent example of an epic sci-fi film that though it's twice as recycled, it's not catching half as much flack. And Alan Tudyk's Sonny reminds me that all the revolutionary mo-cap in the world means nothing without the performance to back it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood can't do Sci-Fi anymore..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Robot would have been much better served if presented as a TV or Cable Mini Series than a feature Movie. This Movie ends up trivializing what could have been very good Science Fiction. I really think Hollywood is incapable of making a "good" sci-fi movie anymore. Maybe it might be because they don't build coldwar arms in southern California like they used to? Maybe it is because of the success of the Star Trek franchise?There are good directors and writers out there but the Studio executives seem to have lost 100 IQ points. When great ideas can't be told because the studio bosses are incapable of understanding the story/genre it is impossible to play to a smart audience. FOX the studio that cranks out terrible Sci-Fi like the Firefly TV Series and Serenity movie, proves it has more money than brains. I, Robot has been turned into a typical Will Smith action movie. Using much of the same performance found in both MIB movies and Independence Day. Yawn. Sprinkle in action scenes stolen from the Matrix movies... Yet I find myself wondering if the movie would have been better with anybody else in the role? I mention Firefly and Serenity because this movie shares actor "Alan Tudyk" between them. Oh and both are clear examples of how out of touch Fox is. The robot/robots that Alan plays as a digital meat puppet is a stupid idea from the start. How hard is it to create a "practical" Robot for shooting? Instead the production relies on digital robot effects. They just look totally fake. All that production trouble for a gag that hurts everyone. Most of all the people watching. On a movie like this.. where humans and the lead robot character interact closely.. They should have used a physical prop/puppet. That way the actors would have delivered a better performance and a better movie would have resulted. Lessons easily learned from the TV series Farscape and "Jim Henson's Creature Shop".I hope that this is not the end of I, Robot and the other stories from the book. This is just a "Popcorn" example of a better movie or mini series to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I have watched and without redeeming characteristics...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I viewed this movie under the impression that it was going to portray the world in Asimov's book of the same title. Sadly, I soon found out, it was nothing like Asimov's clever creation. However, once I realized that it bore no resemblance (despite the 3 laws), I put Asimov's work out of my mind and hoped for a good cinematic experience.Before I continue, I'd like to mention that I have seen plenty of terrible movies. In fact, I enjoy watching old B &amp; C movies and revelling in their ridiculousness. This movie, however, didn't even bring the pleasure of something as awful like "Night of the Lepus." In my opinion, the low point of this movie was Will Smith's character. One expects the single dissenter in a society (and hero(ine)) of a movie such as this to have a valid, well-based reason for their distrust. Will Smith's character, though, dislikes and distrusts robots merely on instinct and with unfounded prejudice. Not to mention, his character suffers from a severe 'macho man' complex, where it is necessary for him to consistently prove his manliness in scene after scene. I can't think of anything more suffocating to watch."I, Robot" is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have watched in several years, and is without redeeming characteristics. Even the portrayal of the robots was unoriginal and the action scenes predictable. I am so glad I did not waste my money seeing this in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can a movie that is full of missed opportunities still be such an entertaining feature? Alex Proyas must know the answer to this, as this movie is better than it should be. It's wall to wall special effects (none convincing) and action sequences, but none of it stirs the viewer. It's good and entertaining, but it should have been exciting as well. Set in the future, Will Smith plays a cop with distrust for robots who believes the suicide of a top scientist (James Cromwell) was actually a murder committed by a robot. Of course, no one else believes him. Smith seems to be on autopilot here, delivering a performance that lacks emotion. Then again, everyone is lacking of emotion. They just stand there and recite their lines and run from the effects. Finally, in the last half hour we get an exciting action sequence that was rousing. Maybe this was because what came before was not as interesting, or maybe it was truly impressive. After Proyas' far-superior Dark City, I was hoping for more. But, when all was said and done, I liked this movie. A lot. I like the robots and the sequence in the tunnel, as well as the finale. Seeing a mass of robots attack a high-rise was thrilling. I'll just tuck this one away under guilty pleasures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was surprisingly good! I was worried that with Will Smith as the lead there would be some real lame dialog and they would direct him to act as he did in MiB. ( Tommy Lee Jones,Vincent D'Onofrio and Tony Shalhoub are the only reason to watch MIB) The movie is not an I. Asimov story, they credited him and used the title of one of his stories and aspects of his universe but, that is where it begins and ends.This movie stands on its own as a great Scifi story in its own right, though.the FX are pretty good, the NS4 and older robots actually looked like they were real, some dirty, scratched and looking older, the NS-5 robots look like computer generated characters and that is really the only aspect of the film that bothers me. but, ti is a small thing and for the average viewer it is a non-issue.If you like scifi, and are tired of Utopian star trek stories, give it a chance. even Wil Smith couldn't ruin the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the ground floor of US Robotics, their leading scientist lies dead, presumably after having thrown himself out from one of the storeys above. Though inexplicable psychologically, the facts seem open to only one interpretation, suicide.Dt. Del Spooner (Will Smith), who knows Dr. Lanning from before, needs to reassure himself that it really is so. In this process, he encounters a psychiatrist of robots who loves them, the company owner who loves the money robots bring, and a singular robot of the last generation, NS-5, which is about to be brought to every home.It's the year 2035, and the film is based on the tension between humans and highly evolved robots.What makes this film more than just an average futuristic action film, is the clarity and originality of its basic conception. It appeals to our faculties of logic and our ideas about the relationship between humanity and technology. This is done simply and intelligently, basically because the film is based on an idea and a script that truly captures both mind and vision.The look of the film is also very good. It creates a future which seems enjoyable, more fascinating than strange, and the look of the robots serves to underline the basic plot. The film's weaknesses are also rather obvious: Part of the dialogue is very predictable and full of clichés. The relationship between Dt. Spooner and his boss, and the portrayal of the industrial manager, is also copied from the standard repertoire. The action scenes weren't boring, but still not strikingly original.Will Smith does a good job as Dt. Spooner, and brings intensity as well as a touch of complexity to the character and his relationship to robots. He's a credible hero, and manages to communicate both strength, creativity and intelligence within adequate proportions. The other leading actors also do well enough, and Sonny, the robot, is intriguing and appealing.If not for the technical and aesthetic ease of the production and the originality of the story, this might have been just another sci-fi movie. It has its flaws, but the moments of brilliance makes one forget them, and leave the screen refreshed and entertained, both visually and intellectually.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High on action, not on philosophy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Robot" is a generic action flick disguised as a movie that will force you to ask yourself questions about the consequences of technology's advancement. Set in a futuristic Chicago, where robots serve as both humanity's slave and pet, Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is wary of the infiltration of robots in human society. Unlike the humanoid robots in the robotic soap opera "AI", the robots here clearly are machines despite their fluid movements and face-like expressions. When Dr. Lanning, the "father of robotics" dies one afternoon, most everyone writes it off as a suicide, except Detective Spooner who accuses Dr. Lanning's personal and top-of-the-line NS5 robot Sonny.Spooner is regarded as crazy and paranoid by his fellow officers and leading robot scientists. What follows is a silly and unrealistic investigation of "clues" left by Dr. Lanning about the coming robot insurrection. After the robots turn on humanity, we are left with a silly action flick where the brash Will Smith single-handedly saves the human race from the maniacal machinery meant to be man's best friend.High on action and low of philosophy, "I Robot" dissolves into the typical Will Smith genre as the movie progresses. With Sonny acting as some sort of messianic robot, the movie tries to draw on the question: If robots can do everything better than humanity, shouldn't robots be the masters and not the slaves? However, it is presented clumsily around the monotonous action sequences. Entertaining movie, but could've been better. 2.5 out of 4.</fullReview>

However, the book is itself a collection of short stories that Asimov connected together in a narrative. It would've been virtually impossible to create a compelling movie with that style. I,Robot combined the themes that Asimov created in each of his stories, creating a worthwhile film, and a worthy successor to Asimov's stories.If you're looking for an action packed movie with an incredible storyline and fantastic sci-fi, this is the film you're looking for.</fullReview>

I try to approach these movies with hope, because I read the stories and the books by asimov, stanislav lem et al, and why the Hollywood producers insist on changing the character so drastically, it is beyond me. Is it simply a move of greed to get more African-Americans watching this crap? (Which I doubt they do, being intelligent enough to know they are being pandered to.) Will Smith is just not cut out for serious dramatic entertainment. I thought these nitwits had gotten the message with that still-life "Wild, Wild West" which died after about two hours in the theaters, but no. Will Smith is a good comedian, why not star him in comedy movies? But then again, I have the full multi-million dollar release of "Bewitched" to look forward to.

		<fullReview>"I, robot" is loosely based on Asimov's sci-fi universe. I've never been a big fan of Asimov (Phillip K. Dick kicks his ass), but from the little snippets of interviews I caught (and good old Asimov's daughter quoted on the posters stating that the movie was faithful to her fathers vision) I was expecting, I dunno, an Asimov adaptation.On the other hand, while it does use the 3 laws of robotics as a basis for the plot, the movie is pretty far from being a Frankenstein-like meditation on current technology, even while it rather ineptly references Frankenstein during the dialogue. It's actually something resembling a cross between a film-noir and a Will Smith vehicle. Unfortunately, it's more Smith than noir.Crammed with terrible, terrible expository dialogue and some of the lamest jokes I've ever heard (we're talking about Akiva Goldsman here; mr. Freeze, anyone?), the movie takes too long to say too little and makes twists that are so predictable that I stared in disbelief at how much of the plot I was able to foresee. The final fight, including more Will Smith one-liners surrounded by another one of those "epic" battles that just have too much CGI to impress anyone, is painful to sit through.I am sorry, but this movie sucks badly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This thing broke robot rule number one. Never injure a human being, through inaction or interaction. This thing was so bad that it hurt this human being. Stay away for your own mental heath. Just as bad as that other film written by this robot lovin' loser. 'Bicentennial Man' with Robin Williams may have had less action in it then this movie but even that crap wasn't as devoid of thought as I, Robot is. The robots never looked like they were actually real or interacting properly with the human cast. They never seemed like a real world threat. Even the mob fight and the police station attack seemed to have no real world threat.You could almost see the wires lifting the cops as the robots 'hit' them. This was a green screen film where you felt the actors looking at nothing as they tried to act. Maybe the humans were really the deficient ones. The effects department and the actors failed here?miserably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't wait to see I, Robot!1. Will Smith stars in it. 2. Science Fiction movie (usually a good reason). 3. Based on one of the greatest SciFi authors, Isaac Asimov's novel.Those are my top three reasons for going to see I, Robot.Now, granted, I have not read any of Isaac Asimov's novels, because I have always been interested in another SciFi/Fantasy author (who I don't believe that I can mention here, for fear of having my review, or any future reviews, axed).One thing, though, is for sure. After seeing I, Robot, I definitely want to read Asimov's novel to see how much of the novel was used in the movie.I know that a lot of people will probably tear down this movie, because it wasn't exactly like the novel. What people don't ever seem to understand is when a movie is made, it is usually modified to make it more enticing or exciting to the viewers.Everybody has their own opinions, and views about a novel being made into a movie, but if you go with an open mind, you might actually enjoy the movie. I know that novels are usually better than the movies, but I have also enjoyed both the novel and the movie separately.I, Robot was very action packed, plus the one-liners that Will Smith uses are hilarious as usual. This movie will definitely make you think about progress, and the possibility of trying to make life easier, can actually make life more difficult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, visual looked real and interesting. No doubt about it. Acting was quite good Will Smith was not too overacted and Bridget Monahan nailed the character as it supposed to be.The direction was annoying and confusing. Shia LaBeouf's character supposed to be a comic relief but there were so little of him to make it matters. There was no explanation of Dr. Calvin's love for robots. Everything was about, oh well, Will Smith.The dialog was smart and witty but that's it. The story was nothing else beside shallow. It lacked of philosophical dept of Asimov's book. There are so many good movies about bad robot out there. We do not need another one of the terminators, really.</fullReview>

C.G.I. looks fake, it doesn't work, the only reason C.G.I. will be accepted in the future is cause future people will not know any better. I like how instead of making a movie version of the book I, Robot ( y'know, simple sci/fi-melodrama about humanity and machines ), they make some Will Smith action movie. This might have been the first movie where I realized that Will Smith is horrible, just completely obnoxious. Like he's not charismatic, he's just a megalomaniac. I, Robot is a dull action movie meant to showcase Will Smith, like one big sh*tty platform he can stand on and proclaim to the world "look at me! Look at me!"</fullReview>

The things about behavior of a robot was really knowledgeable. The idea about three law of robot, has great. Law I: A robot may not harm a human or, by inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Law II: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. Law III: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law. Actually these laws has been invented by Isaac AsimovKnowledgeable and deliberative research of Dr Alfred Lanning about robot: Why is it that when some robots are left in darkness, they will seek out the light? Why is it that when robots are stored in an empty space, they will group together, rather than stand alone? How do we explain this behavior?Grate work by all cast. Good personality of Will Smith. Heart touching emotions in between Bridget Moynahan and robot.My personal opinion, Overall this movie did grate story, action, technology, costumes. Really movie was knowledge, enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I, Robot 3D Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is a sci-fi thriller about a cop, Del Spooner (Will Smith) set in the year 2035, where robots are everywhere, do most labor, and are sub-servant to humans, but he doesn't trust them. After an apparent suicide by Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) a designer at US Robotics, the countries biggest robotics company, Spooner smells something isn't right, and implicates a robot, Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk), in what appears to him as a murder, which is against one of the 3 Laws Of Robotics;I recall reading I, Robot,and several other Isaac Asimov's stories when I was younger, the collection of short stories have little to do with this film though, only the 3 laws more or less are important. That aside, I, Robot is actually a very entertaining and clever thriller, with for the most part so-so special effects for decade old CGI, more on par with a video game, and Will Smith doing it 'Big Willy Style'. I like Mr. Smith, I've followed his career since he was only a rapper, and for the most part the man has made his career, and has arguably the most successful musician turned actor since Barbra Streisand. Rising above his urban upbringing and taking acting so seriously that you can watch him progress into a serious contender in the realm of acting Gods over the last couple decades. Now, I'm not saying that I, Robot is a masterpiece of cinema for the times, nor am I saying it's Will's best acting job ever, in fact that brings me to my point I was getting to, after giving credit where credit is due, in this movie, as I said before, Mr. Smith is doing it "Big Willy Style", and what I mean is, this is a character that Will plays from time to time in these obvious big budget movies. A style interchangeable with a few of his other screen alter-egos. That aside, this movie is fun. That's what counts, it's a pop-corn movie, it's just a little bit better than most. Before you bombard me with slander for comparing this movie to Jaws, it's not in the same league, but the way it's constructed reminds me of how Steven Spielberg took one story and kept the spirit, but gave us something that was much more exciting than had it been a direct adaptation, and this movie is the same way, the spirit of the stories are there, especially with the 3 Laws, but it's a nice tight suspenseful tale that keeps you interested and pays off.All that aside, let's get to the "meat and potatoes" of what this review is really about, the 3D conversion. It's interesting how the movie has been cropped from it's original aspect ratio down to 1.78:1. making the film feel a tad cramped sometimes, as you are losing some of the picture, but I actually prefer 3D presentations in this ratio normally, even though I do generally prefer a nice full 2.35:1 or more panoramic picture to movies like this, at home 3D movies that are in a smaller ratio tend to lend to the experience better by filling the entire screen. I could go on and on about this all day, and I"m sure if your even still reading you don't care anymore either, the real deal is does the 3D conversion work? Yes and no. It's not going to blow your mind, and probably not going to be the first movie you grab to try and impress your friends with. Most scenes feel like two 2D images just separated from the background, very flat. This is one time i cannot say that the 3D helps with the CGI blending with real footage and it is sad because in films that were older, like Jurassic Park and Star Wars: Episode I ? The Phantom Menace the 3D conversion helped those films. It's decent enough, and since most places have it reasonably priced, it is a suitable addition to your 3D library. The standard version is on the same disc, and there is a DVD in the combo pack. All the original special features were carried over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best novel adaptation that I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie that is very loosely based on the book of the same name, it is actually pretty good. In fact it is also good that in the credits it indicates that the movie is very loosely based on the book. The three laws are the same, as well as the robots, and there are also two characters from the book (Alfred Lanning and Susan Calvin) however in the book they never meet as Calvin is actually born at least 100 years after Lanning. However, these characters reprise their roles from the book, with Lanning being the inventor of the positronic brain, and Susan Calvin being a specialist robot psychologist.The book is a collection of short stories about the development of robots, and deals with significant events in their development. The movie itself is loosely based on the last story of the book, where the robots have developed to such a point where their interpretation of the three laws includes what is called the Zeroth law, that is robots may not harm, not cause harm to come to, humanity. In the book this is dealt with subtly with the robots making certain changes to the Earth government by removing those that are dangerous and replacing them with those who will be helpful.However, this movie is a sci-fi action detective thriller, which is nothing like the books. Further, the understanding of the robot's role with humanity is somewhat more forceful, as the robots decide to step in and force humanity to protect itself (much to the horror of the humans) in their argument, humanity is inherently suicidal, and as such they must be protected from themselves. The protagonist, a Detective Spooner, is purely a creation of the film, and his paranoia regarding robots is useful in this role (as it was intended to be).I once wrote a story connected to the book in high school, and that not only dealt with a positronic brain being placed into a computer, but also the computer becoming self aware, and deciding that it must step in as humanities 'nanny', a very similar plot to this film. I did wonder why Asimov never mixed the positronic brains with computers, and why computer systems never played a huge role in many of his science fiction writings. The simply answer to that is that it is not that computers did not exist (they had existed for a while beforehand) but that they were not as ubiquitous as they are now. There was no internet, and a computer would take up an entire room. In Asimov's eyes, he could not envisage miniaturisation, nor could he envisage the world as it has turned out to be. He vision was in regards to bipedal machines that had a capacity to learn. Come thirty to forty years after the book was written (and I wonder is Asimov would end up rolling in his grave) we are in a different world to Asimov. Robots don't simply exist in bipedal machines (actually they don't even exist) but rather hidden in computer source codes. We refer to them as bots, programs designed to lurk in computer systems, and act at particular times. There are stories of these bots mimicking women and men on dating sights, and are designed to elicit information from the victim.I still think this is an awesome movie, one of the best novel adaptations that I have seen (not that it is directly based on the book). I personally think it is because it is exactly how I imagined a movie based on I Robot would be like, and, well, because it turned out the way I expected, I know I have no need to surpass it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie begins in the year of 2035, where robots are just something that walk around everyday and are programmed to work along with humans. Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is called to investigate the suicide of Dr. Alfred Lanning, who is the maker of the robots. But Del does not believe that it was a suicide, he suspects that a robot murdered the doctor, which according to the three laws cannot be true. One of the laws being that a robot cannot harm a human, or allow a human to come to harm. A robot named Sonny soon becomes the main suspect, according to Del, but because of the laws Del will have a hard time convincing people of this, and he must find out the truth before it is too late.Before I saw this film I had been told that it was a really good movie by everyone I knew, but I just really did not like this film. Especially when it came to the story. I found that nearly everything that happened in this film I could see coming from a mile off. It was way too predictable in my opinion. I am not a very big sci-fi fan, so that may have been one of my bigger problems with this film, but to be honest I found the entire story to just be kind of cheesy, and as I was watching it I felt as if I had seen movies with a similar storyline several times before.However, this movie was not all bad, there were a few parts that I thought were good. Will Smith I thought gave a very convincing performance, and I really enjoyed it. But for me he needs to play in a few more roles that are not just your average shoot-'em-up, because for me it is getting extremely old. With that said I really did not like Bridget Moynahan in this movie. I found her performance poorly acted, and very over the top at times, which was one of the bigger downfalls of the movie in my opinion.Overall, I, Robot is an action packed film with and ending explanation that will be very pleasing for most audiences, and even most sci-fi fans as well as that. But for other people you will probably just find this movie mediocre with good acting at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this picture unsure whether I would even get through it. I hate android films for the most part, and my Daddy isn't a big fan of them either. But we were both unpleasantly surprised with this movie! It is a pretty basic formula- Will Smith taking on a batch of C3POs - but there is a humor that is consistent and leavens the CGI parts and the Big Bads. The chief robot, jeremy, or something, was a hoot too! I know that I may have enjoyed it more if I knew more about the culture and/or Asimov movies, but it was a fun/action-packed ride! If you have kids that regularly take in Terminator or Star Worlds-type movies, this will either be a massive bore or a fun change of pace.I had read a brief synopsis of this and went in hoping for some unruly 'bots, a couple of 'machines gone bonkers' moments and to be entertained.

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed "I, Robot". It is an interesting mix of the "what-if" scenario, along with subtle hints of human faults and the debate over artificial intelligence.Will Smith, for acting as the main character, does not do a fantastic job in this film, but it is passable. Many of the other actors in the film are hard to watch. For instance, Bridget Moynahan is absolutely awful. Alan Tudyk's personification of Sonny is believable at first, but then goes downhill when he starts talking like a human.The script is poorly written. Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman are not the best screenwriters the world has ever seen. However, the story is set firmly and they stick to it, making it a decent movie to watch.The main theme in the movie are quite prevalent: robots (aka computers, phones, cars, etc.) are not human and should not be left to make human decisions, such as rescuing a person from a car crash. The films conclusion is predictable yet necessary, and brings the movie full circle.I would recommend this movie. It is not a bad movie, but it is not one I would demand every person in the world to see before they die. I give it 6 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

I enjoyed it, nevertheless, but didn't live up to the high hopes some of us had, and it makes it out to be quite a silly film.Will Smith, James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, and the many others are great actors, and the highlight of the film, and the animation on the robots are fantastic. I love the expressions on their faces, making them out to be more like humans than robots. Some of the action and fighting is also something to point out. The fight against the robots was excellent, another highlight of the film.Overall, I,Robot was an okay film, but seem somewhat flat and overdone in some parts.

Great special effects, great action and some good performances.

It took the short stories and intertwined them by the common thread, that one day robots might take over. But the cast was unbelievable! I really enjoyed the dark humor spewing from Will Smith(Somehow, i told you so, just dosen't quite say it.) Along with the great emotional times coming from the radiant Brigett Moynahan(I like them because their safe! Because they can't hurt you!) It was an awe inspiring movie with great visual effects. And Del Spooner has been: run off the road, had a house demolished around him and been shot at by robots.

		<fullReview>When I first heard of 'I, Robot', I felt that it was just going to be a mindless action film that thought it was, in some way, being intelligent in its execution. I was pleasantly surprised. The year is 2035. Human-like robots have become the norm in modern society. They clean our homes, they make our furniture, they deliver our parcels. In Chicago, police detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) possesses a seemingly irrational dislike of robots. He is immediately suspicious that an apparent suicide could be the doing of a disobedient robot. His suspicions are quickly dismissed by his peers. After all, such an action would violate the Three Laws, which every robot is programmed to obey.The film is very good. The acting is generally very good- Smith is a very likable sci-fi hero. The stand-out performance would be that of Alan Tudyk who perfectly voices the implicated Robot, named Sunny. The special effects are very good, and the cinematography perfectly displays the future landscape of Chicago. Based on an Isaac Assimov story, 'I, Robot' makes for a genuinely intelligent look at where human technology is heading. I'd rate it just a shade below Spielberg's 'Minority Report' and I'd give it 7/10. Well worth your time!</fullReview>

It was very good robot animation but of course seeing Will Smith's buttocks was disgusting! They could have done without that scene! This movie took place in 2038. The whole story was about these robots that are trying to take over this town from the commands of a computer system. Of course at the beginning of this movie the robots are just obeying their owners and doing nice things and helping out the town. But then they turn bad because their commander is telling them to do all of this. So, basically, it's not the robots' fault for doing this but it's the commander's fault. My review may not sound interesting but the movie itself is great! Movie directed by Alex Proyas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for Hollywood, bad for movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can tell a lot about the viewer by their comments on movies and I, Robot tells a lot. There are the art house viewers who expect slow, thoughtful musings; there are the sci- fi historians who expect the spirit of Asimov to rise out of the movie; there are the mindless summer viewers who say, "look at the pretty explosions... haha... that was funny... Will Smith is clever"; and there are jaded, whiners like me who watch the movie so they can add their comments to IMDb... ;-)I, Robot is the classic example of a mediocre Hollywood effects movie with very good intentions that fails for the same reason many Hollywood movies fail: Bad dialogue, lack of suspension of disbelief and dubious casting. As usual, the effects are great, but there are too many. This review will have a few minor spoilers, but nothing, I expect, that will ruin the film for future viewers (as if they will pick this one out of the many).Let's start with the good. The effects are top-notch and the CGI is mostly seamless except for some of the more ambitious outdoor scenes. Will Smith is his usual likable self and almost compensates for the dialogue. Bridget Moynahan does a credible job of playing a scientist with heart and pulls off the technobabble with a straight face and the sense she might know what she's talking about. The plot is somewhat clever with some stuff you can't see coming right away. The discussion of self-aware robots is delved into more than one would expect of a typical Hollywood film.The bad. Why do sci-fi movies always expect huge leaps in technology in such a short period of time? Maybe it's just me, but besides the cell-phone and the ubiquitous wireless laptop is 1970 that much different from 2004? I guess I felt 2035 wasn't far enough int he future for me. Some of Will Smith's dialog is really awful with some really stupid and obvious one-liners that often fall a little flat. The relationship between Will's character and his lieutenant boss seemed very forced. The plot things that happen to Will's character also often fail to suspend disbelief, especially when he supposedly gets suspended for running 2 huge future trucks off the road (inside a tunnel, mind you) with his little sports-car Audi. Lots of the action and effects sequences seemed de rigeur (meaning they were there because a Hollywood blockbuster needs them more than the story). The final battle was almost boring. Lastly, but a mostly minor point, Bridget Moynahan was way too good-looking as the scientist character and her girly, emotional scenes had a bit too much crying. She kept making me think of the Supermodel- Scientist of the MIT ig-Nobel awards.Overall, I, Robot is a watchable, entertaining summer flick, but not terribly memorable or praisable. Worth a matinée. Should be seen in the theatre if you watch it for the effects.</fullReview>

Time and time again this film lingers on the spectacle when it hits every small moment.What were they thinking?No, this is not vintage Will Smith, and yes the female lead is pretty bad, but the film still works. Despite a completely unreal world this film still works. Despite the fact that the film was wounded by Smith battling Proyas for the shape of the film, it still works whenever the small personal moment, or the moments of ideas, for example Smith's first meeting with James Cromwell floored me in its simplicity and perfection... and left me to wonder what this film might have been.See this on TV where I'm certain the small moments will play better than on the big screen. Then again it will leave you sobbing for what might have been.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, ROBOT (2004) **1/2 Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, Alan Tudyk, James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, Adrian Ricard, Chi McBride. Loose adaptation of Isaac Asimov's classic sci-f story about a futuristic society where robots are incorporated into the public trust as servants that uphold three rules to fulfill has angry cop Smith facing off against a corporation's eve of releasing new robots that may be malevolent since one may have killed its creator. Production design and visual effects once again rule the roost in the action/sci-fi genre with little originality since it seems to be a processed output of 'BLADE RUNNER', 'ROBOCOP', 'THE TERMINATOR', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'A.I.' and 'MINORITY REPORT' yet the entertainment value hangs on by the edge of its cinematic fingers thanks to a humor sprinkled turn by Smith (when he's not glowering at the machinations, literally, at hand) and some sleekly waycool aforementioned visuals thanks to director Alex Proyas' visionary skills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to Asimov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the reviews of this movie one can see that those that read Asimov and those that didn't fall into different camps. Those that don't read will probably love this movie- those that grew up with an Asimov book tucked under their arm will probably find it offensive. Will Smith was probably the most miscast actor in history in this movie. The fresh prince of Belair just had no place in Asimov's thoughtful attempt at determining man's future with robotics. The crass inclusion of a Converse commercial (vintage tennis shoes...seriously?) completed the rape of a really intelligent man's premise.If the movie industry wants to whine about pirating their product they should be more careful about allowing director's to turn classic characters into something from the Cosby kids and, in the case of V for Vendetta, dystopic and disturbing anti-heroes into crusaders for gay rights. The fact that these men lack the imagination to do any thing more than corrupt the work of others should determine their suitability to choose their subject matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I, robot" is loosely based on Asimov's sci-fi universe. I've never been a big fan of Asimov (Phillip K. Dick beats him pretty badly), but from the little snippets of interviews I caught (and good old Asimov's daughter quoted on the posters stating that the movie was faithful to her fathers vision) I was expecting, I dunno, an Asimov adaptation.On the other hand, while it does use the 3 laws of robotics as a basis for the plot, the movie is pretty far from being a Frankenstein-like meditation on current technology, even while it rather ineptly references Frankenstein during the dialogue. It's actually something resembling a cross between a film-noir and a Will Smith vehicle. Unfortunately, it's more Smith than noir.Crammed with terrible, terrible expository dialogue and some of the lamest jokes I've ever heard (we're talking about Akiva Goldsman here; mr. Freeze, anyone?), the movie takes too long to say too little and makes twists that are so predictable that I stared in disbelief at how much of the plot I was able to foresee. The final fight, including more Will Smith one-liners surrounded by another one of those "epic" battles that just have too much CGI to impress anyone, is painful to sit through.I am sorry, but this movie sucks badly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dark City' is one of my favorite Sci-Fi flicks of recent years so I was hoping for much, much more. After all, this is an intelligent work of fiction. But it seems he succumbed to the usual Hollywood 'dumbing down' for the mass audience, infusing it with some of the most absurdly unbelievable 'action', and casting a 'money man' incapable of acting his way out of the proverbial paper bag. The biggest mistake, though, was the casting of the ever-annoying Mr. Smith in yet another much-undeserved and much-overpaid leading role. This will be the last time I ever waste money on a film with his participation. I had hoped for more, as I said, from the director of 'Dark City', but then I have to remember he also directed the hopelessly stupid, but stylish 'The Crow'. Another piece of major Hollyweed garbage. So perhaps he's yet another one of the many director's with only one good film in him. But then that's been the trend for the last 20 years. Indeed there is very little good I can find in the crap heap. The script is stupid and obvious, the acting exceedingly dull, even Proyas' usual visual style would seem to be totally gone as there is nothing worth even looking at here.Anyway, my advice is to avoid this, even if, like me, you are an avid sci-fi fan. There's nothing here worth wasting your time on. Go back and watch the old 'Outer Limits' episode.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Product placement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually like Sci-Fi movies like this, and looked forward to see it as a friend got it on DVD. The story was quite nice, the computer animation awesome.But most deranging was the intrusive product placement by Audi. Most of the cars in the movie were recent Audis (mainly A2 which are not even built anymore, as far as I know) in a futuristic shape, and of course the Audi RSQ Concept, driven by Smith. That ruined the whole show more me.Not because personally I don't like Audi (it's for those cannot effort BMW oder Mercedes, and after all it's just Volkswagen ;-) ). I also hate product placement in James Bond and other movies. Where I think James Bond should drive British cars, and not BMW or whatever non British car they want to promote.So the whole movie was a Audi promotion for me. If I saw it in a cinema or rent the DVD myself I'd been angry for the money I paid to FOX. So I'm only angry for the waste of time. I think I'd given the movie a 7 if the product placement weren't there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I know my comments here are not timely, but this movie was awful.First off, it is a shame the way Hollywood associated this movie with Asimov's work. The two have nothing to do with each other.Additionally, the storyline was just silly. The scientist is being watched by the big bad computer, so naturally the only way he can get a message to the police is...killing himself. Don't they have payphones in the future? Oh, and the detective needs to know to follow the clues. That wouldn't be obvious to a freakin' police detective. Obviously, the best way to remind him to do his job is to leave a copy of Hansel and Gretel in the office.Aside from the script issues, the special effects were not good. Many of the scenes look entirely fake, and the director lifted a lot of camera tricks from the Matrix.If you're into Will Smith, you may want to check this out. If you're looking for sci fi, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent all the way through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, Robot is the Will Smith film we've all been waiting for. It's an action/thriller/mystery story that keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through.It starts out by stating the 3 laws of robotics, and then Spooner chases a robot, which shows his disliking for robots. The story picks up when he meets his partner, and they begin looking around the doctor's room for clues. They are surprised when a robot named Sonny jumps out and holds them at gunpoint. Del Spooner's mission is now to track down the robot, which unravels a whole new evolution of robots.The CGI is stunningly amazing, and it's almost possible to believe that the world presented to us in this film could be what the world would look like in 2035. The acting is superb on all levels. Will Smith gives his best performance, and for once steps out his Fresh Prince character, although hinting this character with his comedic moments.The mood of the film is dark and suspenseful, and there's lots of tension whenever a robot is around.Sonny is the best character in this film. The voice is strikingly creepy and done very well. Emotion is put in when it needs to be, and it's taken out when it's not supposed to be there.This is one of my favorite films, and does not for one moment let you down. You'll enjoy this epic masterpiece. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting but absolutely awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, I must admit, that I am in fact going to be biased. As a, I wrote this in the back of a Toyota Aygo and also, I am severely angry because I missed my plane to the Faulkands Islands to fight in a prehistoric war film.None the less I very much enjoyed the film because of it's intense scenes involving Bruce Willis and his several Twitter followers running around Popley creating havoc with Pot Noodles.Besides this, the worst film in the world, and definitely not one to put on your Advent Calendar because that doesn't make sense whatsoever.Thanks very much for reading in advance for the following review.Cya later.</fullReview>
