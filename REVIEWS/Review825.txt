		<shortDescription>Shocking and Sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tickled certainly deviates from its trailer, but the film itself is a shocking piece of art. Tied together with tasteful cinematography (with necessary hidden cameras here and there), Tickled captures the enigma of David D'Amato's empire of male-tickling videos which results in scare tactics, harassment, and financial bullying of the unsuspecting participants--something that is very relevant to modern issues. I felt sad walking out of the film, which is evidence that this film does its job of riding the line between comedy and tragedy. I do feel that the trailer sets up an expectation of a horror/thriller aspect, but there is not much of this atmosphere in the film. I do, however, think that the film by itself is a brave piece of journalism that endangered the Tickled team financially and psychologically. The fact that the team was able to muster up the courage to finish the film is remarkable, and I hope David and his team are brought to justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent debut for Dylan. Went in expecting a ho-hum doc about a strange subculture. Instead, this film impressed at every turn with it's sophisticated handling of a strange and complicated story. Yes, as some readers have noted, it does not have a particularly surprising reveal, but that is not the point. The audience is taken on a twisty turn-y roller coaster which, unlike a carnival ride, only gets more dramatic towards the end. Themes of power, control, exploitation remind the viewer why we have white-collar crime laws on the books. The men shown benefiting in this movie are scarier than any monster I've seen in film.I guess that is sort of the Splash Mountain ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dogged investigative journalism stumbles from something innocuously weird to something bizarrely dangerous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether it is drama, comedy or documentary, New Zealand filmmakers punch above their weight. The documentary Tickled (2016) is one of the most unusual films you will see for a long time and a guaranteed conversation starter in the right company. While the film's title suggests comedic titillation, what it reveals is something more sinister that has wrecked many lives. It is also a fine example of how dogged investigative journalism can stumble from something that appears innocuously weird into something bizarrely dangerous.It is said that movies have plots while documentaries have premises. Pop-culture journalist David Farrier specialises in fringe phenomena and his premise is that if someone spends a fortune to stay anonymous they have something serious to hide. He comes across something described as "competitive professional tickling" that involves the filming of young athletic males being tied down and tickled by one or more other young athletic males, all fully clothed. His initial inquiries to understand more about this activity are so aggressively stonewalled that he turns his investigation into a documentary with most of the filming in the United States. Expecting to find a secretive cult of homoerotic activity, he finds participants who have been subjected to extraordinary legal threats, extortion, and public shaming. The scale of intimidation and the lengths to which perpetrators are prepared to go indicate there is big money involved. The documentary feels like a parallel universe where things go from strange to stranger as the inquiries lead to a prominent and wealthy American lawyer who was a teacher and school principal. Farrier and his team-mate Dylan Reeve use old fashioned stakeouts, doorstop confrontations, and forensic web-based research to turn the study of a fringe fetish into a gripping thriller.This is a well-produced documentary, especially for a novice filmmaker. Minor criticisms aside, like Ferrier's occasional tendency to tell rather than show and a few scenes that need tighter editing (like the time spent in the car stake-out), the overall pace, direction and content make this a totally engaging film. The hand-held filming technique and the unexpected twists and turns in the investigation impart real-time-discovery effects. A quick Google search will show that both during production and since the film's release Farrier and Reeve have been and still are under serious legal and financial threat. Not only do the filmmakers deserve a bravery award, their work is riveting from the laughter-filled opening scenes to the chilling closing credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unexpectedly compelling and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New Zealand journalist David Farrier (tv series Short Poppies, etc) has made a career out of looking at the weird side of life. But even he was unprepared for the fallout after stumbling upon a website about "competitive endurance tickling" in which young men were paid to be tied up and tickled, complete with some videos. Although the on-line videos were pretty harmless, they piqued his curiosity and Farrier decided to find out more. But when he contacted Jane O'Brien Media to try an arrange an interview he was harassed and threatened with lawsuits from a high powered US firm. Their secretive and aggressive manner intrigued Farrier even further and he tried to probe beneath the surface. He and his collaborator, writer/filmmaker and computer expert Dylan Reeve, discovered a vaguely sinister to this tickling fetish as they travelled to Los Angeles and New York. Farrier talks to a couple of former tickle participants who talk about being blackmailed and threatened. What began as a light hearted investigation into something that initially seemed vaguely homoerotic but innocuous turned into a thriller as Farrier and Reeve tried to probe a web of corporate paperwork to find out the identity of the mysterious figures behind Jane O'Brien Media. By turns amusing and gripping, Tickled gives us a look at the darker side of the internet and a vaguely unsettling subculture, and explores themes of power, control, harassment, fetishism, corruption, and criminal activity. This is the first feature length documentary from Farrier, and he has an amiable screen presence, but he also demonstrates a dogged sense of purpose as he refuses to back down from threats and intimidation as he gets closer to learning the identity of the person behind this unusual enterprise. A strange and decidedly weird little documentary that is unexpectedly compelling and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'TICKLED': Four Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed documentary flick; about an online tickling competition, involving young athletes tickling each other. The film was directed by first time feature filmmakers David Farrier and Dylan Reeve. Farrier is a New Zealand entertainment journalist, who also stars in the movie. He met a lot of harsh resistance, while investigating the film's story, from a producer of the 'tickling endurance sport' (named Jane O'Brien). The struggles Farrier and Reeve had making the film, becomes as much apart of the story as the tickling itself. The movie has received mostly rave reviews from critics, and it's become a small indie hit (at the Box Office). I think the film is really well made, and extremely intriguing. The movie begins with a montage of clips, from Farrier's other obscure entertainment stories. Then we see him come across an 'endurance tickling' video. He's intrigued by it, and he then decides to write the producers of the video (Jane O'Brien Media) about doing a story on the sport. He gets a very negative reply, from the corporation, which accuses him of wanting to put a 'gay slant' on the videos (as they insist the 'endurance competition' is exclusively heterosexual). Farrier, and his friend Dylan Reeve, then decide to investigate the subject further; as they make a documentary about their journalistic journey. The movie is a very insightful (and educational) look, at how much those with a lot of money (and power) can get away with. It's involving, and always interesting; and at times it seems more like a legal thriller, than a film about an odd fetish. The material is disturbing, and often hard to watch, but it's also really well made. As far as documentaries go, this one is pretty fascinating (and informative).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/YnZSF_6sbsA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange days indeed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New Zealand journalist David Farrier came upon the strange phenomena of competitive endurance tickling when searching online for new avenues to write articles on. He duly contacted the group who organised it, Jane O'Brien Media, but was met with a volley of abuse. After some to-ing and fro-ing they sent over representatives to Auckland to meet Farrier and his fellow film-maker, which only led to further threats. This bullying encouraged the two film-makers to go to the United States to try and find out more about what dark forces were behind this seemingly innocuous, if somewhat bizarre, online activity.Tickled has been described as the new Catfish (2010) and not entirely without justification. It shares the concept of a documentary following a mystery route where strange secrets are uncovered. In this one an enigmatic empire seems to lie behind the world of tickling, which is really not a competitive endurance based activity at all but an odd sexual fetish. It turns out it is harmless enough to get many young men involved when there is a cash incentive but embarrassing enough to cause them many problems when these tickle videos begin to be posted everywhere online by the media group who own them. The videos are used in this way as a means of ensuring the men comply with the demands of the mysterious leader Jane O'Brien, if the boys refuse to do more work then the videos are posted everywhere with their real names attached to them. The film-makers soon discovered that most of these young men were consequently too afraid to speak out but one or two individuals do talk and detail the levels of blackmail, bullying and exploitation they have had to endure. There group behind it seem to be as much interested in power and control, as they are in their sexual fetish. The investigation begins in the earliest days of the internet and continues to the present day. There is a big reveal late on but it's best not to say too much about it.It could probably be argued that, while this one has a very interesting premise, it doesn't necessarily wrap things up as strongly as it might. By the end it feels like there are still more questions than answers. Still, this is an interesting and strange story and despite one or two flaws, it's one that makes for fascinating viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy beyond your imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I arrived at the local art house cinema expecting to see Weiner only to find that it played at 4:30 and 9:30. Tickled, a film I hadn't heard of was just about to start at 7:00 so there I was. I have seen tickle videos on YouTube and elsewhere and always wondered about the economics behind these strange, professional looking videos. They weren't advertisements for subscription pay sites so what gives...Tickled sheds some light on the economics and motivation behind them. Without giving anything away, I'd suggest that it is as creepy and malevolent a story as Foxcatcher. The head games played by Mr. DuPont and 'Teri Tickle' are frighteningly similar even if the results were very different.Talking about the film with strangers as I left the theater: I thought my 'creepy' was better than any of the other adjectives mentioned. But when I talked about tickle videos being everywhere on the Internet, they might of thought that was creepy.Too often in documentaries, the person with the microphone can be overbearing to irritation. The low key approach in Tickled makes the journey more interesting. It only heightens what unfolds on the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great trailer, very average documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I wanted to like 'Tickled', and went in thoroughly expecting to do so, after having been left intrigued and excited by a very well made trailer for the documentary. What I ended up finding though, was sadly that I'd seen pretty much everything this had to offer in said trailer. The trailer promised elements of horror and mystery, but sadly delivered zero horror and little, if any, genuine mystery.The whole thing gets off to a roaring start in the first 20 minutes, setting itself to seemingly be a great ride, hopefully leading to a thrilling conclusion. Sadly, the first 20 minutes are by far the best 'Tickled' has to offer. The middle is filled with just that - filler. The pace slows dramatically and we are left wondering what the significance of what we are actually seeing is. The ending lacked any punch at all and leaves you with a feeling of "Is that it?" David Farrier tried his best, but was clearly out of his depth in a lot of situations. He's fine when the person wants to talk and is giving a willing interview, but as soon as a situation comes up where the interviewee is being evasive, his attempts to get a word out of them are amateurish and hardly worthy of making the final cut. Also his frequent swearing while giving interviews and talking to the camera are a bad look and take away any sense of class that a documentarian should always possess.I guess the bottom line for me was that I felt let down. I don't think there was anything here that couldn't have been covered in a '60 Minutes' segment, and warranted me paying money to go and see it at the cinema. The story is quirky enough and has a twist (of sorts), but is that enough? I think I would have felt completely differently had it delivered a knock out punch to end things. Sadly it didn't though, and for me goes down as a forgettable experience that I won't be recommending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Farrier is a man on the edge. He is a loose cannon that the department cannot control. He has no time for your rookie shenanigans. It is a day away from his retirement.His boss calls him into the office. Just one more assignment, an illicit tickle smuggling ring. Farrier takes the manila dossier and a handful cigars. He doesn't need to read the dossier, he just likes the sound of the word 'manila' as he breathes it into the pillow at night. He has no time for your rookie shenanigans.Farrier hits up the usual crowd. A Peruvian brothel owner. A snitch with a penchant for origami. A right wing blogger with a suspiciously familiar name. His leads run dry. He has a drink.He has too many drinks. He has no idea where he wakes up, or when. But his shoes are gone and so are his socks. And there it is. A feather.With a tip of his hat and a wink in his eye, Farrier mutters. 'Here we go again'.</fullReview>
