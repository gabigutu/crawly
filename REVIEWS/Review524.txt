		<shortDescription>Shocking tale of corruption and cronyism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If only half of the presented facts in this documentary are true, then the USA will have a bleak future ahead of it. This film is based on the New York Times bestselling book with the same name by Peter Schweizer from 2015. The movie was financed by the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a right wing media organization which prominently and enthusiastically supported Donald Trump from the very beginning of his campaign. Take this as you will.The main topic of the documentary is the Clinton Foundation, a nonprofit corporation founded by Bill Clinton in 1997 and run by both Hillary and Bill Clinton. Supposedly dedicated to helping people in need, but only 10% of the money flowing into the foundation is actually used for charity work.Weirdly enough the foundation receives large donations from foreign donors whenever the Clinton's work out deals and contracts in these foreign nations in the name of the State Department. Plus exorbitant speaking fees in the tens of millions of dollars range, also paid by said foreign donors and their associates. Cases ranging from atom weapon deals with India to misappropriated development aids for Haiti and environmentally irresponsible Canadian oil pipelines. The documentary presents these cases in a somewhat dramatized fashion, with background images of burning money next to photos of the Clintons shaking hands with 3rd world despots, including dramatic music in the background. Overall is the documentary an eye-opening experience. Definitely a must-see movie for people interested in the coming election.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult to describe the FURY! The Clintons are sick people -- watch this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have a conscience, you need to learn what our former President and former Sec of State have been doing the last 15 years. Their dealings are jaw-dropping in their sheer brazenness and utter immorality.The movie depicts Bill's inflated paydays making speeches in Third World countries while also helping make introductions of business friends to those Govt leaders while Hillary is busy finding ways to facilitate improper, self-serving $$$ deals between all the parties as your Sec of State!Shady situations are profiled between the Clintons and the leaders or business big shots in: Nigeria, Haiti, Khazakhstan, India, Russia, Columbia and more.This is certainly why she installed a private email server in her home. It seems impossible that numerous federal laws were not broken in what they pulled off. First-class sociopaths. No way that our President wasn't aware of what they were doing.Watch this important and informative movie! Check the internet for a free streaming of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Factually Based Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very good documentary about the numerous ways the Clintons have hosed every single American. If you can even a tiny bit about the future of the US, you owe it to yourself to see what the mainstream press is not telling you. It's very fluid with no slow spots and just the right length. There are different commentators and many examples of how they've lie, cheated and stolen from each of us. Most I knew about, but even if I did, there were some interesting points and facts I just learned from the film. Just one example was the money raised by the Clinton Foundation for Haiti. I remember when all that went on, but such a tiny portion of the over a hundred million dollars raised went to help the Haitians, while the Clintons pocketed the majority of the donations is appalling. As I said, this is just one example. There are many more. Must See!</fullReview>

As it went along, my need to puke just kept growing.I wish all the Democrats would watch this, but I know they won't.All I can say is, watch it yourself and form your own opinion.Mine is that the Clintons are lying, stealing, cheating, traitorous, felonious, hypocritical douche-bags...they both belong in Guantánamo Bay with the rest of the terrorists.Note that Hillary gives it away when she lies, her eyelids almost close and she looks down, with every lie.Added to the current scandal of the DNC email / Wikileaks debacle, maybe this will be enough to wake up the American public to what a criminal she is...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be completely honest, none of the claims in this film surprised me in the least, as I have suspected the Clintons of shady dealings from day one.Bill and Hillary Clinton are two of the most corrupt people to have held political office in the country's history, and their supporters allow themselves to be hoodwinked at every turn of events, into believing what the Clintons say, over what they actually do, and this film proves that fact.Not only should the allegations in this film have even more light shone upon them, but they should lead to imprisonment for all three of the Clintons (Chelsea included, as she is most certainly going to be the primary beneficiary of this blood money, and has taken part in the doings of the Clinton Foundation in her adult years).My sincere hope is that this film is viewed by as many people as possible, so that the actions of the Clintons can be held against them in a criminal trial. Moreover, there should be a documentary of this type done to ALL politicians whose personal wealth has increased while in office, so that we can know who is to be removed in order to try to clean up the (apparently rampant) corruption in the U.S. Government; these politicians need to be exposed for the criminals that they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let people convince you its old news...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I was excited and scared to watch this. Normally movies don't affect me as much as documentaries so if you are a doco freak then get your snacks lined up, feed the cat, sit relax and take it all in. To some people, I would venture to guess the younger viewers, some of what is talked about will sound surprising but you will reserve judgement and research the issue/s later then formulate your opinion on that particular point or issue. Some of us actually remember some of these events back in the days that social media did not really exist and internet was just cranking up. Most of the news was still going through main stream media and at that time we had no clue the CNNs. FOXs. MSNBCs were biased and owned by one party of the other. We trusted MSM back then. So when we get to review events now, that back then we were led to believe was "America coming to the rescue", it tends to leave me hollow, angry and disgusted. I've lived overseas in Europe and Australia and many times I have had to defend America from what I thought were envious foreigners. I always thought they were jealous...but now I wonder if I was one of those blind Americans that used to think we always came to the rescue to help. I know in my heart that's what I wanted to believe. I refuse to believe the Clintons are the model of what Americans are all about. I choose to believe that they are the ugly side of America so I can still love my homeland and not feel guilty. Watch this, but make sure you take it all in. Whether you support the Clintons or not, you should see this. This political family take corruption and power to a whole new level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill and Hillary Clinton Are Above the Law - Crime Pays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Subtitle: Pay No Attention to What the Clinton's Publicly Say they Believe In...Because, They Can Be Bought. See this movie.I had to watch Clinton Cash twice to absorb the enormity of their crimes. Bill and Hillary under the guise of their Clinton Foundation present their pattern of on-going abuse and it is blatantly criminal. Using her position as Secretary of State and his position as ex U.S. President, they use the full force of their power to line their pockets and to line the pockets of those individuals and countries who 'donate' huge sums to their Clinton Foundation--a win- win for the Clintons and for those people and countries (Canada, Russia, India) who grease the Clintons' palms for expensive mineral and mining rights, building rights, nuclear technology information, XL Pipeline legislation, tax evasion, and more. Cost to taxpayers? 5 trillion + Dollars. Discoveries made through earnest investigation, speaking accounts, and trails of emails...we already know at least 33,000 of Hillary's were deliberately shredded and server wiped clean. Any of these related to Hillary and Bill's pattern of abuse and corrupt ways? Voters must think before voting. Think really hard.....how much damage can Hillary and Bill do to our country if given the White House now? It's a scary thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FACT-checked Expose that SHOULD wake up the Left</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, for those 'reviewers' who have claimed that this film is propaganda, lies, etc - the book has ALREADY been thoroughly fact-checked by countless outlets (including the Left's favorite NY Times, LA Times, on and on). Fact-checking has proved the book, the research to be comprehensively sound and indisputable. That is a FACT. If you require a bit of additional confirmation beyond that, simply look at the recent Dept. of Justice / FBI / Obama admin collusion to let Hillary Clinton walk - after the FBI director admitted that she committed 3 felonies AND repeatedly LIED under oath. You're also welcome to check the WikiLeaks emails, which show indisputable crime, corruption, racism, and bigotry within the entire Democrat party and in the corrupt left-wing media.For those 'reviewers' who claim otherwise - please read their reviews - and you'll see it's quite clear that they didn't even watch this film or read the book. The author, Peter Schweizer, has more than the requisite background, education, and experience. Again, an indisputable point. Breitbart News is NOT 'right-wing,' as many have/will claim. They're very centrist. This issue with that mis-labeling is that it comes from the left, from the Leftist media (already exposed as fully corrupt, fully aligned with the Clintons). The book and the film are objective and entirely balanced. The film is done in a documentary fashion, is NOT propaganda (see Michael Moore), and simply details the 'facts of the case.' Viewers are not steered, influenced, directed, baited, or fed heavily edited quotes and false research (again, see Michael Moore).This film is a MUST see for any Democrat, Leftist zealot, ALL Independents, and anyone who wishes to be better informed about the options in the upcoming election.Easily 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful indictment of Clinton Corruption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Weaving a web of favors-for-contributions, Hillary Clinton has become extremely wealthy in the last decade. Along with her husband, whose speaking fees quintupled after she became Secretary of State, Hillary has leveraged her positions and access to the levers of government with foreign politicians and banksters, including some of the most brutal dictators in the world.In Haiti, in return for Clinton Foundation donations, she funneled American companies to invest in the NORTH side of the island, far from the earthquake devastation. The Foundation paid out about 10% of what it took in, abysmal even for NGOs. Her sucking up to Paul Kagame is typical of the kind of thug regime she took money from.M. Taylor did an excellent job of keeping the camera moving, keeping the number of "talking heads" to a minimum (mostly the author of "Clinton Cash," Peter Schweitzer). Entertaining and thoroughly damning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something everyone should know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film to be an artful compilation of some startling revelations. I've been researching this subject on my own. Many of these facts are generally known, though not connected, and for those doubters are easily confirmed. To collect these noteworthy items in such a presentation is a daunting and well-executed job. Well done. As to those who might deny the validity of what is presented, I'd suggest that your favorite Internet search engine (I favor Google) would confirm enough of these allegations to confirm the entire presentation as true. Sadly, those who proclaim such as this film to be muckraking trash are doing so by denying reality. It's information we should all know before "pulling a lever" in the voting booth. It's an informative addition to the data we must evaluate before deciding who next will occupy the oval office presented in a way that is understandable to most. "The truth is out there," and now it's here in this film. Thanks Peter, Stephen and everyone else in that chain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie exposed the quid pro quo manner in which the Clinton's thru their foundation profit. They solicit funds from both foreign and domestic sources and pay them off with political favors. It is a very inconvenient truth that the both Bill and Hillary have steadily gained wealth and power without "earning" it. Is the movie perfect, no it makes several inferences that are not directly supported by the facts. However the preponderance of evidence does support the old adage that where there is smoke their is fire. Documentaries are by their nature dry, but this is already the highest grossing documentary in 2016 for a reason. If you want to be informed about the Clintons and not rely on sympathetic main stream media coverage, then you should see this movie.</fullReview>

Like stepping on a pile of dog crap and not quite getting rid of it...the smell of it will haunt the collective conscience of the United States. The lack of transparency and deliberate attempts by the Obamaadministration with collusion of the media only perpetuate the decline of America.

		<shortDescription>Better Than Hillary The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well,finally the Hillary haters - as well as Bill haters - can now rejoice as we get to witness a documentary made by Peter Schweizer which was based on the New York Times bestseller "Clinton Cash:The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich". This was made to better explain the cronyism and corruption that the husband-and-wife Bill and Hillary are involved in to make the couple rich with the use of the Clinton Foundation. It tells us how Bill is able to use his ability to make great speeches in convention as well as Hillary's influence when she was assigned as Secretary of State by President Barack Obama. The documentary basically narrates how the Clintons were able to amass $150 million through the $2 billion donated to the couple's charity foundation.Definitely,this was a better than Hillary The Movie considering it is updated in terms of the scandals that the Clintons are involved in and there was no presence of members of the Republican Party.Added to that, there was a better explanation of the type of corruption the Clintons are into which would definitely provide an insight with regards to Hillary's trustworthiness - a big issue between her and her opponent Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential Elections.</fullReview>

These scandals took place in broad daylight, the same way the nation watched Bernie Sanders be robbed in broad daylight with the perpetrators smiling in victory. This is not only an indictment of the Clintons themselves, but even more so of the people who have supported them for the past decades and now offer this vile, moldering person to a new generation as "leadership". It is also an indictment of the media that allows Hillary Clinton to mouth the platitudes that for all their shopworn sentiments, some people actually believe, with impunity. The only thing one can conclude from this documentary is that one day the dogs will lick the blood of this woman from the ground as they did to her historical predecessor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be great if every voter could watch Clinton Cash prior to casting a vote for our next president. I think even without vetting one can see the Clintons have become mind-numbingly wealthy. Did they make a fortune the old-fashioned way, earning it? Or did they benefit by just placing themselves as go-betweens in the greatest money grab of all time?If the devil himself were to be in politics this movie makes it clear it would be in the guise of someone very much like Hillary Clinton. She has her own powerful network starting with her co-demon Bill. They'll come to you as this benign and approachable pair who we should entrust to do good. The truth couldn't be more opposite. As the old cliché' goes: follow the money. This film does just this and it's shocking. Shocking a pair can wield so much power and can get so much done, often in plain sight, but even more since so much of the trail is propped us as humanitarian. These devils will make a deal with any evil leader or oligarch. Often the deals are shrouded in shell companies who donate exorbitant amounts of money to their foundation and/or astronomic amounts paid for public (yeah, a select public that is) speeches. It's not a crime if you can get away with it apparently.I have been fearful pondering the "what if" Hillary becomes our next president. Now I'm absolutely mortified. Please watch this. Do the homework you need and then the math. We're headed toward the absolute worst time as a nation since the United States was founded if we allow the biggest crooks of our time to take over our government. This film is more than an expose' on evil, it's a shot over the bough. A somber warning that pure evil exists and it will rise by fooling us. Wake up! Please wake up! Do not let these killers, thieves, and evil demons get your precious vote. I think I'll shut up because this film speaks for everything quite well. It's a shame, however, so few will actually see it. I beg you to do so and tell the many more who won't ever know unless a trusted friend gives them a "heads up"!</fullReview>

It's basically just a very long attack ad.I don't doubt that American politics are full of shady agreements and corruption in general - but this documentary did very little to convince me that the Clintons are any worse than the rest. Which I think is fair to assume was the main objective. It does little to substantiate it's claims. Only few sources are provided throughout. The people/narrators who express their opinion in the documentary through voice-overs are not credited, so it's hard to tell who is talking and what makes them experts on this matter. A lot of clips are shown of the Clintons talking, where the remarks made about the clips seem lacking in context or just out of context. Also a lot of newspaper clippings are constantly floating around on screen, but they are never referenced in any way, so it just seems like a cheap gimmick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the film, nor do I have any desire to. This is my first (and probably only) review, and it's sole purpose is to point out obvious propaganda. Putting aside the fact that this was funded by major Wall Street corporations that in turn are supporting Trump (I wonder why), there are precisely enough positive reviews on page one to push the three negative ones to page 2. Fake reviews on IMDb are as common as movies themselves, but this is just absurd. The movie in question is feeding on the fears first sparked in Republican voters by Fox "News", which is so corrupt they are LEGALLY NOT ALLOWED TO CALL THEMSELVES A NEWS STATION. That's a fact, look it up kids. It's propaganda through and through, and it's no coincidence that it's coming out right now, mere months from the presidential election. I would be surprised if the Trump administration DIDN'T have several hands in the making of this movie, and it's more or less guaranteed that his publicity department got their interns to set this all up.Just take it with a grain of salt is all I ask, the people who funded this aren't exactly known for fact checking. Hell Newt Gingrich literally said in a CNN interview that this election isn't about facts, it's about opinions. About a week ago, he was presented (with the backdrop of the Republican National Debate) with a graph and statistics from the CIA census bureau showing that violent crime has been decreasing since the 80s, and has only gone down further with the Obama administration. His response, and I quote, "Well that's your opinion. The fact is, Americans don't FEEL safe." At this point they're genuinely just telling you what to think. Please, don't let them.</fullReview>

This crap never ends, footage after footage of the mud-sling stuff would be systematically collected, edited and then either leak or openly provide to the media. Attacks with all their mighty political mouthpieces, demonizing their opponent Party's candidate.The election year of 2016 is so critical since the Democratic Party elected POTUS had the White House occupancy for 8 long years already, without the new presidency falling into their lap again, there would be an even huge disastrous outcome and loss. It means if they lose the bidding war, the would lose another 4 years to allow an Alpha Republican dog move into the White House, no matter whether they could be the majority party in the Senate or the Congress, since that person in the White House has the Veto power to torpedo all of their scheming plots. Lots of entitlements, privileges, lots of lobbying funds, lots of backroom Federal funding deals would lose. They would lose lot of Federal, States and local major positions if their opponent party win the ultimate power-ball lotto.That's why they had played so dirty in Florida and made Al Gore a common citizen instead of the master of that white building. Take a look, you fools, and think it back you fools, think about those disastrous years when this self-righteous far-right extremists did to our nation and what atrocity they had brought to other countries and the world. Think about it, you fools. Think about how many young and middle aged soldiers lost their lives or permanently cripples by these self-interested warmongers. How many families lost their parents, their sons and daughters, not just in America but in so many other countries. Think about how and why the world-wide pandemic terrorism now is becoming so out of control.If you search the monsters too long, if you look down into the abyss so long, you would undoubtedly become a monster too.These lying political animals from both Parties would do everything to have your vote, no matter how low, how vicious, how false it might, they just want your vote in order to have their profiteering 4-8-12-16 years to come. Show me some least I.O., some basic education and do not become a blind and naive repeated fool every 4 years.This mud-slung patch-up election-year strategic mumbo-jumbo will not stop until their 2016 reluctant and embarrassed candidate confirmed is conspiratorially ushering into the White House. And voters beware: you might never know what kind of dirty tricks they'd play in the final hours on that day in this critical year.Is Paris Burning? You tell me.Final verdict: DO NOT WATCH.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's hard to describe how bad this film is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many propaganda films made over the history of film to influence people's emotions while ignoring facts. Some you can admire for the skill of the film makers, such as Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph Of The Will" in 1935, D. W. Griffith's "The Birth Of A Nation" in 1915 or even "The Eternal Jew" released in Germany in 1940 to justify the Holocaust.This propaganda film, however, doesn't come, even remotely, to the level of "The Eternal Jew" or the 1918 film "The Kaiser, The Beast Of Berlin". All the above had, at least, better production values. better camera work, better editing, use of montages, cross fades - "Clinton Cash" doesn't even come close in cinematic quality. It is fascinating, in a perverse way, to see these video "hit pieces" crop up more and more as we near the United States General Election in November, 2016. Technology has, sadly, created a cinematic Frankenstein's Monster, allowing any teenager in their parent's garage to create the cinematic equivalent of a house-cat's coughed up fur-ball."Clinton Cash" should be shown in all film schools as an example of the worst in film making</fullReview>
