		<shortDescription>A fantastic Capra film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Happened One Night directed by Frank Capra was made and released in 1934 by Columbia Pictures as a small budget film that was not expected to do well at the box office. Yet, after its release the film gained many accolades and won the Academy Award for best picture in 1934. Due to the original small nature of the film, the leading man role was surprisingly filled by Clark Gable who was on loan from another studio. He stared opposite of Claudette Colbert. Capra's film was a combination of many ideals, emotions and social perceptions of the American society of the thirties but it was also a combination of many new and innovative filming techniques and sound advancements. The film unfolds the story in such a attention-grabbing and remarkable way that most of today's cinema use his style and ideals when producing and creating films. Capra used the idea of a moving camera, one that was not fixed upon a box, but on a moveable crane instead. This produced more sweeping shots, more angles for filming and fewer distance shots. It allowed for more movement of the actors as well as a more realistic and real life feeling to the movie. The film also incorporates back projection of images. This is were a scene is filmed previously and played in the background while the actors perform the scene in front of the projection. Back projection is used for car scenes to give the impression that the actors are driving but in reality they are in a sound stage. Capra also incorporated the use of a wipe in his film. The technique of moving left to right and fading in or out to change a scene or show elapsed time took the place of the traditional place cards in silent films and allowed for a more constant stream for the film. The film was also all talk, the new technology of a sound strip on the side of the film was used. The text cards of silent films were completely discarded. Another camera trick by Capra is to show a change in feelings within Clark Gable's character for Claudette Colbert's character by depicting her character in a different light. This happens two times within the film at key moments to the development of their relationship. Claudette Colbert is seen in a close up of softer light to emphasize Clark Gable's character seeing her in a `different light.' In this romantic comedy Capra not only showed new styles and techniques but also addressed social issues of the time. Through comedy he showed the outlandish nature of the rich (King arriving for his own wedding in a helicopter) and the nature of man being the controller in relationships as well as in society. The fighting and struggles between the two main characters showed the man taking care of the woman, the social norms of how men and woman should act around each other in that era. But the fighting and the banter also show a strong-minded and intelligent woman. The two strong-willed main characters balanced each other out.Capra's techniques for showing the social relationship between the rich and working classes as well as a relationship between man and woman in the 1930s captured film makers and film viewers for over 70 years. Films are now compared to his style of camera movement and his style of capturing the American ideals. When movies of today make a similar statement of achieving what one wants they are referred to as Capra-esc. Capra's imagination and style is one that changed the outlook of American films and introduced a new genre to film goers everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Introducing... the Screwball Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's idealistic outlook on life is evident in his films. From It Happened One Night to It's a Wonderful Life, Capra has always had a tendency to let the little guy rise above it all and beat the odds. It is no small wonder that Capra enjoyed much of his success during the Depression, when movies were used to truly pull an audience out of the despair of the 1930s into a world where anything can happen, where being a nice person is all you need to succeed. While the fact that the country was in the middle of the Depression was not completely ignored, an overly optimistic view on life was taken to counter the despair of everyday life.There were many points in It Happened One Night where the true state of the country was indicated. Homeless people hitching rides on trains seemed perfectly normal. Rather than regard them with apprehension and pity, you smile and wave at them. Another example is the hostile reaction proprietor Zeke's wife had to the fact that her husband had let Peter and Ellie stay the night with promises of being paid. Upon seeing Peter and Ellie's car missing, they rush to the cottage to see if Peter and Ellie are still there. They cannot afford freeloaders.In another scene, a child's mother has passed out from hunger, because they have no money to buy food. Peter and Ellie have nearly depleted their funds, but decide that the mother and child need money more than they do and give some to them.Despite these instances, the movie was altogether cheerful in its depiction of the world. In the throes of the stock market crash, this movie signaled the birth of the screwball comedy. At a time when the country needed release, they could find that release and laughter in movies like It Happened One Night. Audiences were amused by scenes in the film, such as the segment in which Peter teaches Ellie how to dunk a donut. Or, when forced to share a room, Peter puts a blanket between his and Ellie's beds and calls it the `wall of Jericho,' which is revisited when the walls of Jericho come tumbling down after Peter and Ellie's marriage. Probably the most famous scene in the film is the hitchhiking sequence, which features Peter standing by the roadside trying to thumb a ride unsuccessfully, finally giving up after more than a dozen cars speed by without paying any heed to his attempts. After he gives up, beaten, Ellie simply lifts her skirt above her knee. The first car that passes stops, as we see extreme close-ups of a foot slamming down on the brakes and a hand applying the hand brake.A master in his profession, Capra left his mark on the films he directed. With an almost childlike cheerfulness, he maintains a sense of dignity and class. The viewer is left with a feeling of hope for humankind, even if its only that a person's ideals could be used to make such a film. Capra's films are still regarded as masterpieces. It Happened One Night arguably remains to this day unparalleled in screwball comedies. It was one of many movies made during the Depression, a sometimes sad and even lonely time in our history. It gave its audience a chance to escape and forget their troubles for a few moments in time.9 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hero As Comedian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his autobiography, The Name's Above the Title, Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters, the hero, the heroine, the comedian, and the villain.What Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films, the characters of hero and comedian are combined. Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself, especially with that system all her own. But in doing what he did for Clark Gable's character, Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy, the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the mold.Capra's autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie. Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio, along the lines of Republic or Monogram. As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it. Capra also had a stroke of good luck. Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B. Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars, Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable. The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM. In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day, drunk as a skunk, is priceless. Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldn't have been more cooperative.At some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something. He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day. So the publicity drums were beat.The rest as they say is history. It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios. And it set the standard for screwball comedy.The film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert. They're together for most of the film so if it doesn't click between the two of them, you have people walking out in droves. Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount, ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond. Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM. It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent, a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in. Gable and Colbert did only one other film together, Boom Town for MGM. You can't get much more different than those two films. Boom Town had a huge MGM budget, Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well, and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein. It's also a great film, but it's not a classic like It Happened One Night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant, Funny Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pleasant, funny classic that shows it age only slightly, and that has a lot of scenes you can look forward to each time that you see it. Gable and Colbert each get roles that are nicely suited to them, and are well-remembered for their performances. The supporting cast also rounds out the picture with some good character acting.The cross-country trip on the bus and via other assorted methods is fun to watch, with several nice vignettes that complement the main story line. (The atmosphere on the long bus trip is done especially well.) The plot is of course not meant to be taken too seriously in itself, but it comes in very handy for setting up good characters and comedy.It all comes across as effortlessly entertaining romantic comedy, with some classic scenes and characters you learn to care for in spite of their mistakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It happened one night...I fell in love with this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IHON rightly earns it's place as one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history. A pioneer of the screwball comedy genre, it holds up very well 71 years after it was made.It's a classic tale of the battle of sexes- something that is still so relevant today. We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), who jumps ship from her father's yacht (literally!) in Florida after an argument with said father (played by Walter Connolly) over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley (Jameson Thomas) without her father's consent. Ellie is on a mission- to get to New York to King Westley. But how will she do it? That's how Peter Warne (played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable) comes into the story. Recently fired from his newspaper job, Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York, and, realizing who she is (Her story is all over the news, after all!), offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story- to win him back his job. And so the fun begins. Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances. The trip isn't a smooth one- and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie, which gives us great scenes such as the doughnut-dunking lesson, Walls Of Jericho and the now-classic hitchhiking scene. The humour is still fresh and fast-paced over 70 years later. Oops, I almost forgot the classic 'no undershirt scene' where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses, to reveal (shock horror!) no undershirt, but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of men's undershirts, which dropped dramatically after the film's release (One of the first examples of product placement in film). Great supporting characters, particularly the scene-stealing Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns). Of course it has it's faults- all early talkies do. But any faults are outweighed by the great story. Technically, it was well-made for it's time.IHON won 5 Oscars- Best Picture, Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actress and Best Actor for Colbert and Gable and Best Adaptation. It deserved all of them. Funnily enough, both Colbert and Gable didn&amp;#8217;t want any part in the film at first- I bet they changed their viewpoint after the surprise success and the prestigious Academy Awards they gained for it. It's been said that a number of Disney characters like Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam and Pepe LePew were inspired by characters in this film. A classic, a must-see, a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies in history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my college film class we had begun watching "It happened one night". I was laughing my head off. But of course my professor stops the movie right when it was getting good. After that, I wanted to see this movie so badly. My father lucky enough had the movie. I watched it and it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Clark Gable is histerical. He really does a great job in the film. I always did prefer the old comedies to today. Do you blame me? If you watch the flick, you will enjoy it. This is one of the first romantic comedies. It'll send all the others to the back of the bus. I would higly recommend this movie. It's a classic.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic Comedy that sweeps the first year of the Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie a few times over the year and have just recently viewed it again twice on the DVD version. This is a highly recommended movie on several levels. First, it has to be seen because it won multiple academy awards during 1934. It has won at least best actor, best actress and best director. So it should be seen just for it's historical significance if you are into movies as an art form. However, if you are just looking for entertainment then it is simply a great classic romantic comedy. The set up is that Ellie (Claudette Colbert) is a rich, spoiled, independent woman who is running away from her father (in Florida) to join her husband (not quite a complete marriage) in New York City. She meets Peter (Clark Gable) on the bus who is a down &amp; out reporter looking for a big story. They join forces in that he will help her to get to New York for an exclusive on her story. In essence it is the bratty socialite vs the hard nosed -know it all reporter - Can they achieve true love? Just watch the movie and figure it out for yourself.. There is the classical scene regarding the battle of the sexes which involves hitchhiking. There is some dated material because the movie was made in the 30's about the 30's. This may be both good and bad as a viewing experience. Gable is a bit too shallow as a desirable character. He lacks the sensitivity of a guy that would be in a modern romantic comedy. However, his portrayal of Peter is likely typical for the ideal man of the era in that he attempted to be competent and in charge at all times (the know it all guy). The character comes across as too simplistic by today's standards. However, when he gets the feedback on his rough edges from Ellie he shows his nice guy side. Claudette Colbert is great in this movie she had opportunities to display her acting craft as she responded to different situations. The scene in which she and Gable pretended to be basically 'white trash' was very funny. Her getting the best actress award is very evident even without having to see the performances of her rivalries for the Oscar in 1934. Overall this movie is rated a 9.0 and is highly recommended. A viewer may avoid older movies because they lack dept; however, hang in for this one. Once the screen chemistry starts between Colbert and Gable (their first scene together) the rest of the picture is just a joyride of entertainment in watching these two work their magic for the camera. Enjoy this movie it should be an awesome experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This classic never loses its magic! Romance, warmth &amp; humor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sweet comedy never loses its appeal. Claudette Colbert is a spoiled young girl who meets a wordly, attractive newspaper reporter (Clark Gable). In the beginning, she treats him like a servant, but he never knuckles under to this behavior. The interaction between these two is very romantic and humorous. It is the classic portrayal of what may be called "sexual tension." He takes care of her - does not take advantage of her - but makes her realize that her wealthy background cannot carry her through as a human being, she has to earn his respect by treating him with respect. There is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike, and their "breakfast" is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find. As Gable stands at the edge of the road and Colbert is perched atop a wooden fence, his wisecracking posture is said to be the inspiration for the beloved cartoon character Bugs Bunny. This is a must-see for every one who loves old movies, and entertaining for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travel back in time, to the days when romantic comedies had not yet evolved into chick flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was inspired to think of other films with completely mystifying titles. `The Phantom Menace', obviously. Also: `The Shop Around the Corner' (around the corner from WHERE?), `The Empire Strikes Back' (it doesn't), `The Living Daylights', `True Lies', `Batman Forever', `Species', `The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp' ... if anyone has any more suggestions, please send them to me.In this case, it happens over several nights, and I'm not sure which particular night is being referred to. Probably one of the candidate nights is less unobvious than the rest; so I guess the title isn't COMPLETELY mystifying. But actually, Capra gives us the feeling that everything is up in the air. Everyone knows that the hero and heroine of romantic comedies are bound to get hitched in the end - in most cases it's simply a question of staying awake. But Capra makes us feel the contingency of it all. I, for one, was convinced that right up until the final moment, it could have gone either way. How did Capra manage this? Was it because he was a complete innocent; or was it because he was remarkably sophisticated? I don't suppose it matters: it's results that count.I'm glad to see very little mention among the comments about the sexism of it all. The characters have life; their words have life; and if such art as this could only be produced by a sexist society, it's almost worth creating a sexist society (and then dismantling it), in order to get the art. In modern romances I get the feeling that the writers are wearily writing `feisty' lines for the heroine in an attempt to fool feminists, who, by and large, aren't so easily fooled. Claudette Colbert isn't feisty. When she DOES assert her independence, she means it.(And, of course, when Clark Gable asserts his dominance, HE means it. You don't get sincerity like this these days.)Anyway, the ideology of a film, if there is one, is always beside the point, except inasmuch as the ideology is AESTHETICALLY attractive or unattractive. This is an attractive film. Two real individuals, a real story, some misunderstanding but no tiresome or pointless misunderstanding, constant wit - and, as I expressed amazement at earlier, constant suspense. And if THAT isn't enough to get you to watch it, note that it was released in 1934. The Hayes code didn't come into effect until 1935. Not a moment too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Triumphs (and the Wall of Jericho Falls)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Miami, the spoiled socialite Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is trapped in the yacht of her controller father, the Wall Street banker Andrews (Walter Connolly), who has just annulled her secret marriage with the snobbish aviator King Westley (Jameson Thomas). Out of the blue, Ellie jumps overboard and swims to the shore. Andrews hires a detective agency to find her and offers a 10,000 dollars reward for any information about his daughter. But Ellie pawns her watch, buys some clothing and a bus ticket to New York to meet her lover. She seats side- by-side with the cynical reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable). However, when a thief steals her purse with her money in a bus stop and Ellie does not report to the police, Peter recognizes and blackmails Ellie, asking her to travel together with him. He promises to protect her and in return he would write her adventure to meet King Westley. Along their journey, Ellie falls in love for Peter; but when he vanishes from the motel where they are lodged and contacts her father later, she believes he was only interested in the reward. In the end, love triumphs and the wall of Jericho falls. "It Happened One Night" is another delightful and charming romantic comedy of Frank Capra. The romance of a cynical reporter with a spoiled young woman is very funny despite being naive and dated, with witty dialogs, and the chemistry between Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable is marvelous. The cinematography in black and white is wonderful with magnificent use of lighting to highlight the lead couple. Last time I saw this classic was on 29 January 2003 and this is the third time that I watch this film, now on DVD from Columbia Distributor, and I highly recommend it as one of the best romantic comedies ever. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Aconteceu Naquela Noite" ("It Happened that Night")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute romantic comedy that was a pioneer of its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Happened One Night is one of those films that is so classic, and on so many `must-see' lists that I actually assumed that I had seen it at one time or another. It wasn't until I actually looked into the film when I in fact realized I hadn't.The first film to sweep the major categories in an Oscar ceremony, It Happened One Night spins the story of a young spoiled heiress (Colbert) who marries a shallow, yet dashing aviator. She is then swept off by her father who takes her on a cruise; convinced that time away from each other will cure her infatuation. Instead, she escapes by jumping out of the boat and swimming to shore where she begins her journey from Miami to New York, where her husband awaits. The film quickly turns into an `on the road' flick at this point when she meets up with Clark Gable, a down on his luck reporter who offers to help her for the exclusive rights to her story. Mayhem inevitably ensues as one thing after another goes wrong during their adventure.I'm a little hesitant to completely agree with the general assessment that It Happened One Night is a screwball comedy. Of course, there were certain moments that were hilarious and overdone (the scene when Gable and Colbert pose as husband and wife to share a cabin for the night is absolutely rich) but the majority of the remaining film is clever romantic comedy with fairly even performances by the principles. Perhaps there is a sliding scale for screwball comedies, with It Happened One Night being a two and a film that I feel personifies the genre, Bringing up Baby, as a five.Whatever its classification, It Happened One Night is a charming film that backs up its merit as a multiple Oscar winner. It is one of those films that may not be completely profound or deep, but is important nonetheless if anything, for its place in film history.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I want to see what love looks like when it's triumphant. I haven't had a good laugh in a week."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1934, Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night' ushered in a new era of Hollywood film-making ? the screwball comedy ? and made Academy Award history in the process. It became the first film to be awarded the top five awards on the night (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), a feat that remained unequaled until 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)' and 'The Silence of the Lambs (1991).' As I watch more of his films, Frank Capra is fast becoming one of my most respected directors, with such classics as 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' and 'It's a Wonderful Life' ranking among my favourites of all time. This screwball comedy, however, posed a certain problem, since I've never been a huge fan of the sub-genre. Whilst I had enjoyed such films as 'My Man Godfrey' and 'His Girl Friday,' they hadn't really offered anything other than comedy. This means that they did a good job of making us laugh, but never really inspired any other emotions ? which isn't necessarily a handicap, but doesn't appeal to my tastes.Happily, I'm able to announce that 'It Happened One Night' did surpass my expectations, and I found it to be a wonderfully-enjoyable, very touching romantic comedy. The first half had left me feeling a bit uncertain, since it reminded me of just about every other 1930s comedy I'd seen, but then Frank Capra did what Frank Capra does best: he put a lot of heart into the film. After building towards a perfect fairytale ending, Capra suddenly snatches it away, slowly but surely stacking the odds against our hero. However, the director has never been one to leave us with a downbeat ending, and, when love finally prevails, it feels twice as triumphant. Of course, crucial to the film's success are the two lead performers: Claudette Colbert and Clarke Gable, playing characters of completely polar characters. As story runs its course, we slowly watch their relationship transform from completely dislike to acceptance to romance, and it never feels forced or artificial (despite a reportedly tense atmosphere onset).The plot of the film was based on the story, "The Night Bus," by Samuel Hopkins Adams. Ellie Andrews (Colbert) is the arrogant, spoilt heiress of a wealthy father (Walter Connolly). After she marries the rich but unprincipled King Westley (Jameson Thomas) against her father's will, Ellie strikes off to New York to be with the man she loves, and her desperate father launches a state-wide attempt to retrieve her. It is on a night bus that Ellie strikes up a frictional relationship with fired journalist Peter Warne (Gable), whose only initial interest in the stranded girl is a good newspaper story. Probably one of the best "road movies" ever made, 'It Happened One Night' also has a few twists in the usual formula which have guaranteed its enduring stature. For example, Ellie's father is revealed not to be an evil overbearing demon, but is, in fact, shown to be a very kind, reasonable and loving man, who is only trying to guarantee the best for his daughter by ensuring that she marries somebody with principles (King Westley later gives up the girl without a fuss, compensated by a tidy sum of money).Much to my surprise, I'd never seen a film starring Clarke Gable before, but he really was a revelation. Never taking any situation too seriously, and delivering every line with confidence and a hint of amusement, Gable is the laid-back every-man that the audience can relate to, a stark contrast to Colbert's conceited and ungrateful upper-class rich girl. My favourite scene took place after the night bus accidentally ran off the road, with the shifty passenger Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns) threatening to reveal Ellie's true identity. Fearing that his exclusive story could leak into other hands, Peter Warne declares himself to be the gangster who kidnapped Ellie, threatens to harm Shapeley's family and then chases him into the night. Interestingly, I followed up my viewing of this film with a 1939 Lux Radio Theater broadcast of the story, introduced by Cecille B. DeMille and once again starring Gable and Colbert. This recording can be found, if you're lucky, as a special feature on the 'It Happened One Night' DVD, and it's well worth a listen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Runaway Heiress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (Columbia, 1934), directed by Frank Capra, based on a short story "Night Bus" by Samuel Hopkins Adams, ranks one of the best known and popular romantic comedies from the 1930s, thanks to the star chemistry of Clark Gable (on loan from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) and Claudette Colbert (on loan from Paramount), with fine direction by Frank Capra, witty screenplay by Robert Risken, and for being the very first motion picture to win all five major Academy Awards, including Best Actor (Gable); Best Actress (Colbert); Best Director (Capra); Best Screenplay and Best Picture. This might have been an "upset" in 1934, considering other top-rated films and performances of the year, but who would have imagined IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT to still be as entertaining today as it was back in 1934?This now well-known plot that's been remade twice by Columbia as EVE KNEW HER APPLES (1945) with Ann Miller and William Wright; and YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT (1956) with June Allyson and Jack Lemmon, opens in a yacht in Miami where Ellen "Ellie" Andrews (Claudette Colbert), spoiled daughter of a millionaire Wall Street banker, Alexander Andrews (Walter Connolly), who disapproves of her recent marriage to aviator King Westley (Jameson Thomas), making arrangements on having it annulled. Following a heated argument with her father, Ellie runs from her state room, jumps overboard and swims to shore. Eluding her father's hired detectives, Ellie, acquiring new clothes, purchases a night bus ticket bound for New York City where she plans to meet Westley. While on board, Ellen encounters Peter Warne (Clark Gable), a hot-headed reporter recently fired by his editor, Joe Gordon (Charles C. Wilson). With both disliking each other immensely, Warne, having discovered the "spoiled brat's" identity, becomes her constant traveling companion in order to get an exclusive story and his job back. Hours before reaching New York and taking a rest stop in an auto camp, misunderstandings occur as Ellen awakens to find both Peter and the car gone.A simple story playing like an overlong "B" movie, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a memorable bus trip of so many classic scenes that have been imitated by others but never duplicated. Highlights include the "Walls of Jericho" where Peter and Ellen share a room in auto camps where a blanket is tossed over a rope that separates the couple as they sleep for the night; Peter demonstrating to Ellen on how a man undresses, particularly one in which he removes his shirt to no undershirt underneath; Peter's correct method of dunking a dough-nut into a cup of coffee; and the classic hitchhiking scene where Peter fails to attract cars while Ellen comes up with a method all her own.Although IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is essentially a Claudette Colbert movie from start to finish (there's no secondary female character, quite rare for its time). Due to the strength of Gable's performance, this has been hailed to be his best comedic role. Gable's character is hot-headed and forceful, living by a moral code. Although he shares a cabin with a married woman, that's all he does. He even tells Colbert's Ellie when she asks if she'll ever see him again, he replies, "I make it a policy not to run around with married women." And when he's hungry, he takes a carrot from a farm rather than going through the method of panhandling. This is Gable, a role model. Director Frank Capra, whose subject matter is usually on people, captures the many extras, especially those on the bus and auto camps, to make them appear as important as leading players. Roscoe Karns is equally memorable, "believe you me!" as the gabby bus passenger, Oscar Shapeley from Orange, New Jersey; Ward Bond as the tough talking bus driver; the meek Arthur Hoyt and the nosy/ domineering Blanche Frederici as the auto camp owners; Georgie Breakston the poor boy traveling on the bus with his mother (Claire McDowell); along with other passengers gathered together and singing "The Man on the Flying Trapeze," to a player of a snoring fat and bald man who rests his head on Colbert's shoulder. During it's entire 106 minutes, there's seldom any underscoring. As for the costumes, with the exception of the final 15 minutes, both Gable and Colbert use the same clothing through most of their trip.While Gable and Colbert had challenging roles in their careers, plus their reunion in MGM's large-scale BOOM TOWN (1940), it's amazing how this likable little comedy was the only one to honor them Academy Awards. There's a scene where I feel Gable earned his statuette, the one where he tells Ellen the type of girl he would like to someday marry, saying that those kind of women don't exist anymore. Gable says this with frankness and sincerity. Colbert on the other hand earned hers from that same scene as she she listens and looks on lovingly at Gable with tears flowing down her cheek, coming to realize it happened one night.IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT not only became a perennial favorite on late night television during the 1960s and 70s, but on cable TV as well, ranging from the Disney Channel (1980s), American Movie Classics (prior to 2001) to Turner Classic Movies, and availability on video cassette and finally DVD. While IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT has aged in appearance, it's still timely screen entertainment. There'll never be another film like this again. (***1/2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Comedy Starting One Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capra's 'It Happened One Night' is a fascinatingly shot romantic comedy. It has the 30's feel but at the same time I am surprised that such skill was used in the making of this movie during the 1930s. The camera-work is brilliant as it brings out both the spatial feel and the crowdiness. the long shots are effective and I liked how the scenes change in a sideways 'flip' mode. There's always something about the driving scenes of old classics that amuse me. Clearly the background was shot separately and then projected on to a screen during the shooting of the film while in the foreground the actors are just seated in a car pretending to drive. While the background scene changes, the viewer keeps tuned to the wonderful dialogue between the actors. Needless to add, the film's got fantastic dialogue.Capra also brilliantly gives us a glimpse of the 30's American society, especially focusing on gender and class status. The difference between the upper class rich people and the common ordinary man is shown by their use of language and their non-verbal behaviour. Yet, in a way the film is also ahead of its time. Ellie isn't just some clichéd damsel of the 30s. She is strong-minded, stubborn and smart (albeit slightly naive). She is one who fights for what she wants rather than giving in easily. Perhaps this is also one quality of hers that attracts Peter but at the same time their funny quarrels also indicate that there is a an equality in gender status (which was something women were struggling with in those days).The characters are very well etched. Peter and Ellie were a lot of fun but I also liked how Alexander Andrews (played excellently by Walter Connolly) was written as the rich father who's got all the money but all he wants for his daughter is her happiness. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are great together as they match wits and display warm chemistry.'It Happened One Night' has become an instant favourite, one that I definitely plan to revisit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter, a washed up journalist, accidentally bumps into Ellen Andrews, a spoiled daughter of a rich guy from whom she ran away, on a bus while taking a trip to New York. He offers to help her hide from her dad if she agrees to sell her story only to him. But on their way to New York they fall in love...There are many old classic film that are excellent but leave you with a "Yeah, great...but I expected something else" feeling. But "It happened one night" is one of those films that leaves you amazed without any reservations. I was neither a Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert or a Frank Capra fan before I saw this road movie, which won 5 Oscars, but after I did I became of fan of them for life! The story here is so damn simple that you may at first think that everyone could be able to pull it of, but when you think about it you will realize that at the same time it's actually very clever, carefully written and touching.------------- Take this scene for instance. Ellen is looking in front of herself while a burglar steals her luggage behind her back. She doesn't notice anything but Peter sees this and runs after the burglar. Ellen, still not turning around, is wondering where he is running of to. After a while Peter, all tired, returns and says: "He got away...!" And Ellen not knowing what's going on replies: "I don't know what you are talking about!" That's a perfect example how someone is trying to be a gentleman and ends up as a fool. But this is actually a film more touching than funny. After a while the spoiled Ellen shows her gentle side and realizes that she loves Peter. She says this to her father in tears because she thinks that Peter doesn't love her. So incredibly magical and yet so simple. It's incredibly high grade of 9/10 on the site rotten-tomatoes.com is justified. Too bad almost all TV stations are keeping this jewel of air for decades! No wonder my generation is trapped in a vicious circle of violence, drugs and alcohol. They never got a glimpse of such previous generations with a soul and such raw, honest and touching beauty like "It happened one night" which exceeds the human mind.Grade: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedy ever produced by Hollywood??.!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a true call that they don't make the movies as they used to. There are very less movies coming near to the brilliance of "It Happened One Night". This movie is about a rich brat running from her home to get married with her lover, accompanied with struggling free lancer reporter in her journey. And in the journey they fall for each other. The romance building between two of them is nicely depicted and the blend of Peter Warne (Gables) arrogant personality gives it a nice stir. The story of the movie is very interesting and the comic attribute added by both Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is sufficed to make anyone laugh. The perfect direction from the master of his domain Frank Capra takes the movie on highest level; because of this it's the first movie to be honored with all major five Oscars (Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Movie, Best Director and Best Screenplay).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Romance, Even If Implausible (Aren't They All?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A spoiled heiress (Claudette Colbert), running away from her family, is helped by a man (Clark Gable) who is actually a reporter looking for a story.In this film "a pampered socialite tries to get out from under her father's thumb, and falls in love with a roguish reporter", which, you know, is something that happens when spoiled daughters discover that they want to live like common people and do what common people do (like go to supermarkets).The film was the first to win all five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay), a feat that would not be matched until "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (1975) and later by "The Silence of the Lambs" (1991). And it is not really surprising when you see it... besides, it is Clark Gable and Frank Capra.So, this might not be as outright funny as other films, and even as far as screwball comedies go, it sort of lags behind "The Awful Truth" with Cary Grant. But Clark Gable has a debonair charm to him... from the very beginning he has that attitude about him that women mysteriously love. I am a little confused about the laid-back approach to marriage and annulment, but this is a romance, and that is not uncommon... if anything, it shows how fickle the socialite is.Overall, a very enjoyable film. Not my favorite of the era, but well worth a watch or two. And heck, if such a film can inspire the creation of Bugs Bunny and entertain Joseph Stalin... can it be so bad?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining movie but hardly Capra's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry to say but this movie is just a bit too overrated. Especially Capra's directing is disappointing, since it's done in such an extremely old fashioned manner for 1934 standards. Surprisingly enough he still won an Oscar for his directing of this movie though.It's definitely an entertaining enough movie to watch. These type of movies were the romantic comedies of the '30's, the sort of Cameron Diaz and Asthon Kutcher flicks of their time, only done with more class and better actors involved. Nevertheless it's just as clichéd and predictable though. Dozens of these type of movies got made in the '30's and quite frankly I just can't see what it is that makes this movie a better one than any of them.It's a boy meets girl story and of course they can't get along at first but slowly begin to like each other better and more. What makes this movie its story more special is its adventurous elements being thrown in. It's a movie that involves lots of traveling and therefor also many different characters, which mainly gives the movie its adventurous feeling, without ever really getting a big adventure.More fireworks was to be expected, especially from Frank Capra's directing. It's just too formulaic and at times even just plain poor. It's way too old fashioned for 1934 and it's one of those typical movies that features long close-ups for the dramatic moments. It's a very static made film, as if it was just a job that had to be done and no real passion was thrown into it.As could be expected, the acting is still great though, from Clark Gable and the much more unknown Claudette Colbert. They were good together and luckily shared some good chemistry, which made the movie all the more fun to watch. This was actually the movie that earned Clark Gable his only Oscar out of his career. Ironicly enough non of the actors really enjoyed starring in this movie and also lots of well known actor turned the script down and Claudette Colbert, who also received an Oscar for her role in this movie, even didn't took the trouble to attend the award ceremony at first, until hearing upon her win.Yes, I know I'm making the movie sound horrible, which it really isn't. It's basically a movie I enjoyed watching but is no way worthy of this currently high rating on here. There are way better genre movies and Capra movies, with a much lower rating on here though. There are better and more interesting Capra movies to watch out there, which does not mean that this movie is an horrible one though.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clean Sweep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Consider this, "It Happened One Night" was made in 1933 which gives it the distinction 70+ years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences. And most of the runner-ups for oldest film are 1930's screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the 1934 Academy Awards. The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant. The main reason "It Happened One Night" worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable, who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capra's direction. Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production. Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut. Cohn told Capra: "That French broad likes money" and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $50,000 (double her usual price) and a guarantee that production would only last 28 days. Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B. Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this film.The film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra, a great script that would play well with small town America, and a good ensemble of supporting talent. The story concerns a spoiled young heiress (Colbert) trying to escape the control of her father (nicely played by Walter Connelly). Dodging her father's private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter (Gable) who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story. Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other (brainless brat and obnoxious bully) as an undisclosed affection develops. On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each other.While the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love (one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love), Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film. As another reviewer has written: "Far from lovey-dovey, the dialogue is witty, sharp and occasionally heartless. We may know the outcome, but the road to get there is paved with arguments, anger and misunderstandings. It's also clever, funny and a bit risqué (for 1934)" . During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult, motivated by a desire to improve her companion's opinion of her. Gable shows real star presence, playing a confident, charming, and resourceful gentleman. By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partner.After the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director Oscar.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting "Time Travel" to an era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Background to that '30s era: this 1934 film is often called the first (of the many following) in the 'screwball comedy' genre; it came out in the worst of the Great Depression (US unemployment in 1928 was 2.9%, by 1933 it hit 25%; millions were hungry and desperate, leading to some antagonisms between economic classes). This was also a time when women's roles were changing in the US: the 'women's suffrage' movement gained women the right to vote in 1920 (19th Amendment), more equality in decision-making, more freedom in dress, gender &amp; sexual roles (e.g., '20s 'Flappers'). "Screwball comedies" capitalized and fed on those changes: they typically "feature farcical situations, a combination of slap-stick with fast-paced repartee and show struggles between" (central characters of different) "economic classes. They also generally feature a self-confident and often stubborn central female protagonist and a plot involving courtship and marriage or remarriage" ("quotes" from Wikipedia).A young 30's Gable plays "Peter," a drinking, hard boiled newspaper reporter just fired from his job when he accidentally meets the young 20's "Ellie" (a young 30's Colbert) who's increasingly rebelled against the escalating but failing attempts of her upper class, super-rich father to control her. He tries to keep her on his Florida yacht while arranging to annul Ellie's impulsive marriage to a man (whom her father recognizes but Ellie doesn't as mainly interested in her wealth). But Ellie escapes her father's captivity and sets off to NYC to be reunited with her new spouse. On her way, she meets Gable who's initially interested in helping her because it'll lead to his scoop of a newspaper story (and reinstatement of his job). But then--romance eventually, gradually, starts to happen between you know who.My rating: 6 of 10 I found this interesting as a time-traveling experience--early '30s bus rides, clothes, roles, attitudes, etc.-- but all the people seemed to me to be too much caricatures and not enough real characters. (However, many people on IMDb's "Discussion Board" say the more often they've seen this film, the more highly they value it--many saying it's among their most favorite films of all--so maybe familiarity breeds appreciation?) FWIW: Neither Gable nor Colbert wanted to be in this film; MGM "loaned" them to Columbia Pictures, then a 2nd rate movie company, for this movie as punishment for each being too "uppity" and/or violating MGM policies. But, after this film gained such outstanding success (lifting Columbia's rank to among the majors) and substantially helped both Gable's &amp; Colbert's careers, they came to appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello Miss!! Have You Met My Testosterone Driven Desires?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was truly revolutionary when it hit the silver screen! "It Happened One Night" swept all four major academy awards back in 1934!! Best Actress (Claudette Colbert) Best Actor (Clark Gable) Best Director (Frank Capra) and, of course, BEST PICTURE!! Why was this movie considered so promiscuous and avant garde? Basically because of all the covert innuendos, and the lewd insinuations which gave every indication that, even back then, sex was not just for pro-creation purposes!! When dealing with the demons inside of your typical red blooded American male..What exactly was it that they had to do to assuage their consciences anyway? Now presides the proverbial instance of a "gentleman" having his cake and eating it too. This is not really possible!! Not for a "gentleman" anyway! The classic scene in this movie was predicated on Claudette Cobert's actions being of her own volition.. The necessary bed sheet in the most classic scene in "It Happened One Night" was construed as a case whereby Clark Gable knew the repercussions of such an ensuing fate without the presence of this symbolic divisiveness!! This film definitely delves into the euphemisms which imply that something had to be done to quell such a precariously enticing and comfortably volatile situation!! Without overt barricades, it would be something other than spiritual growth that Clark Gable would have to worry about!! This film broke ground on the wilder side of male's hormonal nature!! The reciprocating movie audience had a thorough comprehension of what the potential chicanery was which loomed on the horizon! Clark Gable's wiles were emerging and ready to surface!! AFI has listed this as one of the top 100 films ever made in the history of the American cinema. This does not surprise me, the issue of carnal desires always evoked a sordid curiosity with the average movie viewer!! The innocence of maverick movie making entertained the movie audience with this film's innocuous approach!! Being candid about the whole situation, it stands to reason that chivalry has to contend with the formidable foes that are related to the innate and lecherous desires of lonely men!! Frank Capra directs this film, and it goes without saying that Capra is a remarkable director... His list of outstanding movies is endless! "It's A Wonderful Life" gets the star lighted accolade of being his stellar mantel piece trophy!! The acting in the film "It Happened One Night" was fantastic, and the entertaining double entendre to everything made this film very enjoyable!! By today's standards, of course, this film would not be considered sexually suggestive in any substantial manner whatsoever. However, given the fact that this film was made in 1934, "It Happened One Night" became the harbinger of things to come with the advent of depicting how sexual indiscretion can proliferate once Pandora's's box is opened!! Wonderful movie!! The talent in this film is utterly astounding!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE classic screwball comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Moviegoers in 1934 started their evening with a Fox Movietone newsreel, pictures of ex-stockbrokers selling apples on New York street corners, of that new president named Roosevelt and his plans for economic recovery, and maybe footage of a rising German leader named Hitler at the Nuremberg rally. Then, with bad news behind them, they'd tuck into a masterpiece of comic fluff titled `It Happened One Night.' Director Frank Capra's movie practically invented screwball comedy, movies that helped America take its mind off the ongoing worldwide economic depression. Nobody goes to movies to get depressed, except maybe fans of Ingmar Bergman films. And few moviegoers expect movies they pay to see to mirror problems they go to the movies to escape from. During the Depression, Hollywood responded to this box office need in comedies about the rich, the eccentric, about nearly anybody who wasn't broke or unemployed or fleeing from the dust that covered Oklahoma. Novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald said, `The rich are very different from you and me.' He was talking about the Jazz Age Gatsbys he wrote about. If he were talking about Hollywood, he would have added, `and they're funnier.' Wealth creates freedom, a precious commodity in Depression America. The screwball comedy focuses on characters, often women, with enough cash reserves (usually from a rich father or relative) to behave as if the world was still theirs to command. Command, comedy, comeuppance ? three words that define the movement of films like `It Happened One Night.' The rich aren't punished for being rich. Rather, the rich heroine learns true values and wins love through her unexpected connection with a man who exposes her to another side of life. Ellen Andrews (Claudette Colbert), daughter of a Wall Street tycoon, never descends as far as Ma Joad's rattletrap Ford. When she flees her father's yacht to join a weasly playboy she married, Capra, his writers, and comic fate put her on a bus with Peter Warne (Clark Gable)``, a down and out reporter. Sniffing a story (when he isn't smelling booze), Warne shepherds her towards New York. Stops along the way provide opportunities for Andrews to share the joys of people who can still sing joyfully without a dime in their pockets and, by the way, fall in love with Warne. Capra trowels on sentiment and sexual innuendo in famous scenes such as an overnight interlude in a motel cabin in which Warne ropes up a blanket between his bed and hers to create privacy. The `Walls of Jericho,' as he calls it, thinly preserve proprieties moviegoers (and the censors) expected in 1934. Naturally, this is too good a gag to let go after one scene, and when the walls fall down, the movie ends. `It Happened One Night' swept the Oscars and in 1993 was selected for the National Film Registry. The movie is a masterpiece of comic casting. Colbert, with her delicate looks, had a voice that could step down an octave into comic dialogue. Gable, then emerging as a Hollywood hunk, growled his lines but showed box office boffo in the Jericho scene when he explains how a man undresses for bed, peels off his shirt, and reveals a bare chest underneath. Sales of undershirts reportedly dropped for the next few years. Screwball comedy took many forms. The conflict between wealth and poverty almost always shadowed the comic plot, but within limits. Nobody seeking a nickel's worth of escape from American grimness was paying to watch real poverty. What moviegoers wanted, and what Hollywood provided, were comic fantasies that affirmed the essential rightness of what they were and what they believed even though darn little in their real lives affirmed these values. Thus, in comedy, sex is the ultimate comeuppance. Instinct and attraction pay no attention to class lines. The important point, in most of these screwball comedies, is that in a society where money makes a difference, sex (or love ? your choice) erases those differences. That may be a comic fantasy, but it held sway in theaters for years. The rich, though different, still have the itch, and that's what Capra and other filmmakers took to the bank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Capra with rough edges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Frank Capra films. Meet John Doe, It's a Wonderful life, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town are four of the greatest films ever made. Capra was not without his misses and downright lemons though. Arsenic and Old Lace and the abysmal Here Comes the Groom fall into these categories. It Happened one Night falls somewhere in between. Not an all out screwball comedy and not alot of social commentary, it is nevertheless a good light road picture, one of the first, and shouldn't fail to entertain. Innovative in it's way it was the forerunner to many more comedies in the later 30's which have become standards in the genre of Screwball. Capra here was still honing his technique for better films to come and it shows. At times the timing is off and the writing could use snappier one liners which hit the mark. Gable's funnier moments seem to be accidental or improvised -- and Colbert, though capable, just is no Carole Lombard or Rosalind Russell in her delivery. The thigh scene where she hails the passing car has been improved upon in several later comedies and even cartoons. Even though I like this picture, I feel it is another film which has received a higher rating over the years than it is due. Maybe it's just my love of more complex and polished comedic situations and dialogue in films like Bringing up Baby and His Girl Friday etc which I'm missing here. Cary Grant was, afterall, the definitive leading man in this type of picture. It Happened one Night is a good, not great evening at the movies. If you want to see Clark Gable really turning on the comedy charm check out Teacher's Pet with Doris Day which was made late in his career. I've yet to see a better Gable comedy than that. And if you're looking for another sweet road picture from yesteryear I recommend A Lady Takes a Chance with Jean Arthur and John Wayne, a light screwball comedy dappled with excellent performances. It's a shame it is long forgotten and hard to obtain on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It Happened One Night" happens to be my personal most favorite film ever. It was an adapted screenplay (by Robert Riskin), from the short story "Night Bus" and was directed by Frank Capra. With a simple story, plot, modest budget and a very short four week production schedule, this film goes a long way. Director Frank Capra obviously knew the story to tell and how to tell it. Some of the best films are made in a surprisingly short amount of time and on a modest budget. This film followed what Capra hoped would be a critical and box office success. The hopes were low for this film, even after securing stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert for the lead roles. Columbia Studios was not well respected at the time in Hollywood."It Happened One Night", 1934, had a relatively small budget for it's time: $325,000, of which Claudette Colbert asked for and received $50,000 for her role. A star receiving this much of the total film budget was unheard of during the 1930's. Released during America's Great Economic Depression, the film had excellent timing and proved to be a big critical and audience hit. All the right elements came together. It had a high quality comedic screenplay with believable characters in believable situations. A film where luck and chemistry came together, producing a film that exceeded the expectations of everyone involved, including its' director Frank Capra.The film comes across as light hearted and natural and with excellent timing and pacing. For it's time, this style of film was new. It would be one of the first of a new genre: screwball romantic comedy. Winner of five Academy Awards in all the major categories: Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor in a Leading Role and Actress in a Leading Role, was a first in Hollywood history. Only two other films have swept the five top Academy Awards: "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest", 1975 and "The Silence of the Lambs", 1991.Claudette Colbert was quoted as saying: "I just finished the worst film ever" on "It Happened One Night". She had no idea how well the film would be edited. The film editing here is subtle and sublime. Colbert and Gable achieved that rare and special screen chemistry in the film. Colbert's demand that the film needed to be produced in four weeks, because of her vacation schedule, actually created the lively pace of the film, working in it's favor. "It Happened One Night" is a fine example of a quality screenplay, some good luck and a lot of chemistry, all coming together, producing an enduring and enjoyable comedy classic.Clark Gable comes across as completely natural and very entertaining. The fun had while making this film shows partly in Gable's performance. Unfortunately, he would not be cast in a comedic role again, even after the big success of this film. The studio system of the time demanded stars remain type-casted. For Gable, that meant macho romantic leading action man.To me, "It Happened One Night" is the best ever romantic comedy film, a gold standard for it's genre. It's lost none of it's charm and naturalness since it's release in 1934. The look of the film dates it, but it still delivers it's original naturalness, charm, wittiness, timing, pacing and entertainment value. Just about a perfectly made film.</fullReview>

The story itself is basically a somewhat fluffy romantic comedy, not unlike hundreds of other romantic comedies that have been made over the years - it's fun, pleasant to watch and more or less predictable. There's no real dramatic tension; the only mystery is how the main characters are going to end up together rather than if they're going to end up together.Colbert nailed the part of Ellie Andrews - a spoiled and rich young woman who married a man she didn't really love just to get out of her father's controlling clutches. He essentially kidnaps her in a bid to end the marriage, and she escapes, trying to get from Miami to New York to be reunited with the guy. On the road she hooks up with Peter Warne (Gable), a down and out reporter who sees the story of Ellie's escape from her father as his way back into the newspaper business. Gable was fun and handled the part well, although to be honest I've seen him in better roles. Colbert and Gable had a pretty good chemistry together, and the supporting cast, while not overwhelming, held up their ends of the bargain well enough.A winner of multiple Academy Awards for 1934, this is a good movie, and certainly Gable and Colbert are the big attractions in it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Escapism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'It Happened One Night' must have put on a smile on Depression-weary audiences way back in 1934. Over 70 years later the magic still works, due to the terrific combination of Gable, Colbert and director Capra.But it almost didn't happen at all.Both Gable and Colbert tried desperately to get out of doing IHON. In fact, it appeared no-one in Hollywood wanted the parts of Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews. The tiny cash-strapped Columbia Studios was making this film with an untried comedy formula, it looked a certain flop. Pfft. How wrong everyone was. IHON swept the Academy Awards, taking home all of the Major Awards, including Best Actor and Actress Awards for Gable and Colbert. It established the screwball comedy genre, and the careers of it's two stars and director Capra.Why is it so good? Well, it has remained so fresh over the years that the laughs beat out almost every modern romantic comedy. It doesn't have to rely on smut or toilet humour to satisfy the audience, just a classic battle of the sexes we can all relate to. It's witty, the dialogue is snappy and fast-paced and the acting is near perfect. So let's have a closer look at the plot of this gem: Spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews (Colbert) has just defied her father by marrying society aviator King Westley. Her angry father wishes to keep Ellie away from her unsuitable husband and whisks her away on his private yacht. Daddy hasn't counted on Ellie's tenacity and will- fed up with the fact her childish hunger-strike is going nowhere she literally jumps overboard. When back on dry land she tries to make her way back to her husband by bus trip. A series of unfortunate events bring out of work newspaper reporter Peter Warne into her life. Cue the battle of the sexes! She has no money so she must accept his help; he knows who she is and to land the biggest scoop of his career he must deceive her whilst also helping her get back to Westley. But problems arise when the pair inevitably start to fall in love.This film is just the tonic that Depression audiences would have soaked up. The parodying of the rich is sublime, you can't help rooting for Gable who is a fine representative of the underdog. It also has it's risqué elements that I'm surprised got past the Hayes Code that had just been enforced. In particular, Gable's sexy lesson to a shocked yet interested Colbert on how a man undresses and the final 'breaking down the walls of Jericho' scene. When Gable undressed to reveal a bare chest with NO undershirt, sales dropped off dramatically. This would be one of the earliest examples of product placement in film.Some of my favourite scenes: the donut-dunking lesson, the piggy-back ride, Gable and Colbert's mock fight and the justifiably classic Hitchhiking scene. Colbert beats the cocky Gable at his own game by proving that SHE doesn't have to use her thumb to pull a ride. Instead she shows a bit of leg and stops a vehicle, much to the horror of Gable. Great stuff!This film almost single-handedly established the great screwball comedy. Colbert's Ellie is the ultimate screwy dame,paving the way for Lombard and Hepburn in the genre, with Gable's Peter a direct forerunner to the Fredrich March character in the screwball classic 'Nothing Sacred' (1937). This films holds a very important place in motion picture history.Best of all, it's so enjoyable.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Frank Capra's seminal screwball comedy, which won all five major Academy Awards for 1934, is still as breezy and beguiling today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Happened One Night is one of the most entertaining films that have ever been offered to the public. The story is about a runaway heiress (Claudette Colbert) who falls in love with a reporter (Clark Gable) who is chasing her across America.The film is a highly successful and influential romance, the first to use buses and motels as background and still come up sparkling. The palpable chemistry between Gable and Colbert set the template for romantic comedies and screwball comedies in the years that followed. In 1993, It Happened One Night was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been Super With Different Ending; Still A Top 'Classic'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie to sweep all the major Academy Awards, this film is still popular today. That's probably so because the dialog between the two stars of the picture - Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert - is just great. Those two make this fun to watch. I enjoyed it, however, much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones. It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect. The ending, too, was very weak. Over the last 20 minutes, the two stars go their separate ways (until the very end) and the story gets very stupid.The nice romance that had developed between the two seemed to have disintegrated when Gable left one early morning (for good intentions) but didn't tell Colbert. The latter thought Gable ran out on her. Hollywood, in films of the 1930s and 1940s, loved to have romances in which confusion abounded and everything was misinterpreted for the worst....until the happy ending when the truth somehow would surface. That same theme was in here, along with yet another trivialization of marriage, another common theme during the classic era. Colbert says it herself in one line, mentioning she doesn't care for this other guy, but what the heck, might as well get married, what's the difference? Huh?If the scriptwriters here would have just kept the "road" part of this film going longer - with Gable and Colbert trading barbs - it would have been super. Gable has the best lines an is the most fun to watch but Colbert can hold her own. She looks really pixie-ish and cute, although most of her closeups are done with a fuzzy lens, another habit of filmmakers of that era had with female stars. One of the film world's most famous scenes is in this movie: the hitch-hiking scene in which the cocky Cable explains the different ways of successful thumbing in order to get a ride....and gets nowhere while Colbert, on her first try, gets a car to stop immediately after she lifts up her skirt! That is still one of the great comedic scenes in movie history.Overall, this is still one of the best comedies of "The Golden Age," even with its faults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More entertaining than I remember . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra understood the strange avenues of the human heart like no other filmmaker, perhaps of our time as well. His films always had a deep understanding of human nature. His characters moved with the flow of real life. That human quality endeared his films to audiences and that's why they are still viewed today.That endearing quality probably came from his directing style. He didn't believe in sticking to the script. It has been reported that he showed up with only the framework of a scene, and then let his actors fill in the rest. "All I want is a master scene and I'll take care of the rest", he said "How to shoot it, how to keep the machinery out of the way, and how to focus attention on the actors at all times." I have always thought of Capra as a pioneer, not least because it was his genius that created It Happened One Night, a movie so popular and so far-reaching that it would inspire two entirely new film genres, the romantic comedy and the screwball comedy. It also helped to perfect the road picture from which some of the greatest films ever made have drawn inspiration; The Hope-Crosby Pictures, Sullivan's Travels, The Blues Brothers, Lost in America, Midnight Run, Rain Man, Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Almost Famous. What these films have in common is some form of familial or romantic attachment from the characters and/or a feeling of self discovery.It Happened One Night is responsible for all of these things. The story involves Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the spoiled daughter of a millionaire on the cusp of marrying an aviator named King Westley against the wishes of her father (Walter Connolly). He has the marriage annulled, and she is so put out that she so jumps off the side of her father's boat, swims to the shore and boards a bus from Miami to New York in hopes of catching up with her new husband. On the way, she runs into a world-wearing newspaperman, Peter Warne (Clark Gable) who hates her at first sight. He's a man of the world, who knows how to get around.Peter doesn't think much of her, he knows she's a babe in the woods and isn't shy about telling her so. She thinks he's brutish and cruel but she follows him because he can get her out of a jam, at one point he pretends to be her husband in order to fend off the advances of an overly-friendly traveler that she meets on the bus. He doesn't want to lose sight of Ellie because he believes that the story could be a major scoop.Peter and Ellie make amends long enough to get where they are going but their mutual connection is that don't have one. He knows how to keep her safe ? when she runs into the friendly traveler again, Peter pulls him aside and informs that man that he's a gangster who is about to pull a big job. The frightened man wants no part of any criminal activity and makes tracks. Ellie proves herself. During a stop on the side of the road, Peter unsuccessfully tries to show her how hitchhike by shaking his thumb in just the right way. A dozen cars pass without slowing down. Ellie decides to show him "a system all my own". Lifting her skirt, the next passing motorist gets a view of her shapely leg and the guy nearly runs himself into the ditch trying to stop.There are a dozen moments like that. One night when Peter and Ellie are forced to share the same cottage, he devises a way that two unmarried people (they're posing as married) can sleep in the same room and have privacy. He builds "The Walls of Jerico", a clothesline with heavy blankets thrown over it between their beds. What do you think the odds are that before the movie is over, the walls will come down? The comedy works in broad strokes, but the ever-present Capra-esqe quality of humanity and social commentary isn't quite as bold as it is in his later films. Peter and Ellie aren't interested in the social ills of their country until it crops up ? they both have a personal agenda to tend to. This movie was made five years into the depression but that event exists around the edges of the film. It only takes center stage once, during a scene in which Peter and Ellie give their last few dollars to a starving mother and child on the bus. There is a personal transition in Ellie's soul. What we come to realize about Ellie is that she's been given the spoils all her life and that this revolution ? the road trip in which she finds her sense of personal freedom.If there is a weakness in the film it may come at the moment when we are supposed to accept that Gable and Colbert have fallen in love. He's so mean and critical that it is difficult to believe it when he in love with her. The movie does allow them to meet in the middle as the heavenly rich and the earthy poor come together, the transition of her soul that allows her to follow her own path. But what does she get from Peter? Yet, the movie was endearing to filmgoers and to the Motion Picture Academy which rewarded it the first flood-tide of major awards ? Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay (a feat that only happened twice more with One Flew Over the Coo Coo's Nest in 1976 and The Silence of the Lambs in 1992. Gable wasn't impressed. Reportedly he gave his Oscar away to a fan.Yet, all that goes out the window when we get into the film. This may not be Frank Capra's best film but it still works and you can't argue with that.</fullReview>

Gradually, in spite of themselves, the two begin to fall in love. Premiere romantic comedy has inspired countless others. Great lines, memorable scenes, wonderful story. The cast is excellent and the two leads have dynamic chemistry. First film to sweep the five major Oscar categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay).

Peter confronts Ellie with a choice: Stick with me so I can get an exclusive story, or I call your father right now. She agrees, and so begins a road picture, as they later leave the bus and are forced to walk and hitchhike, until he can get her back home, assuming they don't fall in love of course...Hilarious comedy with two lead characters you like and care about, and many memorable scenes. Frank Capra had a deft comedic touch, as do the actors, and resulting film is wonderful, if undeniably predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute and delightful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most important Best Picture winners feels like one of the most unnecessary Best Picture winners by some. When one says "Best Picture Winner", you think the said film must meet a certain criteria, such as war drama or epic production value-centric story, that certifies it that prestigious title. It Happened One Night has neither of those, though it does achieve a wonderful romance brought to life by Clarke Gable and Claudette Colbert and contains a screenplay as fresh as the carrots Clarke Gable eats himself during the picture.Movies of the 1930s (and earlier) have reoccurring problems when they are put up to the task of competing with newer pictures using today's standards of film perfection: they lack the tight, technical exertion. The sound is often terrible, some dialogue may even be lost, the editing is probably loose, and the photography is assumably rugged from the restoration attempts by the studios. It Happened One Night falls prey to these shortcomings, but it's the film's only real flaw, and not a big one at that. It's still a fairly entertaining movie and the restoration is actually successful most of the times.I couldn't take my eyes of It Happened One Night! It's a delightful film that should not be missed by any generation. Before Pretty Woman and Annie Hall were "the" romantic comedies of their times, there was It Happened One Night. Most of the romantic comedy plot devices we've seen used repeatedly, originated here and were so accepted by audiences and writers that they have grown into cliché. Aside from that, It Happened One Night combines classic stories (poor little rich girl, desperate reporter, train rides, extramarital affairs) into one sublime, Hollywood picture. The thing to any successful romantic comedy, besides the script having more on its cutting board than what the average joe-blow can bring to the table, is its stars. Think about how successful those two rom-coms I mentioned earlier would have been without Julia Roberts and Richard Gere or Woody Allen and Diane Keaton? Not very. The leading couple not only has marvelous chemistry together, but they both have the bolts to screw in a great performances. Clarke Gable in particular shines. His movie-star presence and ability to flow with a picture and character are on full display here. Claudette Colbert produces first rate acting, as well.It Happened One Night is a greatly pleasing film. You'll watch it with a smile on your face. It's funny and contains one of the best movie romances out there, a relationship that starts out in hostility, evolves to friendship, and is overcome with the realization of love. It Happened One Night is cute and having inspired a whole genre of films ahead of its time.Rating: 10/10Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An antidote for depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't any wonder why "It Happened One Night" struck such a chord with movie-goers in the depression-hit USA of the 1930's. Frank Capra's sparkling romantic comedy is just about as uplifting as any movie can possibly be. Whatever it is that makes a star a star, Clark Gable had it in spades more than any other leading man before or since, &amp; how could Claudette Colbert, (or any other woman?), not fall in love with him. Against her fathers wishes Ellie Andrews (Colbert) has married newspaper magnate King Westley &amp; after an argument she jumps her rich fathers yacht into the sea &amp; swims to shore. She is wearing a long white silk gown &amp; not carrying a handbag. Next we see her at Miami bus station purchasing a ticket to New York to be with her husband complete with a new outfit &amp; handbag! Even allowing for a few plot absurdities this is a movie with a big heart &amp; is very entertaining. On a rainy night during the journey to the "big apple" Peter Warne (Gable) hires out a chalet at a campsite when the bus makes an overnight stop. Ellie Andrews bag was stolen earlier at Jacksonville during a mealstop leaving her with only four dollars. So, as Peter points out to Ellie, they cannot afford "separate establishments" &amp; he tells the owner of the campsite they are a married couple. He attaches a length of rope across the centre of their chalet &amp; drapes a blanket over it as a room divider which he calls "the walls of Jericho". "That I suppose makes everything quite alright" she tells him. Peter Warne is himself a newspaper reporter &amp; has latched on to Miss Andrews because he senses a good story. He knows King Westley very well &amp; tells her, "That guy is a phoney. If I were you I would take the next bus back to Miami". This is a movie that is chock full of memorably entertaining scenes &amp; I guarantee that if anyone is feeling a bit low this film will improve their mood. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that exemplifies completeness in making a movie- a good script, brilliant direction and powerhouse performances by the actors. The movie is the best Romantic Comedy ever-made.The most pivotal facet of a movie is the script. This movie has a script that is an amalgam of humor, love and pride. The humor is immanent and the jokes are incessant. The movie showed me why Clark Gable is the most revered and celebrated actor of his time. He has set the standards of acting with insouciance, composure, egalitarian principles and élan. The actors are so involved in their roles that it looks like the movie was a footage of a real-life couple. Such is Frank Capra's direction.Peter Wayne is a reporter looking for a story that would change his life and he meets Ellen, who escaped from her banker father's ship after he didn't approve of her marriage with Westley. After he finds out who she really is, he decides to help her get to her husband in exchange for her story. He helps her not for any financial benefits and solely for the big break he needed. They fall in love and even though Ellen spills the beans, he refuses to admit falling in love with someone whom he called "pampered and spoiled". When he does realize his love for her, she's already gone. He sends a telegram to her father asking him to settle the money his daughter owes him and that's when he admits he's in love with her.Her father, who despises Westley, likes Peter for his principles and attitude in life. A big, fat wedding is about to happen, Ellen is led by her father down the aisle; her father tells her he'd be really happy if she ditched Westley and eloped with Peter and the daughter fulfills her father's wish.Love triumphs, not just once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming, well-developed romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one for comedies, but this was a good one. The first film to win the 5 major Oscars, 'Happened' stars the legendary Clark Gable as he accompanies a spoiled girl from Miami to New York, played by Claudette Colbert. Along the way she learns a thing or two about the rest of the people in America. (This is a film in the Depression.)'Happened' has a very "love to hate you" vibe about it between the two leads, whose blossoming relationship is the star of the film. Beginning with a bus ride, the duo ride, walk, hitchhike and sleep in various locations, jabbing at each other for most of it. The do seem an odd couple at first, but you grow to love them, as they do each other. It's cool, because you could argue the "tipping point", where each realizes their feelings for each other, is one of many scenes.While on the topic of scenes, there are some great ones. The bus, the songs, the "gangster", the hitchhiking, and my favourite, the angry couple ("QUIT BAWLING!") keep the film fresh and funny, until the last act where the 'rom' in this rom-com takes over. That is until the very end, where a great running joke gets the last laugh.Capra's direction is great: the characters constantly develop, the journey moves, and the film feels just right. A great early romantic comedy heavy on laughs and love. Fans of classics will love this. 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It happened a long time ago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Happened One Night, the film which won pretty much every Oscar worth winning, still holds up remarkably well for a film produced over 75 years ago. It's a film with a very simple story but that story is engaging, charming and often quite humorous. The fact that so much of the humor survives intact all these years later is perhaps most impressive. Obviously sensibilities were quite different in 1934 than they are in 2010. But most everything still works. And it's not just a good film, it's also a time capsule of sorts, a look at an entirely different world. Obviously many modern films have been produced set in the same time period as this film's story. But those new films look back at the past through different eyes, presenting modern perceptions of what life was like back then. This movie is the real deal, a slice of 1930s American life, the way it really was. To the modern eye some of the things we see in this film seem almost unbelievable. This is how people really lived? But it was only 75 years ago, an eye's blink of history really. And that is part of what makes this film so fascinating.Of course the one thing above all else that this film has going for it is that it has Hollywood royalty in the two lead roles. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are just as terrific as you would expect them to be and both duly picked up Academy Awards. Of course pretty much everyone involved with the film except the caterer picked up an Academy Award but I digress. Gable and Colbert certainly earned their golden statues. Gable plays Peter Warne, a newly unemployed newspaper reporter. Colbert plays Ellie Andrews, a spoiled runaway heiress. Running away from what? Well she recently got married and her father most certainly did not approve. So before the marriage could be consummated Daddy dearest essentially took his daughter hostage on his yacht down in Florida, far away from the new husband in New York. What's a girl to do? Well, jump off the yacht of course. From there it's going to be a long, strange trip to New York. Ellie gets on a bus, meets Peter and now the film really gets going.Once our story has been set up there's really not much left in the way of plot. It's a simple story about the obstacles Ellie will face on her long journey. There sure are plenty of obstacles though. And this woman, used to all of life's luxuries, really has very little idea how to interact among the common folk. She needs someone to look after her and Peter falls into this role. It's a fun trip, with many memorable moments along the way. One scene in particular stands out with Peter and Ellie having to pose as a quarreling married couple. They could have stopped the film and handed Gable and Colbert their Oscars right there. There's also the famous hitchhiking scene, there's the Walls of Jericho, there's even a possible inspiration for Bugs Bunny. Now for all the moments which do work there are admittedly a few which don't. Some things are a little hokey but not absolutely everything is going to translate over 75 years. And while it's an engaging story it's not an altogether dramatic one as there's a sense of inevitability hanging over the whole thing. But the movie has to be deemed a success. It's witty, charming, amusing and ultimately quite memorable. Director Frank Capra, helped in no small part by the performances of his two great stars, produced a film which not only was a classic in its time but which still stands up today all these decades later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Capra - The ultimate story-teller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra is widely regarded as a revolutionary director and this movie constitutes substantially to this tag. 'It happened one Night' was the first movie of it's kind way back in the 30's where romantic comedies were yet to be born. This is considered as the first major romantic comedy in Hollywood history. Add to it, it was the first ever 'Screwball comedy' movie. Yup, this was actually a new genre invented by Capra. After reading some trivia about the movie, I came to know that the leads Gable and Colbert hated the script so much that they wanted to get over with the movie as soon as possible. Actually, the story of this movie is so simple that it can be explained in a paragraph. But the story-teller that Capra is, this simple story is converted into a very lovable and feel good rom-com which never ceases to amaze you. The movie is full of clichés such as a rich spoilt girl falling in love with a not so wealthy guy and the girl running away from her marriage once she realizes her true love etc etc. But one must also consider the time when this movie was made. Perhaps, this was the first bride runway from marriage scene of cinema history. This movie also influenced a lot of other artists and filmmakers. The cartoon Bugs Bunny is influenced by one of the characters from this movie. Bollywood influence being 'Dil Hai Ki Maanta Nahi'.This was the first movie to win an Oscar Grandslam, i.e all the top 5 major Oscars - Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay - A Feat achieved 40 years later by 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'. Clark Gable rules the screen with his comic timing and exceptional screen presence. Claudette Colbert will make you fall in love with her, a very natural performance considering the era in which the movie was made.Overall, Be a part of history and watch this movie keeping your critics hat aside.Rating : 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure and unpretentious fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the mid-1930's when Hollywood decided to enforce the production code, movies really got cleaned up. Tales of street life disappeared, movies dropped the sly lines of innuendo, and even the monster movies weren't so monstery anymore. It was a great time for romantic comedies where everything worked out in the end. While most of them were forgettable, "It Happened One Night" is memorable for many reasons.As much as being a story about a man and woman falling in love despite themselves and despite the efforts of family and business to intervene on both sides, the movie is a record of the time - a time of traveling by bus through the night, a time of hitchhiking with pleasure and with confidence, and a time when newspaper deadlines still mattered, at least to the newspapers.Hundreds of reviews mention that this movie swept the top five Oscar categories, but that's never the most reliable gauge of a movie's worth. Only seeing it can really show you what's to like about a movie - the characters, the performances, the lasting mood of its moments of fun and moments of melancholy."It Happened One Night" doesn't waste space. Each scene contributes something to the film's character. The irreverent sarcasm between the leads constantly builds the tongue in cheek tone. The moderately-paced plot keeps interest without skipping too fast across the light parts of the story. The unlikable nature of the leads dissolves as we see enough their characters to appreciate the hidden chemistry between them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It holds up after 76 years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie tonight! The only things that I knew about it were the famous Gable "no undershirt" scene and the famous Colbert "hitchhiking" scene. It didn't disappoint. It was like an archaeological look back in time to the original "ROM-COM" master movie, and it still holds up after all these years. Think about it...it was made over 3/4 of a century ago. To put it in another perspective, if you went back an additional 76 years from when this was made, it would be Pre-Civil War! It's important to remember that this was made in the height of the Great Depression, and note the strict moral code of the time, fully incorporated into the movie. However the total sexual tension was fully exploited in the movie, and still applies today. I also appreciated the technique in the final scene, of letting the audience imagine what's happening, when the "walls of Jerico" finally go tumbling down!Capra's directing and choice of shots and perspectives was amazing too! It really set the standard for all these genre of movies that have since followed. Very watchable, Very entertaining. One final thought....as I watched Gable in this movie, his facial expressions and mannerisms totally made me think of Johnny Depp, who I now realize is the modern day Gable! Watch this movie and don't think too much...just let yourself be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It happened one night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1934 American film, "It happened one night" directed by Frank Capra, is a perfect example of a screw-ball comedy. Starring such actors as Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert, and Walter Conelly, this was the first film to ever win all five major Academy Awards(Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay). I personally thought that this film was quiet comical and thoroughly enjoyed the story. I also thought that it was filmed perfectly, which a great example of this being the bus scene. One thing that I thought was interesting, was the fact that during this era, movies weren't really able to depict relationships and romance, but they found ways to get around it. All in all I give, "It happened one night" 5.5 out of 6 chicken nuggets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so this movie can't be qualified as good just because it was made in the 30s...but coincidentally it is a pretty good movie, a great one, I think. When people say the plot to this is predictable, I say "fine, the ending is, but the journey there sure isn't". For the time and age this movie is very refreshing and it's almost amazing how being one of the first to fall in the category of "chick flicks" it still isn't one, because:1. It's not clichéd in any way. 2. Most of it is comedy, focusing little on the romance and delving more into comical situations and mix-ups. 3. The bit that is romance is sweet and nice without overdoing it, playing off a real situation, not a fairy tale one.I guess this seems paradoxical but this movie's romance department is quite realistic. I appreciated the ending a lot, no kiss (though it wouldn't have hurt :)) no mushy declaration, no ostentatious proposal, just a nice pun well-played out and charmingly unforgettable. I give this movie 9 out of 10 because I didn't like the wedding sequence. I guess that was the only gag that didn't make it the perfect afternoon movie. Other than that you should all go and see this classic. Plus, Clark Gable is way sexier here than in Gone with the Wind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A can't miss it film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In another review I called "Pillow Talk" one of the seminal films in the development of romantic comedies as we know, understand, and love them."It Happened one Night" is its predecessor and partner.Although this film virtually swept the Oscars, it was made virtually by accident. No one liked the project. Clark Gable was banished to the film as a punishment, and I'm quite sure that in 1934 Frank Capra was not looked upon with the high regard his films enjoy today.Yet everything came together in this "bus movie", as it was derisively called pre-production, and a charming, funny, and moving story unfolded.Only a few years into "talkies", the film set the tone and stage for the antithetical courtship that would become virtually ubiquitous for romantic comedies. Don't believe me? How do you decide who is going to get together at the end of a romantic comedy? Its the two people that early on hate each others' guts, right? Right. Every one of those movies is in some way derivative of "It Happened One Night".Unless you just hate "old movies", watch and enjoy. Or if you've already seen it, renew your relationship with the film. It is absolutely worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claudette teaches us how to hitchhike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Happened One Night is directed by Frank Capra and stars Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert, Walter Connolly and Rosco Karns.One of the funniest and best romantic comedies of the 1930's, it's easy to see why audiences then fell in love with it.The funniest scene in this for me has to be the one where Peter's teaching her the thumb signals to use when hitchhiking.They don't work and Elli gets a car to stop by not using her thumb. Elli Andrews(Claudette Colbert)is a rich heiress who runs away from her father(Walter Connolly) after he objects to her secret marriage to another rich man called Westley(Jameson Thomas) her father hates him.She gets on the overnight bus and finds herself in the company of down on his luck newspaper man Peter(Clarke Gable).Recognising her from her missing person picture and article in the papers he sees a chance at getting a top story.However the two end up becoming friends despite their many differences after a series of incidents.Elli eventually falls in love with Peter but will he return her affections?will Peter write the story?will she split up with Westley and can a rich girl really love a man from the lower classes?Well watch this classic and find out. Gable and Colbert are both excellent and show a real gift for comedy. Rosco Karns steals all his scenes as an annoying bus passenger who shows great interest in Elli.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Careful foundation lets these two characters interact brilliantly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously some things about this film are dated, such as Claudette Colbert receiving, in the opening scenes, questionable 'sexist' or 'brutish' treatment by her purportedly loving father. Those actions would not work in film today, as we all know, certainly not in a comedy genre. However, it explains why Colbert's character, not a ditsy dope, would choose to run away from her privileged existence and face certain retribution -- financial and emotional -- making her all the more sympathetic as she gamely takes on Clark Gable in a battle of wits and manners. Likewise Gable, in the opening scenes, suffers in somewhat tragic circumstances, and his character struggles to hide his dejection and sense of failure under a dapper appearance and good grooming. Without this foundation, the situation is silly and contrived, because these two attractive, intelligent, witty persons would have no reason to react as they do, suffering rebukes and slights from one another, mostly "deserved", or at least rationally handed out, according to their limited knowledge of each other. A variation on the theme of 'Pride &amp; Prejudice'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow in all my 55+ years of movie watching I had missed seeing this one. It recently was on a list of top movies, and my local public library had a copy of the DVD so I snagged it and saw it.As history records it, this Capra movie was made almost on a lark, with actress Colbert just available for 4 weeks, and she demanded twice her normal salary in a mild effort to discourage the producers. They made the deal, started shooting right away, made it in 4 weeks, and it swept the Academy Awards for that year.Clark Gable is Peter Warne, reporter, in a different role for him. He is a boozing, wise-cracking reporter who tells it like it is, and doesn't hesitate to call a spoiled rich girl just that.Claudette Colbert is the spoiled rich girl, Ellie Andrews, who had eloped but her father was determined to get the marriage annulled. Her father is Walter Connolly as wealthy Alexander Andrews.As the story begins Ellie and her father are on their yacht in Miami when she gets tired of his telling her what to do and jumps off the boat, and manages to get away.Most of the movie is a road trip, as Ellie takes a bus back to New York to be with her beau. On the bus she meets Peter, her suitcase with money is stolen, so he sticks with her, and then realizes there may be a great story here, as all the papers announce that she is being looked for.Predictably Peter and Ellie begin to care for each other, and she starts to doubt whether she wants to be married to the other guy.Good 1935 movie, and my favorite Clark Gable role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to see why this film appealed to international audiences on its initial release because in the very heart of the Great Depression it provided charm, sophistication, romance, laughter and at the same time gave a reminder of tears in such throwaway scenes as a young mother fainting from hunger and the couple who can't afford to let rooms to skippers. Seen on television this very day it holds up well and is a fine mirror of a lost time. Colbert was always a class act and Gable showed a flair for something other than macho roles to say nothing of ever reliable Walter Connolly who alternated with Eugene Palette in portraying wealthy fathers with errant daughters. Ward Bond and Irving Bacon pop up albeit uncredited and all in all a good time is had by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the great light-hearted romance comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's It Happened One Night was a film I saw a few years ago, first and only time (though there will be other viewings to come), and it's never left me. Not exactly on a big profound dramatic level like a lot of other films of the 30s- including Capra's It's a Wonderful Life- but it's got such an air of confidence to its light-hearted comedy, and the winning combo of Gable and Colbert. The story is pretty simple, which is good so as to allow for this odd couple to bond and grow in behavioral terms; Colbert is spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews and she's just tied the knot, and Gable plays reporter Peter Warne. She jumps ship and Peter follows. It becomes a road movie soon after that (including the famous "leg" bit that's been a staple of male fantasy even up to today to a certain degree), and Capra gets his fun in showing these two characters as being so right for each other for all the wrong reasons. In that sense it's the prototypical romantic comedy, one that we've seen perhaps far too much today and parrotted without a lick of the whimsy Capra gives it. But it's also a big credit to the stars that they keep this tale uplifting (it was the depression after all), and they're simply magnetic personalities to fill up such identifiable personas. It's terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started to explore Clark Gable's movies recently, and obviously I had to watch the movie that gave him and Claudette Colbert) This story has been used many times in movies, if not, watch Shrek (the first one) and you'll know what I'm talking about. Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is the daughter of a rich Wal-Street man who secretly got married to King Wesltey (Jameson Thomas), but her father won't even hear about it. Sick of being told what she has to do, she escapes from her father and tries to get from Miami to NY to see her beau. On the road, she finds a wise-crack reporter, Peter Warne (Clark Gable) who agrees to help her, but in return he wants her story, exclusive.That's the main plot, and it happens lots and lots of things that happen while the story develops. Let's just say that this movie set the fashion for men to not wear undershirt t-shirts, it taught people how to dunk a donut and how to hitchhike.Clark Gable did a wonderful job, who would have thought that "The King" who is known for playing roles of ladies men and serious roles, now plays a comic role. He did wonderfully, he surely deserved the Oscar and you can tell that he had a great time doing this movie. Claudette Colbert was excellent too, great performance as the spoiled girl who always gets her way.Also the movie is great b/c even though it had a limited budget and only 4 weeks to be done, this movie wasn't entirely filmed in a studio, you get to see nice landscapes and great photography, and i love the dialogue between the characters, lots of memorable quotes on this movie that people still use nowadays.This is probably the best comedy of the 30's, and the pioneer in the so called comedy genre "screwball". I give it a 10/10, and to encourage people to watch it, let's just say that Friz Freleng created the famous Bugs Bunny after watching this movie. When you watch it, you'll know why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My quest to watch more classic movies(going rather slowly,BTW)pointed me toward this film,a historically relevant as well as critically well-received film. While I probably watched it wrong(I saw in in parts,due to my sometimes business,laziness or easily-distractedness),what I saw was still a marvel of earlier,"Golden Age" film-making,rife with fast-talking,quick-acting,chain-smoking men and women who couldn't bear to be out in public wearing anything but suits,slacks,ties,dresses,hats and shiny shoes! Particular in this pastiche were the matinée stars,Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert,the very examples of bygone film style. This movie,a relatively early offering from legendary filmmaker Frank Capra,was able to use their style,savvy and moxie to full comic effect.Spoiled and sheltered heiress Ellie Andrews(Colbert,with a face that didn't NEED the soft-cell photography.Not that it hurt)wants to reunite with her playboy,estranged husband(Jameson Thomas),so she bolts from her father's yacht and decides to go it alone. She'll need help,as it turns out,and help comes in the way of opportunistic reporter Peter Warne(Gable,in a performance that's cobbled maybe a 1,000 impressions!),smelling an exclusive story. He's set on believing she's a stupid,spoiled heiress,and while she does little to change that impression,he somehow falls in love with her. But with the newspapers abuzz with the story of a runaway heiress and her wealthy daddy(Walter Connolly,underrated)offering a good-sized reward for her return,WArne has to decide the age old question: the girl or the money? Oh,yes,and the story.Historically relevant for being the first of three(to date)sweeps of the Academy Awards(Best Pic,Actor,Actress and Director),this movie may've dudded with less kinetic actors,but the principals deliver here. While I cannot call this a favorite of mine,it's still a must-see for people who want to grasp some of Hollywood's old glory,an old-fashioned love story/madcap comedy or just a cheap,quality rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Appreciate a 70-year-old Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It Happened One Night," the smash-hit movie of 1934, may not seem groundbreaking today, but it's still thoroughly entertaining. Its sturdy romantic-comedy plot has had elements recycled into many other movies, including classics like "The 39 Steps" and "Roman Holiday." Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), an impulsive heiress, is trying to escape her controlling father and join the man she loves. On her bus from Miami to New York, she meets streetwise journalist Peter Warne (Clark Gable), who agrees to help her avoid the police if he can get the rights to her story. Gable has probably the showier role: Peter is fast-talking, cynical, and contemptuous of Ellie, always trying to teach her common sense. His lessons include, to entertaining effect, "How a Man Undresses," "How to Dunk a Doughnut," "How to Hitchhike." However, Ellie is a quick learner, and by the time the hitchhiking lesson comes around, she can beat Peter at his own game! Another great scene has Gable and Colbert act like a bickering married couple to throw the police off their trail. The movie also attempts to show how Ellie becomes a better person by interacting with ordinary citizens (played by some of those great '30s character actors, talking in colorful vernacular), but I thought it could have gone a little further in that regard.Most of "It Happened One Night," when the characters are on the road, is fast-paced and quick-witted. (At the beginning, Ellie jumps off her father's yacht wearing a dressing gown, and the next time we see her, she's at a bus station in a sweater and skirt. A typical movie would have showed exactly how she got her bus ticket and clothes, which would probably have bogged things down. "It Happened One Night" just has Ellie mention, in a later scene, that she pawned her watch to get money.) But at the end, when the romantic complications need to get sorted out, the pace slows. Also, Ellie's behavior annoyed me: for the whole movie, she's chafed under her father's control, but in the end she lacks the courage to follow her heart, and needs Daddy to make everything all right. Still, if Mr. Andrews hadn't orchestrated things, Ellie wouldn't get her happy ending...and that wouldn't be right in a movie like this, now would it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully entertaining movie...Believe you me!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screen writer Robert Riskin, and Film Director Frank Capra enjoyed a long a fruitful association together throughout the Golden age of Hollywood. Together they worked on eleven pictures starting with The Miracle Woman in 1931 and culminating in 1961 with Pocket Full of Miracles, although this was a posthumous credit for Riskin, having passed away six years previously.Arguably their most successful collaboration was It Happened One Night released by Columbia Pictures in 1934. It was their fifth picture together and it was so simplistic it was ingenious.Shot on an incredibly low budget, in less than four weeks with two reluctant leads, it seemed this film was destined for failure. However it became the box office smash of the year and the first film ever to scoop the four main Acadamy Awards (Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Picture and Best Director plus Best Screenplay for Robert Riskin)Having recently eloped to a flash aviator lover, spoilt heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) escapes from a disapproving father desperate to annul her marriage and attempts to travel incognito by bus from Miami to New York to rejoin her 'husband'. On her tail are the Police and several detective agencies hired by her father to try and stop her.In transit she meets wise cracking newspaper man Peter Warne (Clark Gable) and after a none to promising start to a friendship, Warne offers to help Andrews avoid her father henchmen and make sure she gets safely to New York. In return for his somewhat out of character generosity he expects her full and exclusive story. A story to help revive his flagging career.Reluctant at first and acrimonious to the last, Andrew's resists Warne's offers, but after several misfortunes on the road and near capture by the detectives, Andrews resigns to the fact that she has no choice but to accompany the disagreeable Warne all the way to New York.Your not going to get any prizes for guessing the emotional outcome of their journey, but just accompanying them on this trip is where the true entertainment lies.Riskin's witty dialogue make the frequent and inconsequential arguments between the two a must see as the silly disputes over 'dunking, piggybacking, hunger and hitchhiking set the screen alight. However, Gable and Colbert's comic timing and acting expertise wins the audience over in the more intense scenes, like when they pretend to be a squabbling man and wife to the prying detectives.Brilliant.Walter Connolly (Andrew's Father) Roscoe Karns (a fellow bus passenger)and Alan Hale (an operatic motorist) all steal every scene they are in, but without a doubt this is Gable and Colbert's film.If anyone doubts Gables title as the king of 1930's Hollywood, then watch this film and you will see why. In this film he single handedly destroyed the global market for vests/undershirts purely because he did not wear one. Name one actor today or even since who has that much clout and I'll eat my own foot off!Forgive the old cliché but this IS a must see film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Introspections on It Happened One Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently read a statement that cited something like the test of a good mind is the ability to hold two contradictory thoughts simultaneously. Upon analysis, one can apply this notion to practically anything related to human experience; from concepts as far-ranging as politics and religion to those as close to us as human relationships. Since I had recently seen Capra's marvelous It Happened one Night I was reminded of the moment towards the end of the picture in which Claudette Colbert declares her love for Clark Gable.I was trying to understand the thought processes of Gable as he lies quietly, but obviously engrossed in his own mental meanderings. Here is the crux of a situation that has been preparing itself, falling towards a desired end since the inception of Gable's desire for Colbert, and yet, he questions the entire situation. As one with emotional cold feet: not wanting to remove his shoes in case the wet sand gives him a cold.The strength of his character shows us his childishness; whereas heretofore it was a staple element of Colbert's personality, now it is he who doubts the validity of the next move. And the move must come, as in all denouements where there is a clear sentimental frisson.But what if his thoughts per se? Is he thinking as groom, a father figure, a reporter, or just simply a man? Should the self-imposed 'Walls of Jericho' that have hitherto stood firm fall? Should they collapse in a rapture of passion? To be honest, I do not really believe that the 'act' is as important as the preamble. For me, the whole of It Happened One Night is like a road-hogging foreplay in which desire builds into love but out of a deeper understanding between teacher and student figures. One could argue over the continuity in the nature of Gable?s character toward Colbert; the fact that their relationship shows clear evolution has more than amply been recorded elsewhere; but my question now returns to the original premise about 'the ability to hold two contradictory thoughts simultaneously?'.Gable understands what he is getting himself into. He also understands what he has had to, and will have to go through to both let go of his previous existence as a sassy and streetwise newshound, and to accept a future with this girl who represents so much that he has up to this point detested in his life. Just as Capra had to deal with extremes of class, so too does Gable now find himself having to come to terms with himself in relation to his own class-consciousness.The morality lies in the basic 'goodness' of mankind; not the submission to the premise that all 'upper-class?' people are the same or have the same moral standards; no. Worse: that he may have been wrong all along, that he may actually be able to do something about it, and worse yet: the dawning on him as he lays on his bed behind the 'wall?' that he has already succeeded.Whereas the analysis of film usually extends to its length in feet; the analysis of the human experience can usually humble the mise-en-scéne, especially when the characters are shown to be detailed, complex and deep. Although by today's standards some may analyze Gable and Colbert as being somewhat simplistic, one cannot (and should not) hold current moral values in a social framework up to the lights of 1934's scrutiny, the two as a pair are as rich and meaningful today as they were all those years ago. Furthermore, the processes that burrow through Gable?s mind at hearing simply 'I love you?' when they come not melodramatically, but as the most important words he has wanted to hear.Ironically, the words interrupt his reverie and he clams up almost childishly, hoping but not wanting to hope that he will hear those words. His retorts, sending her back to her bed, reminding her that she is married, his dream-like vociferation of the perfect girl who seems so near and so far are leading him closer to the identification of self. That he might actually be ready to go further with her. That the consummation, not through wordplay but through physical action, is about to happen, lead him, as previously stated, into two minds which by extension, to his two worlds; as reporter and as future husband. All of these dualities (a cold feet of the mind) lead him to the eventual awareness that he is, in fact, juggling with opposing concepts, feelings, worlds, options and although they at first seem contradictory, are nonetheless worthy of him as a person. He is the richer for it, despite what it can cause him in the future.The concept is timeless, the inner-conflict likewise. And this is but one small reason why It Happened one night must rate as one of the greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is unfortunate that I had to this hilarious comedy first, because all the movies after it pale in comparison. This movie confirmed my love for spunky Clark Gable and introduced me to the lovely, elegant and talented Claudette Colbert. It Happened One Night is a very simple story and that's what I loved about it. Colbert plays a rich, snooty heiress that runs away from her Father after he disagreed with her new marriage to a playboy. Although she is just doing it to spite him, she is determined to go to New York and marry him. He sends out private investigators all around the country in hopes in finding her. Since she is rich, she uses unlikely transport: a night bus! And there she finds Clark Gable. Hilarity and romance ensues.There are many memorable scenes in this and every time I watch it, it still cracks me up. There is nothing better than to watch Gable teach Colbert how to hitch-hike - boy does she show him! Great performances, great direction - just runs smoothly so you can enjoy this fantastic movie.It Happened One Night will make your needs melt for Clark Gable, make you laugh out loud and make you realize how much this sort of comedy is lacking in today's cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Great Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen a few Frank Capra movies in my day, and I must say that this is my favorite of his films. Every modern romantic comedy, from "The Graduate" to "When Harry Met Sally" to "Sleepless in Seattle", owes a serious debt to the film that all but spawned the genre, "It Happened One Night".It can be argued that film was lucky to even get off the ground. This film was produced at several different locations on a shoestring budget (with Claudette Colbert receiving a large chunk of that budget as pay), yet the chemistry between Colbert and Clark Gable was among the best ever caught on film. Also, Capra's efficient directing style, which became a necessity for this project, paid off in spades."It Happened One Night" caused a sensation from the word "go". T-shirt sales dropped because Clark Gable didn't wear one in the film. The phrase "Walls of Jericho" became a part of the American lexicon. It showed that women could indeed get just about anything they wanted, just by showing a little leg. And it has been acknowledged in several circles that "It Happened One Night" was the inspiration behind the creation of one of most-loved cartoon characters ever, Bugs Bunny.It would be hard to pick just one reason to watch this film, but if I had to choose, it would be the scene in which Peter (Gable) and Ellie (Colbert) pretend to be a married blue-collar couple when private detectives hired by Ellie's father encounter them at a motor lodge. This scene alone demonstrates Gable's and Colbert's chemistry with each other (I know I've mentioned it before. Trust me -- It's that good!).The first film to win Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay, "It Happened One Night" is a heartwarming, charming, hilarious movie that I would recommend for any couple (young or old) to see. This is the first truly great romantic comedy, which still holds up pretty well (Okay, so taking the bus isn't very romantic anymore).By the way, I showed selected scenes of this film to my son when he was 16, and he liked what he saw. If that isn't a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It Happened One Night" is a charming and fresh comedy with a series of mix-ups, inconvenient circumstance and an eventually happy ending. This movie is a perfect example of what many romantic comedies were like during it's time, mostly due to the many rules and regulations of the Motion Picture Production Code, which came into effect in 1930. For example Peter (played by Clark Gable) and Ellie (a married woman and played by Claudette Colbert), go through much together throughout the movie and during these series of events they fall in love. On two separate occasions they end up having to stay the night in one hotel room together. Both times the rooms have two separate single beds on opposite sides of the room and between them a blanket gets hung in order to make this situation seem more appropriate, and to ensure that nothing would happen between this man and woman. Even though Paul and Ellie develop strong feelings for each other, to the point where Ellie (in desperation not to go back to her husband) practically throws herself at Paul, but is told that she had better get back to her side of the blanket. It is not until the very end, after the marriage gets properly annulled and Paul and Ellie get married, that the movie can make the suggestion that something more than flirting may happen between the two. Although I would never wish for the any type of censorship on Hollywood (or anyone else) to come back into effect today, there was something about the modesty and innocence of the film (a quality that is almost extinct in modern comedies) that I really appreciated.

		<fullReview>Here I am again, in a quandary over a film's reputation and my own reaction to it. Hailed as one of the great screwball comedies and on many best lists, I just didn't think it was as strong a picture as I was expecting. When I think of 'screwball', I'm looking for snappy one liners and engaging chemistry between the principals, but the film didn't deliver for me on that score. Gable's character came off as rather harsh for my taste, especially in the scene at the cabin when they faked their marriage to convince the authorities that Ellie (Claudette Colbert) wasn't the person they were looking for. There was also that set up at the beginning of the relationship when Peter Warne (Gable) has the 'so there' tiff with the bus driver. I was really expecting a clever resolution to that exchange and it just went nowhere.So OK, the picture swept the Oscars, but take a look at one of the competitors - "The Thin Man". Now there was a screwball comedy, with as engaging a couple as you can find in William Powell and Myrna Loy. What was probably needed here was someone like Cary Grant to pull off the male lead, as Gable's approach was just a bit too shrill. In fact, Grant was a newspaper reporter in "His Girl Friday", opposite Rosalind Russell, so there's another example. Another would be "Philadelphia Story", Grant again with a little help from Jimmy Stewart. The latter two came a half dozen years later, but you still get the idea.As for director Capra, I think he outdid this picture with his 1938 Best Film Oscar winner - "You Can't Take It With You", and you can't get any more screwball than that one. And even though the theme is somewhat different, "It's A Wonderful Life" stands head and shoulders above this one in my estimation. So maybe I'm missing something, and I'll leave it at that.There were a few things that caught my attention though, like 'Hot Dogs and Hamburgers - 10 cents' on one of the roadside bus stops - there's a bargain! And I had never seen an 'autogyro' before, I thought it would be a helicopter, but seeing it with two propellers going in different directions was really cool to see.But then you had Gable smoking in bed a couple of times. Not a very good example to set when so many people lose their lives in house fires from that very cause. And who thought it was cool for him to beat up a guy to steal his car? Sorry for those downers. But the thing that nagged me the most - what did Ellie Andrews ever see in King Westley to begin with?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra, Claudette, and Clark - and an auto-gyro landing on the lawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film to sweep the main categories of the Oscars (of that time - 1934) was IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. In it Clark Gable plays Peter Warne, a newspaperman who is having problems with his boss Joe Gordon (Charles C. Wilson), when he latches onto one of the big scoops of his time. Willful Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the daughter of millionaire Alexander Andrews (Walter Conolly), has fled her powerful father's yacht, in order to reach the man she claims she loves, an aviator named King Wesley (Jameson Thomas). Ellie is very strong minded and snobbish. She has common sense, but her will sometimes overcomes it. Peter hooks up with her on a bus that is going from Florida to New York. He soon lets her know that he knows her identity, but he will assist her if she will allow him to write of the bus trip for the newspaper.Capra movies are fun because he did not hesitate to throw in pieces of Americana into them. Here it was bus travel. The interstate highway system that we know of today really dates back to the 1950s (possibly it was the most useful internal achievement of Eisenhower's Presidency), but more and more roads between states were being built in the 1920s and 1930s due to the growth of the use of automobiles. However, Mr. Andrews (well played by Conolly as a stern but loving father - and a good judge of character: he doesn't think highly of Wesley), concentrates his agents at railroad and seaport (and even airport) depots and stations. He doesn't think Ellie will travel in such a plebeian manner as a bus. The bus is driven by Ward Bond, who has a nice, simple comic scene with Gable where all Bond repeats like a dummy is "YEAH?", to which an increasingly confused and befuddled Gable is forced "YEAH!!". The passengers are a mixed bag, and include Roscoe Karns as a heel and opportunist, and several others who entertain themselves singing "The Man On the Flying Trapeze". Ellie finally shows her humanity giving away most of her money to aid a boy and his mother who are so broke the mother fainted from hunger.Early trailer parks are shown in the film, as well as the rest stops of the 1930s (note a brief moment when a man in great distress makes a very quiet request for information to a waiter - he is told the comfort station is in the back). It's interesting to see a film like this to catch the changing scene in America in the 1930s or any period, and the things that we now take for granted.My one partial criticism of the film as it is it that Wesley is never really built up as a villain - although he is obviously a fortune hunter. He has some celebrity as an aviator (this was the age when men and women of real stature became public figures for aviation achievements: Lindbergh, Earhard, Post, Gatty, Hughes, Amy Johnson, Doolittle, Turner). But even Gable (admittedly jealous after he falls for Ellie) calls him "the pill of the century". As a stunt at the wedding ceremony, Wesley lands an auto-gyro on the lawn. Mr. Andrews feels it's silly. But for real villainy in the story, we are left with the treacherous Alan Hale (in one sequence) and Karns as a lecherous and greedy pest.That true love finally wins is to be expected. But the journey of Ellie Andrews and Peter Warne is a colorful one that takes us back to a moment when auto travel on the east coast was still quite a little adventure. The film won best picture, Capra best director, Gable best actor, and Colbert best actress. Ironically Colbert, a fine actress, never won another Oscar, and Gable (whose signature role was Rhett Butler, not Peter Warne) lost that Oscar of 1939 to Robert Donat (and lost the 1935 Oscar for Fletcher Christian to Victor MagLaglen). However, Peter Warne added more than an Oscar to Gable's legend. His scene where he undressed in a roadside motel room in front of Colbert revealed he did not wear an undershirt. Sales in men's undershirts declined precipitously for a number of years as a result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra's First Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie might be the first great romantic comedy ever. Despite its age (1934), there is virtually no overacting from any of the participants. That aspect alone helps me to understand how and why this movie took Hollywood by storm that year and swept through the academy awards.Clark Gable is fantastic as a newspaper reporter who has a great story drop right in his lap when he gets on a bus with runaway heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert.) From the moment Gable appears on film, (calling his boss from a pay phone while he's drunk), every scene from then on is a classic to this viewer. Not a single missed step does Capra take. Claudette's confrontation with Oscar Shapely from Orange, NJ is classic as is Gable's confrontation with him later. The scene where everyone on the bus sings 'The Man on The Flying Trapeze' is a gem. The scene where Gable &amp; Colbert are forced to get a room for the night and Clark introduces the 'Walls of Jerico' as well as the donut dunking lesson the next morning and the plumber's daughter, and on and on.Gable &amp; Colbert are magnificent together. Capra, Gable and Colbert deserve every single award they received for this movie. It's an absolute masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timelessly Charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1934's It Happened One Night was the first film to sweep all the major categories for the Academy Awards (Best Actor, Actress, Director, Screenwriter and Picture). only One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Silence of the Lambs have equaled that.After 70 years, it's charm still holds up and Director Frank Capra isn't guilty of manipulating the audience into sappiness...which he would do from time to time in later projects.He and screenwriter ( Robert Riskin) pit two opposites: gruff, cocksure and seemingly untrustworthy newspaper reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable); with cultured, rich, naive, sheltered American Princess Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert). Ellie is a runaway bride (actually daughter). She's married against her father's wishes, jumped off his yacht off the Florida coast and plans to travel by herself up to New York and reunite with hubby (King Westley played by Jamerson Thomas). Since air travel was fledgling in 1934; train travel would've been the mode of choice.But Ellie's low on cash and dad's (Alexander played by Walter Connolly) detectives are watching all the stations...Ellie gets on a night bus headed to NYC. (hence the title...source material was a story called Night Bus).A series of vignettes ensue, among them the classic 'walls of jericho' motel scene, and the hitchhiking scene. throughout Gable barks and complains nonstop and forbids the spoiled brat heiress from even thinking of whining. he's after an exclusive story (or so he thinks) and she wants to rush back to hubby's arms and out of dad's influence.of course, along the way...they unexpectedly fall in love. it's never manifested on screen...they don't even kiss and here's where the movie, the principles, Riskin and Capra shine. the motel scenes are a nose thumb to the Hays Office in their silliness also, since overt sexuality couldn't be shown at the time...the sexual tension between Peter and Ellie simmers below the surface during the film's second half. the haystack scene...where Peter stops himself from kissing her and Ellie realizes how much she wants him to...is the beginning of it.the final motel scene on the last night of their journey, where Ellie professes her love to Peter (the Oscar winning scene for Colbert) manifests this sexuality.i also found the sexism on the part of Ellie's father, Andrew interesting. he's a loving, doting father...but he's contend to find a good husband for Ellie...to insure her happiness. he never looks to see if she can or wants to help him...or what she wants for her happiness...until the end; after she tells him who she really loves.a reward is made public for Ellie's safe return; Peter leaves her to get an advance from the newspaper because he wants to bring his own money to Ellie to start their life together; though he rejected her advance. Then she contacts dad and Westley after she thinks she's been abandoned.there's a great scene...the last time we see Ellie and Peter on screen together...at her estate. A party's being thrown, she's to wed Westley again in a gala wedding...Peter comes to her house to pick up the money her father owes him. He sees her for the first time in her element; gowned and bejeweled...and he snarls at her.Perhaps Gable's Oscar winning scene is with her father...where he states he doesn't want the huge reward...only expense money for the trip...that Ellie's only a spoiled brat because of the father... and that, though she's daffy he's hopelessly in love with her!Andrew plays cupid...telling Ellie of Peter's rejection of the reward and his profession of love for her, as he's walking her down the aisle. Ellie runs off to a waiting car...leaving Westley in the lurch again... and over the phone...day's later from Andrew's office we learn that Westley's accepted cash to annul the marriage...and Peter and Ellie can marry.the film ends at a roadside motel...with a befuddled older couple complaining about the wacky young couple asking for a toy trumpet and a rope...they're re enacting the 'walls of jericho' scene. As a time capsule, as all films shot during current times become... it's rich with many Capra staples. The Depression, the melding of 2 different classes, which is an American institution...sense of looking out for the other person, they're all here.there's a scene in mid film...on the second bus ride, where Peter gives all his cash to a young boy traveling with his starving mom to meet his father...that is Capra at his best. he tweaks the heartstrings...but doesn't hit this one too hard. it also serves to mirror what Peter is involved in...he too is trying to get a woman he loves back to her husband.in short...the movie after all these years, holds up well...which is something all classic movies all still do. and it still works well on all levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film That Put the American Cinema on the Map.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinema was still relatively new to many people in 1934. The silent film era had come and gone, films with sound were now familiar to movie-goers and the Oscars had a few Best Picture winners already named. However, "It Happened One Night" probably turned American cinema into a business more than any other film before its time. The production was a commercial blockbuster and dominated the Oscars as it won five Academy Awards (sweeping the picture, director, writing and lead performer categories). "It Happened One Night" is a hilarious and heartwarming romantic comedy about a young newlywed (Oscar-winner Claudette Colbert) who has been forced onto her rich father's (Walter Connolly) yacht after he annuls the marriage. Colbert has had it with her father and decides to jump ship literally and get back to her new husband (Jameson Thomas). Naturally it is not near as easy as she first expected as nothing seems to go right and she continues to be helped and annoyed by a sleazy tabloid reporter (Oscar-winner Clark Gable) who is just looking for a good story to give to his readers. While at odds with one another, they slowly realize that they have a mutual admiration and love for one another, but will they both realize it before it is too late? Frank Capra (who received his first of three Best Director Oscars here) was arguably the finest director from the 1930s to the early-1960s. His pure style and his deliberate compassion and love for his characters created outstanding film after outstanding film. Still excellent and still a wonderful piece of entertainment, "It Happened One Night" is an essential to all lovers of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triad of Talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's so much to say about this title, and most of it's been said. However, it seems there has been little mention of the enormously gifted triad of Capra, Robert Riskin, and Joseph Walker, and how their talents combined to produce such a first-rate romantic comedy. A perfect balance of naturalistic direction, beautiful cinematography and wonderful words. A film which truly deserved the multiple Oscars it garnered. The oft-mentioned scenes in the cabin and on the road we all know and love are terrific, but what about the bedding-down-in-the-hay scene? Such wistful looks and gestures...just the way Colbert is framed suggests the emotional changes taking place. So much said with so few words. Truly pure cinema. And when there are words, who better to provide them than Riskin, master of dialogue that sparkles with wit. I recently saw a 95% restored print of this at the Academy and the picture was stunning. On a big screen, in 35mm, I was absolutely transported back to 1934. Joseph Walker's lensing simply glows. And for those of you who shun black &amp; white films, you must reconsider when you see a print like this, as it should be seen. It'll take your breath away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's a better romantic comedy, I haven't seen it. Every possible cliche is woven into the plot: spoiled sad rich girl, tough as nails reporter, cheerful singing just-folks, happy hoboes, won't take charity starving boy and his mother, gruff but wise old rich father--it goes on and on. It ought to be as bad as the worst movies Frank Capra ever made, but somehow Capra overcomes everything, even himself, to craft a gem. It's completely absurd, of course, in the way a Dickens novel is absurd, but it works because we wish it could work in reality. And it works because Clark Gable was a mediocre leading man in drama but a fine comedian; because it has the peculiar 1930's way of making men and women oddly both different and equal; because nobody took the whole thing seriously, but just played it out. An absolute don't miss, especially if you're thinking of getting married.</fullReview>

"The Man on the Flying Trapeze." In addition to being a fine entertainment, this film makes me think of a time machine. Daily life as depicted in this movie is close enough to our time to seem familiar, but far enough removed from us to seem exotic. "It Happened One Night" provides a delightful glimpse into everyday life in the early 1930's, a time and place only the oldest of us can have known as adults.

Clark Gable strung it up and called it the walls of Jericho, and in the end, when that wedding that Bruce (in Bandits) is referring to taking place at the end is his and Claudette Colbert's, and then they 'bring down the wall'." I now am on a mission to add this to my NetFlix list so I might better edify my hubby on the subject. A definite must-see or, if possible, must-own for any movie buff.

		<fullReview>In the scene (first "walls of Jericho,") from the movie 'It Happened One Night' directed by Frank Capra, we see Ellie standing outside during the night in a pouring rain. The narrative/story or the plot unfolds like this. The passengers are forced by a storm to spend the night in an auto court and Ellie has had her suitcase stolen not too long ago and she has very little money to afford a room. Peter knows this because he tried to retrieve her suitcase from the thief but was unable to do so. Thus in order to help Ellie, he rents a room at the auto court under both their names and claims her as his wife. Ellie is somewhat surprised by this, but the shock is softened both for the audience at the time (1934,) and for Ellie, because in the earlier scene Peter helped Ellie to deflect an annoying guy on the buss named Shapeley, by claiming her as his wife. When Ellie enters the room she is somewhat dismay by having to have to spend the night with a strange man. "According to Colbert, this was the only time in the rapid shooting schedule that he redid something, because he had decided she didn't look 'scared enough.'" pg.44, last paragraph, Runaway Bride, Hollywood Romantic Comedy of the 1930's, Elizabeth Kendall, Alfred A. Knopf, New York 1990 Keep in mind that for 1930's this was a big deal. The film is going against dominant ideologies at this time and they have to thread carefully. They are going against the norms. If one pays close attention, you notice the beds are separated from each other, even though the room is registered for couples. This is due to the influence of the evangelicals at the time. And the fact that they would have boycotted the movie if the beds were seen together. (class notes, professor Goldberg, Summer 2015) The beds are the first thing that captures Ellies attention once she enters the room. We get a POV shot of her looking at Peter making the bed for her in a low key lighting. What is to follow is witty comments going back and forth between Ellie and Peter as we get establishing and re-establishing shots of the room. Ellie is trying to find out about Peters intentions and Peter is trying to get Ellie to stay. Not only because he likes her, but because he also needs her story to get his job back. It is at this moment that Ellie finds out about his occupation. In order to gain her trust he assures here that he is not interested in her sexually and that she is "just a headline" to him. Then Peter puts up the rope in the middle of the room and uses a blanket to make the 'wall of Jericho,' according to Peter. He does this to gain her trust. But the situation is till tense. This is when the director Capra, "broke the pathos with some comic relief" and had Peter taking off his clothes to force Ellie to her side of the room. pg.45, first paragraph, Runaway Bride, Hollywood Romantic Comedy of the 1930's, Elizabeth Kendall, Alfred A. Knopf, New York 1990 Then we get a pan shot of Ellie running to her side of the room and looking baffled that she has to put up with him. To further seal the deal as if she has no option but to spend the night in this room with this man, we get a silhouette shot of her lifting up the curtain and looking out at the window at the pouring rain. The movie does a great job of getting the audience of the 1930's engaged in the class warfare between the rich and poor by making it as if the rich girls (Ellie) needs the poor guy to survive on the streets, but yet at the same time the poor guy (Peter) needing Ellie to survive. The way the movie does this is by going against the traditional gender role and the dominant ideologies of male masculinities, through a role reversal. Peter, the poor guy is putting Ellie on a budget and rationing her breakfast. But the glue that holds the movie together and acceptable for the audience at the time, is the sexual tension between the two characters. Nonmatter the class difference or gender difference, the one thing that all of them and the audience have in common is sex.</fullReview>

Capra shows people romantic story at a time when people forget themselves. In spite of the initial disbelief succeeds in doing. It's hard to do a screenplay that is not popular. A spoiled rich girl and talkative journalist. Two disgruntled actors. Clark Gable had to accept a role as a punishment of his studies even though he was keen scenario. Claudette Colbert has often stated that it is the worst movie that is recorded.From so much dissatisfaction and anxiety gave birth to one of the best comedies of all time. At least I think so.In addition to the set design, sound and atmosphere, which are excellent by the way, Capra is managed with two different human character and an average storyline to create a masterpiece. Modern story about falling in love with a slight but pronounced sexual segment, socio-economic differences and excellent verbal duels was hit. ting is a segment that is the film gave the necessary strength.The story is a human and humorous and not even a single moment is not superficial. Disgruntled actors have made one of the best chemistry in the history of cinema. The motif of the opposition, and sending each other two different, intelligent, good-looking men used a million times, but the best effect is achieved in this film. Colbert creates vibrant Ellie, naive, inspiring and inspired by the desire for the ultimate freedom, while Gable is brilliant in the role of journalists, symbols of freedom in American pop culture treasure ridden most acceptable of marriage - alcohol.This movie is still overwhelmed by its freshness and grandeur, and each modern replica acts pale and superficial.

		<shortDescription>Classic romantic comedy with Colbert and Gable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clark Gable dials up the 1934 beefcake with his shirt off in one seen, and Colbert famously stops a car while hitchhiking by revealing her leg, but the movie is quite innocuous, and is better known for essentially being the blueprint for romantic comedies to this day. Colbert is a spoiled, rich heiress who runs away from her family (actually starting this by jumping off a yacht and swimming away from them). Gable is a newspaper reporter who's been fired. They find each other on a crowded train, and are forced to sit together. They hate one another at first, but after spending time on a couple of buses, a car, in the haystack together, and in a hotel room divided by a clothesline with a blanket hanging over it ? well, you get the idea. At one point he carries her across a stream caveman style, over his shoulder, and gives her a swat on the behind as they debate what constitutes a piggyback ride. They confuse each other's motivations and split at the end, Colbert off to wed another (and in a very pretty dress), but we all know where it's heading, and this one is complete with a 'runaway bride' scene. I don't know if the movie was worthy of sweeping the Academy Awards (and Colbert herself didn't think much of it), but it's still sharp with its dialog, and quite entertaining. Aside from the main story line, it has a nice 'Capra' touch in having everyone on a bus (including the driver) singing verses of 'The Man on the Flying Trapeze' to pass the time. I also smiled over this interchange after Gable's character had tossed some newspapers off the bus to make space for his seat:Bus driver: "Oh, fresh guy, huh? What you need is a good sock in the nose." Clark Gable: "Listen pardner, you might like my nose, but I do. I always wear it out in the open, where if anyone wants to take a sock at it, they can do it." "Oh, yeah?" "Now that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago." "Oh, yeah?" "You keep that up, we're not going to get anywhere." "Oh, yeah?" "Ya got me. Yeah!" (to chuckling from the other passengers)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It happened one night" tells a very simple story. Ellie (Claudette Colbert) is a spoiled daughter who runs away from her family. On the way, she meets Clark Gable's character, Peter, a journalist that sees in Ellie a golden opportunity to tell a worth reading news. The movie, then, focuses on the constant relation and friction between the two protagonists, each one with its own objectives. The brilliance of this movie, though, resides not on the story itself, but on how it is told. The director Frank Capra was known for his ability to perform simple shots, such as a conversations and dinner moments. In this film, he is at his best. The screenplay basically consists on Peter and Ellie spending a lot of time together, either in a bus, or in a hotel room. What at first could be seen as a boring ordinary buddy movie is turned into by Capra's hands into one of the most marvelous best picture winners of all time. The rhythm is absolutely perfect and the dialogs uninterruptedly catch your attention.The performances were also sublime. The chemistry between Gable and Colbert was absolutely perfect, and both their characters earn our sympathy from the very beginning. Not surprisingly, both of them won the Oscar for best actor and best actress, respectively. The soundtrack, even though not being as memorable as those from other Oscar winning movies, was amusing, specially when the bus passengers sing "The Flying Trapeze". Personally, I simply love when movies include diegetic music with such competence.My only problem was related to the secondary characters. It is true that the presence of Gable and Colbert is remarkable, but I missed another characters to increase the weight of the movie. It was, however, nothing that disturbed the experience.The Oscar-winner of 1935 has great acting, sublime directing and an intelligent screenplay, deserving even more fame than it already has.

		<fullReview>'It Happened One Night' is a charming film. This is in large part due to its two lead actors. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert have great on-screen chemistry and do a fine job of making their characters and their relationship believable and engaging.Gable and Colbert are helped by the film's screenplay. The story is simple but it provides a great opportunity for these characters to be fleshed out and their relationship to be explored. The film established several tropes common in romcoms today but the characters and dialogue are well written enough to prevent the film from feeling clichéd or dated. It did take me a little while to get into the rhythm of the film and feel invested but by the end I was rooting and cheering for the lead duo.The film is also well shot. This shot - http://pre-code.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/02/ItHappenedOneNight2.png - from the beginning of the film took me by surprise. It was a pleasant surprise. It feels rather modern for a film from the '30s. Most shots from the 30's tend to be wide shots that capture a good chunk of a scene. This applies to 'It Happened One Night' as well and it is not a complaint. They give scenes or conversations a kind of flow that makes it seem more natural. It is a nice change of pace from what we're used to today.Overall, this is a pleasant and engaging film with two well-developed characters played by two well cast and charismatic actors. I wasn't amazed but I would happily revisit it in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eternally Funny, and Optimistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Happened One Night is a great Classical film about society and the American Dream. While being a classical film, reusing old plot points and themes, it had a sense of realism as well, whether that be because of the realistic characters created, or the touchier subject matter. It differs greatly from the first film we watched Modern Times in it's message and it's approach.The message of this film seems to be "If you put your head down and work hard, then you can get through anything." This message is very optimistic, and almost the opposite of Modern Times which was very pessimistic. This film is also a perfect example of Cinema offering an escape, it's not as subtle as Modern Times, but is still hidden under a comedy, so in essence people could see the film, and enjoy it without knowing the message. The message is very optimistic, through the message and characters it offered audiences a chance to hope when times were very tough.I would go so far as to say the whole film was an allegory for society and the American Dream, saying "yes times are tough, but it will get better." The characters are relatable because they were imperfect, they weren't stereotypes, and they resembled the masses, which made the allegory all the more powerful. Audiences could see themselves in characters that would persevere and eventually succeed, further reinforcing that the film offered hope to the masses. Whether or not Capra knew we were closer to the end than the beginning than the end of the great depression is irrelevant, because films like this helped America get out of the great depression and redefined the American Dream. The impact arguably was this film, and others like it helped people be more comfortable being themselves as they were finally being represented in media, they weren't being told to be a stereotype anymore. The impact was both good and bad, as people began to be more comfortable being themselves, society became more open, and less judgemental, but things like divorce rates, and single parent families also rose. Whether or not the impact of this film is good or bad is totally subjective, but I would lean towards positive, because optimism is usually a good thing to give people. Looking at the advanced camera-work, lighting, the countless films it's inspired, along with the timelessness of the message, It Happened One Night may be the most influential films of all time. I know it sounds bold, but when one considers that it was a film unafraid to tell the masses "be who you want to be," that's a message that people still haven't fully accepted today. It also helped redefine, and reinstate hope in the American dream, while offering audiences an escape. It's a very well-rounded film, and it is still present in society today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the First Screwball Comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Happened One Night is a film from 1934 directed by Frank Capra (It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Arsenic and Old Lace) and written by Robert Riskin (Mr. Deeds, You Can't Take it With You, Meet John Doe) who adapted it from Samuel Hopkin Adam's (The Harvey Girls, The Gorgeous Hussy, Week Ends Only) short story. It stars Clark Gable (Gone With the Wind, The Misfits, Mutiny on the Bounty) and Claudette Colbert (Since You Went Away, The Palm Beach Story, Drums Along the Mohawk).It Happened One Night is about a rich spoiled girl who runs away from all of the wealth and meets an out of work newspaper writer and they hitchhike to New York City together and on the way there, they just might find love. This film was one of the pioneers of the screwball comedy genre. So when the Robert Riskin was writing this script, I'm sure he had no idea of the impact this would have on the world. Ever since this film, the formula has been copied over and over again. Even now, this has the classic rom-com formula.The acting in this movie is great. The chemistry between Gable and Colbert is impeccable. Sure Gable's character Peter might be a little of his time (with all the talk of beating Colbert's character Ellie). They still work very well together. Colbert also gives a good performance as the rich girl who just wants to get away from it all. They both won Oscars for their performances.While a good movie, we have all seen this before: two people with conflicting personalities don't like each other in the start, but of course fall in love in the end. But then I remind myself that this is the first movie to do that. In conclusion this is a very funny movie that has a lot of heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairy-Tale for the Twentieth Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ellie Andrews, an heiress, has married a dashing pilot named King Westley against the wishes of millionaire father, Alexander. He tries to keep Ellie a prisoner on his yacht until she agrees to have the marriage annulled, but she runs away and boards a bus bound for New York, where she hopes to be reunited with her husband. Now at this stage the audience doubtless think they know how the movie will end. Westley will be the hero, the villainous Alexander will get his come-uppance and true love will ultimately triumph. Only it doesn't quite work out like that. True love does indeed win the day, but not between Ellie and Westley, who proves to be an unscrupulous fortune-hunter. Ellie's true love turns out to be Peter Warne, an unemployed journalist whom she meets on the bus. At first Peter's only interest in Ellie is also financial; her elopement has aroused great media interest and he believes that if he can get an exclusive on her story, he will be able to get his old job back. After a number of adventures, however, they start to fall in love."It Happened One Night" was one of the last American films made before the production code came into force in 1934, and might have had difficulties getting past the Hays Office had it been made a few months later. That does not mean, however, that there is anything particularly permissive about it by modern standards. There is no violence, and no sex scenes, unless the sequence in which Claudette Colbert stops a car by showing a shapely leg counts as a scene of a sexual nature. Its rather cavalier attitude to marriage, however, might have struck some as excessively daring by the standards of the thirties. Certainly, there were plenty of screwball romantic comedies ("The Women", "My Favourite Wife", "His Girl Friday", "The Philadelphia Story") involving divorce during the late thirties and early forties, but most of these ended up with divorced or separated couples getting back together, which made them more acceptable to the censors. "It Happened One Night" is a romantic comedy which actually involves a couple who start off married and end up with their marriage annulled.This was the first film to win all "Big Five" Academy Awards, namely Best Picture, Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actor (Clark Gable), Best Actress (Colbert) and Best Screenplay (Robert Riskin). This feat would not be equalled for over forty years; it was eventually to be matched by "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest" in 1975 and later by "The Silence of the Lambs" in 1991. In the case of "It Happened One Night" it must be said that all five awards were well-deserved. As was often the case with screwball comedies the basic plot is pretty implausible, but Riskin's script is so sharp, witty and fast-moving that we hardly notice.Gable and Colbert combine so well that it is strange to think that neither was the first choice of the producers. Robert Montgomery rejected the part of Peter and Colbert was only cast as Ellie after several other actresses had turned it down and Warner Brothers had refused to lend Bette Davis, who wanted the role, to Columbia. Colbert herself, in fact, was initially reluctant to take the part, allegedly because she had clashed with Capra while making another film with him some years earlier, but was persuaded to accept by an increase in her salary.Capra today has the reputation of being a director of sentimental comedies which helped Americans to feel better during the tough years of the Great Depression and World War II. There is an element of this in "It Happened One Night" with its Cinderella-in-reverse "rich girl marries poor boy" plot, but there is more to the film than that. It is a film where our expectations are constantly reversed. Ellie, the spoilt, pampered socialite, turns out to be much more resourceful than we might have imagined. Westley, who we expect will turn out to be the hero, turns out to be the nearest thing the film has to a villain, although as he benefits financially from his short-lived marriage there is a happy ending even for him. Peter, the cynical, down-on-his-luck reporter, proves to have hidden reserves of decency. Even Alexander is not such a bully as he at first appears. (And he was dead right about Westley's unsuitability as a husband for his daughter). Capra and Riskin are essentially playing games with and subverting standard movie clichés, producing a modern fairy-tale for the twentieth century. They succeeded so well that the film remains fresh fifteen years into the twenty-first, more than eighty years after it was made. The makers of modern rom-coms, with a few honourable exceptions a pretty fossilised genre today, could learn a lot from them. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Is the Deal With Donut Dunking?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Happened One Night was my first exposure to what I now consider to be my favourite genre of film, the screwball comedy. I'll never forget the feeling of exuberance at watching Clark Gable run to his boss at the newspaper to pitch a story about how he's fallen in love with a princess, such energy, such emotion, I had never felt such a way from watching a movie before. It Happened One Night is the famous and most widely seen film of its genre, and I believe it deserves such an accolade; something unforgettable is happening in every scene, whether funny or tender, jam packed little details to spot on every viewing. It Happened One Night along with Twentieth Century gave birth to the screwball comedy; but it isn't the only sub genre it set a standard for. The runaway princess movie, the road movie and the newspaper comedy all owe their debts to it.In his opening scene Clark Gable is introduced as the king, couldn't be more adapt. Watching the movie closely, I can say that everything this man says is pure gold, from his art of donut dunking, art of clothes removal, the different methods hitchhike signalling and his wall of Jericho. Then it dawned on me just how Seinfeldian this movie is. Much of Clark Gable's dialogue in this movie could be a Jerry Seinfeld stand up routine. It's easy to see how many screwball comedies have influenced modern day sitcoms; all that's missing is the laugh track.Claudette Colbert is one of the most famous incumbents of The Gable Treatment, what I like to call the macho manner in which Gable treats his leading ladies. Of course for any other actor to have this characteristic they would be an unlikable brute, but because it's Gable, it works. I also have to ask did the scene in which Gable eats a raw carrot while attempting to hitch-hike with his usual confidence and cockiness inspire Bugs Bunny? Ah Gable, has never ever existed a more charismatic human being?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a classic tale of the battle of sexes- something that is still so relevant today. We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), who jumps ship from her father's yacht (literally!) in Florida after an argument with said father (played by Walter Connolly) over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley (Jameson Thomas) without her father's consent. Ellie is on a mission- to get to New York to King Westley. But how will she do it? That's how Peter Warne (played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable) comes into the story. Recently fired from his newspaper job, Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York, and, realizing who she is (Her story is all over the news, after all!), offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story- to win him back his job. And so the fun begins. Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances. The trip isn't a smooth one- and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie, which gives us great scenes such as the doughnut-dunking lesson, Walls Of Jericho and the now-classic hitchhiking scene. The humour is still fresh and fast-paced over 70 years later. Oops, I almost forgot the classic 'no undershirt scene' where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses, to reveal (shock horror!) no undershirt, but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of men's undershirts, which dropped dramatically after the film's release (One of the first examples of product placement in film). Great supporting characters, particularly the scene- stealing Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns). Of course it has it's faults- all early talkies do. But any faults are outweighed by the great story. Technically, it was well-made for it's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It Happened One Night (1934): Dir: Frank Capra / Cast: Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert, Walter Connolly, Roscoe Karns, Alan Hale: Charming romantic road comedy about chance encounters. It stars Claudette Colbert as heiress Ellen Andrews who is eloping with a man whom her wealthy father objects too. He demands an annulment but she runs away boarding a bus to New York. On the bus she encounters a drunken struggling newspaper journalist Peter Warne, played by Clark Gable. He promises to help her get to New York if she grant him her publicized annulment details while on the road. Reluctantly, she agree and as predicted they go from bickering couple to actually falling in love. What works is a climax that bares charm and integrity. This becomes one of Frank Capra's biggest directional efforts and it works largely thanks to the chemistry between the leads. Gable brings much humour due to quirky dialogue and a knack for winning the argument, but he plays Warne with heart. Colbert plays the spoiled heiress set in her rebellious ways until a man like Warne says, "no." Walter Connolly plays her strict father who comes around for the right suitor. Roscoe Karns steals moments harassing Colbert on the bus. Alan Hale has a comical appearance as someone who picks them up hitchhiking and then attempts to steal their belongings but is stopped by Gable. Theme switches actions, attitudes, and mental destinations. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even After 80 Years, It Happened One Night Lives Up To Its Legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winner of 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture, and the very first film to win the Oscar "Grand Slam"; a feat only two other films have been able to accomplish so far, It Happened One Night is a wonderfully balanced, oddly whimsical &amp; neatly executed romantic comedy that still retains &amp; resonates all its charm despite being over 80 years old.It Happened One Night tells the story of a spoiled socialite who runs away from her father's clutches to get back to her lover, whom her father disapproves of. While on the bus to New York City, she meets an out-of-work reporter who's in search of an interesting story, and on recognising her in the papers, makes a deal to help her reach New York in exchange for an exclusive on her story.Directed by Frank Capra, the film is sprinkled with fine dose of humour, romance &amp; drama from start to finish, keeps its light-hearted tone alive throughout its 105 minutes of runtime &amp; never loses its momentum at any given moment. Coming to the performances, both Clark Gable &amp; Claudette Colbert chip in with commendable work while their on-screen chemistry is even more impressive.On an overall scale, It Happened One Night is an expertly directed, deftly written &amp; superbly performed cinema that brims with heart, humour &amp; entertainment, and remains as effective today as it was back in its time of release. Cited by many as the first true screwball comedy though I have no idea what it even means, It Happened One Night is a highly enjoyable ride that comes thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It Happened One Night" might seem to be a simple romantic comedy at first glance. A romantic comedy it is, but I can see how it could have won the Academy Award in the 1930's.One Night contains the affluent fantasy of many 1930's films. To the many audience members to whom even the price of a movie ticket had to be a carefully thought out luxurious expense, the typical 1930's film world of mansions, diamonds, gowns, tuxedos, song, dance, and anything you want a mere checkbook scribble away, had a fantastic appeal.One Night gives us that world in the form of movie bookend. Ellen (Claudette Colbert) leaves that world in a rebellious attempt to marry a man who is in reality only after her money. Finding herself in a strange world without her wealth to protect her, Ellen is vulnerable to thieves, con artists, and her own inability to stretch her meager resources. Along comes Clark Gable, whose ability to stand up to her and show her *husbandry* (get it?) allows her to make it to New York without Daddy's detectives or other baddies intervening. To a 1930's audience that no doubt knew how to stretch a dollar (and probably had to every day) the Gable's character's husbandry must have been a source of pride: the rich aren't so great?they are helpless to cope with the problems we common folk face every day.Peter Warne (Clark Gable) although befriending Ellen in order to collect a reward and get a great news story, ends up with neither, only insisting that Ellen's father pay the $39.60 in expenses he incurred in bringing Ellen home. "Love Triumphant" is the headline as Ellen arrives home, and it is so in this movie, for by the end Warne does not value money, only Ellen's love. Again a triumph of the common folk.Surprisingly, even Ellen's father values love over money, hoping Ellen will choose Peter over King, even though the latter's own considerable wealth would be enhanced in terms of what Ellen would inherit. Even he would rather a poor newspaperman for a son-in-law that loves his daughter than a millionaire that doesn't love her.</fullReview>

In her try one man who is also a reporter is helping her in order to have a story to sell to his boss.I liked this movie because of the nice plot but most of all because of the cast and their interpretations. Especially I liked very much the interpretation of Clark Gable who played as Peter Warne and I believe that he was simply outstanding in his role. I also liked the interpretation of the beautiful Claudette Colbert who played as Ellie Andrews. One more interpretation that it had to be mentioned is Walter Connolly's who played as the father of Ellie Andrews, Mr. Andrews. I also want to mention that this movie is a really enjoyable movie because it has a good plot which is combined very well with the interpretations of the cast and of course the direction which is made by Frank Capra.Finally I believe that "It Happened One Night" is a very good movie to watch and I strongly recommend it.

		<fullReview>For a film that was made eighty years ago, it stands up well to the test of time, meaning that the movie not a complete antique. It's a road movie and it deals with themes that will resonate with a contemporary audience. Many of the scenes are hilarious, especially those involving Mr. Shapely, played by Roscoe Karns. The movie has snappy dialog, a fast-paced story, excellent development of the principal characters, and a good upbeat ending. Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable give outstanding performances which reveal their skills as comic actors. The hitchhiking scene cannot fail to provoke laughter. The movie presents a story format that sets the standard for a genre of road movies. The movie also highlights the emergence of an America dominated by the automobile and tied together by roads and highways. Figuring in the story are gas station attendants, motel owners, bus drivers and bus stations, all part of the newly emerging automobile age. A movie of this kind could not have set in a pre-auto culture. This accounts for the movie's contemporary feel. Clark Gable so dominates this movie that it is virtually impossible to imagine anyone else playing Peter Warne. Yet, what makes the movie succeed is its straightforward storytelling about people who want to be break free from the social conventions that are denying them happiness. This is a wonderful and beautiful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here are my notes from when I last introduced it on the big screen...1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea for tonight's film started in a barber shop while Frank Capra was waiting for a haircut he read an old magazine article in Cosmopolitan called "Night Bus" by Samuel Hopkins Adams. It was a cute idea so Capra asked Columbia studios to buy the rights to it and then he forgot about it. Frank's previous feature was LADY FOR A DAY which got great reviews and was Columbia studio's first film ever Oscar nominated and Capra's. Irving Thalberg wanted Capra to make his next film at MGM in exchange for $50k and the loan of a star. But at the last minute Louis B. Mayer canceled the film but honored the deal. Back at Columbia Capra wanted to make Night Bus, but studio tyrant Harry Cohn and all his advisers fought against it. They said things like, "It's nothing; froth, trivia, just another bus picture, no suspense, no heart, no oomph, winter's coming and it's all exteriors." All they could get Capra to do was change the title to IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT which they said was too long to fit on a marquee! Capra tried casting Myrna Loy ? she turned it down; then Margaret Sullavan ? said 'no thank you'; Miriam Hopkins was insulted and said, 'Not if I never play another part'; Constance Bennett told him to go fly a kite and then offered to buy the script and have it rewritten for her! Capra had co-written the script with his favorite writer Robert Riskin but they brought in Myles Connolly who added more sympathetic and interesting characters so people could identify with them. The pretty girl, a spoiled brat, was rich yes but bored with being an heiress now wanting something real. The man was made a guy we all know and like; a tough crusading reporter on the outs with his pigheaded editor. It's The Taming Of The Shrew, but the shrew must be worth taming and the guy must be one of us. Back to casting, this time they went after Robert Montgomery a great light comedian at MGM. Mayer called Cohn and said, "Montgomery says there are too many bus pictures and (don't take this in the wrong way) but going from MGM to lowly Columbia was an insult. But you've caught me in a good mood. I got an actor here who's been a bad boy. Wants more money. And I'd like to spank him. You can have Clark Gable." Surprisingly the next knock on Capra's shabby office door came from a very drunk and cursing Gable, reporting to Siberia as he called it. Gable's objections almost made Capra throw in the towel but then Harry Cohn suggested getting Claudette Colbert for the girl in the story. (He had heard she liked money.) So Capra and Riskin made an appointment that very night to see her at her home. When they arrived Colbert regretted agreeing to the meeting as she was packing to leave on a month long skiing vacation. Capra saw this attractive, wealthy and spoiled woman and knew she was perfect for the part. So Capra, after being bit in the butt by her dog, asked what it would take to get her in the picture. (Capra had directed her first picture, FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE a silent made in 1927 and a flop) To throw him off she said she normally made $25k a picture (a price Columbia had never paid to an actor before), he would have to double it AND she was only available from her studio Paramount during her Christmas vacation. They would have to shoot all her scenes and retakes in less than 4 weeks -- half the time they had budgeted! So Capra called Cohn to ask would he pay her the $50k, Cohn said "I can pay it if you can shoot it in 4 weeks." Capra said, he didn't know, but he'd try. So they told her, "Deal, Claudette! $50k for 4 weeks! Okay?" To which she replied, "Oh for God's sake!" She was trapped. That next day she had to report for her costume fittings and the day after that they begin filming? in a hurry. While they shot film all day Capra edited and rewrote the story to tighten it up at night. To make the film and story move quicker he asked the actors to talk faster, his amazing cinematographer Joseph Walker to shoot faster. They had little time to build sets so most of the film had to be shot on location. If an actor didn't show up one day he was replaced by another and lines were rewritten. Most scenes were shot in one short take and then they sprinted on to the next location. Capra, getting exhausted claimed he felt like a boxer who left his fight in the gym. But, things started to pull together as they filmed. Capra in his autobiography talked about the happy accidents like when Colbert did not want to undress in front of the camera came up with the blanket being used as the "walls of Jericho." Gable to save time undressing skipped wearing a t-shirt, causing t-shirt sales to later plummet. One of the best happy accidents happened when Capra decided to add a scene on the bus of a couple hillbilly musicians who start singing The Man On The Flying Trapeze to break up the monotony. He noticed the extras started smiling and singing along, almost becoming child like. Frank stopped and called for 4 more cameras and his stars. He told everyone they had no time to rehearse but to feel free to join in the singing and ham it up if they wanted too. He then told Gable and Colbert that they were a pair of icebergs when the scene stars and they were to slowly melt. Then they shot it all in one take. Just watch the actor's faces as they naturally shed their inhibitions and join in having fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was a quickest romantic comedy then this would be it. It's easily one of the best movies that had been made.I have firstly watched it without any references just seeing it in IMDb top 250 and that Frank Capra has directed. I completed watching it once, twice and now thrice. It's a simple ride that will be at times too fast as the bus moving in the film and at times lousy as they eat their breakfast. It's not hurried and it's neither slow. This has the perfect pace and Frank Capra, the genius who has given wonderful gems knows how to keep the audience glued.The time it was made that is 1934 could have been so exciting to have seen this and I discovered this movie only last year that is 2010 and yet I was very excited all through for the first time and even now. There are moments that have stood the test of time and this I believe will be appreciated simply for it's authenticity for a real life portrayal by characters.Now coming the movie, it's a tale of a runaway girl who wants to meet the one she loves and along this journey meets a man she falls for. The depiction of such simplicity is strengthened with such conversations that are straight into heart as we can relate to all of those. Like the conversation where our hero helps the heroine save from the detectives while she combs her hair, ah so apt it was. Refulgent this movie shall be for all the romantic comedies.I hugely thank frank Capra for presenting such a delightful film right in 1934.It's 5/5 for the earliest romantic comedy that I am aware of and the one of the best I have seen thus far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It Happened One Night is a movie that puts a smile on your face. Timeless and witty, lovely and down to earth, this is a perfect example of classic cool Hollywood cinema. Colbert is the star here; her odd beauty and endearing mannerisms will keep you mesmerized. Gable is a fitting opponent; although he overacts a bit now and then, he is not annoying. Walter Connolly gives a fine portrayal of Colbert's father and Alan Hale is hilarious as the singing car bandit. On a par with classic 30's movies such as My Man Godfrey and The Thin Man, It Happened One Night is a fast-paced and amusing feel good movie that will make your day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great love-hate rom-com chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is a stubborn spoiled heiress who got married to adventurer pilot King Westley against the wishes of her father Andrews (Walter Connolly). She's stuck on the yacht while he tries to get it annulled. She jumps off the boat and escapes to the bus station. After getting fired, reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable) is traveling on the same bus as Ellie. She doesn't like him even thought he tried to chase down the thief who stole her bag. Then she misses the bus and he realizes who she really is. She needs to reunite with King Westley in NYC. He helps her in exchange for the big story.Legendary director Frank Capra uses his skills to bring a fun screwball comedy. The basic foundation is the love-hate relationship between the romantic lead. It hits on the fuel of this genre which is passion. She hates him so much at the beginning that it generates more than enough emotion to power the whole movie. It's also a road trip which is another crowd pleasing genre. Of course, there is the classic hitchhiking scene. Their chemistry in that scene is amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite part was when Clark Gable is showing Claudette Colbert how to hitch-hike, it was really clean funny. The best part of the movie: was no kissing, no mushiness, no sharing the bed scene. I just love Clark Gable, he was such a gentleman (putting the blanket on a rope in their motel room). Even when Claudette crossed the rope line; Clark told her to get back to her bed. He could have taken advantaged of Colbert but he had decency and respect for a married woman. I loved Claudette's father, what he did towards the end of the movie. In the year 1935, Clark Gable won the award for best actor and Claudette Colbert won for best actress, in this blockbuster movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice comedy - but outstanding enough for an Oscar?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been written so many things about "It Happened One Night" that it's probably not really necessary to add anything else; the plot is known, its huge success (including the Oscar Award for Best Picture of 1934) is known - there only remains one question for me: is it really THAT different from all the other screwball comedies of the time, and THAT much better? We've seen "Ball of Fire", we've seen "Bringing Up Baby", we've seen "Bluebeard's Eigth Wife" and many others of the kind; and they were all about equally funny and equally well made and acted - in fact, some of them are even more entertaining, because with a running time of 105 minutes, "It Happened One Night" is a bit overlong and DOES have its lengthy periods. And there also are MANY other comedies from the same time, which are MUCH less known, and yet almost more unusual and inventive - like "Three Cornered Moon", made just a year earlier and also starring Claudette Colbert.Now was it the studio's PR machinery (and it was VITAL for Columbia to land a success that year, because otherwise they would have gone bankrupt), was it the impact of Clark Gable, who was rising like a shooting star at the time, were it the last glimpses of pre-Code frivolity (like when Claudette Colbert teaches Gable about hitch-hiking, and lifts her skirt instead of her thumb; or the constant talk about the 'Walls of Jericho', the blanket that separated their beds...) - it's all OK with me, of course, it may not be the VERY best of the classic screwball comedies IMHO, but it's surely good, clean fun to watch even today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best romantic movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all Indians know that the movie "Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin", made in 1991 (featuring Amir Khan), was a poor copy of the classic movie "Chori Chori", made in 1956 (featuring Raj Kapoor and Nargis). But very few of us know that "Chori Chori" was also an adaptation of this movie "It Happened One Night" made in 1934? And believe me, this 1934 Oscar winner movie is the best of all these three movies. Although this movie doesn't have the soulful Indian music which we enjoy in "Chori Chori", yet this movie is having far better script and acting than its Indian adaptation.I rated this movie 9/10 on IMDb. This is a must-see for every one who loves romantic movies. Enjoy this movie, it should be an awesome experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Happened One Night (1934)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing My Man Godfrey (1936) I fell in love with the screwball comedies of the 30s, as a lover for rom-coms, screwball comedies were a great find. What I enjoy a lot is seeing these older movies and there story lines compared to todays rom coms, and how they inspired todays movies. It Happened One Night follows a spoiled heiress and a reporter who found her as she was running away from her father. They make a deal, she will give him the story of her if he gets her to New York. The story is fun and playful and you are constantly routing for this unlikely couple. They are continuously getting themselves into, and some how out of, these hilarious situations on their travels. Whether it be them escaping from detectives or the two of them hitchhiking, but what makes these scenes so fun to watch is their crazy and flirtatious ways out. The chemistry between Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable is undeniable which makes the movie so entertaining. The movie is still relatable and enjoyable to watch today, I would recommend this movie to any of friends, and if you haven't seen it either, well make it happen one night!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra +Colbert +Gable= Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is one of the Hollywood legends that in film-lover circuits has achieved a status usually reserved for Scorsese-helmed gangland dramas, Wellesian experiments, and most musicals with Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly. This film, more than any other film of the time before, made comedy classy and personable. It has genuine heart, skillful gags that have no need for pies or extravagant slapstick, and intelligently written characters who are along for a ride, literally and figuratively. It is one of my favorite comedies and my goal for this post is to renew interest in my readers who have already seen it and ignite a curiosity in those who haven't experienced the joy of viewing it for the first time.For those unfortunate ones who haven't yet seen Frank Capra's master work, or simply those who have forgotten its plot, here are the basics. 'Ellie' Andrews, the irresistible Claudette Colbert, is a young socialite from Miami who is bored with her smothering father. She impulsively marries a fortune hunting heel of a man which infuriates her father. She rebelliously runs away and determines to meet her husband in New York, traveling by Greyhound bus. On board, she makes the acquaintance of recently laid-off reporter Peter Warne, the ever charming Clark Gable, who within hours deduces her identity and makes her an offer. She'll allow him exclusive story rights to cover her journey to reunite with her love and he won't tell her daddy where she is. The rest of the movie is a wagon-load of shenanigans that the two of them get into on the bus, off the bus, on the road, in the wilderness, and in the process of multiple overnight rooms. This movie was the boasted favorite of Friz Freleng, one of the pioneers of the Looney Tunes and you can see why. The gags and dialogue are snappy and always effective, all the actors are in rare form, and the story moves at a brisk, yet leisurely pace to compliment the sometimes leisurely, sometimes chaotic journey these two share. Why don't I own this one yet?! Time and generational gaps have unfortunately given It Happened One Night the label of an "old movie", something an unfortunate number of youth today will go out of their way to avoid, which saddens me. I am as much a proponent of classic film as Scorsese or Roger Ebert, and that does not make me old. That makes me educated in a certain regard to history. It Happened One Night was the first of only three films thus-far in American film history to win the Big Five Oscars: Best Picture, Screenplay, Director, Actor, and Actress. This movie is a time capsule of how it was in the Depression on the road. I would rather watch this movie than another time capsule of the Depression-era, John Ford's Grapes of Wrath, since this movie is nothing but lighthearted fun from start to finish. Grapes of Wrath is so heavy-handed and sappy, that it tends to make Paul Haggis' Crash look subtle and that movie could hardly have been less subtle.This film is a bundle of joy wrapped in caustic lunacy with love from one of America's prime comedic directors, Frank Capra, whom most would remember as the maker of 1939's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and the public domain classic It's a Wonderful Life. If you're interested in seeing more from super-zany Capra rather than soapbox, melodramatic Capra, look for 1938 Best Picture Winner You Can't Take it with You. This movie is begging to be watched, so do It Happened One Night a favor, and give it a look. I personally guarantee you won't be disappointed.Final Rating: 5/5 Practically Perfect in Every Way</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartwarming film, definitely worth seeing... even more than once!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Happened One Night (1934; director: Frank Capra), is a wonderful romantic comedy, meant to delight the audience with romance, grandeur, and Clark Gable's charming wit. It Happened One Night is the story of two people from opposing backgrounds having an unlikely meeting on a bus, and how it snowballs into something much more. Claudette Colbert's character Ellie Andrews is fleeing to her husband in New York whom her powerfully wealthy father doesn't approve of, and although she is trying to evade her father's scouts, she is a bit drunk on the idea of finally being on her own. The runaway heiress runs into Peter Warne, Clark Gable's character, who only a few minutes prior to bumping into her had been fired from his job as a reporter (although he pretends that it was he who quit) and needs a story (such as one involving a spoiled heiress throwing a tantrum). They immediately take a disliking to each other, but grow close as they must depend upon each other to reach their separate goals. It's truly very amusing, and the plot's simplicity doesn't affect that, but rather, makes it sweeter. Like with the form of the film, it's better to leave well enough alone and enjoy what it is: an "aww"-type rom-com. It's meant to make the audience feel warm and fuzzy, and maybe like they could be in a situation like it; one where they find true love over the course of a couple of nights of adventure. Trying to pick out a specific meaning for the big picture only leads to testing generic sort of phrases and realizing they all fit the plot; "Sometimes you don't know what you're looking for until you find it", "opposites attract" or really anything other clichéd tagline can be applied to this plot, but to give it credit, It Happened One Night was perhaps the first popular romantic comedy with sound in U.S. cinematic history, so it can't really be clichéd when the clichés are of it. The only real symbolism is the "walls of Jericho", which is a blanket folded over a string that Peter put up to separate he and Ellie, which at the very end after their elopement is shown to drop to the floor.The cinematography of It Happened One Night is unsatisfyingly dull. The plot is certainly cute and amusing enough to keep the film enjoyable overall, but the camera doesn't perform anything special to layer it. Being charmed by this classic screwball film is only achieved if you resolve not to look for any interesting type of camera directing. The audience just wants to feel a part of the story and live it out happy ending and all, so the form seems to have been something that was dropped in priority to what is now considered sitcom level. Even the music isn't remarkable. In fact, the only time I noticed it was in the wedding scene that plays Mendelssohn's traditional Wedding March. The acting, however, is wonderful, most notably Clark Gable's, whose charm makes the film what it is. I loved it, myself... but I am a sucker for a good rom-com.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1934 and in top...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On top of what? Romantic comedies, which this has often been dubbed to be the first, of all screwball comedies. While its not, it's definitely the best. From writing, casting, superb acting, and directing. From Gables inebriated nonchalant disrespect of anything he see as a barrier to a good thing, to his charming and overtly sexual grin, his threatening to (sexually) spank Colbert, to him clobbering a highway thief--this comedy has more romance and adventure, than most romance and adventure films claim to have.There's even some singing, per the era, and it fits nicely into this picture. Colbert was perfectly cast, and does her part well as the spoiled little rich girl, who needed a good "thrashing" and a real man to take charge and plow through anything to "tear down the walls of Jericho". If chem-labs at school were as copacetic as Gable and Colbert, I'd be feeding carrots to lab animals. Their chemistry is undeniable the best sexual, comedic, and dramatic chemistry of any film. This is 1934, and for mainstream films, female legs (and men's), spankings, sexual undertones, women hitchhiking, and the likes, we're frowned upon (not in the dirty B cinemas) and Capra and team did right to keep if PG, or else it'd be a simply lost film, looped in with other, muddy, grainy pictures from the era. This one has a warm, soft tone in the lens. I remember seeing it on TV and VHS years ago, and it's as good as the restored versions. This is a romcom that won't emasculate men, and a bit of cat and mouse, "come and get buddy" action, for the ladies.He gets the girl (or did she get him?), guys and girls are happy, there's a stellar supporting cast, and then the walls of Jericho come down...always a biblical undertone and joke with Capra, but far from religious or pretentious. This movie catered to the depression-era populous, who needed to be entertained, and that's what it did, that's what it does, and that's what it I'll continue to do.Definitely a top 5 film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Screwball Comedy of the Sexes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When spoiled millionaire heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) jumps off her father's yacht, reporters are on the trail for the hottest newspaper story! She finds herself hiding on a bus sitting next to down- on-his luck reporter Peter Warne, deftly played by wise cracking Clark Gable. The story takes off in funny and memorable predicaments for this unlikely couple. Both Ellie and Peter are fiercely independent with their personal goals on the line and yet they are forced to completely depend on each other. Peter is not about to let his lead story escape and she needs him to help her get to New York and "Westley," the weasel husband she married in haste who is only interested in her money. In the meantime, an array of colorful characters including Ellie's father bent on annulling her phony marriage, help make this film a wonderful screwball comedy. This Frank Capra film is the original road trip story packed with fast paced dialogue by Robert Riskin who won the Oscar for best screenplay. Gable and Colbert also deliver great performances that garnered both of them Academy awards! When they find themselves stranded off the road, Peter teaches "Brat" (Ellie) the art of hitchhiking. It is a classic scene, as he fails miserably until cool and collected Ellie succeeds in stopping a car by lifting her skirt and exposing her leg. Clark Gable munching a carrot with his mouth full in a fast talking performance according to Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones of Warner Brothers cartoons admitted was the inspiration for another iconic character, Bugs Bunny! "It happened one Night" is sheer joy to watch and director Frank Capra is at his best. This 1934 gem is why so many other films that came later, copied and recreated so many famous scenes from "It Happened One Night." With very little money, Peter and Ellie register as a married couple to get a room only to hoist a blanket between the two beds;"the walls of Jericho." This is another classic scene and a turning point in the story for the two sparring characters who are falling in love. Even funnier is when detectives hired by Ellies' father, close in on the couple at the motel and they improvise a domestic argument to fool them, only to burst out laughing when the coast is clear. "It Happened One Night" is the first film to win 5 Academy awards including Best Picture. It should be part of everyone's movie collection. 80 years after it's release, "It Happened One Night" is still fresh, funny and the ultimate screwball comedy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evening Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We never truly know who the one is, it could be the next person you talk to, someone we work with, pass by most to everyday, a best friend, but all the same the one we truly love is closer than we think.This is my fourth favorite film from Frank Capra, one of the best things about most of Frank's movies have always been the romance aspect. It works because the way he handles it there is a sense or reality to it because the characters do what any couple normally does interact and decide for themselves on how they feel for the other which makes them feel human. This is another one of the romance stories I actually like because it's done the right way.Yeah the plot line is kinda a stretch, but in a way it also gives the film an almost modern fairytale aspect. And really this is a film that is more concerned about it's characters not so much plot.I really like the chemistry between both of them, they both almost seem like a couple that might not happen due to how slightly flawed both are since both are just a bit on the shallow side. Yet, both of them actually click as they both interact more which makes them warm up to each other and both become even better characters than before which to me is part of what makes a good romance, bring out the best in the other.I really like Clark Gable's character Peter, whom is a down on his luck reporter that is looking to make a comeback. One thing I really like and can emphasize with him is the fact that he's not all concerned about image. The guy doesn't always dress professionally, nor does he really care what anyone thinks of him or even Ellie, he's simply a person that just wants to do his own thing, go his own way.Even like Ellie whom is pretty much a typical modern day princess, that wants personal freedom from her upper class life, let alone running away from a forced marriage to someone she doesn't love. I can also emphasize with her on that aspect of freedom, I love having personal freedom. To me that is just human nature, every person no matter what upbringing must be free to make his or her own choices on what they want their life to be or where to go.Both really have somethings in common, both as I said at first are a bit flawed and that's part of the reason why they haven't got what they truly desired. For Peter he became lazy, when he was famous for his time and had high success as he stated somewhere along the line, he let it get to his head and blew it. Ellie she's was just spoiled though not totally by choice, she could have anything she wanted but never really grew up because she never learned the lessons of selflessness, that nothing is for free, and life doesn't always go your way. However both are somewhat aware of them and aren't when both meet their about to learn their unlearned lessons the hard way.In a way both are sort of pieces of a puzzle that fit because they help fill in that missing portion of their persona. Their back and forth is really funny and touching at the same time. From some typical arguments to how both handle a situation or two along the road. One of my favorite moments is of course when both put on an act as a trashy couple and when Ellie puts on a crying act, Peter says one of my favorite lines in the film "Stop Ballin!" I just can't help but crack up to that because of the way he delivered it.The other thing both have in common is both are looking for something which I feel are genuine ambitions. As I said for Ellie it's personal freedom, for Peter it's redemption in both his career and soul. Both at first see each other as means to their ends. But of course as they spend more time together and go further they begin to really warm up to one another and you can see sparks are just starting to fly, because both are giving each other not so much what they want but what they truly needed but also opening up which is something both have never really done. There is one other favorite scene when both kiss passionately, yeah I know typical love scene but it was really the way both looked at one another, they way they looked at each other was beautiful because they were seeing each other differently than before almost a spiritual awakening in a sense. They begin the realize that what their both looking for and going to was really each other.I feel that this sort of a universal truth with most couples, sometimes the people we go out with, some of them could be so beautiful looking, only to realize after a while they can't give you what you need. But then there is that one person, usually someone really close like a best friend or someone you work with and as you get closer with them you start to see them differently and you find a beauty, one you want to get close to and touch.A lot can truly happen in one night.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road trip escapism at it's best despite a crowded long haul bus, Go Greyhound! Still trying to assess who is who in this early debut of the RomCom. Going with Clark on the "Thelma" role who shows his weakness for drink in the opening scene, and his desperate pursuit of adventure to leave his dismal, unappreciated career life far behind and makes it happen. "Louise" is definitely all about Colbert because she finally decides to take supreme measures to leave her insipid, mundane life for anywhere but here attitude. However, her scheme falls apart by end scene as she succumbs to predictable married life. Or perhaps it's the other way around?? Either way, no canyon crossing here!The Walls of Jericho analogy is probably lost more so on current viewers which dilutes much of the sweet and delightful truimphant notes. Colbert's system of hitchhiking was the highlight of the production. The Haye's Code, most likely in force, was compromised to see a skirt hitched thigh high with that perfect gam and ensuing end result, hilarious! I kept seeing Julia Roberts in "Runaway Bride" in the final scene with her wedding train flowing through the meadows to an escape vehicle. So many other films to mention based on these characterizations, plot lines, and script devices that lead credence to the viability of Capra's vision and use of erratic, crazy, convoluted elements. Great PR for romance on the road, Clark's attempt to be theee MAN in charge (LOL) and an actual AeroGyro demo. Delicious entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original "Runaway Bride"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three time Oscar winning director Frank Capra emerged as one of the most successful filmmakers before, during, and after World War II with classics such as "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" (1936), "Lost Horizon" (1937), "You Can't Take It With You" (1938), "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939), "Meet John Doe" (1941), "Arsenic and Old Lace" (1944), "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946) and "State of the Union" (1948). Before he made movie history with these films, he helmed the first Hollywood epic to receive all five top Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Screenwriter. Starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, "It Happened One Night" qualifies as a road trip comedy about a millionaire banker's daughter on the lam from her dominating father and a newspaperman abetting heiress' every move until they break up inevitable and then reunite at fade-out. Louis B. Mayor loaned out Clark Gable to Columbia Pictures as punishment for refusing to make a movie. Mayer's strategy, however, backfired. You see, the Academy awarded Gable the Oscar for Best Actor. Claudette Colbert received the Oscar for Best Actress, too! Culturally, this contagiously funny comedy of errors is memorable for two scenes. First, Gable shed his shirt and displayed his bare chest. Undershirt sales as a result plummeted. Actually, according to IMDb.COM, Gable ditched his undershirt because it interfered with the flow of the scene when he was shedding his apparel. Second, Colbert flaunted her leg when Gable cannot thumb them a ride. Indeed, history takes some interesting turns. Reportedly, Colbert lambasted the movie before it became a big hit. Furthermore, she dictated that Capra had to lense the action in four weeks. According to Frank Capra, Jr., Columbus paid Colbert twice her salary. "It Happened One Night" brought Columbia Pictures its first Best Picture Oscar.Millionaire banker Andrews takes his own daughter Ellie (Claudette Colbert) hostage on his own yacht after she marries the thrill seeking aviator King Westley. Actually, Andrews detests Westley and later pays him off with $100-thousand dollars. Ellie refuses to let her father coop her up against her will so she dives off the yacht and swims ashore. Andrews offers a ten-thousand dollar reward for her whereabouts. Ellie decides to maintain a low profile by traveling by bus. During the bus trip, she encounters an out-of-work newspaperman, Peter Warne (Clark Gable) and they begin their relationship as adversaries until things change. The wealthy heiress loses her suitcase when a thief snatches it right from under her nose while she is leaning against the bus smoking a cigarette. Warne decides to play Sir Galahad and helps her out when he discovers that Ellie is the object of a national manhunt. Ellie misses the bus after a scheduled stop because she mistakenly believes that the bus company will wait on her. Warne sticks around the bus depot, hands Ellie her ticket, and helps her board another bus. Back aboard the bus, Ellie encounters a character named Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns), and Peter saves her from an evening of his company. A washed-out bridge halts the Atlantic Greyhound Bus. Conserving their dwindling funds, Peter checks them into a cabin as a married couple. In this hilarious scene, Peter strings a blanket that he designates 'the Walls of Jericho' across the room between them as they sleep in separate beds. Our hero conspires to help Ellie hook up with King Westley on the grounds that she gives him the scoop on her saga. During a convivial moment when everybody is singing the song about the man on the flying trapeze, the bus driver steers the vehicle into a hole, and Shapeley makes his big move. Shapeley has learned about the reward so he tries to get Peter to share it with him. Cleverly, Peter lies to Shapeley tells him that he is a gangster who has abducted Ellie. In no time, Shapeley makes himself scarce. Afraid that Shapeley (Roscoe Karns)will still try to get word to Andrews about Ellie, Peter convinces her that they need to refrain from using the bus as transportation. Peter has no luck at hitchhiking until Ellie displays her legs and a motorist (Allen Hale) pulls over and gives them a ride. Naturally, Peter is upset that Ellie has saved the day for them. They get into an argument and things go from bad to worse. Meantime, Ellie's father experiences a change of heart and seek to win Ellie back even if it means accepting Wesley. "It Happened One Night" wraps up with a happy ending.This is a Hollywood classic worth seeing a dozen times or more. Colbert is the original runaway bride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Break down the walls of Jericho! This movie is pretty funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a pretty good romance-comedy. I think some of these modern romance comedies, need to have their producers look back at this film as research, on how to make a good film. Still, why the title? Nothing happened one night? The movie takes place over several weeks, it appears. They first met one night, sure, but it didn't take a night settling to have them, fall in love. I like the title to be, Night Bus like the book by Samuel Hopkins Adams, in which the movie is based on. At less, that makes kinda more sense. Directed by Frank Capra, the movie is told through a screwball comedy that has the two leads engage in a funny battle of the sexes where the woman is often dominating and the male character is often challenge in the masculinity sense. You have to love the fast-pace repartee, farcical situations, and escapist themes here. It's hard, not to get into this film. The format came to be, whenever a major film is trying to avoid censorship from the harsh Hayes Code of the time. Verbal sparring between the sexes often serve as a stand in for physical, sexual tension. Indeed, this movie is a sex comedy without any sex. The screwball comedy also serve as a mention in discuss the issues of social classes between the different of the poor to those of the rich. The movie starts with spoil brat pampered Miami socialite, Ellen "Ellie" Andre (Claudette Colbert) is trying to get out from under her father's (Walter Connolly) thumb by trying to marries fortune-hunter "King" Westley (Jameson Thomas) against the wishes of her father who wants to have the marriage annulled. She wants to run away to go meet up Westley in New York, only to find herself sharing a bus ride with roguish out of work reporter, Peter Warne (Clark Gable) whom is wanting to use her story to get him the biggest new scoop in his life. There are numerous famous scenes throughout the film, that is later recycle, remade or spoof after such as the runaway bride or the famous hitchhiking leg scene. One of the biggest impact, the film had on popular culture was the influence it gave to a certain animator. The scenes with a minor character, Oscar Shapely (Roscoe Karns), continually calling the Gable character "Doc", plus the imaginary character named "Bugs Dooley" mentioned once to frighten Shapely, and a scene in which Gable eats carrots while talking quickly with his mouth full, gave the animator, the idea of Bugs Bunny. Other mentions of "Looney Tunes" characters from the film include Alexander Andrews and King Westley being the inspirations for Yosemite Sam and Pepé LePew, respectively. I do have to say, my favorite scene in the movie is the 'flying trapeze' singing bus scene. While, it's mostly unlikely this would had happen in real life, I have to say the song gives the movie, its charm.I do have to say, while the movie seems lighted hearted; there is several dark humor that is still kinda risking even in today's standards. There is a scene where Warne and Andre act like a hillbilly domestic abuse couple that is a bit disturbing. Then there is a scene where Warne steals a car, after the driver tries to drive off with their luggage. That's still Grant Theft Auto, Peter. You can go to jail for that. It doesn't help his case if he even did go to trial, as he also pretended that he was indeed a gang leader in another scene in the movie, admitting to 'kidnapping' Andre. Still, with his good-natured, street-smart, and breezy performance, Gable would likely be not guilty of the crime, but found guilty on his sex appeal. He did influenced the un-sale of undershirts by taking off his shirt and exposing his bare chest in the film. The acting was pretty good here. I didn't think, Colbert deserve her Best Actress role, as her character wasn't so far off from her real life. Plus, she only took the role because her salary was doubled and she can get a well-planned vacation. Gable was more reluctant participant in the film. It's hard to believe that these two actors are supposed to fall in love with each other, as there was a tense atmosphere as Gable and Colbert did reading. However, they established a friendly working relationship and found that the script was no worse than those of many of their earlier films. Colbert continue to bark trouble during her time on the set, complaining. There are some critics out there that blame the movie for being a bit sexist. Both, Ellen and Peter can seem like unlikeable character because Ellen is a brat and Peter is pompous. His treatment of her reflects his disdain for her class, not because she was a woman. Her behavior reflects her inexperience with the real world, her disdain for his arrogance, and her fear of being out on the road alone. It's very easy to look back and criticize, the social norms of another era but our standards and culture have changed gradually over time; how can we look back and impose those standards on another. I really don't see the movie as sexist at all. The movie did help the bus system more as travel by women substantially increased as a result of the film. Overall: If a fan of classic movies, this movie is one movie, you need to watch. Show a leg, and get hitched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" . . . when it's triumphant." So says Clark Gable, as jaded alcoholic big city reporter Peter Warne. The girl of his dreams appears to be swirling down the drain. It's been a tough week. He loses his job. He pawns nearly everything he owns. He sleeps under a haystack. He gets robbed. He steals cars and carrots himself. But the millionaire is "reimbursing" him $39.60. That's a start. In 1934, forty bucks can buy a lot more booze than it would today. And unlike the preceding 15 years, it is even legal to swill it. Yet, in a few moments, the worm may turn once more. The self-declared married-but-virgin heiress he's been shacked up with these past seven days has one last chance to come to her senses. Could there be a fifth verse of "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze" sung? Can a plumber's daughter eat raw vegetables? Will the "Walls of Jericho" finally tumble? Toot toot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whimsical love story breaks all the rules about love between the classes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First ever winner of five Oscars in all major categories, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay, the 1934 movie It Happened One Night is a whimsical romantic tale of fortuitous love between a spoiled socialite Ellen Andrews played by Claudette Colbert and a cantankerous newspaper reporter Peter Warne played by Clark Gable. The slapstick comedy collaboration from director Frank Capra and writer Robert Riskin, still remains quintessential viewing because of its clever and amusing portrayal of the pursuit of happiness and fulfillment.Ellen, recently married to infamous pilot King Westley (Jameson Thomas) against her millionaire father (Walter Connolly)'s orders is now cooped up on a yacht against her will with her father so that he can decidedly change her mind and have her marriage to the apparent gold digging cad annulled. Defiant Ellen who believes she is in love wants no part of her father's plan for her jumps ship to shore and eventually finds herself on a bus bound for New York. Here she hopes to reunite with her husband and live happily ever after. On board the Greyhound bus she meets Peter, none the worse for wear and recently fired from his newspaper for being drunk on the job. So begins an unlikely series of dealings between the two that stem from them agreeing to help each other out for a price of sorts. Peter recognizing Ellen from newspaper headlines as the much talked about runaway heiress, agrees to help her get to New York while she in turn offers him exclusive rights to her story, his hope is to revamp his career. The journey is series of memorable, classic, comical, events that draw the two closer together. Peter never one to hold back on his opinion and ever nonchalant, often chastises "Brat" his nickname for Ellen, because of her bourgeois tendencies and take on life, whereas he is a down to earth working class man; depicted in sharp close up clarity, every handsome rugged feature proving to be aesthetically camera friendly always defining his cool no nonsense sensibility. The two collide, bicker and banter about everything. There's is not an apparent match made in heaven but their liaison becomes more meaningful the longer they spend together. Peter is assiduous in keeping his promise to Ellen; Ellen is just doe eyed and realizes she is in love with the brash outspoken journalist. A timeless feature that that suggests Ellen's beauty and fragility is achieved with the application of a filtered lens on all of her close ups; this very effective application implies a softness and purity to her character.A notable fact about this seminal movie is the precedent it set for zany romantic comedies that would follow, such as Bringing up Baby (1938) and the Philadelphia Story (1940) both starring Katherine Hepburn and the impact it still has on screwball comedies today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Young people in love are never hu-un-gry!" The granddaddy of all rom-coms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stumbled across this film recently, expecting it to do no more than help me kill some time. Several viewings on, I'm hooked ? it seems almost incredible that it was made in 1934, not 1984 or 2004. There isn't a romantic comedy in existence, and never will be, that doesn't owe a debt to this film. It's funny, modern, charming, and meaningful about people ? what more do you want? Colour? Ah, nuts.Clark Gable plays Peter, a cynical journalist who ends up on a road trip across a Depression-hit USA with runaway heiress Ellen (Claudette Colbert). Ellen's sheltered life has done nothing to prepare her for the trials that lie ahead. She's so certain that she knows what she wants, and what's best: she's naive, but sparky and intelligent. She has to be knocked down in order to have her eyes peeled open.* Some spoilers from here* I thought I knew all about Clark Gable, and wasn't that bothered, but here he radiates masterful alpha-male charm and can switch on a dime from comedy to a love scene, boyish vulnerability to hardboiled cynic and back again. I don't know which version of him I liked more, although I think my favourite mini-moment comes when he's hardboiling it for the telegram girl, pipe in mouth - Philip Marlowe if ever there was one.The script is full of wonderful details ? I don't know how much was in the original short story but I get the impression a great deal must have been added in to make it funnier. Oh, let me count the ways? her not understanding what a real piggy back ride is?his hilariously terrible attempts at hitchhiking?Mr Believe You Me...Peter's "shut up" when they're back on the bus (which brings to mind James Cagney and That Grapefruit)?and then his petulant sulk when he realises he's losing the upper hand, falling in love and just a shade jealous?it's all great.I was hysterical by the time we met the operatic buggy driver ? ever since I first saw the film I've been turning everyday trivialities into Gilbert &amp; Sullivan libretto ? and I just loved Peter's shouty conversation with Ellen's dad. But best of all are the lessons Ellen has to learn. For all her wealth and snobbery, and for all we enjoy her gradual comeuppance, she shows she's capable of learning (finally being hungry enough to eat a raw carrot!), and is worthy of Peter's love. When, near the end, she's weepily describing to her father how poor Peter's opinion is of them both ("you should hear what he says about you!"), capping it off with "?he's marvellous?(sob)?", you're right there with her."It happened one night" is in danger of eclipsing William Powell's wonderful "My Man Gordon" as my favourite thirties film. It's revised my lazy opinion about Clark Gable too ? but it won't make me like "Gone with the Wind" any better, I don't care what anyone says.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It Happened One Night is one of the only three movies since the commencement of the Academy Awards to have been able to win all five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Screenplay), a feat that would not be matched until One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975 and of cause latter on in 1991, Anthony Hopkins The Silence of the Lambs followed suit.Here is a romantic comedy as raw as they come giving you a thrill as you watch two people miss matched from the start found a way to fall in love and tour America on their way to New York. The funny thing about the movie is the name which says, "It happened one night" when actually in the movie's story it actually went on for more than a night.The movie plot is about Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) who has been whisked away by her father in his yacht to keep her away from her new husband King Westley. Ellie then jumps ship, swim to shore and heads off to New York to meet with King Westley. On her way she meets a reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable) and both started as an unsuitable pair that grew to be lovers.Both Colbert and Gable felt the movie was not going to be good enough and gave Capra a lot of bull. Even the movie's iconic scene where Colbert lifted up her skirt to stop a car during the hitchhiking scene, was not so easy to film for Capra as Colbert refused to do the scene claiming it was not lady like, but upon seeing a body double do it, she later changed her mind and did it herself.Although picking up slow, the movie later became one the biggest hits for the studio and the thing is that at the end the movie cleared the Academy Awards and both Gable and Colbert were better off. Colbert is known to have told a friend, "I just finished the worst picture in the world." She boycotted the Academy Awards when she got a nomination believing she will not win, but she was called back to come pick up her award.Here is a movie that actually makes you smile all the way through, although like the actors themselves upon initial siting of the film you can be turned off thinking this is heading nowhere, but be patient the movie has all the familiar scenes that we see in the movies today (all taken from this old classic). This old classic is tagged the 46th greatest film in the last 100 years in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).It Happened One Night is a nice DVD for one to place on the shelf.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful 1930s rom-com!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comedy follows runaway heiress Ellie Andrews (Colbert) who eloped with playboy King Westley (Jameson Thomas), a man her father deemed unsuitable. She meets smart-mouthed reporter Peter Warne (Gable) en route and the antics continue as they mutually reply on each other to get to New York despite their differences.After Ellie Andrews escapes the clutches of her father (Connolly) and tries to make her own way to New York, we get to enjoy seeing her experience such foreign concepts as budgeting, being alone with a man and sleeping rough...mostly done with her upper-class charm, bar the odd tantrum.Rogue reporter Peter Warne, not wanting to miss a chance to get his job back, blackmails her into letting him tag along. Their relationship develops and varies between friends and enemies as they remain stuck with each other. Peter fails to hitch a ride with his thumb so Ellie hilariously hitches one using her leg, a scene mimicked in the Laurel and Hardy classic Way Out West when Stan does the same thing.It was a non-stop film and plenty of fun to watch, though the acting was over the top in places among some of the supporting cast. The atmosphere on the bus was well done with a very entertaining rendition of The Man on the Flying Trapeze.Said to have inspired several Looney Tunes characters, the film thrives on the combination of the naivety of Ellie and the life experience of the more happy-go-lucky Warne as an unlikely love triangle begins to form and plenty of hilarity ensues. It is a little predictable like many rom-coms, though perhaps in the day they kept the audience guessing! This was the first film to receive the Oscar® "Grand Slam": Best Picture®, Best Director®, Best Actress® and Best Actor®. A nice bit of irony for Oscar®-winner Claudette who stated "I have just finished making the worst picture I've ever made".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Birth of Romantic Comedy ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It Happened One Night" opens with two people profoundly disliking each other, a tough, blue-collar, down-to-earth journalist and a rich, spoiled and bratty heiress. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, who both won Oscars for their respective roles, couldn't have played characters that were more opposite in their backgrounds and manners. Yet at the end, following one of the most creative and wink-inducing metaphors in cinema's history, they 'break the Jericho walls' together. Yes, this is an obligatory code of the romantic-comedy genre, but it's precisely because the film is the one that established these very codes.Yet, regardless of its influence on other movies or the predictable ending, there's one thing that makes the film stand on its own as a wonderful classic: it's a director's film and not anyone because his name is Frank Capra. "It Happened One Night" marks the spectacular entrance of the most significant director of Hollywood's Golden Age: a Sicilian emigrant who embraced the American dream with such intensity that it would show in each of his films, comedies or dramas. Through "It Happened One Night", Capra built his reputation of a talented director whose films would forever display a vision of America never deprived of a humanistic touch.I must say though that I was surprised to read some harsh Internet a user complaining about the way Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) was treated by Peter Warne (Clark Gable). Indeed, all through the picture, she got yelled at, threatened and the icing of the cake: she got spanked. It's very eloquent about today's narrow-mindedness and the way every single thing is automatically associated to a conflict between men and women. It's not surprising because it's the very plot element that would drive most of the romantic comedies today. It did well for "When Harry Met Sally?" but it also reduced the genre to bourgeois-like comedy of manners with no other purpose than underlining a sort of eternal opposition between male and women. As for the class struggle, it's now translated to modern fairy-tale format with mixed results, sometimes good ("Coming to America") sometimes, not so good ("Maid in Manhattan") but always superficial in the end. The class struggle is naturally more significant in 1934 in the context of the Great Depression Indeed, Frank Capra, cleverly uses the comedic story to subtly write a social commentary about the America of the 30's, it's not as militant as his later works but it does provide a slice of life of America's people in a few scenes. Some of them reach very dramatic points, like when Peter gives all the money left to a kid whose mother fainted from hunger in the bus. The film provides remarkable examples of the solidarity that prevailed during those difficult times and that were totally ignored by the rich people who lived in a world where everything, everyone could be bought. Gable strikes the viewer by delivering a very punchy speech against Colbert, and we could read between the lines of his rant, what would constitute the essential of Capra's themes and messages in his next films. This intelligent and thought- provokingly humanistic side is the little flavor that remains after the laughs, but there are still laughs. A few romantic comedies try to mix the humor with social commentaries, and the miracle of "It Happened One Night" is that it never contradicts the overall mood of the film, which is very warm and delightful. To a certain extent, the film is Capraesque on the surface but in its core, it's a hilarious and entertaining screwball comedy. The film was one of Columbia's picture major hits and that definitely launched Capra's career: had it failed, maybe we wouldn't have known Mr. Smith or George Bailey, but again, thankfully, nothing ever comes to alter the overall quality. It's funny, romantic and witty. Of course, it's also known for having been the first film to win the 5 major Awards in history, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "The Silence of the Lambs" (coincidentally, all these films won 5 Awards) Well, on that level, what happened that Oscar's night was totally deserved.Capra's directing is very powerful in the way it creates a parallel between the road trip across America and the romance between Peter and Ellie, it's Ellie's immersion into the lives of little people who sing and dance in the bus, who share food, money and laughs, and the realization that she can find happiness in this world. Through Ellie, it's also Capra's way to make us feel for this world and wish people could stand together as they did these days and he makes it through a perfect dosage of wit, of slapstick gags and verbal exchanges, the five minutes of the film about the hitch-hiking are as comedic as comedy can get, with the perfect balance between sophistication and a naughtiness, which is perfect for the romance.Gable is masculine with a very sensitive way about him and Colbert is very strong-willed yet sentimentally vulnerable. There's something extremely childish and endearing in these two characters that seem like constantly playing games, hiding their true feelings, acting tough, as if it was the only possible facade. Like when Gable pretends to be a gangster and then accidentally spits on his sleeve or a more dramatic part where he rejects Colbert's declaration and she bursts into silent tears on her bed. Both Peter and Ellie are like trapped in their own carapace and incapable of making the first step, to our own frustration. But that's the way Capra handles its characters, it's only at the end that everything gets well. See, there are two ways, the easy way, the hard way, and the Capraesque way. It's like the hard way, but wittier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Movies of All TIme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It Happened One Night" is a nearly timeless classic and probably the greatest romantic comedy of all time. Claudette Colbert plays Ellen Andrews, the wealthy daughter from a wealthy family. She's recently married and her father is trying to keep her from her "love". She escapes her father and is determined to get to her husband, King Wesley. Clark Gable plays Peter Warne, a down and out newspaper reporter who has the story of his life fall into his lap (literally). Peter Warne is determined to salvage his newspaper career by getting Andrews back to her husband. Neither he nor Ellen Andrews have any money, so they have to make it across the country on the cheap. As they travel it becomes clear that they are falling in love with each other--- both both Gable and Colbert play their roles perfectly. Falling in love and not wanting to fall in love---because Ellen Andrews is already married---and Peter Warne is only in it for the money that the story will bring him. In all romantic comedies the end is never really in doubt, however the twists that this story takes make it an adventure. The film is incredibly uplifting and fun---the hallmark of a Frank Capra film. This film has inspired many other romantic comedies (such as the "The Sure Thing" and "Runaway Bride" to name a couple). However, this is the real deal. It appeals to audiences of all ages and is timeless. If you haven't watched it before you are missing a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Capra helps sets the standard for acting in Talkie pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who have been keeping track of my Best Picture retrospective, Hollywood movies had been heading towards a downward spiral since adapting the then-gimmick of talking pictures, and most of the previous BP winners were really lackluster (particularly Cavalcade). This film helped save talkie pictures and audible performances, and helped put Director Frank Capra, as well as stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert on the map. With that aside, I never really thought it was that funny.Don't get me wrong; it has its place in cinematic history, and it is an important step in the branching path in the evolution of cinema as an art form. But I never particularly found that much to be funny about this movie, and while it is subjective, the film is a Comedy, and humor is a key element of any given Comedy. There are a few scenes that worked though, particularly the hitchhiking scene. Essentially, Clark Gable was trying to hitch a ride for him and Claudette Colbert to this large group of cars driving by, and Gable tries everything in the book to signal them, and they all ignore them. And then when Colbert gives it a try to another passerby, she shows off her bare leg to him, and he stops and picks them up. There's more that follows later in that scene, but I don't want to spoil the rest because it is a pretty ridiculous series of events.Speaking of spoiling the movie, what is it about? Well, Claudette Colbert is a spoiled, rotten little rich girl named Ellie Andrews that runs away from a wedding to a rich aristocrat and goes out on a ram. Meanwhile, Clark Gable is second-rate reporter Peter Warne that found himself out of work due to the lack of news stories. The two cross paths as passengers on a bus, and he recognizes her because her escapade made headlines (a Frank Capra trademark; absurd news headlines). Unfortunately for her, Ellie loses all of her money and possessions, and is forced to stick with Peter. Seizing the opportunity, he makes a deal with her: he gets to escort her cross country so that she makes a new life for herself, and he gets to chronicle her escapade in detail. To avoid life broke and on the streets, she agrees, and high jinks ensue.Now, let me be frank; while I do not consider this film to be that funny, I still enjoy this movie a great deal. There is a reason why this film works so well: A blend of witty writing, direction that takes full advantage of the medium, and the excellent chemistry between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, audible or otherwise. In fact, back then, not only did this film set the record for most Oscars ever won, sweep or otherwise, but it was the first of only 3 films to have won The Oscar Grand Slam: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay (Adapted or Original), Best Actor, and Best Actress; and it shows.Now if there is one thing to gripe about this game, it is essentially what spawns all the common Romantic Comedy clichés, particularly the bad ones; they start off not getting along, they eventually start developing feelings for one another, a misunderstanding occurs, they go their separate ways hating each other, and then a friend convinces them to return to one another, and it usually ends at an airport (not this movie) where they fall in love again, get married, and live happily ever after.This film though did it much better than almost all of these other movies, because it was new at the time, and it was actually believable; some contrivances here and there, but mainly for comedic effect. They didn't hate each other when they first met; they simply teased each other. They develop a relationship with one another, but we can actually believe it. There's a misunderstanding involved, but they didn't hate each other for a while. Peter ran off to go publish his story in the city and to buy an engagement ring, while at the same time, the hotel owner recognized Ellie from the earlier headlines, and called the police while he was gone. For a while, neither of them were happy, but that was because they were missing each other's presence and not fully aware of it. They both had friends that convinced them to run off again, reunite together and, a recurring gag that bears symbolic relevance, take down the curtains.Overall, even though it introduced a dangerous number of bad RomCom clichés, I will not count it against this film as what followed is irrelevant to the qualities of this film. Besides, I think the positive legacies of this film easily outweigh the negative. Still, I wish this game was a little bit funnier, but I'll let it slide a bit. With that said, unless you really hate Frank Capra, I highly recommend this film to anybody. I'll give this film 8.5 out of 10, rounding it up to 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is supposed to be a screwball comedy, but it was so dramatic it kept me on edge almost the entire time--will she go back to her husband? Is he going to make it back in time? What about everyone else who helped them on this crazy journey? Is she going to say 'I do?' wow! It's old-fashioned in the way women are depicted (colbert spends a lot of her time sobbing and freaking out, while clark gable plays the unmoved, exasperated, in control, wise-cracking, eye-rolling man), the way people talk, and the way 'trashy' relationships and hitchhiking is depicted ('see? i told you they were a nice couple!' still cracks me up.) Yet at the same time, it was surprisingly racy. Apparently a moral code was passed a year after this was released, so we see scenes like unmarried people sleeping in the same room, almost-kissing, cuddling, and one v. shapely leg exhibited during the famous hitchhiking scene. It's great. It's a very beautiful movie; the hay scene with lighting in particular reminds me of Casablanca, and Colbert looks beautiful and very sleek in all scenes; it's like the Inception of the 1930s.The ending is satisfying, and it's a feel good movie--there's no real villains here, and you get a sense that everyone's just an upright, decent person who wants you to win, even if they fired you a week prior, etc. Great lines, great chemistry-- a v. enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Frank Capra's "It Happened One Night" (1934) was deemed "culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant" by the Library of Congress in 1993, and for that it was preserved in the National Film Registry. It is an honor few films have received, considering only 550 out of the hundreds of thousands of films America has produced since film's birth long ago. This is rightfully so, as the film is a masterpiece on many levels and despite being nearly eighty years old watching it today it still doesn't feel dated at all. Its humor is golden, there being so many classic lines I've heard them quoted so many times in other productions and in everyday life even. Not only that but it was a blue print for future films of a similar genre, the romantic comedy everyone's come to know and love, and its influence is unmistakable as well as undeniable. The film encompasses many aspects of the classic screwball comedy that was prominent in the 30s and 40s. Though elements of the subgenre have survived on for years in modern comedy, the screwball comedy of the early twentieth century represented a specific point in American history. Take for instance Claudette Colbert's character, Ellie. Besides being beautiful, she is intelligent, especially compared to the minor male characters. We see this in the opening scenes and one of our initial reactions may be to think of her as nothing more than a spoiled brat. However, the clever writing uses her somewhat awkward and clumsy nature amongst the everyday people and bus travelers not only as comedy, but as a way to draw sympathy for the character. We soon see that she is alone in her plight, and so arrives the charming Peter Warren, played by Clark Gable. Peter Warren appears and quickly distinguishes himself from the other male characters in that he is not only intelligent, but he's a man of honor and dignity. Not only that, he's street smart and humble compared to Ellie's would be husband. Consider the well-played foil of how Peter is on a simple bus, in sharp contrast to the groom who arrives at his wedding in a plane of all things. It is on the bus where the majority of the character interaction takes place. The two seemingly opposite personalities are brought together by fate, another one of the trademarks of screwball comedy that became a principle of romantic comedy as a whole. Throughout the film, one hears dialogue in rather a series of quips almost, the comedic insults and quirks of the characters. You see this with many of them, but it is strongest with the two star crossed lovers.That is one of the beauties of screwball comedy. This "sex comedy without sex" achieves its sexual tension without being lewd at all. Despite the lack of today's raunchy style, the dialogue is so rich, and the actors so talented with lines, you can feel the attraction building. Before it even reaches the dénouement, you can hardly notice how much closer the characters have become due to its sublime subtlety. Romantically speaking, the hay scene is the high note, as we finally see the boiling romance between the characters that they previously denied or really had no intention of. But also, and perhaps for memorabilia and sentimental laughs really, would be the hitch-hiking scene. It's not just incredibly hilarious, but Ellie finally proves her worth to Peter who previously had cared for her almost as if she were a helpless damsel. It's brilliant characterization at work. The mise-en-scene of this film is another one of its main attractions. On one level, it represents the social status differences and qualities of the character. In many shots of Ellie's father (Walter Colbert), we see the fine wine and other assorted alcohols. In sharp contrast, the first time we see Peter he's drinking out of a bottle in a telephone booth. The remarkable beauty of the film's artistic mise-en-scene though comes out in its night scenes, especially in the rain. The camera and lighting really illuminates the characters in those scenes. It makes them stand out amongst the others as if they weren't even there. As time goes on, night after night, the two literally and emotionally draw closer to one another." It Happened One Night" is a masterpiece on many aspects. It is a classic that represents the birth of a genre and a picture of human emotion. Alas all that, it is a frozen moment in history, giving illusion to a time that has been forgotten by some. Taking all that into account, along with the majestic authenticity of the glorious black-and-white days, it truly stands the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Practically flawless cinema from Frank Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's "It Happened One Night" may be his finest picture, which is somewhat surprising since it doesn't exhibit the trademark Capra style of later films like "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" or "It's a Wonderful Life". No, "It Happened One Night" is an unabashed romantic comedy and one of the best (if not the very best) of all time.The story concerns a spoiled heiress (Claudette Colbert), on the run from her controlling father, who meets up with an unemployed newspaper reporter (Clark Gable) on a night bus to New York. They decide to work together to their mutual advantage but what starts out as a business arrangement gradually develops into something more.The film's embarrassment of riches begins with its stars. Not only do they deliver excellent performances individually but together they have wonderful chemistry. Gable's performance is probably the best of the two but both were deserving Oscar winners. Besides these two, the cast is uniformly solid, including supporting standouts Walter Connolly &amp; Roscoe Karns.The film is distinguished as the first to win all five major Academy Awards. Besides the aforementioned Oscars for Best Actor &amp; Best Actress, the film also took home Oscars for its adapted screenplay (by Robert Riskin) and direction (by Frank Capra) along with the prestigious Best Picture Oscar. Only three films have ever captured all five awards. Pretty elite company, to be sure, but well warranted given the quality of each contribution.In the end, "It Happened One Night" is a film that's practically without fault. Despite being over 75 years old it's still as vibrant as the day it was released. Without a doubt, it's a must-see for any self-respecting film fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have a single artist in charge. Capra, from top to bottom shines through this little fairy tale. Of course, he had to be lucky enough to land Gable and Colbert. Well, luck is the residue of perspiration, or something like that. . .IHON is NOT the first "screwball" comedy. It is not a light, fluffy piece of "Capra-corn." Nor is it a fairy tale.This unique and remarkable film stands alone like a Colossus astride converging worlds of film-making, unable to be categorized, refusing to fit into a formula.It is filled with reality: the scourge of the depression is never far away, the charm of ordinary people, in ordinary situations, making them far from ordinary. The ugliness of people, so easily drawn to crime of one kind or another, and the human spirit, resilient, flawed, stubborn, immature at times, and confused, lifting itself about all.**Spoiler** An excellent example of this (there are a multitude) is the singing of "The Man on The Flying Trapeze". A spontaneous celebration of humans sharing a common experience and musical language (long lost, tragically, today) which elevates them (if just for a moment) above the difficulties of their lives. How beautiful. Then, we are shocked back to a different reality with the passing out of the child's mother. This is quite disturbing and not the usual fodder of the so-called "screwball" comedy. No, it approaches the works of Chayefsky or Wilder, or rather, they approach this films juxtaposition of the tragic and the comic.As far as the performances, look--Gable is perfect. It is impossible to take one's eyes off him for a moment and I say this as a confirm heterosexual. Gable is MAN, child, Sage, and fool, wrapped up in Peter Warne, a complete and fully realized human character. Bringing him to life, Gable is brilliant. It may be the greatest (forgive me, Jack Lemmon) single comedic acting performance ever made. Gable. No wonder they called him, "The King." Colbert is as well, as perfect, not a missed moment or note. She glides through the role as an ice skater warming up before an event, free and unencumbered, angry, vulnerable, phony, pure and wise. All can be seen in her visage and tone. What a performance.Roscoe Karns. Need I say more? I hope not. Perfect.Please note the absence of a soundtrack. None is necessary as the film provides its own, in its counterpoint of people of a multitude of melodic styles, faces, colors, attitudes (OH, yeah?!?!?), in its flight from fear to laughter, in its harmony of all these playing simultaneously. Who needs a soundtrack.Beautiful.Perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Opposites Attract</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rich girl (Claudette Colbert) runs away from home. She runs into a newspaperman - played by the always dapper Clark Gable - who offers her help, but only because he hopes to scoop the story of her flight from her rich and renowned father. Much hilarity and goofiness then ensues, until our heroes bridge the class divide and fall in love. Cue ending.Modern audiences will find this stuff tame, and it is one of director Frank Capra's weaker pictures, but the film is interesting enough from a historical perspective. The Hays Code was on its way in, the age of "talkies" had arrived, the Great Depression was in full swing and hack directors were busy turning cinema into a glorified version of stage theatre.And so "It Happened One Night" is primarily an interesting time capsule, flirting with sexuality and immorality, conning us into laughing at a rather misogynistic plot, celebrating the invention of sound cinema with much song and dance business and carefully selling another love-conquers-money dream to its impoverished Depression Era audience.Would modern audiences buy such a tale today? Of course they would. The template of many "opposites attract" romantic comedies starts right here, and ever since Rob Reiner "updated" Capra's film with "The Sure Thing" in 1985, movie studios have been retelling this tale, in one form or the other, virtually every year.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To modern sensibilities, "It Happened One Night" is a tame cliché of a love story. Although tabbed as a classic "screwball comedy," in fact it lacks the essentials of that genre. It is neither as funny nor as romantic as the best of the screwball comedies. The end is visible from the beginning, and the road from start to finish doesn't travel a route that is particularly entertaining. Nonetheless, this is a landmark film of the 1930's and it deploys three of the great talents of that era: Frank Capra as director and Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert as the two hostile personalities who eventually fall in love. I never thought much of Gable when I was young but my mother often said he was the handsomest man alive. Colbert also pales alongside contemporary sexpots yet she was considered one of the most beautiful of the stars (back in the days when Stars were Stars). And Capra was considered a master movie-maker in his day. Although tame by contemporary standards, "It Happened One Night" is worth viewing as a milestone of an earlier era. Bearing in mind the limited technical resources available at the time and the no-sex code imposed by the Hays Office, I think it's worth 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best romantic comedies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best comedy-romance films ever made. It isn't the funniest movie, by a long shot. It doesn't' have the running dialog of witty repartee. There's no slapstick and there are no pratfalls. No scenes lead to rollicking laughter. There are no hilarious escapades or frantic goings on as in screwball comedies. There are no zany scenes of frantic farce as in the best Marx Brothers films. And, the film doesn't spoof or poke fun at various groups. Perhaps the absence of so much in these areas is what befuddled some of Hollywood and the critics ? but not all. Because even the members of the film academy saw something special in "It Happened One Night." They may have been swayed by public opinion, when this low-budget, second-tier studio movie packed the theaters and topped the all-time box office for Columbia studios to that time. It finished the year in fourth place, after such lavish MGM productions as "Viva Villa" and "The Barretts of Wimpole Street," and the Paramount extravaganza, "Cleopatra." There's more than a little irony in the fact that Claudette Colbert won the best actress Oscar for this film, and wasn't nominated for her role in "Cleopatra." Especially, when most film histories note that Colbert told associates that she had just finished making the worst film ever, when shooting finished on "One Night."Not only did the public like this film, but the academy honored it with the big five Academy Awards. Columbia was then a second tier studio, but won for best picture. Clark Gable and Colbert won the top acting awards. Frank Capra won for directing, and Robert Riskin won for the screenplay. "It Happened One Night" was the first film to win the big five Oscars, and the only one to do so for more than four decades. Only two others have done that since ? "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" in 1975, and "The Silence of the Lambs" in 1991. My DVD of the film has a special feature short, "Frank Capra, Jr. remembers ? 'It Happened One Night.'" It was made for Columbia Tri-Star in 1999 and has interviews with Frank Capra, Jr. He had an erudite observation of how performers can misread the quality of a movie. It explains how Colbert thought so lowly of this film until after her Oscar. "Many times," Capra Jr. says, "actors don't realize what is being made. They see today's dailies, they see tomorrow's, they see yesterday's. It's disjointed. They don't know which takes are being picked. They don't know how it's being edited. They don't know what's in the director's mind of how this picture is going to actually be. So, sometimes they don't realize what their part is like."So, what is it about this film that makes it so great? It's a very good plot ? and one of the first that began a decade-long run of rich heiress films. The comedy was subdued in places, and the film had a perfect mix of romance and humor within a range of different encounters and events. It was a perfect setting for a road-trip romance. And this film came out early in 1934, just when Hollywood was beginning to enforce its production code (aka the Hays Office, Breen Code, etc.). The only "daring" scenes that came anywhere near raising censorship eyebrows were Clark Gable taking off his shirt to show his bare chest, and Colbert's lifting of her dress to above her knee as a hitchhiking ploy to stop the next car. This one in particular is worth a hearty laugh because of the expression on Gable's face when she does that. It's a perfect representation of the culture of the time. The film is a prime example of the better humor that often came out of Hollywood films that toned down the "risqué chart" in favor of clean, genuine comedy. "It Happened One Night" will likely remain a favorite for generations to come. It's a movie that leaves one satisfied and smiling. One has a feeling of having spent a couple of entertainment hours very well.</fullReview>

Even if they made a remake of the movie it would be terrific to have Megan Fox, Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson to parody Claudette Colbert, but they are razz actresses. So I think Kirsten Dunst, Natalie Portman, Kate Hudson, Kate Beckinsale, Claire Danes, Cameron Diaz or Anne Hathaway should be a terrific choice. The actors that can be a good Clark Gable would be Will Ferrell, Aston Kutchner, Alex D. Linz, Chad Michael Murray, Owen Wilson, Jon Heder or Ben Stiller. Instead of showing one leg in the classic version the woman would show both her legs in the remake for a person to stop the car. This remake is going to be much different from the original version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra's 1934 film "It Happened One Night" paved the way for many copycats; even the soap opera "General Hospital" had a story arc that involved a runaway - bridegroom this time - and those famous Walls of Jericho. Not only that, but it changed the undershirt industry and inspired a famous bunny pose.The story takes place during the Depression, when hitchhiking was common. It concerns an heiress, Ellie (Claudette Colbert) who runs away from her father to join her sort-of husband in New York. On the bus, she meets a reporter named Peter (Clark Gable) who is down on his luck. The strike a bargain: Peter can have an exclusive on Ellie's story if he'll help her get to New York.Though many actors turned down the lead roles, the combination of Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is perfect. Gable is appropriately a gruff know-it-all with oodles of sex appeal; Colbert is beautiful, spoiled and uppity. My favorite moment is when she coolly informs the bus driver that she's leaving so hold the bus for her.Any even peripheral fan of the film has heard that when Gable undressed and was wearing no undershirt, sales of undershirts plummeted. Perhaps a little less well known is that Gable's standing by a fence talking with a carrot in his mouth is allegedly the inspiration for Bugs Bunny. The most famous scene, of course, is Gable demonstrating how to hitch a ride and failing and Colbert lifting her skirt to get one immediately.Frank Capra is known for his feel good, idealistic films, but there was much more to this director than that, as "It Happened One Night" demonstrates. He gives the film a wonderful pace and gets marvelous performers out of his cast, which includes Walter Connolly as Ellie's father, Roscoe Karns, Alan Hale and Ward Bond. It's a comedy, but Capra shades it with earmarks of the Depression. A slice of life in the 1930s, a wonderful comedy - well, in the end, it's a feel good film after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, timeless film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are the stars of Frank Capra's legendary romantic comedy, 'It Happened One Night'. Decades later, the film still feels fresh, has lost none of its charm and is a pleasure to watch.After the opening credits (accompanied by some appealing theme music), we are introduced to Claudette Colbert's character of Ellie Andrews. She has locked herself in her room on a boat which belongs to her over-bearing father. He is threatening to annul her very recent marriage to 'King' Westley because he disapproves of him. After an argument develops, she jumps ship and swims for the shore, with the intent of going straight to New York to meet up with her new husband. While taking a bus trip to reach her destination, she encounters Peter Warne (played by Clark Gable), a newspaper reporter who eventually recognises her after seeing a front page story of her as a runaway. After he threatens to turn her in unless she stays with him in order to give him headline news, she reluctantly makes the cross country trip with him. Things don't always go to plan, which allow some humorous scenes, and there is an attraction that develops between the two. The question then, is who will she end up with by the time the film ends?This is a film which deserves its status. Not only is it a wonderful, feel-good movie, it is great in all aspects of cinema, and has hardly dated a bit. The films energy and performances from all the cast keep the film from feeling stale, even after more than 70 years. The script is cleverly written with some truly laugh-out-loud moments. What makes this film even more remarkable, is the fact that few people involved in it, with the exception of Frank Capra, had much faith in it. Even the stars of the film, particularly Claudette Colbert, were unenthusiastic to say the least. Thankfully though, the film turned out incredibly well.'It Happened One Night' also has a place in cinematic history for being the first film to win all 5 Oscars in the main categories, an achievement that was not equalled until 1975's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest'. Some viewers today remark at how unlikely it would be for a romantic comedy these days to receive such an honour. That being said, it's not a film that is going to be forgotten any time soon, and it certainly should be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You would think that after over a century of having the Motion Picture around as a Business as well as an "Art", that we'd have some formula or two that could be applied and, Wah-La! Success, we have an Oscar winner. We do have formilae, but they're all too evident. The success of a picture is often just good old fashioned, "Pot Luck!" As in so many other cases, Director Frank Capra's IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (Columbia, 1934) started life as a short story in the hallowed pages of The Saturday Evening Post. It was Samuel Hopkins Adams' story titled "Night Bus", and it was adapted to the screen no less than four times. In addition to this 1st time with IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, there was Columbia's 1956 remake, YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT, with June Allyson and Jack Lemmon; as well as both Fillipino and Turkish productions. Like so many other Capra films, Robert Riskin was responsible for the screenplay.Simply stated, the plot goes something like the following. A cocky and rebellious newspaper man, Clark Gable, decides to tell off boss, and go freelance, all on his own. He does so with a bottle and a telephone. Meanwhile, spoiled daughter (Claudette Colbert) of ultra rich(though sympathetic)father(Walter Connolly)decides to run off from her scheduled marriage, leading father and his army of Private Detectives on a merry cross country chase, from Florida to NYC via a Greyhound-type Bus.Ex-reporter and rich Heiress cross paths, and the fun all begins. Was it going to be business for Peter Warne(Gable) as a "scoop", that would allow him to name his ticket anywhere in newspaper business? Or was this to become a case of personal involvement for the two? A see-saw, back and forth series of events then transpires and we have one of the best pictures ever. And to think, it was all do to other studios lending a couple of their Stars to lowly Columbia.MGM lent Gable to Harry Cohn's "Poverty Row" Columbia Studio as a punishment for misbehavior in public. Paramount likewise lent out their lovely,sexy and sophisticated Leading Lady, Miss Claudette Colbert, reportedly against her will. The two reportedly did not hit it off so well, but their professionalism prevailed.We must mention again a great assembly of supporting players that gave such life and seeming spontaneity to the story. We had Alan Hale, Ward Bond,Jameson Thomas, Arthur Hoyt,Blanche Frederci,Charles C. Wilson, Irving Bacon and even Bess Flowers. Special mention has to go to Roscoe Carnes whose possibly career's best role/performance did so much to add sparkle to all of his his scenes. He also provided a comic relief as fast talking, lecherous Traveling Salesman, Oscar Shapley.("Shapley's the name and that's how I like 'em!") In spite of all these problems and a short shooting schedule, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT swept the Oscars with Best Picture, Best Actress(Miss Colbert), Best Actor(Gable), Best Screenplay(Riskin), Best Director(Mr. Capra).It was interesting to observe our "young 'uns" and getting their reactions to a film that is now over 70 years old. Well, it appears that the age has little, if anything to do with their enjoyment and appreciation. As our 30 year old Michelle Ryan, now of Arlington, Virginia, stated, "There is a big difference between 'movies' and a 'Film'." And IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT should be on everyone's list of "Top Films"!</fullReview>

The screwball comedies of the 1930's all contain a nourishing endorsement of 'happily ever after,' not only as a possible destination and resting place, but as a necessary one. 'Happily Ever After' is fated in these movies, and we have the comforting pleasure of watching the two potential lovers find their way into that paradise.

		<fullReview>"It Happened One Night" is an example of what happens when everything in a movie works just right. This movie probably had low aspirations when it was first released in 1934, but everything clicked so well that it's now considered to be the supreme example of screwball comedy, one of the best movies of the 30s, and one of the best movies of all time.Clark Gable and the adorable Claudette Colbert could not have more chemistry together. Their sassy back and forth is a joy to watch. And though this movie came out in the first year of the enforced Production Code, their relationship is refreshingly sexy. Dig Clark Gable in his undershirt (gasp!). And check out Claudette Colbert's shapely gams when she uses them to hitch a ride in one of the movie's classic scenes.Though the film is light and frothy, the spectre of the Depression isn't totally absent. For example, in one brief scene, Gable pauses at a railroad crossing to watch a freight train go past, loaded with hobos presumably off to find work somewhere, anywhere they can. One wonders if this was even staged or if Capra happened to catch an authentic moment from a dark time in America's history.The screwball comedy is not a genre that's managed to survive throughout the years, so all the more reason to enjoy this funny, breezy, sophisticated piece of cinema magic.Grade: A+</fullReview>

Facing with the incoming marriage with Westley, Ellie had to make a choice.Any words are futile to describe wonderful performance coming from Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.

		<fullReview>Romantic comedy is one of the most fun of all movie genres; a great one is mixed with a nice balance of romance and humor that is very enjoyable for the actors and the audience. Today, these "rom-coms" are much more cynical and bitter; almost to a point of not being funny or romantic at all. They also so rigidly follow a formula that it becomes incredibly difficult to find any part of the story that is surprising, refreshing or even remotely entertaining.Here is a film that very well may be the first example of what is considered a romantic comedy. Often called the first screwball comedy, this is anything but for there are very few fast-talking dialog scenes and the on-screen couple don't get into too crazy of situations. Directed with down-to-earth sincerity by that great American director, Frank Capra, the story of a spoiled young woman taken from her high society settings and stuck with a wise-cracking, handsome man who takes her under his wing and sets her straight is as old as the hills. And yet, it works here effortlessly due mostly to the wonderful and realistic chemistry between the two lead actors.Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, two of the biggest stars in Hollywood at the time, reportedly both disliked the script and only did it for money and steady work. Neither would have thought that an Oscar for each and huge acclaim was waiting for them on the other side. Each actor's personality complemented the other perfectly; Gable's smart-ass remarks and smug grins against Colbert's soft, delicate yet independent facial expressions. Another element here handled much better than today is the parental issue. For most parents in these movies, they are either blithering idiots with no mind for parenting or bull-whipping tyrants with no evident love for their children's welfare. Here, the father is a little hard but is certainly filled with love and only wants what is best for his daughter.Still, perhaps this film will live one forever because of the incredibly smart and funny script. Based on a short story, screenwriter Robert Riskin fleshed out the characters and threw in some really great one-liners revealing not only the conflict between the main characters, but also the features and mannerisms that would put them in future situations. Nearly every scene is wonderful to watch unfold. The great timing between Gable and Colbert adds to the snappy dialog and makes the watching all the more enjoyable.It is amazing what has happened to practically every part of the great medium that is film a mere 80 years later. What was once great comedy and great romance together in the same story today turns into wild and illicit sex or stupid, dumbed down physical comedy and cheap laughs. Sometimes they have both; but here it comes down to well-written and acted characters along with two very likable actors letting their personas shine and the story do the talking. It really is true when they say they just don't make them like they used to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Excellence Overcomes Being Slightly Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It Happened One Night" is a clever, warm comedy which mixes in a hint of attitude. The female lead character, Ellie Andrews, is in her early twenties and lives in an old-fashioned U.S.A. where women are invested with significance by the males who govern and guide them. Her wealthy father has detained Ellie against her will on his boat, because he wants to annul her recent marriage to a man he despises. Ellie escapes and hits the road with fired reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable), both endeavoring to get Ellie back together with her husband.The night scenes are beautiful, with light luminously dappling the darkness - the night crossing of the stream and the bedding down beside the hay carts are awesome.Director Frank Capra eloquently brings to life inclusion in God's vast family by portraying a makeshift community of bus passengers joining in song.Yes. This film is somewhat dated by the inferior status of women and the two-bed accommodations for a supposedly married couple; but to be fair to the writers and Mr. Capra, they worked under the intimidation of the Hays Office restrictions: a ludicrous and un-American brand of censorship which was in the vigor of new enforcement when this picture was made. Keeping this in mind, the viewer can see that the writers and director managed to cleverly slip some of the sensuality of real life into the movie.Despite any minor qualms, "It Happened One Night" is a delightful comedy which achieves excellence and is well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Happened One Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Happened One Night was the racier of the screwball comedies. There was much more sexual tension between Clark Gable's and Claudette Colbert's characters, who showed much chemistry on screen. For example, when Gable is undressing in front of Colbert during their first night together and lastly when the blanket separating them is thrown down in the last scene-in which they aren't shown, even though they are now married. I liked how each was mistaken at the end (but are brought together by her father). Gable was great in this movie-it reminded me a bit of Carey Grant in His Girl Friday-the cynical newspaperman who really just wants to get the story (and the girl). While I enjoyed this movie and thought the acting and plot where excellent and it was very well made and realistic, I feel Bringing Up Baby the funnier and better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In movie-making, the best things happen through collaboration. It Happened One Night, easily the finest Best Picture Academy Award winner up until that point is what it is thanks to a perfect teaming of talents in its writer, actors and director. This exceptional group created a picture that is the essence of 1930s Hollywood ? one of the most neglected and misunderstood periods in cinema history ? and yet is universal enough in its appeal to be widely enjoyed today.Let's begin with the writer, one of the unsung geniuses of 1930s cinema, Robert Riskin. While everyone knows about the directors who couldn't handle sound or the silent stars who found themselves out of work, it's rarely remembered that screenwriters had a hard time adapting too. No-one seemed to know how to balance dialogue and action, and one of the weakest elements of many early talkies is the screenplay. It Happened One Night is one of the first really beautifully constructed screenplays of the era. Riskin's pacing of the budding romance is spot on, ensuring there is never a dull moment by smoothly easing us from romantic intimacy to comic absurdity. One of the most effective juxtapositions is when the coach passengers all join together to sing "The Man on the Flying Trapeze" just before the coach crashes. The song draws into the warm feeling of community spirit, making the crash more of a jolt. Riskin's dialogue is abstract in that it is witty and almost poetic at times, but every sentiment is believable, and makes the characters larger than life.The early 1930s had also seen a scramble to define a great screen performance. The Academy Award-winners for acting thus far had been a very mixed bag, with a tendency towards rewarding the most grandiose theatrical performances. While the previous year's Best Actor ? Charles Laughton as Henry VIII ? is admittedly the most watchable and absorbing slice of hamming I have ever seen, and totally deserving of the prize, it was not of a style that could become the norm if the talkies were to progress. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were not spectacularly good actors, and there are many better performers who were never even Oscar nominated. But they deserved the awards here because It Happened One Night captures the fullness of their admittedly limited ranges ? form Gable, suaveness and street-smartness, from Colbert haughtiness and sophistication, and from both a flair for comedy and down-to-earth realism. Most importantly they make their characters likable, something that the deepest or most versatile players still sometimes fail to achieve.And now we come to producer-director Frank Capra. Capra had a massive ego when it came to marketing his own brand, but on the screen he took a decidedly relaxed approach, using long takes and few camera movements. One of the best things a director can do to aid the actors is simply give them space to act in, not cluttering up the scene with a lot of bizarre angles or tracking shots. Capra often does something known as "cutting down the line", which means during a scene he switches to a closer or more distant shot without changing the angle. This technique is sometimes frowned upon, but it is effective because it steps up the intensity of a moment without changing the positioning of the performers in relation to the camera. Capra keeps his attention-grabbing whip-pans and close-ups to a functional minimum, using the former to draw us into a scene (like those horizontal wipes), and playing the latter like a trump card at moments of emotional intensity.Writer, cast and director ? each was ideally suited to the material. This was the only way in which a picture this special and this enduring can have been made. The auteur theorists may not be able to accept this, but the Academy did. It Happened One Night landed the Oscar "grand slam" of Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Credit where it's due.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It all happened in 1934</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie, made just 5 years after the invention of sound in the movies, is watching the invention of movie making itself.With only 5 years experience in scripts for "talkies", this script is outstanding. It is not a stage play on celluloid, the dialogue is wonderfully emotive and not descriptive. The tone is light but not too light. There is enough space between the word and the role to create a character.What is more remarkable is the absence of sentiment. A lot of movies from that era "create" the moment for the audience: the music decides when the viewer needs to be scared, to be touched, to cry. Here there is no such forced reaction. And yet the order of the events keeps us interested, keeps us with both lead characters and their emotions.The funny thing is that it is a comedy, often referred to as the first screwball comedy, but it has no jokes. There are witty lines, of course, but no "laugh or I'll shoot"-remarks. The funniest bits are when Claudette Colbert proves how to get a free ride by showing her leg and the driver who comments on everything by making a song of it. Those moments could be clichés now, but at the time they were original and fresh, and even to a 21st century audience, used to so many comic situations, those scenes are still funny and touching .The sympathy and understanding that this movie show for humans in general gives the viewer the same sympathy and understanding. How not to be touched by the scene in the bus where people are singing a song they all know, and where strangers take turns singing the different verses. To see such community feeling in an era that was struck by poverty and despair is heartwarming.Both leads achieve to be likable and believable just by portraying a round character. A film that celebrates humanity, extraordinarily simple but touchingly effective, and that in 1934!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happened One Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it's evident why the many attempts to re-capture the spirit of this film have failed. The story really isn't all that good. What works is watching how Clark Gable (as Peter Warne) and Claudette Colbert (as Ellie Andrews) make the most of the script, with help from director Frank Capra. They play the reluctant lovers quite magically - coming across like a couple of performers having fun with the project. Possibly, the sparring of their characters parallels the two stars discovering their professional "chemistry". There is a sense of fun (the script calls it "screwy") about the film, thanks to Mr. Capra and his famous stars.Most memorable are the leading couple's "risqué" scenes - Mr. Gable baring his chest when explaining how men undress, and Ms. Colbert lifting her skirt to hitch a ride - they are sexy and tasteful. And, Roscoe Karns' "Oscar" is worthy. The ability to create "fun" from "dumb" was improved on, in better films - but re-making this rather dated and unappealing story would obviously be futile. You can't re-make Capra, Gable, and Colbert - and that's what happened one night.******* It Happened One Night (2/22/34) Frank Capra ~ Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert, Roscoe Karns, Walter Connolly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It needed only one night ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>? and that night was 8th January 1976, which was the first time I saw this All Time Great. Although I've seen it well over 10 times since it never fails to charm, captivate, amuse, entertain and defragment me, they being the opposite effects most modern movies have on me. Frank Capra made some great films, but imho he didn't better this simple little screwball comedy with its Love (Ultimately) Triumphant message.Grouchy newspaper man Gable bumps into coquettish runaway heiress Colbert on a bus trying to get to New York to marry an ugly gold digger to spite her father. To get the story he helps her but they gradually fall in love of course - this is the logical how and why of it, with the central witty and natural performances from Gable and Colbert as sparkling as the lustrous photography. As a by-product True Love between the classes was also shown to be possible, although of course in this case neither class had Breeding. There are some delightful characters to savour along the way ? the tongue-tied Ward Bond, the garrulous Roscoe Karns, the operatic Alan Hale, and the blustery Walter Connelly. Favourite bits: dunking doughnuts; piggybacking; hitch-hiking; the Walls of Jericho making it alright; frightening Shapely; the repartee on the bus(es); the clinch by the haystacks in the gleaming arc-moonlight ? and so much more!To me it's ascended into timelessness ? it seems less dated than most films made from the '50's to the '80's - the only films that will temporarily look less dated than this are perhaps those made in any current last couple of years. And no matter how corny I always relate better to real people than to Imperial Stormtroopers or cgi cartoons. Thoroughly recommended - this is a brilliant beautiful film, absolutely inconsequential and one of my top 10 favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It Happened One Night" may be a movie for its times, but its humor, its tenderness, its "love for the little guy" and its interesting detail of what life on the road was like in the 1930's, makes this movie so watchable 71 years later. Not too many flicks can withstand the test of time, but I suppose the "battle of the sexes" genre that permeates "It Happened One Night" and the honest dialog that fills the script can still resonate with us (it does me)so many years later. It was made before Hollywood explored the dark side of life and so "It Happened One Night" does not tell you much about the grimmer aspects of the 1930's. It only briefly alludes to the joblessness and hunger that many people experienced (a woman faints on the bus, and there's a train full of hobos), and does not touch race relations during those years whatsoever. Instead, in no maudlin way, it seems to try to show that there is decency in everyone, from a hustling reporter looking for a scoop, to a rich heiress trying to find happiness in her own right. That they should find love in each other, despite their differences, is what makes the movie so hopeful. If that's too naive for some to stomach, the sophisticated humor in such scenes as the Walls Of Jericho and the donut dunking lesson, help ground the movie in some reality. "It Happened One Night" got the Oscar for Best Picture in 1934, and as far as I'm concerned, would deserve it again today. It is delightful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent romance/drama; not raucous comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the movie many times. I was puzzled that sometimes I liked it a lot, and other times I wondered what the fuss was about. I finally figured it out: the movie is a sweet, delightful, amusing romance and should be appreciated for that. It is not really a raucous comedy. I just saw it again tonight. I noticed that there was not a good laugh, hardly a chuckle, for the first hour! (Though the "Yeah? Oh, Yeah!" scene was nice, as was his comments about writing books on undressing, dunking, etc.) In fact the only good laughs in the movie are on four occasions, all near the end: **** minor spoilers**** (1) when they pretend to be bickering marrieds to throw off the detectives, at the motel; (2) the great hitchhiking scene (Gable has most of the lines, but Colbert's few reactions and smiles help the scene enormously); (3) when he is driving back to the motel with the money, and her entourage races past him coming from the opposite direction; and (4) when he meets/gets paid by her father.The movie gets better and better as a wry, tender, erotic, romantic drama once we get past the first hour.Two small points of logic that break the spell some: (1) nice scene, but it was silly to give the boy practically all their money (a $10 bill, quite a large amount in 1934) because they wouldn't take the trouble to get change for the bill; and (2) it was reckless/stupid of Gable to leave her despondent, asleep and unaware of his plans as he leaves for an extended period to raise some cash and then return. ****end of minor spoilers****Another small point: I wouldn't call it a screwball comedy. For practically the whole movie Gable was direct and honest with her (and she with him) as to their trip together.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

This only prove that Frank Capra was one great director with great sense for heartwarming stories and that quality is hard to find in any of the newer directors. And in the end I can say that i really enjoy Capra's movies and for me he is the greatest director of old school.

A sense of adventure, and discovery, wit, and romance... that always brings me back.Now it's plain to see, Cary Grant and Claudet Colbert are wonderful together.

It Happened...doesn't have the beautiful sights of Rome, but makes up for it with the dazzling banter between Gable and Colbert. Colbert was an outstanding pre-Code Hollywood actress, and this movie, though it was made after the code was in place, shows some of the same vivacity she had in those earlier films which would later fade. This is a classic that any movie buff shouldn't do without.

The pace and timing throughout this movie is impeccable and I really enjoyed Claudette Colbert's role as the wealthy heiress trying to escape her father's wrath and find true love. The movie is a lot racier and more risque than many movies of the '40s and '50s. There also seemed to be a lot more location shooting than you find in most movies of this era.This movie works a lot better than the more modern sappy romances for me, like "Sleepless in Seattle" and "When Harry Met Sally." Wile all of these stories are simple and contrived in such a way to ensure everything works out "for the best" in the end, it somehow seems a lot more believable with Gable and Colbert at the helm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Summer 1933, Columbia Pictures paid $5000 for the rights to "Night Bus," a short story written by Samuel Hopkins Adams that appeared in the August issue of Cosmopolitan. After completion of Lady for a Day, director Frank Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin began work on the film adaptation; as several bus-related films had recently failed at the Box Office, they changed the title to It Happened One Night.Columbia Pictures, a small studio with few stars under contract, made it a company policy to borrow exspensive brand-name talent "as needed." So when Capra wanted MGM's Robert Montgomery and Myrna Loy for It Happened One Night, Columbia's president, Harry Cohn, sent the script to their boss, Louis B. Mayer. Althuogh, both stars were unavailable, Mayer surprised Cohn when he insisted that Columbia take MGM's top leading man, Clark Gable, instead.With Clark Gable confirmed as reporter Peter Warne, Capra turned his attention to casting the Ellie Andrews role. After Miriam Hopkins, Margaret Sullivan and Constance Bennett turned him down, Capra approached Paramount's Claudette Colbert, who didn't want to play the heiress either. Instead of saying no, however, the actress made Capra an offer she was sure would be rejected: $50,000 for four weeks work. To Colbert's amazement, Cohn agreed to her terms.Production of the $325,000 project began on November 13, 1933. Although Clark Gable was initially reluctant to work on It Happened One Night, he warmed up to Capra, and gave a charming performance, one that would forever cement his screen image as a breezy, good-natured man of the world. Claudette Colbert however was another story. Although she too gave a winning performance, the actress did not want to make the film and continued to give Capra a hard time throughout production.After her scenes were completed, Colbert went on vacation to Sun Valley, where she told friends, "I've just finished the worst picture in the world."It Happened One Night was released on February 23, 1934, to moderate to indifferent reviews. But audiences across the country adored the film and made it the sleeper hit of the year. The first screwball comedy, It Happened One Night, went on to sweep the Academy Awards, winning all five major Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actor (Clark Gable), Best Actress (Claudette Colbert), and Best Screenplay (Robert Riskin). But it was Claudette Colbert who knew exactly who was responsible for It Happened One Night when, after accepting her award, she graciously told the Academy, "I owe Frank Capra for this."

This film is the one that really started the screwball comedy genre, and its influence is still very strong today. Definitely one of the seminal pictures in motion picture history, a deserved 5-Oscar winner. The excellent writing and acting are pulled together under the brilliant direction of Frank Capra, undeniably the greatest film director in terms of conveying a powerful story. Hitchcock and Welles may have been the masters of detail and technique, but when it comes to absolutely selling a story to an audience, Capra is tops. What a legacy he left for future generations to enjoy! His film IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is still the most often-watched film at the holiday season, but IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is one of the *very* very few truly perfect films ever made.</fullReview>

This is without a doubt one of the greatest love stories ever filmed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want a funny, sexy comedy with a great cast and a sparkling script, you don't have to go any further than IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. The first film to win all four major Oscars (Best Picture; Actor; Actress; Director) when the Oscars still counted for something, IHON is the touching, funny story of a rich girl Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) who meets reporter Peter Warne (a delightfully charming Clark Gable) on her wayward way to New York. Along the way, the mismatched couple pretend to be married, wade through streams and sleep in haystacks, hitch-hike and, of course, fall in love.The script is delightful, the direction marvellous, the acting superb. Clark Gable is on top form here, and I dare any female viewer to watch this movie and not be completely charmed by him. ;) He's debonair while being a bit gruff around the edges, tough but sweet, kickass but caring. Anyone doubting Clark Gable's legendary charm and appeal (I did, before I saw this) should only have to watch this movie to discover it for themselves.My favourite bit would have to be, of course, the running theme of the Walls of Jericho. Watch to find out for yourself... certainly the best extended metaphor I've ever seen in a movie! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic runaway screwball comedy with Gable and Colbert at their best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The minute Gable and Colbert meet on a bus headed for New York, you watch the chemistry between them--little glances, a shrug, a look of disapproval--everything clicks to make the two characters people you want to watch for the rest of the movie, no matter how predictable you feel the ending might be.Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert both richly deserved their Oscars for this, as did the film and director Frank Capra. It's still got that magic despite the very obvious fact that it is forever imprisoned in that 1930s look of hair style and clothing on Colbert (must have been a tough decade for women to look attractive!!). Or maybe it's the fact that everything looks so antiquated (including the bus) that it only makes the comedy more endearing. And somehow, the two of them having to share a motel room while it's pouring rain and with only that thin blanket between them--well that must have seemed pretty risque back in 1934. Whatever, the dialog is ripe with some witty lines. The doughnut scene is priceless and shows just how fantastic Gable was with comedy. And his demonstration of how each man is different when it comes to undressing is another example of his comic flair. Colbert, of course, matches him every step of the way, reacting with such naturalness to all of his impish behavior.A joy from beginning to end. If you can get past how dated the film looks, you should have no problem enjoying it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things I learned from "It Happened One Night"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. Young people in love are never hungry.2. There IS a certain method of attaining full pleasure by dunking donuts into coffee.3. Pawn shops are very useful. If you've got anything of value to pawn that is, and having a millionaire Father with his own boat is incredibly handy.4. The limb is mightier than the hand when it comes to the task of hitching a ride. Problem is in 1934 it was easier to trust strange drivers.5. Very easy to steal cars by knocking people out and tying them to trees. I'm just never going to try it.6. Never leave your bus ticket on the seat.7. You CAN and WILL get to New York on an amount of $4 if you don't buy chocolate, sleep in hay stacks overnight, eat carrots and persuade motel owners you are staying for a week. Of course, it always helps to travel with an unemployed newspaper reporter who has the upper hand threat of black mail. 8. Never be afraid to call home in case of emergency, even if there's not a fortune and fiancee waiting. 9. Blankets are sufficient walls of Jericho to keep the big bad wolf out.10. Ignore all of the above. No one is crazy enough to play cat and mouse if wads of cash are waiting. Without a doubt, this still rates as Capra's best award winning success, by being the first film to sweep the five major categories at the Oscars, including the coveted Best Picture of 1934. Capra-esque trademarks and some of the most famous scenes are a part of this classic comedy which made screwballs popular. And the screenplay is full of absolutely delicious moments! Gable and Colbert are at their comic best, it would have been nice if they teamed together again. They both deserved their Oscars. Capra's direction was excellent, but he just got even better, picking up another two best director oscars in four years, this success marking his first.Although my favourite movie of 1934 is still "The Thin Man", "It Happened One Night" is one of the best movies ever made from the 1930s.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

I had intended to watch only the first few minutes before flipping channels, but was swept into the farcical situation and ended up going to my New Years party somewhat later than intended. Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable were inimitably charming and delightful... their clothed banter had more scorching sexual innuendo than most of today's stars can muster. I'm no prude, some of my favorite flicks my grandparents would probably have a heart attack if they were alive to view, but it was curiously refreshing to enjoy a "wholesome" sexual comedy.

		<fullReview>Watching this movie, made me merge my mind back into the 1930s and wish that I was Clark Gable!! This movie, with the great Frank Capra directing, is a wonderful story about a romance that on paper just shouldn't be. Claudette Colbert plays the young daughter of a rich Wall Street businessman who swims away from her father while traveling on a boat. She meets up with Gable's character, Peter Warren, on a bus set to go to New York City. That's where the fun begins! The chemistry between Gable and Colbert is there. They feed off of each other and have an enjoyable time making this movie. You can just tell. It's easy to see why this movie won the 5 big Academy Awards!</fullReview>

Clark Gable, one of America's greatest legends, turns in one of his two best performances of his career (along with Gone with the Wind, of course!) and is perfectly matched by the hilarious and spunky Claudette Colbert. Frank Capra directs, but avoids the sentimentality that some dislike in his Jimmy Stewart classics, Mr Smith and Wonderful Life.

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This film is fun. Clark Gable has some great bits, including some with `Shapeley.' But along the way, it demonstrates a couple theories I have about successful films.The first is that the actors are often the last ones to know what a film is all about. They have a different set of concerns than the filmmaker. Sometimes this is taken advantage of by the filmmaker, who exploits the unwittingness of the actor. The Coens do this all the time: they'll have one actor who is clued in and at least one actor who is not and there is a several-layered goof on the target.Here, Ms. Colbert walked through this picture more or less as the character she played: completely at the mercy of forces around here but believing she was in control; absolutely oblivious to the actual manipulations at work. She thought the picture was bad, a well known story that. But I think that except for the few cases where the actor is the only attraction (think of the bombastic performances of the latter DeNiro or Pacino for instance) the actor and filmmaker are working at crosspurposes.The second of Ted's laws is that nearly all successful stories includes itself in some referential way. This is a (movie) story about a (newspaper) story. The people engaged in the creation, the reporting of the movie are mirrored in the characters engaged in similar reporting. This is a pervasive narrative device, so much so, I've decided to write a book about it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

Clark Gable does a very interesting role and Claudette Colbert is really brilliant but my favorite remains Walter Connolly for his splendid art to translate the emotions of a father, force of rich man and wise character in Shakespeare jester form. a beautiful film who is little more than slice from old period or a comedy from others but a nice example of impeccable work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To fully appreciate this movies a second time I would suggest viewing version with the directors son's commentary during the picture. He gives such an inspiring outlook on just how remarkable this picture was having been made with limited time and budget. How under appreciated it was by the producers to make, how the main actors were more or less coerced into doing the picture. How it was first met with so so reviews by the sophisticated New York City audience. Yet it was made so across the US of A it was put in theaters and what do you know it remained there for a record number of weeks. The movie goers of the time enjoyed it so they went back to see it again bringing family and friends cause they knew they had seen something truly awesome. Come Oscar time it took the five biggies, Best Picture, Leading actor and actress, writer and director. A feat not repeated again until One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. Yes this is a gem and that it became so at such odds makes it more so and should be in every movie lover's library! I loved it :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here are my notes from when I last introduced it on the big screen...2/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is part two of my two part introduction: ... Another unexpected accident came years later when legendary Warner Bros. animator Tex Avery told the story of how he came up with the idea for Bugs Bunny by watching Clark Gable eat carrots in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT! A sound man on the film later told Capra the story of how he over-heard Colbert complaining to Gable about making the film (she thought it her worst) and Gable defended Capra saying he Gable was having a blast and that Capra was on to something. Well they finished the film on time and it opened at Radio City Music Hall where it only played for one week. The reviews were good but mixed and the box office not as strong as Capra's previous movie LADY FOR A DAY. Then ? it happened. Happened all over the country ? not in one night, but within a month. People took longer to find the film, in the Midwest, in small towns, the word of mouth spread and surprise it was funnier, much funnier than usual. But, the biggest surprise of all, they could remember in detail a good deal of what went on in the film and they found everybody else did and that it was great fun talking about this and that scene. And let's go see it again and take the neighbors. The quietness burst into the proverbial prairie fire. Theaters sold out for weeks and weeks. Critics went back for a second look, a third, a fourth.Astonishingly enough, the news about It Happened One Night was not that it made Classic status but that it got made at all. Oh and buy the way it, was the first film to sweep all five of the major Academy Awards and the only one for 48 years! Colbert did not want to even attend the Oscars so she went in travelling clothes, seems she was leaving that night to go on that vacation she missed. So when her name was called she ran up grabbed the award, said thanks and dashed out the door only to STOP. Turn around. Go back up on to the stage to the microphone and added, "I owe Frank Capra for this." Gable said the same. Meanwhile, my favorite director Mr. Frank R. Capra went on to have a wonderful life. I used to call him at his home on his birthday (he was in the phone book) to thank him for making this film, and then MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, LOST HORIZON, YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, MEET JOHN DOE and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. I used to call him on my birthday too. I told him watching his films again, was my present to me. With the help of film preservation, I hope you can always enjoy his presents to all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Remains The Best Romantic Comedy Ever Released On Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Happened One Night is a romantic comedy film with elements of screwball comedy directed by Frank Capra, in which a pampered socialite tries to get out from under her father's thumb, and falls in love with a roguish reporter. It features Clark Gable,Claudette Colbert and Walter Connolly.The plot was based on the short story Night Bus by Samuel Hopkins Adams, which provided the shooting title. Ellie Andrews is a spoiled heiress who has married fortune-hunting aviator King Westley, despite her father's objections. To keep Ellie from marrying this Lothario, her father has been holding her prisoner aboard his yacht. But Ellie bolts from the yacht, swims ashore in her clothes, and eventually slips onto a Greyhound bus bound for New York. Aboard the bus is newspaper reporter Peter Warne, who has recently been fired for drinking on the job. Peter gets the last seat on the bus but when he gets up to argue with the bus driver, Ellie takes his seat. Since it is the last seat on the bus, they have to share it. When Ellie has her purse stolen and she refuses to report it, Peter begins to suspect something. The next morning, they both miss the bus after a leisurely breakfast, and Peter reveals that he knows her identity. She makes a deal with him: if he helps her get to New York, he can write a scoop about her for his paper. Peter thinks she is a spoiled brat, however, and refuses a monetary bribe: "I'm not interested in your money or your problem. You, King Westley, your father you're all a lot of hooey to me" But as they travel northward and engage in a series of misadventures, the gruff newspaperman and the spoiled rich girl, thrown together by circumstances, fall in love with each other.Director Frank Capra took home every major Oscars for this seminal comedy. Funny and sexy, the film is full of memorable scenes often referred to in other films, such as the "walls of Jericho" and Colbert's famous flash of thigh to stop a speeding car in its tracks.This is Capra at his best, very funny and very light, with a minimum of populist posturing.His brisk, urbane brand of wit was a perfect complement to his populist faith in the common man, and that inspired combination makes this film both a spirited entertainment and an uplifting experience.This is still is pure delight to watch at present and it still remains the best screwball comedy ever released as remains unsurpassed by the countless romantic comedies it has inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the original....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often, I don't bother reviewing films with a bazillion reviews already or films that are classics. After all, what could one more review contribute? However, I have a reason to finally review "It Happened One Night". Tonight, I watched a god-awful mess called "You Can't Run Away From Love". Why? Well, because it starred Jack Lemmon and I almost always like his films. Sadly, after a few minutes, I realized it was a musical remake of "It Happened One Night". And, sadly, it VERY closely followed the original--and that's the problem. Seeing Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in the original is charming and both fine actors were at the top of their game. Jack Lemmon and June Allyson (especially Allyson) were pretty bad--and it's so apparent when they are parroting Gable and Colbert. It made me appreciate the original so much more! So, if you are bored and have nothing to do, do NOT watch the remake!! Watch "It Happened One Night"--even if you've already seen it before! The film is charming, funny and sweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film that is as charming as it is funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of the timeless classic that is It's a Wonderful Life, comes It Happened One Night, a wonderful film that is as charming as it is funny. While some parts are quite idealistic, it is essentially a screwball romantic comedy and a great one at that. The direction from Frank Capra is classy and dignified and cleverly gives us an insight into gender and class status, and the screenplay is sophisticated and funny. The humour still works, I found myself laughing when Clark Gable said "now don't tell you're in love with the bus driver" for example. The cinematography is beautiful and dynamic and the music is richly and sensitively scored. The acting is very, very good. Clark Gable looks handsome here, and he gives a close to hysterical performance as Peter, with his impeccable comic timing and witty humour. Claudette Colbert is lovely as Ellie, the spoiled yet somewhat independent heiress who Peter falls for. The two actors show great, charming chemistry together on screen, and they are terrifically supported by especially Walter Connolly as Andrews. The story is relatively simple, but I liked its simplicity, it was effective. Overall, a wonderful, funny and charming film. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #107: It Happened One Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>107: It Happened One Night (1934) - released 2/22/1934, viewed 8/2/08.Alcatraz becomes a prison. The first Flash Gordon comic strip is published. BIRTHS: Hank Aaron. KEVIN: What can be said about this seminal rom-com classic that hasn't already been said? This is one of only a couple of 1934 releases that we've seen previously. When we first rented it, we watched it twice before sending it back, which was extremely rare at the time. Even then, I wasn't exactly sure why it merited a second viewing. One of the many things I like about this movie is how it's one of those classic films that was never designed to be a classic. There was nothing particularly out of the ordinary about its production, and yet the planets aligned just right so that the end result swept the major awards at the Oscars for the first time ever. Even when you watch the movie, you're not likely to find anything unusual or innovative about the story and the characters, except that they are all top-notch. Both Gable and Colbert take their potentially bland roles and breathe beautiful life into them. Gable's struggling journalist Peter is kind of a jerk on paper, and not just because he's exploiting Ellie for a story. He seems to want to bring Ellie down a notch and give her a humbling lesson about common folk that she'll never forget. He insults Ellie and her upbringing in nearly every scene. He tells Ellie's father (played by the excellent Walter Connolly) that what Ellie needs is "a guy that'd take a sock at her once a day, whether it's coming to her or not." But Gable's likability and charisma make Peter's undeniable love for Ellie (in the context of all that outward disgust) feel honest and not a contradiction. How is that even possible? Peter creates something of a monster in Ellie, who exceeds his bitter expectations when she metamorphoses from a spoiled, shut-in heiress to a spunky and resourceful heroine (re: the limb is mightier than the thumb). Colbert hits just the right note to make Ellie likable and even at times relatable, yet never losing the sense that this is an upper-crust kind of girl. Then there's the chemistry, which crackles every moment they share the screen. These two probably bad-mouth each other more than they are ostensibly nice to one another, but the script drops in all those subtle hints that these two are really growing attached throughout their journey. The episodic storyline is perfectly paced. I don't think there is one scene that runs too long or too short in the entire film, and every character and subplot is paid off by the end. Frank Capra made a lot of perfect movies, and this one was the first of those.DOUG: 1934 begins with Frank Capra becoming an A-list director while giving birth to the screwball comedy with It Happened One Night. Not bad, Frank. What's with that title, though? It has nothing to do with the movie. I'm not going to bother summarizing the plot, so I'll just get straight to the review: When I first watched it some years ago, I thought Peter was a little too mean. I don't think that anymore (any girl with $2 her pocket who indulges in bus vendor snacks is in need of an escort), though he probably couldn't get away with some of the things he says or does today. The hitchhiking scene is my favorite, and not for the reason you think; It's Claudette Colbert's shining moment. After taking so much abuse from Peter, she finally gets to upstage him and make him look stupid. I can't believe this hasn't been remade a hundred times over. There's The Sure Thing, which follows the model, of course, but I'm surprised we haven't seen Hollywood do a literal remake, especially in this age of celebutante heiresses splashed all over the media. (Not that I'd want them to, mind you. It's just?odd.) Although it became a huge hit and a motion picture classic, it's easy to see that IHON was designed as a small film.Last film viewed: One Hour With You (1932). Last film chronologically: Design for Living (1933). Next film: Tarzan and His Mate (1934).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty situational humor with great leading actors overshadows classic clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It Happened One Night" is a classic love story yet its best feature is that it surprises you: it's not chock-full of clichés (though not devoid of them either) and it has an enduring sense of humor that all generations can appreciate.The film stars two classic screen actors in Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert playing Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews, one a recently fired journalist and the other a runaway heiress who meet on a bus to New York. For Peter, this scoop could save his career and for Ellie, well, she needs all the help she can get to make it to New York alive. The two develop an unlikely relationship exchanging humorous jabs as they bus, hitchhike and hijack their way and of course while neither will be the first to admit it, there's no hiding their feelings for each other from the audience.Classic films tend to rely on the prowess of their marquee actors and Gable and Colbert are terrific together. Both are humorous and play a wide range of emotions. Gable is one of those stars that has that intangible "it" factor that just makes him seem so incredibly important in every scene. There is a strong tension between them the entire film that is funny at times and romantically intriguing at others.The writing, however, is what makes this a standout classic. The way Peter wiggles his and Ellie's way out of tight situation, namely those that would result in Ellie being found out, is genius. Robert Riskin does some of the best witty dialog and scenes. The best parts of the film are when Peter and Ellie are alone, either in their motel room or out in the forest. The tension between them is highest and it makes the dialog that much better. This is a film that you remember the scenes. Like a play they all carry their own weight and interest. What happens next is not as important as what is happening."It Happened One Night" only suffers from a cliché ending. The humor shifts from wit to just laughing at the film in general because you know the inevitable will happen and anything that tries to stay in the way at that point is just--pointless. Anyone who loves classic situational and near-farcical comedy will love "It Happened One Night" and with good reason. It's enjoyable for all generations but it's very true to the era, definitely an escapist depression-era film because it concerns itself with the wealthy and pokes fun at them. There's even a song though it's incorporated in a more drama-focused way, no theatricality.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a classic for a reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely adore this movie. Even though the first few moments are a bit clunky, once Ellie gets on the bus and meets Peter, the magic starts.Colbert and Gable are wonderful together. They play off each other so well. This is most evident in the fight they stage in the cabin. I've seen this movie at least a dozen times and I still laugh at that "argument".My other favorite moment of the movie is the "Man On The Flying Trapeze" sing along on the bus. I can't even really explain why I love that scene so much. Perhaps because it's so simple and joyful.I really enjoyed the character development in this film. I love watching Peter and Ellie start out as strangers who are pretty much disgusted with each other grow into two people who love each other. It takes place very subtly and is very sweet to watch. One reason why I love classic movies is because I enjoy seeing the sights and sounds of that era. This movie is no exception. I loved seeing all of the classic cars and even Colbert's wardrobe and hair were a treat. While it wasn't the most flattering look, I'm sure it's very true to what was considered high fashion in the mid 1930's. The last scene of the movie (when the trumpet sounds and the Walls of Jericho fall) is the perfect ending to a nearly perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a very rare thing when a light-hearted comedy, something that is quintessentially the stuff of a 'good movie,' breaches into that territory where the term 'good film' can also be applied, but Frank Capra's 1934 film It Happened One Night may be an exception. Today, most people know Capra solely for his rediscovered classic It's A Wonderful Life, made a dozen years later, but this film was his first stab at what most critics would label greatness. This is all the more interesting because the 1930s, with their still newly developed sound technology, were still a transition period, of sorts, with the over the top hammy expressionistic acting of the silent films still dominating more than the more subtle naturalism of later film eras.As a comedy, this is all the more striking, since there was not the manifest symbolism of some of the great silent film comedians, nor was there the social satire of the 1960s madcap comedies, nor those of Woody Allen's intellectualized Golden Era. Yet, Capra's film, aside from its fame as having lifted Columbia Pictures from the bottom of the film studio heap, and being the first film to win the Big Five Oscars in a single year- Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Lead Actor, and Best Lead Actress, is credited with being the first 'screwball comedy,' a subgenre of the romantic comedy, that flourished during the Great Depression and World War Two years. The films that this film kicked off all were romantic comedies, but the main focus of the films was on the frustrations the protagonists went through before inevitably ending up together in the end, rather than the stuff of pulp novels. Another aspect of this film, which makes it relevant today, is the brisk pace at which it was filmed, acted, and even edited. It is not as noticeable today, in Hollywood's caffeinated era, but compare it to any of a few dozen other films from that era and the difference is startling?. there are a few cringe-inducing moments when the era is shown at its worst- with a portrayal of a Stepin Fetchit like black railroad character, but that's a minor cavil in an otherwise great comedy, and possibly great film. After all, greatness includes- it does not preclude, humanity, and Capra was as infected by the worst of his times as anyone. But what makes a man great, especially an artist, is the degree to which those times claw at him, and the percentage of times a man of his time becomes a man for all times. The same is true for his art, and this artist and his film pass both of those bars. It Happened One Night is still as funny as it ever was, and the fact that you will get a bit more is the type of bonus feature DVDs alone cannot provide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Happened One Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar winning director Frank Capra (The Bitter Tea of General Yen, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life), this was the first film to win "the Big 5" awards at the Oscars (a record equalled by One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Silence of the Lambs). Basically Ellen "Ellie" Andrews (Oscar winning Claudette Colbert) is a spoiled heiress who, despite the objections of her wealthy father Alexander (Walter Connolly), is eloped to pilot and fortune-hunter "King" Westley (Jameson Thomas), the father wants the marriage annulled as he knows Westley only wants her money. In Florida, Ellie jumps ship and runs away, boarding a bus to New York City, she wants to reunite with King, on the journey she meets freshly out-of-work newspaper reporter Peter Warne (Oscar winning Clark Gable), they initially start with some seemingly coincidental bumping into each other. Peter recognises Ellie and gives her a choice: give him an exclusive story and he will help her, or he will tell her father where she is, she agrees to the first option. Peter and Ellie go through several adventures together, her initial disdain for him fades away, she finds herself falling in love with him, there is a point when she uses her sex appeal to get a hitchhike, but the person who picks them up attempts to steal their luggage, but Peter stop him, and steals his car. Nearing the end of their journey, Ellie confesses her love for Peter, the next morning Peter has disappeared, believing he has deserted her Ellie calls her father, who agrees to let her marry Westley, Peter meanwhile has obtained money from his editor to marry Ellie. Ellie has no desire to be with Westley, but she believes Peter has betrayed her for the reward money, a second formal wedding to Westley goes ahead, on her wedding day Ellie finally reveals everything, Peter comes to her family home where her father offers him the reward money, but only insists on being paid his expenses. Peter explains his odd behaviour to Ellie's father is due to the fact that he admits his love for her, Westley arrives for his wedding via an autogyro, but at the ceremony Mr. Andrews reveals Peter's refusal to take the reward money to Ellie, he sends her to Peter, and pays Westley off, Peter and Ellie offscreen finally embrace. Also starring Roscoe Karns as Oscar Shapeley, Alan Hale as Danker, Arthur Hoyt as Zeke, Blanche Friderici as Zeke's wife and Charles C. Wilson as Joe Gordon. Gable is very likable as the good looking hard-nosed reporter who lightens up, Colbert is pretty and amusing as the runaway heiress who realises true happiness, together they are a great duo and partnership. I previously admitted that I didn't understand this film very well, however watching it again it is fairly straight forward, it is well written with good funny lines and mishaps, and classy and charming performances and interactions, it certainly deserves its status as a classic romantic comedy. It won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Adaptation. Clarke Gable number 63 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, the film was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 35 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It happened one hell of a film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the plot: Ellie Andrews has just tied the knot with society aviator King Westley when she is whisked away to her father's yacht and out of King's clutches. Ellie jumps ship and eventually winds up on a bus headed back to her husband. Reluctantly she must accept the help of out-of- work reporter Peter Warne. Actually, Warne doesn't give her any choice: either she sticks with him until he gets her back to her husband, or he'll blow the whistle on Ellie to her father. Either way, Peter gets what (he thinks!) he wants .... a really juicy newspaper story.This is such a classic film, you should have seen it and loved it already. If you don't but- GO NOW! It truly deserves its place on the IMDb top 250 list, if not a higher spot. It captures the romance of cinema in the 30's and 40's. A classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you believe this was made in 1934 that's 72 years old, surly it must be rubbish, it must have aged and become irrelevant. Well no it has not. It is as fresh, witty, sassy and entertaining today as it was when first released.This was the first film to win the big five awards at the Oscars and has been followed by only two other films, so that's something special to start with. It manages to pair two fine actors at the peak of their charm and attractiveness. It has a great script and is directed by one of the finest directors Hollywood has known, so how could it fail.The story fair cracks along, with Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable creating an on screen chemistry, with adult humour and situations. We the audience are treated like intelligent grown ups who are going to get the point even if it's not obvious and therefore find it even funnier.That the two leads end up together at the end makes the journey all worth while, because I love a happy ending, and this is one of the most satisfying i've seen. The DVD has some extra features here in the UK and I found them interesting as well. So order it today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic comedy romance starring the amazing Clark Gable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This old black and white Frank Capra classic must surely have set the standard for the romantic comedy, perhaps even been the first of this genre. It stars Claudette Colbert and my favourite actor from that era, the handsome Clark Gable, who fall in love in the midst of an entertaining set of screwball adventures, all the while exchanging assorted witty banter.The story revolves around a spoiled heiress, Ellie Andrews, who marries a fortune hunter named King Westley against the wishes of her father, who has the marriage annulled before it can be consummated. Ellie runs off and boards a bus where she meets reporter Peter Warne, who recognizes her. He gives her a choice, either give him an exclusive story and he will reunite her with King or he will reveal her whereabouts to her father and collect the reward. Ellie agrees to give the story and various adventures ensue, during the course of which the pair develop a mutual attraction.This movie has two main claims to fame, other than its incredible male star! The first is the hitchhiking scene in which Peter tries unsuccessfully to thumb a ride, turned down by car after car. Then Ellie lifts her skirt to reveal a shapely leg and...you guessed it, the next driver slams on his brakes!The other is the famous Walls of Jericho scene, which is my lingering memory of this tale. Peter and Ellie are obliged to share a motel room for the night, surely quite risqué for that era! However, in order to maintain the proper decorum for an unmarried couple, a blanket is hung up sort of clothesline style to separate the two sleepers. Oh, the Good Old Days when couples weren't having sex within the first fifteen minutes of the movie! Now I won't give any spoilers, but will those walls of Jericho ever come tumbling down?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reporter Gable tries to get the scoop on runaway heiress Colbert in this comedy classic. Gable is perfectly charming as a fast-talking playboy and he and Colbert display terrific chemistry. They are helped by a fine supporting cast, particularly Connolly as Colbert's banker father. Among the highlights are Gable showing his mastery in the arts of dunking a donut, undressing for bed, and, most memorably, hitchhiking. Working with a witty script, Capra keeps things moving at a breezy pace, never slowing down to wallow in sentimentality or deliver a heavy-handed message, as in some of his later films. One of five best films of the 1930's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Comedy About Sheltered Female and Strong Male=TNT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This script by Robert Riskin I find to be filled with excellent dialogue; This is an unpretentious but very idea-level social satire, involving the unlikely pairing of no-nonsense Clark Gable with classically-trained charismatic Claudette Colbert. The second unlikeliness about the film is the princess-like Colbert, being barred by her magnate father from consummating a secret marriage, jumping off the yacht where she is being confined and ending up being spotted by newsman Gable. He is in fact portrayed as the usual late-twenties hard-drinking no-nonsense reporter sort with three exceptions--he is adventurous, able to get along and function effectively at all levels of society even during the Depresssion, and he is working in a profession where there is no job-level between managing editor and field reporter; this all leaves him frustrated by dull or routine assignments but wanting to investigate and do something important in the world. Only the wealth of Colbert's father qualifies her as important. Once he befriends her, and agrees to get her where she wants to go, the added complication comes from their attraction for one another, a slowly growing and smoldering subtext to what they actually do. He disapproves of her; she disapproves of him. He represents, it appears to me, reality--what she has been denied every bit as much as any European princess ("The Princess Comes Across", "Roman Holiday") has been denied it; and he is a natural leader shut out from the upper levels of society and thus denied also; and he is the natural leader/mental aristocrat by ability denied her worlds of unobstructed goal-setting, doing one's one desires and not having to be disbarred from anything. As no one I know has noticed, then, this is a European story-line grafted onto a supposedly classless U.S., every bit as much so as is "Destry Rides Again" or "Roman Scandals". That I suggest is the secret to "It Happened One Night" and its strong story-line; it is a film about Gable's personal purpose of doing a good story for his career's sake and having it turned upside down by his falling in love with what Colbert ought-to-be, could be, and is becoming. The "Walls of Jericho" business involving the erecting of a curtain so Colbert will feel safe spending the night with Gable is a charming device for comedic purposes, as is Gable's removing his shirt as a symbol of reality-sexuality being offered to Colbert, the last thing she immediately wants to deal with. In another sense, the Walls are protecting him, the realist, from immediately having to deal with her higher-value-sexual meaning rather than her story-value to him as a reporter. The cleverness of the dialogue, picaresque adventures, human encounters and interactions depicted in the movie all magnify its importance again. And the fact that these are all beautifully presented by director Frank Capra and his technicians further increases their ability to affect an audience. The couple's different ways of handling people, the dunking of a donut, and the classic triumph of the bared female leg (hers) over hitchhiking expertise (his) at promoting them a ride become symbols of the natural triumphing over the artificial. over "barriers". And when the time comes for Ellie Andrews (Colbert) to decide whether she wants to stay married to one King Westley or divorce or marry Peter Warne (Gable), we the viewers have been well-informed as to what decision she will be making. This is a screwball-type comedy due to the unpredictable reactions of many persons to the Depression's unnatural restraints and emergencies. The basic situation--the princess-cheerleader female and the rough-hewn-commoner male has been carried out many times, but never with more success since the film's release; but this is essentially a European plot line grafted onto a U.S. stature-through-ability individualism; this is why so many attempts at this formula have failed, I suggest; because the formula was not understood, and because the united States has been increasingly unAmerican since 1902, particularly since 1937. The other interesting and important aspect I find as a writer is that Gable does not know who this waif is at the beginning; so we find that Gable's character is a commoner who deserves to be an important man, a first-rate newspaperman frustrated by his inability to chart his own course, a man who likes people who lives in a rough, noir-like environment, and a man who likes women and wants an equal but has to play mentor to a desirable woman only slowly realizing her potential. This is the "ice-goddess" aspect of the rich explored in "The Phildaelphia Story" by Philip Barry; Gable's problem is that of the great man stuck in a tsar-ridden society, familiar from "Holiday", "The Big Sleep" and "The Fountainhead" among others. The film I find is a delight; its dated aspects are those of its technologically backward period only. Its strengths appear to me to be derived from its honest plot and many interesting characters. Both leads are self-regulating; he lives by a moral code, and during the film she discovers the need for one. They seem to be an excellent match, when all is said and done. The evils of the Depression, which socialist Capra might have stressed even more than he does, are used very cleverly here as a background to the personal self-discovery mutual story-line. This is a well-photographed and artistic effort, I suggest, but nothing as stylish as Capra's later efforts. Cinematography by Joseph Walker, art direction by Stephen Goosson, and Robert Kalloch's costumes, with brief music only being provided all add to the realistic sense of the two character's descent from riches or daily reality and their immersion in the wider meaning of a nation in social upheaval and economic distress. In the cast the viewer should note Walter Connolly as Colbert's exasperated banker father, Roscoe Karns, Ward Bond, Alan Hale, Arthur Hoyt, Jameson Roberts, Harry Hume, Milton Kibbee and many more persons effective in brief parts. This is a well-designed movie, very deserving of its popularity.</fullReview>

I honestly have to say it is one of my favorites. Of course it has flaws with the script, plot, filming and all but what movie doesn't? Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are brilliant with great chemistry and strong supporting actors. The plot was the usual love story where boy meets girl and falls in love but it was beautifully played out in this movie. Clark gave a wonderful performance as the overzealous reporter and Claudette convincingly played the spoiled rich kid with no shame whatsoever. It is indeed a must-see especially for classic movie lovers or Clark Gable fans. Take it from me, if I haven't established it already, this is a really good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think it was a really good film. the interaction between gable and colbert, while not exactly provoking uncontrollable laughter (neither did anything else in the film), was really altogether enjoyable. while the three stooges, marx bros, and laurel/hardy, among others were doing outrageous over the top comedy, this movie showed that subtlety and relatively quiet wit could be done well too. in this sense it was a sort of precursor to the TV show "cheers". i happen to think the hays code was a mighty good idea. maybe quite a few of its requirements could be toned down a bit though. there's no need for its rule against miscegenation, though at the time, considering the circumstances of that era, it couldn't be avoided.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It Happened One Night set a pretty high water mark for romantic comedies back in 1934, a standard that has rarely been met, and possibly never surpassed. Any classic movie lover would be hard-pressed to deny the charm of this film. As enjoyable as any of Capra's best, I Happened One Night is one of those rare films that is a joy to watch, simply for its entertainment value. Clark Gable stars as Peter Worne, a hard-nosed reporter, who just got the pink slip from his job when he runs into Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the daughter of millionaire Alexander Andrews. Having run away from her father, Ellie is trying to get to New York to be with her husband, King Westley (Jameson Thomas). Smelling a story, Worne decides it may be best for both of them to stick together for a while. What the newsman doesn't count on is that he may see more to Ellie than what he had counted on. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert play off of each other wonderfully throughout the movie, displaying a the chemistry between stars that makes a movie a classic. The achievements of the Capra and company did not go unnoticed during Oscar season, either. It Happened One Night made Oscar history as being the first film to sweep the five major categories at the Academy Awards, a feat that would not occur again until One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did it in 1975. Aside from winning Best Picture, the film also took in Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actor (Clark Gable), Best Actress (Claudette Colbert), and Best Screenplay (Robert Riskin). It Happened One Night should not be missed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first motion picture to win the five major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, and screenplay) deserves the accolades it gets. Even though the plot itself is a product of the times, the dramatic tension and comic sensibility remains fresh today. Sure, we know from the beginning the two attractive leads will end up together( how could it be otherwise?) but unlike romantic comedies of today, the journey to that end is believable. Standouts: Oscar "Believe you me" Shapely; the famous hitch-hiking gag; the bit with the detectives in the cabin.I've seen this film referred to as a "screwball comedy." I don't think this falls into that category. While there are some screwball moments, overall the situations, while unlikely, are, at least to a degree, possible, and the performances aren't manic. Each moment is played for reality. There are plenty of quiet moments to balance the action of the piece.If you haven't seen it, you should.</fullReview>

Excellent performances from Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, and easily worthy of "Best Actor/Actress" awards. Ditto for the script and direction! Best Picture of 1934? I haven't seen all the nominees yet, but this one is a shoe-in, I'd say. Absolute magic from Frank Capra, and you could have fooled me that this was the same man who directed IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (which I didn't much care for).Colbert plays the spoiled daughter of a stuffy socialite who decides to abandon her life of confinement. She winds up bumping into the tough Gable and from there, the sparks fly. Very humorous, and a great chemistry between the two lead performers. One of the best romantic comedies of all, and I'm prepared to call this easily one of the all-time greatest movies ever made too; it will certainly occupy a place on my own personal "100 Greatest Films" List (which I'm going to be working on over time).Oh yeah??

		<fullReview>It happened one night was released in February 1934. It Happened one night stars Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable and was Directed by Frank Capra. Frank Capra is my favorite film director; It happened one night is my favorite Frank Capra film. Frank Capra was an excellent director who spoke well to the working man. Spoiled wealthy heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is on a boat with her father. Ellie's father doesn't want her to marry her boyfriend King Wesley, because he doesn't approve of him. Ellie gets made and jumps of the boat and swims to shore. She goes to the nearest bus station and gets a bus ticket to go to New York to be with King Wesley. Meanwhile at the bus station reporter Peter Warne has just lost his job. On the bus Ellie meets Peter. Peter knows who Ellie is, because her father is well-known. Peter tells Ellie that he will help her find King Wesley. Peter is a gruff man who isn't going to tolerate Ellie's spoiled ways. Peter teaches Ellie how to be more humble and less spoiled. Overnight Peter and Ellie room together at a small hotel. In one of the funniest seens in film history Peter puts up a sheet so they can undress in private. He calls it "The walls of Jericho". My two favorite scenes in It happened one night are: 1. when Ellie and Peter have to hitch a ride. Peter can't get a ride by using his thumb; Ellie lifts up her skirt and they both get a ride. 2. A woman and her child are on the bus, they are obviously very poor and have been looking for work all day; like a lot of people during the great depression. The woman faints and the boy starts crying. Someone helps the woman up; Ellie and Peter both comfort the boy. Ellie gives the boy most of the little bit of money she has left. Ellie is now learned how to be less spoiled. By the end of the film Peter and Ellie fall in love. Ellie decides that king Wesley is a shallow rich snob, and that she would rather be with Peter. IT Happened one night is obviously set during the great depression. The film was released right in the height of the depression. It Happened one night has the feel of a depression era movie. The idea of the happy poor and the depressed rich show are feelings of the great depression. IT Happened one night is a pre-code film; released 5 months before the hays production code was passed. It Happened one night was the sleeper of it's year; a sleeper is a film that everyone thought would be a box-office failure but turned out to be very popular at the box-office. IT Happened one night is based on a short story called "Night Bus". It Happened one night has been copied many times: the idea of a spoiled rich young woman running away. When It Happened one night was released Columbia pictures was a small studio. IT Happened one night is a masterpiece with excellent cinematography, a flawless script, top-notch acting, colorful characters, and perfect sets. Claudette Colbert is very sexy in the lead role. IT Happened One night is a film that everyone will enjoy! My rating is 1,000 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One night I watched this movie and I still am in awe to this day. Number 35 on AFI's list, "It Happened One Night" is an American film classic, a screwball comedy pioneer, and the 1934 winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, and Screenwriter, one of the only three movies to this day to take home all five awards. This is one of my favorite movies and one of few I ever give a flat out A plus to, wishing there was a higher rating. It's terribly witty and perhaps--its only flaw--overwhelmingly wonderful. Frank Capra is at his best as are Colbert and Gable (who was borrowed from another producer and almost not in it at all). The chemistry between Colbert and Gable is outstanding, they have wit down to a long forgotten art most romances lack today. Very famous scenes will stay with you--shouldn't say which--and especially for the moviegoer, should and must. If you haven't seen this movie, this should be one of the next on your list. I always will suggest this movie and biasly will get p*ssed off if someone has never seen it, its just that amazing. My only worry for those of the less mature teenage age is that it takes a slight focus to realize that this movie happened then, not now, and though timeless, would not have happened as certainly no one takes bus trips to New York from Miami, gets a motel for a couple dollars, or gets offended when people reveal their legs. Get past that, though- i demand it- and you've got an unforgettable classic. A +</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It Happened One NightAt face value this film seemed to take viewers through the same routine plot that most Hollywood romances produce. However, taken into consideration the film first hit a theater in 1934 makes it revolutionary. The plot is witty and plausible, in the sense that it invites viewers to seek out their own romantic fantasies. The applied comedic character roles boost the plot above normal romance film standards. People might label this movie a chick flick, but with gendered expectations put aside it is a film for all audiences to enjoy. The film's plot is carried on the shoulders of actors Clarke Gable and Claudette Colbert, whose performances lead to an Oscar for both best actor and actress. The dynamic duo play characters with rather diverse social and economic differences which allows conflict to unwind. Their dissimilar lifestyles are creatively display by Capra's famous 'Walls of Jericho' scenes. At face value the character's goal are to reach to New York incognito, but romance takes its toll and the new plot twist aims to tear down the walls of Jericho. Using several fade techniques the filming itself rhythmically jumps from setting to setting as the travels of Peter and Ellie persist. As our characters further themselves along the path we catch glimpses of dependency for one another, for instance the scene in which they cozy up in a hay stack for the night. The scene's setting is natural yet suddle allowing for each character's true feeling to unravel. Perhaps the best aspect of this film is the comedy applied mostly through Clarke Gable's character Peter. His charming and direct tones bring laugh out loud comedy. Peter's character becomes an ideology for all males. Staying with in the lines of realism, the films overall quality provides one of Hollywood's best romantic comedies up to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many angles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film that we watched was a somewhat comical love story in which a man and a woman both in desperate need for something. The woman was in need of getting to her husband and the man was in need of getting his job back. The two found each other and decided that they could use one another to seek their goals, but instead, they fell in love with each other. Throughout this film, there were many different camera angles taken which made the film more realistic. A majority of the film was shot through the view of a moving vehicle. The angles differed from time to time depending on what type of vehicle the main characters were in. When the characters were in a regular car, the camera was straight in front of them and would not move from side to side as if the camera was on the hood as they were moving down the road. Although, what was really happening was that the car wasn't moving. There was a screen behind the vehicle with film already on it making it look like the car was moving and then another camera was filming the whole thing. When the characters were on a bus, the only other vehicle they were in, had many different angles portraying the couple. There would be angles shot from the front of the bus which would shot in close and out far on the characters, where in the car scenes the shot would stay at a certain distance. The camera would also shot angles from the side of the bus as if looking through the window. There were a couple of instances when you could tell that the bus wasn't really moving when they were filming from the side of it because there would be some distance from the character, who was against the window, and the actual window or the side of the bus. The camera shot different angles on the characters even when they were not in a moving situation. Most of the camera angles stayed back far enough so that you could see both characters in it. It would single out the characters once and a while when they had something meaning say and the film wanted you to hear it. The camera would also single out characters when they were expressing emotion. The camera angle would get in nice and close to the characters face in those situations, especially when the woman was crying, this way you could actually see her tears and get the full effect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this memorable comedy `Clark Gable' proves once again tha t he was the king of comedy.His macho attitude was perfect for the role but at the same time in some scenes he shows his true self(gentlemanly; kindness) of course my beloved scene is the Hitchhike,Claudette Colbert legs are just irresistible for any road driver.Another scene that is so great is when Claudette and Clark pretending to be a marry couple and then we see both eating breakfast in silence and gentle with each other.I'm not an admirer of Frank Capra movies,but this one is a real gem,maybe because the actors were so talented for comedies.I dont know but it really works.Clever dialogues some memorable scenes . `It happened one night' Is one of the greatest 30s comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent light romantic comedy by Frank Capra. Gable and Colbert are excellent in their roles and all is played for laughs and romance. The plot has been hashed and rehashed here enough, no need for a synopsis from me. Recommended. It would be a great film to watch up against a movie like "When Harry Met Sally..." as it shares the plot of two people who don't much care for each other at first being thrown together on a cross country trip as a way to bring them both together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews first meet on a crowded bus headed to New York. `Driver do these seats accommodate two?' Peter asks. `We'll maybe they don't and maybe they do' responds the driver. It Happened One Night takes us on a hilarious journey in the lives of two very different characters. Peter Warne is an alcoholic, jobless news reporter who is down on life and Ellie Andrews a na?ve, sheltered Daddy's girl who is tired of doing what is expected of her. The strongest and most effective aspects of It Happened One Night are the amazing chemistry between Peter and Ellie and the great one-liners that occur throughout. In my opinion, the dialog, along with the witty story line of It Happened One Night, is what makes it such a powerful movie. Ellie is in denial, she is miles and miles away from her destination, the police and America are looking for her and she only has $1.60. She will do anything not to depend on Peter. Peter on the other hand is just as stubborn, he needs a job and he sees a story in Ellie. Although he constantly refers to her as `brat' and `as helpless as a baby', there is an obvious sort of twisted attraction to her on his part. As true to life in real romance, Ellie and Peter will try at all costs to resist one another.`I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband' Ellie says. There are five points in this movie where Ellie and Peter are assumed to be husband and wife; the first time is on the second bus. Ellie has missed her first bus assuming that it would wait for her and Peter has stayed behind as well. An annoying man named Shapely has explained to Ellie that it is his experience that `the colder they are, the hotter they get', Peter steps in and announces that Ellie is his wife. Ellie seems shocked but pleased. Ellie and Peter are husband and wife again at the first lodge they stay over night in together. Here they build `The Walls of Jerico' a sheet clumsily separating the beds they sleep in. Ironically enough, it is not until this point as Ellie lies in bed, dressed in Peters pajamas, that she learns his name. As pretend husband and wife for the third time Ellie and Peter fool a search team of detectives hired by Ellie's father into believing they are in fact married and not who they are looking for. This is a major turning point in our story. The development of trust is occurring. Ellie and Peter begin to work together in order to accomplish one another's goals. The fourth time they stand as mock husband and wife occurs after Ellie accomplishes at what Peter fails- successfully hitchhiking. Peter and Ellie grow even closer as they sit in the back of the car that picks them up; Ellie gloats as she bites into a carrot. The fifth and final time they are supposed to be married marks the huge turning point in our love story. They are flat broke and Ellie insists that they stay at a lodge only three hours away from their destination. It is there that she professes her undeniable love for Peter. His head filled with confusion he responds to her that she had better go back to her bed. They are perfect for each other and they know it, but could it ever work? Peter can't deny it, he's mad about her. He needs money so he returns to New York. The whole thing becomes a huge misunderstanding, mainly because both Ellie and Peter are extremely quick to jump to conclusions regarding one another's intentions. For the first time in our story, the lovers are separated and miserable. `He blames you for everything that is wrong with me' Ellie weeps to her father. Actually to this point we have all had Mr. Andrews pinned very wrong. If not for this father's love and greater concern for his daughter's happiness, then this love story would never have been. In a meeting between Mr. Andrews and Peter over reimbursement in the amount of $39.60 to Peter for his troubles, he asks; `Do you love my daughter?' and Peter answers, `Yes but don't hold that against me, I'm a little screwy!' So Mr. Andrews being a good father realizes that it is up to him to unite Peter and Ellie. In an anticipated and suspenseful finale, the two are joined and it is then that `The Walls of Jerico' finally topple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first film to win all 5 major Oscars (the only one to do so until 1975's 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'), this has lost none of its charm and still ranks as a genuine classic.The story is simple, concerning a runaway heiress making her way to her lover in New York. On the journey she meets an opportunist news reporter, who agrees to help her in return for a scoop on the story.The two main players are superb (with Colbert shading the honours) and the script they have to work with ensures the interplay between them is spot on.'It Happened One Night' is difficult to fault and is a notch above Capra's other classic 'It's a Wonderful Life'. With memorable scenes like the sing-along on the bus, the hitch-hiking, the carrot eating and the 'Walls of Jericho' in their various boarding houses, the film rates up with the very best of its type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Age Old Comedy That Has Never Lost Its Appeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Hollywood classic comedy starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. This film has never lost its charm and appeal even after 65 years. Rich Heiress Ellen Andrews (Colbert) runs away from father to be with husband and meets Peter Warren (Gable) on a bus trip from Florida to NY. Gable's rough tough demeanor makes it hard to believe that the two can fall in love but that is just what happens. The classic Walls of Jericho motor court scenes and Gables explanation of how he undresses are superb. The best scene is Gable trying to hitchhike a ride after explaining to Colbert that it's an art and he knows so much about it that he should write a book on it. Of course, he fails to get anyone to stop. Colbert gives it a try and what you see is her pulling up her skirt and revealing a beautiful leg shot which immediately stops a car which is driven by the great character actor Alan Hale. The scene near the end of the movie which has Gable asking Mr Andrews for payment on his expenses and whether or not Gable is in love with Colbert is hilarious. Characterizations are solid (Oscar Shapely, King Wesley) dialogue is crisp, plot line is hilarious. A truly great comedy classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colbert is perfect as the runaway spoilt brat and Gable adds many a laugh to this and leaves nothing to be desired. His idealistic turn in Gone With The Wind does not compare to the likeability and strength of this great performance, for once the Academy Awards are consistent with that.I hate it when nostalgia promotes a pretty mediocre achievment from an unbiased 2 to a warm and fuzzy 1, there is none of that here anyway though, this is the old days when the guy didn't have to get down to it with the girl for them to realise they cared about each other and when the humour is about the people and good writing, it was the first of 3 flicks to snag all 5 of the major awards, Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director and Screenplay.This was also the very first road trip romantic comedy and one of the first romantic comedies. A great moment is Colbert falling to bits in the fake husband and wife scene as Gable yells "quit balling", or Gables little commentary about stopping cars. A good clean flick that you can watch more than once. Fans of Romance and Films should see this, be sure your among them.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admiration for wonderful subtle acting, for the script, the wonderful cast of supporting characters, It is nearly 70 years since this was made, and apart from the previously mentioned bonuses, there is also true Americana to be found, as in the term for "motel" was "auto camp" and a helicopter was called an "auto gyro". The scene on the bus where "the daring young man on his flying trapeze" is sung has to be a classic. Clark and Claudette glow in this. Even though some of it is quite ahead of its time (sharing the room, the famous undershirt scene which caused undershirt sales to drop 50% in the year it was released) the suggestions of hitting her to keep her in line are appalling today. Roscoe Karns as Shapely gives a winning performance and nearly steals the movie. I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

The main characters are smart and three-dimensional -- a very hard thing to do in a comedy.One of my favorite comedic moments of all time has to be when they are crossing the stream "piggy back" and he tells her to hold his suitcase. I also love the scene where the people on the bus start singing, truly hilarious.The DVD has some interesting trivia about the production and how Colbert did not want to make this picture. Ironically, this is the movie that won her an Oscar.All in all, a very rewarding movie experience.</fullReview>

I began a one and a half year obsession by renting IHON and watching it at one in the morning because I didn't feel my parents were "worthy." Well, my stomach acid rolled over, and I think I've seen it so many times that I can recite the whole script. While Clark Gable is no longer my dream guy and IHON no longer my dream flick, everybody has to see it. Don't bother to ask questions. It's so devastatingly true. No wonder why it surpassed so many other 1934 classics on Oscar night!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still around and getting notices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been around since 1934 and people are still commenting on it. Above all else, I've notice a lot of women who love to comment over the most famous scene in the film in which Clark Gable takes off his shirt and exposes his bare chest. I'm surprised, after all the other good-looking heartthrobs that have come and gone since Gable, women are still admiring his muscular physique. MY favorite scene however, is when Claudette Colbert brings the cocky Gable down a peg or two and puts him in his place when she hails a cab with those nice gams of hers. He spends the rest of the trip down the highway sulking over how a woman beat him at his own game of hitchhiking. Well, it serves him right. Also, I want to punch (no, KICK) him right in the face whenever he dictates to how and what she spends her money on. The jerk obviously thought he owned her or something. I'm not a feminist or anything, I'm just old-fashioned to a certain extent and think that a guy should be a gentleman to a lady and not boss her around. If a man bossed a woman around these days he would have gotten his teeth knocked in, or worse. Anyway, this was a great movie with a lot of comedy, a few bittersweet tears and an all-around good time for movie buffs.</fullReview>

I found it the 2nd best of the three after "Silence of the Lambs" and I don't think " One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" deserved even to get some nominations. It is one of the legendary Frank Capra's first and best movies .. it is one of the best road movies of all-time. Claudette Colbert &amp; Clark Gable made a very good couple.The music .. the acting .. the atmosphere is amazing and very superior to its time. I do not know what else to say ..

		<shortDescription>Film analysis incorporating feminist perspectives.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Happened One Night is a decidedly 'Capraesque' film that employs uplifting but stereotypical themes, which correlate with much of the prevalent conservative ideology in the United States during the 1930s. The film, starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is undeniably charming but displays glaringly conventional views about class and gender relations in particular. Implementation of diegetic sound helps to advance rather than hinder the film by allowing for the portrayal of class status through accent and manner of speech. Colbert's Ellie represents the epitome of high breeding with her disaffected and skeptical drawl and careful enunciation. Peter's unrefined, blue collar accent and colorful slang help to mark him as having a lower socioeconomic status in contrast to Ellie, someone for the average American moviegoer to identify with. Another voice worthy of note was that of the only black man in the movie, a vendor selling food to the travelers at a bus stop, hollering in a stereotypically southern black accent, a holdover from plantation days. This character was clearly on the bottom rung of the social ladder in the scene, in a racially stereotypical presentation. While Wllie defied traditional norms by running away from her father to join her new husband, she was quickly 'rescued' and swept up by Peter. In this world, men appear to own or at least to make the decisions for Ellie, and she can't seem to help but falling head over heels for the first two she meets outside of her sheltered life. In several scenes, newspaper headlines are superimposed with Ellie's picture, one even reading "Ellen Andrews Escapes Father." This presents a rather disturbing image of Ellie being held captive by her father, and the legitimacy with which this is viewed by the public is akin to that of an escaped convict. Indeed, one of the only ways the sylph-like Ellie fought back against male oppression was through the use of 'hunger strikes' and, arguably, smoking cigarettes. I do not need to restate the implications of women wielding their power through food restriction, smoking, and sex (e.g. the hitchhiking scene), all of which convened during the 1920s, setting the scene for generations of women to come. One of the major recurring themes of the film was the 'walls of Jericho' that existed literally (through a rope and blanket) and metaphorically (through the lack of sexual contact) between Ellie an Peter. This 'wall' enforced the metaphor of a woman's body as a fort to be stormed, the first conqueror reaping the spoils. Indeed, even though Ellie was technically married, it was made quite clear that she was still a virgin, and thus the opportunity to marry Peter was still a viable one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of Capra's earliest and it's amusing too. Capra, from an immigrant Sicilian family, shows his concern for class differences and promotes a benificent view of the poor. There's nothing explosively funny about the script, no memorable tag lines, but rather comic or ironic situations follow quickly upon the heels of one another. There are some laughable exchanges though, as the one between Ward Bond as a bus driver and drunken passenger Clark Gable. Bond: "Say, I ought to sock you in the nose."Gable: "I always keep my nose out there where people can take a sock at it."Bond: "Oh, yeah?"Gable: "That's an intelligent reply. Why didn't I think of it?"Bond: "Oh, yeah?" Gable: "If you keep that up we're never going to get anywhere." Bond: "Oh, yeah?" Gable {exhausted}: "Ya GOT me -- YEAH!"Colbert is a spoiled brat, as we are told several times, although Capra never deprives her of our sympathy. (She's not spoiled, she argues, because spoiled people are used to getting their own way and she's been told what to do all her life.) Gable is a blustering newspaperman who begins their relationship with the intention of exploiting her but falls for her instead. (Cf., "Roman Holiday".) He teaches her things. (1) How to dunk a donut. (2) How to hitch hike. (3) How a man undresses. These lessons must have been amusing to an audience in 1935, many of whom might have been happy to have a donut to dunk. The undressing scene -- incomplete before Colbert retreats behind "the walls of Jericho" -- started a fad involving the non-wearing of undershirts by men. It's still kind of interesting, partly because we rather like the performers, but it's badly dated. Nobody dunks donuts anymore. Nobody hitch hikes either. Why not? Because instead of driving Model A Fords at 30 miles an hour down country roads everyone now speeds along in Ford Mustangs on Interstate Highways at 80. And hitching is now largely illegal.Besides, all hitch hikers are serial murderers now. (Except north of the border, where hitchers flourish along the TransCanada Highway. Canada has no serial murders, only postmen and moose hunters.)But this is a movie with some of Capra's populism on display. I direct your attention to the scene aboard the second bus. The scene is crowded with ordinary humanity of diverse but modest backgrounds. (Rich people in this movie fly.) An improvised band is playing in the back of the bus and a passenger requests, "The Man on the Flying Trapeze." The tiny band goes through the first verse, including the bridge. A sailor pipes up and says, "I know the second one, let me handle it." And the third verse is sung by a short dark guy up front. Then everyone piles into the bus's central walkway and dances around -- sailors, fat guys with bushy beards, little scholarly looking people, all smiling and singing. It's a startlingly unexpected delight, a spontaneous community engaged in a rite of intensification, the equal of any of John Ford's dances. Even the bus driver, behind his curtain, is drawn into the song. And the moments when the sailor if fluttering his hands and swings clumsily from an overhead bar are unforgettable. A thoroughly happy scene, a capricious but Capraesque caprice.Gable is almost always likable and unpretentious. Colbert can be irritating but she's okay here. You won't laugh during this film but you'll probably smile a lot. Well worth going with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolute Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enter every movie viewing with energy and delight, and this time was no different, but by the time that thing was over I was angry. I am shocked that this is a classic and won so many awards- shocked, to an extent. I'm aware that society was ~different~ back then but I can't just ignore the blatant sexism prevalent in films from this time. In the same way that a racist movie would infuriate me beyond my ability to ignore for entertainment's sake, the disgusting misogyny in this film made it nearly unbearable. People say, "it was a different time!" but I don't care. It's disgusting now, it was disgusting back then, and no art/entertainment gets a pardon just because it was a hit when it came out.Despite this film having a female lead, she was nothing but a plot device. How the main character could make a total of ONE decision of her own within the span of an entire feature film is truly beyond me. Summaries of the film cushion the plot with things like, "she agrees to help him if he keeps her secret" but in actuality this was a woman on the run from a controlling father who was threatened with violence into giving that sleazy reporter a story or else he would give her up to that controlling father. Literally romanticized Stockholm's Syndrome. This is described as a romance movie but there was nothing romantic about it. This is a movie about men wanting a woman to do what they want instead of what she wants. The word "demented" popped into my mind multiple times while watching in reaction to things these men would do to her.The characters were really annoying, all of them. The things that were supposed to be romantic were just gross. There must be a million ways to make a story about a runaway heiress, you know? It's an interesting premise but it was executed incredibly poorly, with totally unlikeable characters and multiple disturbing dynamics in play. Plot holes so enormous even the male lead's gigantic head would get lost in them. Professional appearance, decent sound, standard cinematography- not a particularly artistic film. Weak story, poorly told, no character development besides developing them from strangers to creepy, controlling jerks. I hope no bizarre situation occurs in which I am ever forced to watch this again.4/10 Bye love you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra has done way better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As good as Gable and Colbert were together in this good romantic-comedy, they weren't enough, in my opinion, to keep the story from being a little uninteresting. It might just be the fact that I'm not that crazy about romantic-comedies, but I seem to have stopped enjoying the idea of the story after a while. However, I really did enjoy some of the scenes in this classic. For example, the scene where Colbert manages to get a ride with Gable by lifting up her skirt to hitchhike. I also thought that the scenes where Gable undresses and tells Colbert that there aren't two men in the world who do it the same way and the scene where Gable explains to Colbert that dipping your doughnut is an art were brilliant. Overall, I think it might simply have been the idea of a reporter falling in love with a rich woman whose father does not appreciate her fiancé that kind of made this movie, to my eyes, not quite as good as I expected. However, I must give credit to Gable and Colbert for their two very good and very strong performances as well as for Frank Capra's expert directing. I do believe that he is one of those directors who can make those incredibly charming movies better than any other director. I do recommend it for movie-buffs and for fans of Gable, Colbert, and Capra. After all, it was the first movie to win best picture, best actor, best actress, and best director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off it should really be called It Happened One Night and then Some cause it was more than one night. The one night was never really even shown. It was a good movie and I enjoyed it, however I'm not sure it is really worth all it was cracked out to be. I don't think that I would have given it all the awards that it won. It was good but not THAT good. I probably still would agree with Clark Gabel's performance, in my opinion it out tops them all in the movie. Maybe even for the year. Not that I've seen every movie that year far from it. But Gable here delivered the goods that is worthy of the Oscar.Though if you find yourself home one evening with nothing to do pop some popcorn, grab a soda and watch this movie. Just make sure you're mouth is empty if something strikes you as funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Indian remake is a notch higher, but Indian movies never make it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a nice movie, no doubt. But you would be disappointed if you were to be an Indian viewer who had first seen its Indian remake Dil Hai Ki Maanta Nahin (1991), which is a sensational mix of the up-and-down romantic drama, hilarious comedy, great acting (Aamir Khan - who outperforms Clarke Gable by a distance, and Anupam Kher), and a score that would have done Giorgio Moroder proud.Unfortunately, the remake can never make it to this list because it is not in English - it is in Hindi, India's native language. Still, one must ask if Italian/Spanish titles could be included in the list, then the list should truly be free of language restrictions.Actually, as an afterthought, I should add that at least half of Slumdog Millionnaire is actually in Hindi. So maybe the real problem with the list, just like with the Oscars, might be that it expects somebody from the Western world to direct &amp; produce the movie. Whether or not you disagree, I strongly recommend you watch Pushpak (another Indian movie, and importantly NO language problems with this one). This is in not a imdb-250 movie. After you have watched it, you would likely just ask whether imdb-100 or something even shorter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caution, screen at your own risk.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A feminist critique of this film would be both long and frightening, I think. Half of me (the more liberal intellectual half, of course) had to cringe at half the lines in this movie, but the other half (the testosterone driven knee-jerk 'rather mannish' half, of course) couldn't help but get a kick out of the dialogue. I have to admit, when Peter spanked Ellie, I laughed myself half way out of my seat. It's the kind of scene that makes you scratch yourself and belch, thinking, "God it's good to be a man." The film is definitely worth seeing, if you can manage to put down all your opinions on the patriarchical phalocentric reification of normative gender rolls and pre-feminist social structure and values. Well.. it's good for a couple laughs, at least. I agree, though, with some of the other postings here that this isn't Capra's best work. I prefer the slightly more world-wise Capra-courtship that we find in films like 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' and others. Still, it's worth watching, and it lends itself well to at least some analysis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What am I Missing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on all the historical accolades, I decided to watch this "classic". After enduring to the bitter end, the most flattering thing I can say is that the camera appeared to be in focus for the full duration of the film. I'm willing to make concessions given the cultural differences of the time periods, but I can't imagine that peoples innate senses of humor and romance have changed THAT much. I mean really, did folks back in the day think dissertations on dunking donuts and piggy-back rides were funny? I realize the players in older films can be exaggerated and caricatures, but the obnoxious male bus passenger was just too much. It was one of many cringe-worthy scenes that left me wondering if the art of writing screen plays was in it's infancy. Incidentally, who didn't think Peter's terrorist threats against the bus guy's family were a howler! I'm still laughing at that one?!?!As for chemistry between the two stars, distilled water appears more reactive. Peter was a self-righteous grouch who wanted some dream "dame" who likes to frolic on the beach and look at the stars. Who wouldn't want a guy like that? She..., come to think of it, I don't remember anything about her desires or ambitions. Her facial expressions and lack of anything resembling passion were confusing. There was nothing to like on either side. He wasn't an appealing character and she was boring.I will say the movie was funny as an audience participation event. When Peter ran and caught a car to retrieve his belongings from a film-flam man, I couldn't help busting a gut. Either the cars were very slow in those days, or the cigarettes they were smoking really did make them more fit. Either way, there were several "incredible" circumstances in the movie that had me chuckling.I suppose the movie wasn't a complete waste of time, but I'm still wondering what happened and on which night?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra probably did not realize it in 1934, but he was basically setting the blueprint for pretty much every single rom com that has been made ever since. The strength of this movie other than its sharp plot lies in the sizzling chemistry between the two lead stars . Gable and Colbert simply glow every time they appear on screen together. The simple plot of a spoiled runaway girl who befriends and eventually falls for a smart mouth reporter while ironically riding on a bus trip to meet the man whom she thinks she loves is pure genius. The old cliché is very apt over here and it can truly be said that they don't make em like they used to. All in all a classic movie and deserves its place at no 35 on the AFI list of the greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is exceptionally fresh considering its a "classic". Infact it feels funny at times when you realize that the movie you're enormously enjoying is more than half a century old. It's one of those "feel good" movies that tickles your heart with its honesty, innocence &amp; of course matters of the heart. As in one scene when asked if he has ever thought about love at all, Peter replies "Sure I've thought about it, who hasn't!".My only criticism is that Ellie is shown as a girl who rebels her father because he always told her what to do &amp; what not to do. Later Peter ends up doing the same, which she was totally comfortable with.Nevertheless, what makes this movie truly timeless &amp; memorable is the first rate acting by the leading cast especially Claudette Colbert. Accompany that with an excellent direction &amp; superb production &amp; you've got a winner. This is a must see for anybody "anytime".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The studios - and, of course, Frank Capra - knew how to sell dreams to their audience, didn't they? "It Happened One Night" sets up a chance encounter which ultimately turns out to be kismet, as our two protagonists - wouldn't you know it? - eventually fall in love. This is a good example of the 'odd couple' comedy. It's a treat to see the debonair Gable handle some of his zingers from the script, and his double-act with Colbert really clicks into gear by the time the two opposites are forced to share a hotel room. Factory owners everywhere were cursing the demise of the undershirt, though!You're in capable hands if you like a romantic comedy with nimble players. As is too often the case with me, though, I got so wrapped up in the central relationship that I became mildly irritated at the frequent cutaways to the subplot where the father tries to get his absconding daughter back... That, then, is why I don't rate it as highly as some - but oh well, I've still got the lively banter to enjoy... !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No film education would be complete without seeing Frank Capra's Depression-era comedy, which despite sweeping the Academy Awards and setting the romantic comedy mold for decades to come is still very much a product of its time, from an age when all men were meant to be tough and virile and all women beautiful but helpless. The story is yet another variation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew', with spoiled heiress Claudette Colbert, on the lam from her overprotective tycoon father, learning about love and humility from brash, mercenary journalist Clark Gable, who insists on calling her (it later becomes a term of endearment) a "brat". Too often the screenplay resembles the daydreams of a down-and-out author; how else to explain the fabulously wealthy Colbert suddenly throwing herself at a man later revealed to be "the best writer in the business"? But elsewhere Capra's simple, crowd-pleasing sentiments carry the film, allowing the director to jettison credibility without it seeming like too hard a sacrifice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And The Walls Of Jericho Came Tumbling Down!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From my fairly dissatisfied point of view, the absolute highlight of this decidedly disappointing "Screwball" comedy from 1934 took place within the first 15 minutes when wealthy bank Pres, Alex Andrews, so rightly slapped the face of his snitty, snotty, snooty, spoiled-brat daughter, Ellie. (And, boy, did she ever have it coming to her!) I can't begin to tell you how much I wished that this royal, high'n'mighty bitch had gotten her over-lacquered face slapped a few more times, but, of course, it never happened.Over the years I have heard (time &amp; again) people literally falling all over themselves, raving away to me about "It Happened One Night" (IHON) being the ultimate "be-all-and-end-all" of Hollywood, screwball comedies.Well, I must say, that after giving IHON a fair enough view, I couldn't believe how petty, small and downright trivial its sappy story was.Not only was there absolutely no on-screen chemistry, whatsoever, taking place between IHON's 2 co-stars (Clark Gable &amp; Claudette Colbert), but, I thought that Colbert's character (Ellie Andrews) was positively despicable and I couldn't have given a wet fart about her "poor-little-rich-girl" problems.And, not only that, but, Colbert (who was 31 at the time) was clearly way too old to be playing this part which would have been more suited for a younger woman of about 20.I am absolutely shocked out of my socks that this trite, little, nothing-of-a-movie actually swept the 1935 Oscar presentations by scoring for itself 5 of its prized awards in all of the top categories of "Picture", "Actor", "Actress", "Director" &amp; "Screenplay".Back in "Depression Era" America IHON might have thrilled and delighted its audiences to literal pieces, but, today, 80 years later, its apparent charm &amp; appeal (which doesn't hold up very well) got completely lost on this here viewer.All that IHON came across as being was just a completely contrived, clichéd and predictable story whose attempt at cuteness and coyness left me utterly unmoved.From my point of view, this rather flat and tired "Boy-Meets-Girl" Comedy/Romance was, at best, only mediocre entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Samuel Hopkins Adams' story "Night Bus" turned into a big, commercial audience-pleaser circa 1934. The unhappy daughter of a wealthy banker flees daddy's yacht in Miami, intent on getting to New York City to be reunited with the man she married against her father's wishes; a recently-fired newspaper reporter attempts to befriend the spoiled heiress on their journey by bus. Wafer-thin material stretched to the breaking point, with a rollicking first-half (in buses and roadside motels) let down by less-funny second and third acts more concerned with a quasi-introspective study of character. Robert Riskin won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar; Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert also won for their performances. Indeed, their rapport is easy and free of gimmicks, though some of the sniping grates. Frank Capra won two Academy Awards, one for his direction and the other for producing this Best Picture winner. Its American minutiae was fresh and novel at the time--and some of it still holds up today--but when the wisecracks turn somber, and Riskin's script loops around to bide time, the film seems less a feel-good trifle than an over-praised, desperate movie-star "product". Remade in 1956 as "You Can't Run Away From It". **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This "classic" movie, starring Clark Gable, and Claudette Colbert and directed by Frank Capra, doesn't REALLY stand up the test of time very well. Although it was the first movie to sweep the Academy awards, taking home Actor, Actress, Director and Picture, when seen today, it's almost nothing more then a light 30's comedy surely to be put on the lower tier of Academy Award best picture winners. Oh sure, the Gable and Colbert team are great, chemistry going right and left, and maybe they earned their Oscars. But best picture? To be honest with you, the only reason it became so massively popular, is because this was what the USA needed during the years of the Great Depression, a riotous comedy that people could escape to forget their troubles. Much like the ridiculous 'Yankee Doodle Dandy', this was the right picture at the right time, (and uh, the right influential director) to take home the big prize. Did I like it? Sure, but this is a movie that's far too praised for what it's worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ONLY good thing about this movie is Clark Gable whose shirtless scenes actually led to a decrease in undershirt sales in the United States upon this movies release (that's true, and the funniest thing about this movie). Now I'm not someone who is opposed to old movies or even old comedies (though I think that pretty much all of them are products of their times, as are movies today). But I don't find this movie funny at all. It doesn't have witty lines and verbal humor nor does it have much slapstick or goofy stuff. It doesn't really have any funny material, unless you find some annoying sailors on a bus singing the "daring young man on the trapeze" to be hilarious. BTW the one sailors solo and dance proves that gays have been in the military for at least 70 years. Even the Romantic portion of this movie is weak, mainly considering that Claudette's character is very unappealing. She is really winey and not funny at all. If you are looking for a classic comedy check out The Marx Brothers, The Thin Man series (which I think are still hilarious today, Asta alone is better then this entire movie), W.C. Fields, or even Buster Keaton (if you want to go that far back...he is better then Chaplin). I guess I'd recommend this movie to Gable fans or people who want to see what won best picture in 1934 (im sure there was something better). This is just one of those movies that has since attained untouchable classic status and is on the critics funniest movie lists. It isn't funny and as much as I hate to admit it, I laughed more watching Happpy Gilmore (I don't like Sandler) then I did at this movie.Zoopansick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Societies undergo phase changes...like the change from water into ice.The year 1934 was perhaps the middle of one such phase change in the US: national Prohibition was gone, it was around the depth of the Depression and the paternalistic Hays Code was on its way in with full force. Silent films were dead, 'talkies' were here to stay -- it allowed us the chance to laugh and sing along with the actors in the film. What could have been better in such dismal times?Looking at it that way, one can see why "It Happened..." was showered with adoration. But it just doesn't resonate today...there have been additional phase changes in the interim.In terms of content, this is watchable only for Gable's performance, who towers over everyone else here. Simultaneously, he smirks for the audience in recognition of his own power. The plot pinballs off of the newspaper headlines, which keeps the mood light.However, in form, this offers nothing as a *cinematic* experience. There's no change of perspective from our day to day world...it could all be played out on a stage. Heck, you could turn your back to the viewing screen and follow what's going on from the audio content -- like a period radio show.It's for this astounding lack of cinematic qualities that I must rank it so low. If you want a far superior and more effective example of visual storytelling, go with Hitchcock's "The 39 Steps".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So... It was a talkie... I think it would have been better scilent.The videography of the movie was fine... but the idea of the movie just wasn't for me.The transition from seen to sceen was well done and the movie had some great actors.I'm not a fan of the directors other works either. I guess its just his style that throws me off.It was one of those movies that was way to far out there for me to enjoy.If you don't like movies with "dumb" type of characters don't see this movie.</fullReview>
