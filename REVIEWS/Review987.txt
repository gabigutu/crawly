		<shortDescription>Just One Look. That's All It Took........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one was a true nail biter. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Mr. Robinson's performance was believable and Ms. Bennet was beautiful and just as realistic as two people desperate to cover up a crime. This is a film that I highly recommend. It's suspenseful and dramatic. I felt as though I was on a roller coaster ride and couldn't get off. In short, I was a nervous wreck wondering how this film would play out. I highly recommend this one. I almost passed it by but I am eternally grateful that I didn't. Rent it, buy it, but by all means, watch it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be Careful What You Wish For...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wonderfully entertaining "film noir" by master director Fritz Lang is a curiosity, defying all of our expectations as a viewer and basically subverting the "noir" genre barely before it had gotten started. The dark shadows, the femme fatale, the harboiled detectives, the murder... all the elements are in place for a typical outing, but when all is said and done, look back at the motivations, the events, even the "femme", and what we have is not a world of evil (the typical "noir" stance) but a world of innocence darkened by a few petty thugs. Like the more obviously subversive (and equally wonderful) "Kiss Me Deadly" fifteen years later, "The Woman in the Window" seems to say that evil only lives when people look hard enough for it - practically a "film noir" rebuttal. As in "M" and "Fury," Lang (a refugee from the Nazi regime) once again examines issues of social evil in ways more complex than any of his contemporaries. Enjoy "The Woman in the Window." The cast is impeccable, the writing a delight, the direction peerless, the music score years ahead of its time. A small feast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Middle Aged Men Better Stick To Looking At Landscapes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film puts forward the theory that all middle-aged men are destined to "play-the-sap" for young women, and since it must come to pass, it is prudent to do so in ones fantasies, not in reality. It's a blast listening to Prof. Wanley, (Edward G. Robinson), District Attorney Frank Loler, (Raymond Massey), and Dr. Barkstane, (Edmund Breon), all in their late 40's to late 50's, talking about young women as though they were living bomb-shells. Why, if a middle-aged man gets within 30 feet of a pretty young woman, she could mesmerize him with a glance, make him give her all his possessions for a single kiss, and of course, eventually destroy him completely...with one hand tied behind her back. Indeed, Edmund Breon, who played a middle-aged music box collector in the excellent Rathbone/Sherlock Holmes film, "Dressed To Kill", fell under the thrall of beautiful villainess Patricia Morison in that film, and paid with his life. What got our brave trio talking about young women in the first place is the compelling painting of a beautiful young woman in an art gallery window, which is next store to their club. They all fell in love with her at first sight, with Robinson the last to see it, and the last to have his heart pierced. Massey and Breon are watching him, and start giving Robinson the needle. "We saw her first, so you stay out of it."  It is Robinson's destiny to meet the woman in the portrait, Alice Reed, played wonderfully by Joan Bennett. Of course he's wary, and full of reservations at this chance meeting. To his credit, he doesn't make a fool out of himself, and Bennett genuinely seems to like him. What Robinson does so effectively in this film is convey very subtly, that he can never really quite accept even the possibility that he could hold this beautiful woman's attention, no matter how charming or interesting he really is. It's never stated but implied, that he thinks she's doing him a favor by making friends with him.  Of course, this encounter leads to trouble, very serious trouble, and the "Woman In The Window" ventures into the dark waters of blackmail and murder. District Attorney Lalor (Massey) is in charge of the case, making things even more intriguing. It is a compelling film, and Robinson &amp; Bennett are superb in their scenes together. I'll leave you to discover just what kind of woman the mysterious Alice Reed turns out to be. This is a very interesting and enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to tell which element of "The Woman in the Window" (1944) contributes most to its excellence: script, direction, casting, performances, lighting, cinematography, scoring. So, it's probably safe to say, "All of the above!" "TWITW" introduces us to Assoc. Prof. Richard Wanley (Edward G. Robinson) of Gotham College, who has just seen his wife and two kids (young Robert Blake is "Dickie" Wanley) off for a two week summer vacation. Just prior to entering his men's club, he is captivated by the portrait of a beautiful woman in the display window of a neighboring storefront. His club member friends, District Attorney Frank Lalor (Raymond Massey) and surgeon Dr. Barkstane (Edmond Breon) notice him staring at the portrait and indulge the temporary "bachelor professor" in some good-natured ribbing before the three enter the club for drinks and conversation. As the evenings winds down, the doctor having subscribed some medication for Prof. Wanley who has complained of fatigue, the colleagues leave. Prof. Wanley asks for a 10:30 PM call in the event that he dozes off while reading in his club chair. Upon leaving the club, Wanley again stops at the portrait; and standing behind him is the model, Alice Reed (Joan Bennett), who posed for the artist. She admits that she frequently comes to the spot to check out people's rections to the painting. The small talk leads the two to an innocent drink at a club followed by a visit to her sumptuous apartment, where she shows Wanley other sketches by the artist.The intrusion of an insanely jealous lover leads to struggle, murder (in self-defense) and a quandary: How do two non-merderous strangers go about covering up a murder, disposing of a body (a large one), and manage to trust eachother in the process? The body turns out to be the type of man who warrants headlines. Wanley's friendship with the D.A. gets him invited on a "field trip" to the spot where the body was found. Here we meet the Chief Inspector, beautifully portrayed by Thomas E. Jackson). Through a series of delightfully handled mishaps, the gentle professor manages to exhibit elements about himself which would conspire to make him a prime suspect had the very prospect not been so ludicrous. A sleazy, but extremely clever blackmailer (Dan Duryea) is introduced. How he becomes involved, we'll leave unsaid, so as not to spoil some of the film's outstanding storytelling. The characters are three dimensional. Massey, as the D.A. is both a condescending stuffed-shirt and a caring friend. Jackson, as the Inspector is superbly understated, an affable exterior housing a brilliant mind for detection. Bennett and Duryea are both fine, although some of the dialog between them could easily have been cut to the improvement of the film overall. Robinson is excellent as the unassuming, bright but vulnerable professor. The Nunnally Johnson-Arthur Lange script is right-on, with the noted exceptions. Director Fritz Lang has created a taut, superb suspense tale. "The Woman in the Window" could easily have had either of two endings, one tragically ironic, one concocted to satisfy audiences in search of more delectably amusing resolution. I'll never tell. This film deserves any healthy debate about its ending every bit as much now, in the year 2000, as it did during its first release in 1944.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absorbing Edward G. Robinson "film noir" murder mystery with surprise ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Woman in the Window" is one of my favourite Hollywood films of the forties and is in fact included in my "Top Ten" movies of all time. Expertly directed by Fritz Lang and starring Edward G. Robinson, the delectable Joan Bennett in a wonderfully seductive performance, and the sinister Dan Duryea it has a fascinating storyline, some outstanding acting and a "twist in the tale". Robinson is respectable Professor Richard Wanley (married with children) whose family are away on holiday. Admiring the painting of a woman in the window of an art gallery near his club he is surprised (and pleased) to see the attractive model (Joan Bennett) standing right next to him. She explains that she often comes along to the gallery to "watch people's faces" when they look at her painting and see how they react. After a few minutes conversation Robinson reluctantly escorts Bennett back to her apartment and the events which ensue lead to murder, blackmail, hardship and deep torment for Robinson whose neat well organised life is thrown into turmoil and disarray. Robinson's friend Frank Lalor (Raymond Massey) is the District Attorney investigating the murder which ironically for Robinson causes him even further complications and gets him unwittingly drawn deeper and deeper into the murder inquiry. Just when it seems that things could not get any worse for Robinson there is a magnificent twist at the end of the movie which comes as a total surprise!!Some favourite lines from the film:Joan Bennett (to Robinson): "I'm not married. I have no designs on you and one drink is all I care for".Robinson (to Bennett): "I should never have stopped to talk with you - I should never never have come here to drink with you". Bennett (to Robinson): "Never?".Raymond Massey (to Robinson): "It's all right Richard - don't get excited. We rarely arrest people just for knowing where the body was".Bennett (to Dan Duryea): "Are you nuts? I haven't got $5,000 and there isn't any guy to get it from so you may as well go right along to the police and tell them whatever you wish!".Although Edward G. Robinson was not the typical leading man type he could always be relied upon to give a good performance and in "Woman in the Window" he was at his very best!! 10 out of 10 for acting, direction, screenplay and photography. The only Oscar nomination this film received was for "best score" which was in my opinion an oversight as I believe in retrospect that both Robinson and Bennett clearly desrved to be nominated for their acting. If you enjoy this film be sure to see "Scarlet Street" (1945) which is another classic "film noir" thriller featuring the same three leading players and with Fritz Lang once again as director.

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang Winner (almost!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herr Lang has another winner here with the same cast that he used in "Scarlet Street" in 1946.....wonderful portrayals from all concerned. In both films, Edward G. is caught up in a situation that traps him and forces him to make decisions that go against his sense of morality. Joan Bennett is gorgeous as the beautiful woman who ensnares Robinson in her troubles. Dan Duryea again proves that he was one hell of an actor.....he was stereotyped throughout his career in roles in which he was a coward, a weakling and a thoroughly unlikeable guy and nobody played it better. The story line is gripping and you feel as trapped as Edward G. BUT, it is that ending!!!!! Lang never was one for the easy out but here he must have been desperate to tie up all the loose ends and come up with a believable solution...so he tacks on the worst ending since the Bobby Ewing/Dallas explanation! I was disappointed that he would stoop to something so pat (and he is one of my favorite directors). This film could go down as a true classic and should have except for the ending....that knocked it right off the list. Still, it is very much worth watching and I would recommend it to all who love film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent noir from the master Fritz Lang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubting that Fritz Lang made his best films in his native Germany - the masterpieces 'M' and 'Metropolis' ensure that without the need to mention the likes of Doctor Mabuse; but even so, his American films have some gems - and this quality film noir thriller is certainly one of them. Made with the same cast as Fritz Lang's later 'Scarlet Street', The Woman in the Window is a tale of lust and money, wrapped up in the idea of how life becomes less exciting as you approach middle age. Professor Richard Wanley is a middle-aged man bored with how life is treating him. This boredom is soon to dissipate, however, when he and his friends become obsessed with the portrait of a woman in a shop window. On his way home one night, Richard meets this woman purely by chance and ends up going back to her apartment to look at more artist impressions of her. This ends in tragedy, when her boyfriend comes knocking, and ends up discovering our hero in his girl's apartment! A struggle ensues and the boyfriend ends up dead...Richard agrees to hide the body in order to keep the pair of them from spending time behind bars.Many of the ideas later used in Scarlet Street are present here too, and in that respect; The Woman in the Window serves as an interesting prelude to the later film. The film analyses a murder from the moral point of view, rather than being purely for profit. This idea was better realised by Lang later the same year in the aforementioned noir classic, but through it's inspired plotting and unpredictable atmosphere; The Woman in the Window analyses the same idea in a slightly different way. The cast is put to good use, with the great Edward G. Robinson doing a fine job with the lead role. He portrays his character admirably, and the scenes where the finger of suspicion drifts over him sees Robinson at his best. Joan Bennett plays his female counterpart. This beautiful woman is great as the heroine, and it's her performance that gives the film that golden Hollywood feel. The ending is one that could easily have gone wrong, but Lang makes good of it, and it actually makes sense of little nuisances, such as the fact that Robinson is allowed to accompany his policeman friend to a murder scene early on in the film. I would rate Scarlet Street as the must see film of the pair; but if you enjoyed that one, there's no reason why this one shouldn't go down well also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic suspense thriller directed by the great Fritz Lang but spoiled by a cop-out ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gripping suspense thriller involves a man (Edward G. Robinson) and woman (Joan Bennett) who barely know each other conspiring to cover up a murder which threatens to destroy their lives. Robinson is an aging college professor of criminal justice who thinks there is no adventure left in his life anymore; Bennett is a mysterious and beautiful model. Fritz Lang's brilliant direction and a stunning musical score build the suspense incredibly. However, this superb film is spoiled by a trivializing happy ending, probably imposed on Lang by studio hacks. In all other respects, it is a triumph of film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have rated this higher except I don't like endings where the whole story turns out to be nothing but a dream. That is unfair to any viewer and it also discouraged me from ever watching this again.Until then, it was quite good, almost like a Columbo television episode where you know the person who committed the crime early and and then see how the police unravel the mystery, much to the disdain and paranoia of the guilty culprit. In this case, it was two culprits: played by Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett. The story gets better as it goes on with some realistic characters.Dan Duryea adds a lot of spark to the story, as the blackmailing bodyguard. He's fun to watch, which is not a surprise if you've seen him other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following a chance meeting with a beautiful young woman, a forty-something professor unwittingly becomes involved in murder and blackmail while his family is away on vacation. Robinson is wonderful as always as the professor who is in over his head because of a moment's indiscretion. Bennett looks stunningly beautiful as the kind of woman who can lead any man astray. Duryea is appropriately slimy as a blackmailer. Lang is at the top of his form in this atmospheric and efficiently made film noir. Some feel cheated by the ending but it is actually quite clever. Interestingly enough, Lang reunited with Robinson, Bennett, and Duryea in his next film, "Scarlet Street."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the family of Gotham College Professor Richard Wanley (Edward G. Robinson) travels, he meets with his close friends Dr. Michael Barkstane (Edmund Breon) and District Attorney Frank Lalor (Raymond Massey) in a club for talking. Wanley is fascinated with the portrait of a young woman in the next door window, and they discuss about affairs and middle-age crisis while drinking. When Wanley leaves the club, he walks to the window to admire the picture once more and he meets Alice Reed (Joan Bennett), who was the model of the painting. She invites him for a drink and they end the night in her apartment for seeing sketches of Alice made by the same artist. While drinking champagne, her temperable lover arrives and misunderstands the presence of Richard, hitting and suffocating him. In self-defense, Richard stabs the man with a pair of scissors on the back and kills him. They decide to get rid off the body, dumping the body in the woods and destroying the evidences, but when they are blackmailed by the scum Heidt (Dan Duryea), Professor Wanley tells Alice that there are only three ways to deal with a blackmailer, all of them with a high price."The Woman in the Window" is another fantastic film-noir of the awesome director Fritz Lang. The engaging and original story has a magnificent and unexpected plot point in the very end. This is one of the best performances of Edward G. Robinson that I have seen and the leading trio - Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea ? worked on the next year with Fritz Lang in the masterpiece "Scarlet Street". This is the first time that I see this outstanding movie, following the recommendation of a friend of mine that I would like to thank. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Retrato de Mulher" ("Picture of a Woman")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, steady, fascinating, and a little too deliberate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woman in the Window (1944)A methodical movie about a methodical cover-up. Edgar G. Robinson is the perfect actor for a steady, rational man having to face the crisis of a murder, and Fritz Lang, who has directed murderousness before, knows also about darkness and fear. There are no flaws in the reasoning, and if there is a flaw to the movie, it is it's very methodical perfection. Even the flaws are perfect, the mistakes made and how they are shown.We all at one time or another get away with something, large or small. And this law-abiding man finds himself trapped. He has to succeed, and you think he might. Part of me kept saying, I wouldn't do that, or don't be a fool. But part of me said, it's inevitable, he'll fail, we all would fail. So the movie moves with a steady thoughtful pace. It talks a lot for an American crime film, but it also has the best of night scenes--rainy streets with gleaming dark streets, hallways with glass windows and harsh light, and dark woods (for the body, of course). But there are dull moments, some odd qualities like streets with no parked cars at all, and a leading woman who is a restrained femme fatale, which isn't the best. And then there are twists and suspicions, dodges and subterfuges. And of course Dan Duryea, who makes a great small-time chiseler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Woman in the Window is directed by Fritz Lang and adapted by Nunnally Johnson from the novel "Once off Guard" written by J.H. Wallis. It stars Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Raymond Massey &amp; Dan Duryea. Music is by Arthur Lange and Milton R. Krasner is the cinematographer.After admiring a portrait of Alice Reed (Bennett) in the storefront window of the shop next to his Gentleman's Club, Professor Richard Wanley (Robinson) is shocked to actually meet her in person on the street. It's a meeting that leads to a killing, recrimination and blackmail.Time has shown The Woman in the Window to be one of the most significant movies in the film noir cycle. It was part of the original group identified by Cahiers du Cinéma that formed the cornerstone of film noir (the others were The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Laura and Murder My Sweet). Its reputation set in stone, it's a film that boasts many of the key noir ingredients: man meets woman and finds his life flipped upside down, shifty characters, a killing, shadows and low lights, and of course an atmosphere thick with suspense. Yet the ending to this day is divisive and, depending what side of the camp you side with, it makes the film either a high rank classic noir or a nearly high rank classic noir. Personally it bothers me does the finale, it comes off as something that Rod Serling could have used on The Twilight Zone but decided to discard. No doubt to my mind that had Lang put in the ending from the source, this would be a 10/10 movie, for everything else in it is top draw stuff.At its core the film is about the dangers of stepping out of the normal, a peril of wish fulfilment in middle age, with Lang gleefully smothering the themes with the onset of a devilish fate and the stark warning that being caught just "once off guard" can doom you to the unthinkable. There's even the odd Freudian interpretation to sample. All of which is aided by the excellent work of Krasner, who along with his director paints a shadowy world consisting of mirrors, clocks and Venetian blinds. The cast are very strong, strong enough in fact for Robinson, Bennett and Duryea to re-team with Lang the following year for the similar, but better, Scarlet Street, while Lang's direction doesn't miss a beat.A great film regardless of the Production Code appeasing ending, with its importance in the pantheon of film noir well deserved. But you sense that watching it as a companion piece to Scarlet Street, that Lang finally made the film that this sort of story deserved. The Woman in the Window: essential but not essentially the best of its type. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, great ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to disagree with all the people who say that the ending spoils the whole movie. In my opinion, it is just the opposite: the end makes the whole film much better. First of all, it is the only way to make the whole thing realistic. Is it possible to believe that a professor -supposed to be an intelligent person- would react to a murder in the way he does, i.e., getting rid of the body, when it would have been very easy for him to prove his innocence? Furthermore, is it logical his suggestion of killing the blackmailer? Of course, it could all have been that way, but then it would not have been such a realistic film as it actually is; it would have been a good thriller, but nothing more. Actually, it is a thriller, but also a deep description of the human mind. All the "thriller" is a description of the professor's hidden desires and fears. Some interesting details: -When he is giving a lecture at the beginning of the film, the name of Sigmund Freud is written on the blackboard. Freud's theories are the key of the film. -During all the dream, whenever the professor appears in his house, portraits of his wife and children are visible. This shows once again his fears and his state of mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The woman of his dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't hold Lang in particularly high esteem, he has a bit of a rough hand for my taste. But he's one of few who can claim they invented noir as far back as the silent era, or laid all the groundwork for others to decorate with shadows and dames, so I will watch anything he does in this field with some interest.This is a very taut thing to say the least, a thriller par excellance. It has all the hallmarks; concentrated space, unfolds in real time, simple but smart setups of the bomb ticking beneath the table, to quote from Hitchcock.So it's not just that the noir schmuck has to sneak out of town with a corpse on his backseat, across empty streets at night, while omens abound everywhere he looks. He's also the most unlikely guy to ever find himself in this situation, a quaint college professor who had one drink too much with the wrong woman. And this explains perhaps why it's no more well known, say on par with Hitchcock. Edward Robinson is short, stocky, mousy, just perfect for the occasion but really far from the ideal leading man, Joan Bennett on the other hand is beautiful and fragile but is neither as radiant as a Gene Tierney.The main idea is twofold tension; on one hand the culprit is kept up to date every step of the investigation leading back to him, because his friend is the DA, on the other hand police are looking for who's in plain sight of them all this time. It works, even as a few of the slip-ups come across as forced and because we need the noose to tighten fast.But there is something else here that deserves mention. Oh, the final twist spells it out for us, but an observant viewer will have noted what goes on as soon as the professor is asleep and meets the woman in the picture.Between sleeps, we have a deliciously moral anxiety; a nightmare that vividly steers a middle-aged man away from desire that his friends openly indulge in, and no doubt he would as well, and back into social order.Oh, the message is stridently cautionary as was customary in Hollywood, even if a bit humorous. Watch Jacques Rivette's Celine and Julie for the same motif - the mind asleep - improvised with more breath and soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Careful What You Wish For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expect a lot of hookers went hungry after this cautionary tale was released. It's enough to frighten most any philandering husband into permanent fidelity. Because once the screenplay finishes with Prof. Wanley (Robinson), he's not even going to think about straying, blonde, brunette, or redhead. And that controversial ending is especially effective at driving the point home.I like the way the screenplay makes use of "doubles". After all, a part of the professor peels off in his dream and has the romantic adventure the real guy can only fantasize about. At the same time, the sexy portrait peels off into the "real" woman such that the two doubles meet in a twilight world of fantasy.No wonder the professor is restive. He's a highly respectable family man in a highly respectable profession with highly respectable friends, undergoing what we would now call a mid-life crisis. His body may feel trapped, but his imagination isn't. And get a load of Bennett?she's one delectable package, especially in that clinging gown. She's certainly no streetwalker, more like a kept-woman with a list of prestigious clients. Note how the Production Code screenplay stays vague about her means of support. Still, she and her ritzy apartment are just the kind of set-up a guy like Wanley (note that the name begins with 'wan') would dream about, that is, until things get out of hand.The middle part sags a bit as police procedure takes over, and the prof's conscience begins to drop hints to the authorities. It's clear, even then, that not even his double can escape the respectable man himself, as the climax reaffirms.But that showdown between Bennett and Duryea amounts to a little gem of scripting and acting. It's a cat and mouse contest all the way, except it's unclear which is which. Bennett is so good at being a silken conniver, while Duryea is the last word in slimy schemer. Watching them maneuver is fascinating, and in my book, the movie's high point.What a fine turn by Robinson as the under-stated professor. Hard to believe his unimposing figure could also snarl with the best of them, e.g. Little Caesar (1930). Here, his homely little man yearning beyond respectability is so believable. For that matter, so is the nightmarish lesson he's taught himself. As a result, when he runs from the blonde streetwalker at movie's end, I expect more than a few guys were running with him. All in all, if Family Council Oscars were given out, this crafty screenplay would deserve a big one. More importantly, the 90-minutes amounts to a darn good film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Longing For Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lead character, Richard Wanley (Edward G. Robinson), is a middle-age absent-minded professor who teaches a course in crime. For relaxation he meets with two other middle-age men for drinks and academic conversation. Surrounded by books and dim light, the three men talk about how stodgy their lives are, how averse they are to adventure, and how alluring the woman is whose portrait they see in a nearby shop's window.Says Richard to his two friends: "you know, even if the spirit of adventure should rise up before me and beckon, even in the form of that alluring young woman in the window next door, I'm afraid all I'd do is clutch my coat a little tighter, mutter something idiotic, and run like the devil."This story setup, with quiet, reflective, sedentary characters, gives the film's surprise ending credibility. With a different setup, with different characters, the film's ending, as is, would be an act of creative malfeasance. But here, it works.And Richard's excellent adventure is spellbinding. Tension is maximized because we, as viewers, are put directly in the point of view of Richard and his predicament. What would we do in such a situation? How would we react?I wouldn't have cast Edward G. Robinson in the lead role. But he certainly does a nice job. So does Joan Bennett, as the woman in the window. The film's plot is tight, except in the second half, in a couple of sequences involving a blackmailer."The Woman In The Window" is a clever, well-written, character driven story about a man whose infatuation with a beautiful woman's portrait drives him into a dangerous adventure. Once the viewer has seen the ending, the power of the plot vanishes. But even then, that ending is still thought-provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine noir with a clever and -- the second time you see it -- satisfying twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Woman in the Window has an ending almost guaranteed to infuriate you the first time you see the movie, and, the second time, to leave you with an immensely satisfied smile. "The man who kills in self defense, for instance, must not be judged by the same standards applied to a man who kills for gain." So says middle-aged and happily married Richard Wanley (Edward G. Robinson), professor of criminal psychology, to his class at Gotham College. Wanley is about to put his dictum to the test. When his wife and their two young children leave for a brief vacation, he dines at his club with two old friends, one a doctor and the other, Frank Lalor (Raymond Massey), the district attorney. Wanley bemoans his increasingly middle-aged life. "I hate this solidity," he says with a rueful smile, "this stodginess I'm beginning to feel. To me, it's the end of the brightness of life, the end of spirit and adventure." His two friends leave and he settles in, before returning to his empty home, with one last brandy and The Song of Songs. When he leaves the club late in the evening he stops, as he often has, and gazes at the portrait in the window of the gallery next door. The woman is lovely...beautiful, with a challenge in her eyes and a gaze that looks right at you. When a voice asks him for a light for her cigarette, the professor turns and is stunned to see that the voice belongs to the woman who posed for the portrait. Alice Reed (Joan Bennett) sometimes stops by the gallery to see the reaction of men when they look at her portrait. The two somehow wind up at a quiet bar, talk and then the professor escorts her to her apartment in a taxi. She invites him up and shows him sketches the artist made of her before painting her portrait. She seems genuinely friendly and honest and the professor apparently has no intention of becoming an adulterer. But when an angry man breaks into her apartment, slaps Alice Reed and attacks Professor Wanley, it's only a matter of seconds before the man is dead, stabbed by Wanley in the back with a pair of scissors handed him by Alice. Professor Wanley's life now begins to spin out of his control. He decides to say nothing to the police. He leaves Alice and returns with his car. With her help he gets the body into the back seat and drives it to a deserted parkway, where he disposes of it in the underbrush. The man turns out to be a powerful businessman who had been seeing Alice regularly two or three times a week. The Professor's friend Lalor takes charge of the investigation and invites Wanley to accompany him, thinking the professor of criminology will be interested in how the case is slowly being built up to identify the murderer. Wanley keeps making little errors and mistakes...a ripped coat, a scratched wrist, a tire track in the mud, a slip of the tongue that seems to say Wanley knows more than he should. Lalor begins to look curiously at his old friend. And then the bodyguard (Dan Duryea) of the dead man turns up. He blackmails Alice, who must ask Wanley for help. This time Wanley reluctantly begins to think of murder. The Woman in the Window is a fine noir. Some may think it's just the opening act for Fritz Lang's Scarlet Street, filmed the following year with the same three stars, Robinson, Bennett and Duryea. Scarlet Street is a classic, drenched in casual cruelty, loneliness and sadness. The Woman in the Window starts out as a classic noir. Professor Wanley is a man of good intentions whom we like and who finds himself moving in situations well beyond his capability. Joan Bennett's Alice Reed, however, is no Kitty March. Alice may be a kept woman, but she wants to do the right thing as long as she doesn't get in trouble. And she seems genuinely to like and even respect the Professor. Dan Duryea, of course, is a rotter, but he's at least straight forward here. He wants money; he doesn't seem to delight in hitting women. It makes for a movie which puts a premium on the skill of the actors to bring us along with them as events conspire against them. Few were better at this than Edward G. Robinson and, in my opinion, the under-appreciated Joan Bennett. So we have a first class noir...and then Fritz Lang pulls the rug out from under us. To fully appreciate The Woman in the Window -- trust me -- you'll need to see it a second time. How about making that second time a double feature? Have some friends over and play Scarlet Street first, then The Woman in the Window. Keep them in that order. You'll have a great main course, and then a great desert.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a great film. I actually watched (not through choice) the colourised version of this classic film noir, and while that's a debate in itself, I must admit I was seduced by the ochres and browns employed here and wasn't distracted at all by their use. I'm a great fan of Fritz Lang's oeuvre and unlike other critics here no way accept a diminution in his skills when he crossed the pond to Hollywood. I mean pick any one from "Fury", "You only live Once", "Scarlet Street" and this, as entertaining a thriller / fantasy film as you could ever hope to see. I prefer to think that like his great contemporary Hitchcock, he adapted superbly to the mores of the Hollywood studios and generated a great body work almost the equal of "The Master", who don't forget had more pull with the studios, meaning bigger budgets and stars at his disposal to more convincingly project his artistic vision. The story here is of course a cautionary one, "be careful what you wish for" as Edward G Robinson realises every safe middle aged man's fantasy as his dream girl, the alluring Joan Bennett comes to life right on cue to bring some glamour and excitement to his bookish existence. Besides the two leads excellent portrayals, I was impressed by Dan Duryea as the blackmailing heavy but good as the cast are, it's Lang's manipulation of them which attracts most admiration. Okay the "Dallas" meets "Wizard of Oz" ending might seem a bit of a cop-out but that would be griping over next to nothing. This is great Hollywood film noir and thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Psychology professor Richard Wanley played by Edward G. Robibson, who seems to be sleepwalking throughout the entire movie, gets a lot more then he expected when he becomes infatuated with a portrait of a woman Alice Reed, Joan Bennett,in a art display window as she suddenly comes out of the shadows and into his life. Taking Alice out for a drink at a local night club Richard is invited to her apartment to more or less chit chat, Richard is married with children, and nothing else.After getting to know each other a little better all of a sudden this wild man bursts into Alice's apartment and almost like a robot, the guy looked like he was under hypnosis, attacks Richard ringing his neck. Alice coming to Richard's rescue hands him a pair of scissors where he ends up stabbing the unhinged and crazy guy to death. It turns out that the dead man is a Frank Howard, Arthur Loft, who's been having an affair with Alice and lost it when he found her alone in her apartment with another man. An open and shut case of self defense Richard together with Alice instead of calling the police choose to practically implicate themselves in a murder that they really didn't commit. The two decide to transport Howard's body by automobile to the wilds of upstate New York and dump it there where it would, hopefully for them, be found days if not weeks later decomposed and unorganizable.Things don't go exactly as planned for Richard and Alice with Frank Howard turning out to be Wall Street financier Claude Mazard with the police having an all points bulletin looking to find him within 24 hours of his disappearance. Richard also messed up in his disposing of Mazard's body by both inuring himself, Richard cut his hand on a barbwire fence, and leaving his both shoe and tire prints at the scene. There's also the fact that Mazard's body was found in tact and identifiable the very next day by former "Little Rascal" and now eagle scout Spanky McFarland with all the evidence of Richard being there in tact as well.Despite all the facts pointing towards Richard and him subconsciously blurting out facts about Mazard's killing that would have him at least arrested for questioning by the police his friend District Attorney Frank Lolar, Raymond Massey, doesn't seem to catch on and gives him a more or less free pass in Mazard's death. It's when this blackmailing sleaze-ball and Mazard's former bodyguard Heidt, Dan Duryea, pops up that things really get hot for Richard &amp; Alice. Heidt wants a cool $5,000.00 from Alice, he's not really sure who her accomplice his, for him to keep his mouth shut about her involvement in Mazard's death, somehow Heidt put two and two together, or else he'll rat her out to the police. Alice and Richard in turn plan to do Heidt in by having him invited to Alice's place for the evening and then spiking his drink with a lethal dose of sleeping pills.Like everything Richard and Alice planned in their "perfect crime" this also backfires as well with Heidt getting the drop on what Alice was up to and taking off with the full $5,000.00, she offered him $2,900.00, after slapping her around for trying to hoodwink as well as kill him. On top of all that Heitd wants another $5,000.00 or else he'll rat her, and eventually Richard, out to the police where they both can very well end up in the Sing Sing electric chair. Richard getting the news from Alice that everything is now kaput and that he'll together with her will soon be arrested goes home and downs a bottle of crushed sleeping pills, in his wine, waiting for the or his end to come. It's when everything looks like it's going down hill for Richard and Alice that Heidt ends up getting shot and killed by the police for what seemed like him running a red light! You now wonder if the news, with Alice being on he scene of Heidt's shooting, will get to Richard before he ends up killing himself! It's then when the movie finally starts to make sense as we watch Richard out cold, from downing his toxic drink, as Alice frantically tries to get in touch with him by phone with the good news of Heidt's sudden departure. It's then that you suddenly begin to wonder if the movie is at all real or something out of the ordinary; like something straight out of an episode of the "Twilight Zone" or "One Step Beyond"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Guilt Trip Of A Lifetime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a dignified middle aged professor starts to muse about how dull and boring his life has become and also feels frustrated by the constraints placed upon him by his lifestyle, he becomes increasingly discontented and despondent. The necessity to no longer respond to events completely spontaneously or to simply act in accordance with his own instincts has taken a great deal of the colour and vitality out of his world. The opportunity for an improvement seems to arise however, when his wife and family leave for a short vacation and after having become captivated by the portrait of a beautiful woman in a gallery window, he unexpectedly meets her and she invites him to her apartment to see some sketches by the artist who'd painted the portrait. Unfortunately for the professor, these developments also propel him into the guilt trip of a lifetime.Professor Richard Wanley (Edward G Robinson) and Alice Reed (Joan Bennett) spend a pleasant evening together until an extremely angry guy suddenly storms into the apartment, slaps Alice and starts to strangle Wanley. As the two men struggle, Alice slips a pair of scissors into Wanley's hand and he stabs his attacker. At first, Wanley intends to contact the police, but then on reflection, decides to dispose of the body instead. Alice tells Wanley that the man had regularly visited her and she knew him as Frank Howard. She empties the man's pockets before Wanley takes the body to his car and finds a watch with the initials "CM" engraved on it. He then goes and dumps the body in a wooded area.Next day, Wanley meets his friends District Attorney Frank Lalor (Raymond Massey) and Dr Michael Barkstane (Edmund Breon) at their club and Lalor announces that he's been put in charge of investigating the disappearance of prominent financier Claude Mazard. The body is subsequently discovered by a boy scout and Lalor thinks it's likely that Mazard had gone to his mistress' home and been killed by one of her other male friends. He also mentions that a bodyguard had been employed to follow Mazard and that the "tail" was also a criminal. When Barkstane notices Wanley looking increasingly disturbed and upset, he prescribes some sleeping powders but warns that an overdose would be fatal.Mazard's bodyguard Heidt (Dan Duryea) visits Alice's apartment and after threatening to expose her involvement in Mazard's death, demands that she hand over $5,000 to ensure his silence. He searches around and finds the scissors and the professor's initialled pencil. She asks for time to pay and he promises to return the following day. Alice contacts Wanley to tell him about the blackmail and knowing that Heidt won't stop after receiving the first ransom; Wanley gives Alice the cash and some sleeping powders to put into Heidt's drink. Heidt collects the money, but becomes suspicious and avoids the drink and after another search, finds Mazard's watch which he puts in his pocket before leaving. His possession of this item is incriminating and leads to the first of the two twists which conclude the story."Thw Woman In The Window" is a gripping melodrama in which the suspense builds relentlessly as Wanley's predicament becomes increasingly serious. His anxiety is also made progressively greater by the fact that:- 1. through his friendship with Lalor, he is close to the investigation and is alarmed at the speed with which developments seem to be racing towards the obvious conclusion that he is the culprit.2. he has a seemingly uncontrollable habit of blurting out remarks which, if taken seriously would point the finger of suspicion firmly at him.3. when he dumped the body, he left behind a whole series of clues.He also feels the strain of knowing that things have become hopelessly out of control as he goes from killing a man to disposing of the body and then colluding with Alice to kill a second man. The tension he feels also becomes unbearable as he tries to maintain his respectability so that he can avoid jeopardising his marriage, his family life and his career.This movie is a well regarded film noir but one which departs from some of the conventions of the style. Most notably, the much maligned ending changes the whole tenor of what had transpired earlier, the very repressed Wanley is certainly not a typical noir hero and Alice is a far more mysterious and benign presence than the standard femme fatale. Similarly, its rather moralistic and salutary tone (especially at the end) is at odds with the more ambiguous and objective stance more commonly adopted in these films.The strong supporting cast act in a style which is extremely competent, though maybe rather "stagey" by modern standards and Edward G Robinson and Joan Bennett are excellent throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Lang winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's sturdy ensemble - Joan Bennett, Edward G. Robinson, and Dan Duryea - which would deliver again in 1945's "Scarlet Street" - comes together for "The Woman in the Window," a 1944 film noir. The two stories have some similarities, with Robinson in over his head, Duryea a slime bucket, and Bennett a beauty, though this time, not corrupt like her character in "Scarlet Street." However, as in that film, she manages to get Robinson in it up to his neck.Robinson here is an assistant professor, Richard Wanley, enjoying a bachelor summer as his family gets out of the city as he hangs out at his club with two friends, the DA (Raymond Massey) and a doctor (Edmund Breon). One night, on arriving at the club, he notices an arresting painting of a woman in the gallery next door and becomes mesmerized by the woman's seductive beauty. Inside the club, the conversation is rather depressing - he and his friends are middle-aged, and their adventurous years seem over even if the spirit is still willing. On leaving the club that evening, Wanley can't help looking at the portrait again - and in the window's reflection, he sees the artist's model, Alice Reed, standing behind him. He takes her out for a drink, and she invites him to her place to see some of the artist's other sketches of her. It's all fairly innocent, Wanley being happily married but just enjoying some extra freedom and a little of that adventure. It turns out to be more than a little. Unfortunately, Reed's boyfriend enters and on seeing Wanley, becomes jealous and attacks him. A terrible fight ensues, and Wanley is about to be strangled when he is able to repeatedly stab the man in the back with scissors which Alice hands him. He's about to call the police but hesitates for fear it will ruin his career. He decides instead to cover up the murder and dump the body with Alice's help. Then he has to sit by while his friend the DA comes up with clues to solve the case, and Alice becomes the victim of a blackmailer.This is really an excellent film, very compelling and tense, and I for one didn't mind the twist ending one bit, which the viewer will find somewhat reminiscent of a famous film done a few years earlier. Perhaps by now the device has been overdone; I don't think it was back in 1944, and it's certainly a surprise.Lang's stylish direction makes each moment count in this atmospheric film set in and around New York City. Robinson hands in yet another fine performance as an innocent in Babylon; Bennett does a great job as a man magnet who didn't mean to get Wanley in trouble; and Dan Duryea, as a nasty bodyguard, is very good with some fabulous line deliveries. "What an amateur!" he sneers at Alice as he finds what he's looking for in her apartment. Duryea was by reputation a very nice guy, but you'd never know it from the scores of blackmailers, sadists, and killers he played during his long career.It's a shame that Lang was so difficult to work with, which caused his career in the U.S. to hit the skids in the '50s. Nevertheless, he was one of the great directors, and in the noir genre, he was a hard guy to beat. If you love film noir, don't miss the master's "The Woman in the Window."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dream is a life, a little more coherent than most....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS** Fritz Lang had a reputation for stalking around the set barking orders through a megaphone, wearing breeches and riding boots and a monacle, the last of the great cartoons. At least he got the job done. "Woman in the Window" is pretty good noirish stuff. I say "noir-ish" because it's missing one of the principal icons of the genre -- the black snub-nosed .38 revolver. In it's conventional place we have some of Fritz Lang's ideosyncratic icons -- straw hats, mirrors, and scissors. Robinson leads a rather stodgy life as an assistant professor at Gotham College. (Who is promoted to department head during the film. How do you do that?) He periodically gets together with two friends for dinner at his club, a doctor and the district attorney, Raymond Massey. One night after leaving the club he runs into Joan Bennett and accepts an invitation to her apartment. An enraged man rushes in and begins strangling Robinson who must stab him repeatedly with a pair of scissors in order to save his own life. Robinson and Bennett then weave the proverbial tangled web. Robinson disposes of the body in some woods north of New York. I should say "a densely wooded area" because that's where all dead bodies are found, including this one, by a Boy Scout who promises that if he gets the reward he will use the money to send his kid brother to Harvard and he himself will go to a GOOD college. (The script by Nunnally Johnson is intelligent and witty, one of the movie's better features.) The story is a big improvement over that of its companion piece, "Scarlet Street," if only because in the latter Robinson had to be an undiscovered genius in painting still lifes. And the paintings we see are sidesplittingly absurd. The acting and the ending in "Woman in the Window" also deserve a comment.Robinson had more range than he's usually given credit for. One watches him in "Little Caesar," chewing the scenery, snarling, strutting, grinning idiotically, and the image is stamped on one's brain. But he could do other things as well, and sometimes quite nicely too. His last performance, in "Soylent Green," was one of his best. Joan Bennett was a competent actress, no more than that. She's not much of a femme fatale here, just ordinarily pretty. She lacks the kind of glandular ooze that someone like Gloria Grahame might have brought to the part. Raymond Massey is likewise professional. It's interesting to watch his expression change from scene to scene as he grows more suspicious of Robinson. Each time Robinson takes a step or opens his mouth he seems to drip more clues, and Massey picks up on each one, so that if his friendship with Robinson begins with a smile, it ends with a thoughtful frown. Dan Duryea is a slimier, venomous version of Bob Fosse in both appearance and movement, reed slender and sinister all the way. The ending. It seems contrived and tacked on. It's as if someone had tapped the producers on the shoulder half-way through shooting and said you've only got ten minutes left to finish the film. So a minute after leaving Bennett's apartment, with his financial future fixed up and no charges against him, Duryea the blackmailer is told to stop by a policeman, pulls out a gun and starts shooting. The clock must have been ticking because this is completely unmotivated. It does serve the broader purpose of the story however in introducing irony. Duryea seems to have brought ruin to Robinson's life. And by the time of the shootout Robinson has already taken an overdose of something or other and is dozing off into the big sleep without knowing that his suicide is now unnecessary. (It's kind of complicated, I know, but I don't want to take up too much space except to explain that the murder committed by Robinson has now been pinned on the dead Duryea.) But -- wait! There is a high-key closeup of Robinson's face going slack and slumping to the side. Is he dead? No -- he's asleep! A hand enters the frame and touches him on the shoulder, and someone says, "Professor, it's ten thirty." He'd fallen asleep in his chair at the club! Perhaps borrowing from "The Wizard of Oz," a shaken Robinson retrieves his coat from the man he murdered and says good-night to Duryea, the hotel doorman, before walking down the late-night street. He peers at the portrait in the window that started the whole business and a tarty woman's face appears in the reflection. She asks him for a light and he runs off, protesting, "Not on your life. Not for a million dollars!"It's easy to make fun of a movie like this but it's actually kind of neat. Robinson is no crafty villain, and Joan Bennett appears to be an honest whore, less innocent than he but not at all evil. Everything they do is out of desperation. One feels sorry for both of them, especially Robinson who seems never to have had an impure thought. I didn't even mind the it-was-only-a-dream ending. Sure it's been done before, but it permits the film to end on a comic note, which comes as a relief after all the drama and suspense that has preceded it. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this film, and quite thoroughly enjoyed it. I won't reiterate what's already been said by many about its strengths. I just want to offer a different opinion on the ending (without actually divulging any of the content of the ending).I liked the ending. It took my by surprise, and I think, all in all, fit very very well with the way the movie laid itself out. But I can understand why some people might not like it. But to such people I would point out: the ending is almost optional. Because of the way it's structured, you can, if you choose and prefer, basically just ignore the ending, and treat the movie as finished at the point you believe it ought to have been. Rather the way one watches an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and then rather ignores Hitchcock's final explanation of how the killer eventually got caught.I don't want to say too much more because I really don't want to spoil the film for anyone who hasn't seen it. I thought it was excellent.</fullReview>

When her psycho boyfriend unexpectedly shows up, the prof ends up killing him during a scuffle. To protect himself and the gal, he gets rid of the body. Then the fun really starts. Edward G. is at the top of his form here, and Bennett is sexy and ever so slightly tawdry, even fully clothed. The ending, which has been used or misused in many movies before and since, here works beautifully. I am surprised I had never seen this particular melodrama until now.

		<fullReview>THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, coupled with SCARLET STREET, form a formidable duo in Lang's mature American style. The director who may have singlehandedly developed the style that would come to be known as "noir" never relented. Even his latest Indian films are forceful and dense with Lang's characteristic fatalism. He may be more recalled for his work in erecting German cinema, but his cross-pollination with American studio mandate produced a series, from FURY to BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT, containing some of the most influential and memorable films from the 30's, 40's, and 50's. Underneath an ideal surface example of the "noir" construct, Lang interjects a deft psychological evaluation of the increasing voyeurism in American culture -- perhaps encouraged by cinema? Robinson's plunge into fate's grip is all suggested by his fixation on a portrait. Here, Lang smartly plays on the same construct on which Hollywood operates -- the relationship between image and audience. Most potently, he understands that this relationship is a sexual one. A connection between idealized and unreachable models cinema has taught us to build. The kind of kernel that has been gnawing away self-image for a century. However, instead of glorifying and capitalizing on this relationship, Lang inverts it and demonstrates how it can hijack common sense. HOUSE BY THE RIVER shows the same obsession with the human connection with ideals and sex. Furthermore, it introduces a concept key to Lang's greater ideology -- sex and death are forever entwined as basic necessities.We must immediately forgive the ending, like we must do for countless other pictures of this era. It is remarkable that Lang even managed to cultivate such an unforgiving portrait of Americana. In fact the ending only serves to further his evaluation of the viewer's fatal, sexual relationship with art.Like they would repeat in SCARLET STREET, Robinson and Bennett turn in a fine chemistry. Robinson is not an attractive man. But he rejects our need for such a character by inspiring the bumbling, nervous moments of idiocy that we all know in ourselves. There is something about the way Bennett lights her cigarettes that signal danger. WOMAN IN THE WINDOW does not present her as the appalling bitch that she would be in SCARLET STREET, but the smoke hovers around her like an evaporating halo. And her youthful power complex is just right for dragging Robinson into the abyss.Lang managed to be so damning and so hateful while simultaneously constructing a new American style. So many of these films demand a viewing and so few of them get one. A renaissance of this formidable cycle is needed.88.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You stepped out of a dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still find this one amazingly enjoyable after umpteen viewings now ? I mean, once you've seen it and know how it ends it shouldn't really still spark, should it? But it does. Probably because the dignified exploration and expert delineation of its subject and characters coupled with a languid noir atmosphere that even the colourised (and the best I've ever seen too) version couldn't destroy keeps bringing me back to it.Middle aged staid professor (Robinson) sees a beautiful young hooker (Bennett) by her reflection in art gallery window and they get talking. After a few drinks she says she has no designs on him and invites him back to her place at ten past midnight and of course one thing leads to another ? the brutal murder of her enraged boyfriend in self defence and their amateurish attempts to conceal it from the cops and then a blackmailer. How a very respectable elderly man finds himself suddenly thrust into this position and his probable mental processes was lugubriously but believably portrayed by Robinson in one of his best ever performances. Gorgeous Bennett (and her gorgeous apartment too) was suitably high class and low key for the Hays Office and she seemed to take everything that happened good or bad in her stride. Raymond Massey played the incisive DA whose suspicions were gradually rising as regards his bumbling friend, and Dan Duryea as usual excellently played a nasty piece of work.The fatalistic mood Lang imbued here make this a unique film even if held up against his inferior remix Scarlet Street, both well worth watching again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adult film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film in 1945, the ending I felt was a cop-out due to censorship of the time. However, when I read the book, it does end almost the same as the movie. Won't say what it is, it will spoil it for the first time viewer. If you get a chance to see this film, don't miss it. Edward G. Robinson was a fine actor and this is one of his best parts, that of a man in mid-life. Joan Bennett fit the bill, a beauty even with Hedy LaMarrs hair. If you want to see the change in this beauty, look for the film, "TradeWinds"; where she went from blonde to dark. The rest of the cast do a fine job, and the direction was first class by Fritz Lang, who I believe was married to Joan Bennett at the time. Fact of the matter, I think I remember a bit of gossip about this marriage</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang's sure-footed thriller almost compromised by its not-ready-for-noir studio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The catastrophe just around the corner is the premise for Fritz Lang's first unabashed film noir. Settling stuffily into middle age, Edward G. Robinson lectures on criminal psychology at Gotham University (est. 1828). One morning he packs his wife and kids onto the train for a summer in Maine, then repairs to his club for dinner, a brandy or two, and a comfortable snooze in a wing-chair.A portrait in a gallery next door had caught his attention, however, so before heading home he gives it a second glance. Suddenly its beautiful subject (Joan Bennett) looms up behind him, reflected in the glass. They flirt rather formally, stop for a drink, then head back to her apartment under the pretext of viewing more of the artist's work she'd posed for. Suddenly a man Bennett has seeing on the sly with barges in and, enraged, tries to throttle Robinson, who stabs him with scissors. And suddenly Robinson's complacent life lies in shards.He decides, for the sake of his and Bennett's reputations, to dump the body along a stretch of rural road upstate, then part ways forever with this woman from the window. But, far from a nobody, the murdered man turns out to be a wealthy developer, whose death claims headlines. And his bodyguard (Dan Duryea) pays a visit to Bennett, to blackmail her.A shrewd and cultivated man caught in the vise of circumstance, Robinson proves his own worst enemy. When fellow club member Raymond Massey, a police inspector, chats casually about the crime, Robinson blurts out details that only the killer could have known. And as the jaws of the vise squeeze ever more tightly, Robinson devises ever more desperate stratagems to hide his guilt and protect Bennett...While Robinson proves reliably expert, Bennett invests her part with a reserved, almost remote, air that lends to the uncertainty. Her cool contralto beckons, but she plays hard to get. Her arrangements with her dead paramour suggest something sordid but she's not quite the tramp she would be the following year in Scarlet Street (again opposite Robinson and under Lang). The sure-footed Lang simply uses a public clock down the street from Bennett's brownstone to log in a precise chronology of the fateful night. That befits a plot which leans toward the clockwork, but plausibly so. Or rather, does until just its last few minutes. For all intents and purposes, the movie ends, convincingly and satisfyingly, with Robinson slumped in a chair, clutching a drained glass. But MGM wasn't yet ready for the uncompromising vision of the emergent noir cycle, and must have recoiled in horror. So a whimsical wrap-up was hastily grafted on. Some would argue that, in consequence, the movie falls into the valid subcategory of `oneiric' noir. Others would argue that it's just a craven cop-out, at cross purposes with all that's gone before. Luckily, The Woman in the Window displays enough artistry and integrity that it really doesn't matter all that much either way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS SPOILERSFritz Lang had always thought that man was a potential criminal.He ran the whole gamut,showing psychokillers (M),who killed because they could not help it,neurotics ("secret beyond the door")who could easily act ,and the guy next door who could be part of the club too.Edward G.Robinson's character belongs to the third category.He's a good-natured professor,whom we will never suspect.He's caught up in the system and we wonder how he will get away with it.Some users will tell Lang takes the easy way with is long dream.But nobody,in 1999,complained about "The sixth sense" ending!The most important thing,for Fritz Land is that the man bears in mind (or in subconscious)the idea of murder.In "M",Lang showed a "real" trial-Lorre tried for muredr by the populace-,in "secret beyond the door" he would show,three years after "woman in the window" ,an imaginary dreamlike trial where the defendant is also the judge!"Woman in the window" is a movie that needs to be watched twice ,like "beyond a reasonable doubt " ("when you see this 1956 movie for the first time,you pity Dana Andrews for being a chastised innocent;the second time,it's more unbearable because he carries the load of his ineluctable culpability".Jacques Lourcelles,in dictionnaire du cinéma).A lot of clues explain the final unexpected twist,and Joan Bennett's first name is not the least :ALICE!!!!;but there's also the music which becomes threatening and strange as soon as Robinson leaves his club,the way he meets the woman of his dream -a fabulous tour de force-,this recurrent picture of the clock ,the way the "victim" enters the apartment...But,like in a nightmare -and this is really one-,the hero seems to get stuck in the quicksand of its mind."Did I say murder?" "Did I say barbed wire? "Did I say poison ivy? " the prosecutor,his friend,says.Like Dana Andrews in "beyond a resonable doubt" ,our miserable hero seems to give away all the clues that may lead him to the road of ruin.All in a dream ,where you're only a witness,when you're helpless .It's amazing that all the characters of this long dream do exist in real life,even if they do not always play the same part in it.Only Joan Bennett/Alice is a pure illusion :she epitomizes the forbidden fruit and the other side of the mirror.Needless to say,as almost every movie the great Lang made,this is an unqualified must.Alain Corneau ,when he made " Police python 357" with Yves Montand and Simone Signoret in 1975 was certainly influenced by the screenplay of "window".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I just watched "The Woman in the Window" and loved it. First of all I am an Edward G fan since forever, I feel that he is one of the greats that Oscar overlooked (although they did give him an honorary Oscar) and really like Dan Duyea in just about everything that he did. I have seen Scarlet Street, but had not seen "The Woman in the Window" since I was a kid and had forgotten it. Before I watched it I read most of the comments here, other than those containing spoilers, and knew that most of those commenting did not like the ending. But I must say, nevertheless, it was not anything that I expected and I liked it. Now, after watching it, I am reading some of the remaining comments and I find that the ending Lang used here is basically the same as the book. So I don't feel so bad, I liked it, that is what the original artist (the writer of the book) intended, so there.Don't go into to it with a preconceived notion that you won't like the ending. Just watch it to enjoy it and you might like it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why dream would not be honest?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WOMAN IN WINDOW is pretty interesting mystery melodrama. I think the script is very good and sophisticated so that the unusual and satirical way circumscribes a criminal story. I am aware of the fact that the last scenes of the film divided audiences. I'm thrilled. The original and a little magic.I'm sure it's a surprise that brings the end of the film in most people turned into disappointment. Classic denouement murder in this case no. Mr. Lang and his team were well played. The story is simple. Acting is at a high level.Edward G. Robinson as Professor Richard Wanley is simply good. His appearance will not leave anyone breathless, but it's hard to find a complaint. Simply good. Joan Bennett as Alice Reed has afforded us a very good performance. A woman came out of the image. Impressive is it seen as a frightened and vulnerable woman on one side and a very skillful and enthusiastic negotiator on the other side. Raymond Massey as Dist. Atty. Frank Lalor was in a little satirical police investigation flawless. Dan Duryea as Heidt/Tim, the Doorman is very good in the role of the blackmailer. The dog who smelled burnt. It would be wonderful if this film misses a classic villain. But I am satisfied with the fact that the only villain paid with his life for something he did not do.This film works honestly. Why dream would not be honest? Elaboration is infallible. The focus is on the investigation of the murder, in which indirectly participate killer himself. Uncertainty is a constant. Awakening is certain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like a lot of classic mystery noir is too mysterious and hard to follow. Then again, these end up being better written because they have more thought put into them. This is probably one of the more simpler noirs of the 1940's, at least in comparison to something like "Rebecca". "The Maltese Falcon" is of course the best of all of these. The plot features a man who notices a woman in the window, or rather her reflection. Now, it seems kind of weird that they would name the movie after such a minor plot point, but it ends up being rather relevant at the end. Anyway, a man comes in on them who tries to kill him, but they kill him. They then get rid of his body, but it's found and a guy who knows the woman did it blackmails her.What's also interesting is how they include this brief scene at the beginning where a guy mentions that it's okay to kill in self defense. It's not really used in the movie, but it was probably just sending some message. I guess it's more mysterious that way. When I saw the ending, at first I thought he had died and gone to Heaven or something, but looking up all the info, it's less complicated than that. Have I spoiled the ending with that? Whatever, this was still wonderfully acted with great dialogue and good pacing. I admit the ending is a bit of a cop out, but it still manages to be interesting with how unpredictable it is and how you simply want to know how it ends. I'm not even sure if I need to put the spoiler thing here. ***1/2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome film-noir, dark and tense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson is a quiet, friendly professor who sometimes lectures on murder. One night, his friends discuss the fact that they're too old to go on any "adventures" anymore. Lately he has been fascinated by a portrait of a lady in a street window. One night, he is admiring the painting again and then sees a real woman appear in the reflection next to it, like something out of a dream. But he turns and she's really standing there. Even though he knows he "shouldn't", they go out for a drink. The movie seems harmless enough, a lonely older man befriending a younger lady. And then something happens and they're in a tricky situation. He hesitates to call the police. Perhaps he should have.Based on the plot, you would guess the director was Hitchcock (but it's Fritz Lang who does an excellent job here). It's exactly his kind of movie. An innocent man gets mixed up in some nasty business. He just wants out but he's stuck and the pressure builds on him. He becomes overcome with guilt and worries so much that the police will find him out.In this movie, the professor meets a detective working on the case and hears the details of exactly what they've found out. Your heart falls into the pit of your stomach when you realise how much they've figured out and so quickly. He stumbles with his words a number of times, nearly giving himself up. He is not stupid, he is gripped by intense paranoia and uneasiness. There is awkward humour as he and the police joke about him having committed the act. In a couple of instances, he seems to be trying to get caught, he just wants it to be over. The threat is worse than the thing itself.It's a curious trick of the mind that the word "murder" comes up in other reviews. A murder has to be planned and that clearly wasn't the case here. Robinson feels guilty about trying to cover up an accident but then that guilt seems to turn it into a murder for a lot of people (including the character himself) and they start to see him as an evil criminal. He is innocent except for trying to cover up what happened and avoid going to court and explaining the truth.I greatly enjoyed this movie. It had many surprises and the tension was high all the way through. There is an instance where a woman tries to poison a man. It avoids clichés, the focus is on whether he suspects or not and we can't tell. The movie is not about the fates of the characters or what they deserve. It's not about murder or the police. It's about the way lies grow and come back to haunt you. The psychology of guilt, how it never fades and constantly eats away at you. The way the truth is usually inescapable. The harshness of the outside world and how difficult it is to outsmart people. How impossible it is to get away with a crime.The focus of the movie is Robinson's state of mind. He is a fly caught in a web waiting for the spider to slowly, inevitably eat him up. We feel his guilt, his dread, his relief and his hope as they cycle between each-other. We don't want him to get caught (although he should have called the police) but it seems that will be his only escape from the unbearable guilt and apprehension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Professor Richard Wanley (Edward G. Robinson) is teaching psychology of homicide at Gotham College. He sends his family off on their vacation while he continues working. He becomes entranced by a portrait in a store window and joins a woman (Joan Bennett) with a similar likeness. She invites him home to see more sketches and then her boyfriend Frank arrive. Frank immediate goes into a rage and Richard kills him in self defense. She tells Richard that Frank is a secret boyfriend and she knows little about him. Her place has the name Alice Reed on the mailbox. Richard decides to dispose of the body to save his reputation. However he leaves behind many clues and the case is more mysterious than it first appears. Frank turns out to be powerful financier Claude Mazard. One of his friend is D.A. Frank Lalor (Raymond Massey) who tells him all about the case. Then he's blackmailed by ex-cop Heidt (Dan Duryea) who was the dead man's bodyguard.This is a great suspense thriller. I really like the cat and mouse game. Once it gets going, it becomes a compelling thriller. Edward G. Robinson is good as he always is although he could be more scared at the start. He's a bit too calm after killing a man. As for the ending, I don't like the twist. If that's the ending, it could have been done much better by laying down obvious clues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder is never easy, no matter how much you think you know about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is only by chance that assistant professor of criminology Edward G. Robinson encounters the beautiful Joan Bennett. He is admiring her portrait in the gallery window and it is certainly a surprise to him when he sees her reflection behind her. She innocently invites him over to her apartment to show him drawings by the same artist, and all of a sudden, he finds himself plummeting a pair of scissors into a man's back who interrupted them and presumed something else was going on. He only thought that he was trying to get the man to stop beating him when Bennett conveniently placed the scissors in his hand. Now, determined not to be involved in a murder wrap, Robinson and Bennett conspire to get rid of the body, thus (with his expertise) committing the perfect crime.But crime, no matter the circumstances, never goes undetected, and when the body is discovered, Robinson's pal (Raymond Massey) is involved in the case and asks Robinson to aide him in putting together the clues. The fact that certain aspects of the case Robinson innocently reveals and the fact that certain clues show up implicating Robinson doesn't make him a suspect, but his own guilt gets him back together to conspire with Bennett, especially when a shady blackmailer (Dan Duryea) gets involved.This is a tight little film noir, sometimes slow moving, but always intriguing, only marred by a trick ending. The first half of the film focuses on Robinson's efforts to keep himself from being exposed; the second half focuses on Bennett's dealings with the sinister Duryea. Bennett moved from light-hearted leading lady into film noir vixen with ease, proving that she was more than just a former blonde beauty who became brunette to capitalize on her Hedy Lamarr similar looks. Actually, I had always known that Bennett was a better actress than the types of roles she had been doing up to this point, and as film noir became a major part of American cinema, her status in Hollywood rose, proving that even in the age-defined movie capital, re-defining yourself can stretch your career and keep you going, something very rare, especially for women heading past their mid 30's.As for Edward G. Robinson, he had always mixed his tough guy gangsters with the milquetoast characters he played in such classics as "The Whole Town's Talking" and "Mr. Winkle Goes to War". Robinson proves once again that he was one of the most versatile actors in film and could handle both leads and supporting parts with equal vigor. Director Fritz Lang provides enough thrills here, and while the final denouncement is a bit inconclusive (even before the trick ending), there's a nice touch involving character actress Iris Adrian that will make you forgive the writers for fooling you and being slightly cheap in bringing the film to its conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's why I run when beautiful women look at me invitingly in the street.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching, smitten, the portrait of a beautiful woman in a window, a professor is addressed by the woman herself. After they exchange a few words, she invites him to her apt.. There, after enjoying themselves for a while, they are brutally interrupted by her boyfriend--it seems--who attacks the professor. This last kills the man in self-defense and now he and the woman must deal with the corpse, which he goes to drop in some park, and also with some unwelcome witness of events. Even worse, the crime detective working the case is one of his best friends.I have just finished watching this film and I have to say I liked it a lot better than Scarlet Street, which has the same leading actors and to which it has been rather unfavorably compared. Great cinematography, typical film noir settings--late night in the city, almost empty streets soaked wet after some rain--a dark, unsettling atmosphere, and the gig is on. TWITW would have been worth at least an 8/10, in my opinion, had not been for that silly twist, which allows for a more or less happy ending; one popping up like a rabbit out of a hat, as it doesn't come about as the inevitable result of the natural flow of the plot but which appears as if just tacked there, presumably for the relief of the viewing audience. This is made even worse by the final appearance of the two (dead) villains, now in far nicer, reassuring, attitudes--the only thing missing there is their complimentary bow to the audience. Definitively, the word End should have appeared in the screen during Alice's phone call, while Wanley is slowly drifting into eternal slumber. That would have made of TWITW a true classic of the genre. As it came out, it's not quite a film noir, just a project.What I liked better here is that the plot holds together far more tightly than it does in Scarlet Street. There is nothing forced in the plight of the two main characters-?prof. Wanley and Alice Green--which are after all rather normal people, instead of the stereotypical protagonists of a film noir, and so we all can related to them one way or another. The jam in which they find themselves is, unfortunately, like many we may get ourselves into, any day, even if not necessarily of the same dramatic proportions--just think about someone passing you by, at night, in an empty street, and pushing you and then you pushing the guy back, making him fall and hit his head on the pavement; and then he stays there without moving; what would you do then...? That's the kind of mess honest &amp; decent people get into every day, every hour, somewhere in the world, in your own city. In Scarlet Street instead, both Chris &amp; Kitty could have gotten out of their respective situations the moment they wished, as nobody was forcing them to be there. All what Chris had to do was to stop being a fool and for Kitty to give the pink slip to Johnny-well, that last part may have been a lot easier to say than to do, but anyway. That what's gives the whole situation in SS a contrived nature that allow viewers to stay emotionally detached from the plight of both main protagonists, which is not the case in TWITW.Also there's the fact that TWITW has characters you may actually like, something unusual in a film noir. I loved the Massey character, the way he toys with professor Manley, playing a rather suave, high brow, Columbo to him-?as I have no doubt he must have started suspecting from the beginning that his friend got something to do with that crime, that he knows more about it than he's willing to tell. And if any doubt still remained in his mind, that must have dissipated when Wanley went straight in the right direction, in the lieu of the crime, added this to his hand wound and his poison ivy infection. For most of the length of the movie that Columbo type fencing between both is delightfully entertaining and it's a real pity that all that should have ended with the arrival of the film's villain, Duryea's blackmailer. It's clear, anyway, when we see Massey for the last time--I think when he leaves the lieu of the crime in his car, with Robinson--that he's sure that, when this case is solved, of which he doesn't have by now any doubt, his academic friend will appear involved in it one way or another. It's unfortunate that this Columbo--like banter between Massey and Robinson wouldn't go farther than that, which costs the movie one point in my review. In that sense WITW looks like a film divided in two parts, with only the two leads of the first part remaining for the second.The cinematography is up to Lang standards I say, and the acting is superb across the board, specially from Robinson's part. (My, has this man ever been in a bad movie, has he ever done a bad acting job? I think the answer is No, in either case). A definitive 8/10, if were not for that twist at the end. Come to think of it, maybe this is the reason behind it: the Code demands that people pay for their crimes and if WITW had ended during that phone call, Alice wouldn't have paid for having been an accomplice in the murder. Quite the contrary, she would have been the main beneficiary and, while it's true that she had lost her Sugar Daddy anyway, a girl with her looks wouldn't have had any problem finding another. So, maybe Lang, or the studio, felt forced to end the film that way, just to prevent her from remaining unpunished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's "Woman in the Window" could hardly be called less than fascinating. With a classic, simple device-- a death which the main characters try to cover up-- the film rapidly unfolds into an improbable but still very scary nightmare. There are many moments of pure tension, while all along the irony of the main character's plight pursues us. The story is stylishly-- in fact, beautifully filmed, exemplary in terms of noir's tense, claustrophobic technique. Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett have good rapport; Dan Duryea is perfectly nasty as a cold-blooded blackmailer. All in all, an extremely worthwhile film.

		<fullReview>"Woman in the Window" is a pretty good film noir about an everyday man(played by the wonderful Edward G) who is happily married, has two children, a safe unexciting job, and a membership at a gentlemens' club. All this changes in one night when he innocently accompanies a woman to her apartment one night, and winds up killing her jealous boyfriend in self defense. There are some great tense moments in the film, especially when Robinson drives out in the country to dump the body, or when he is later invited by his DA friend to view the scene of the crime. I'm still undecided on the ending, though. I certainly didn't see it coming, and it took me by surprise. But it seems a bit of a cop-out, with the final message of the movie being "Run home and hide under your bed at the first sign of danger, rather than take a risk every now and then."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that Fritz Lang could have benefited from reading the non-existent book 'How Not to End an Exciting Movie'. Without divulging his mishap to the readers who have not yet been disappointed by this otherwise glorious drama, I will say that I was quite intrigued with the plot lines, characters, cinematography etc., until the final five minutes. Edward G. Robinson does a wonderful (as usual) acting job along side his pretty co-star. Fritz Lang's direction isn't as spectacular as some of his earlier German films (eg.'M', 'Metropolis' ) but it is sharp and fairly decisive. But if you are looking for a good crime drama that leaves you felling satisfied with the final conclusion, trust me, this hasn't got it. For a much better substitute, try 'Double Indemnity' which also includes Robinson in its glorious cast and is one of the most important films of the mid 1940's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A taut tale which indicates that the innocent may have plenty to fear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's taut direction helps to make this an intriguing account of how an innocent man's comfortable, perhaps rather boring, life can be put at risk by circumstances over which he has little control. A mild psychology professor (Edward G. Robinson) who regretfully concludes that he is too old for adventure suddenly discovers that fate can pitch anyone into adventure at any time. To extricate oneself is difficult, perhaps impossible.As in another Robinson film, 'Double Indemnity', a man and a woman are united, whether they like it or not, by knowledge of a death. Innocence, absence of malicious intent, are no safeguards against the appearance of guilt. The innocent may in fact be driven to consider crime as a means of escape from the bad hand that destiny deals them.As always, Robinson is superb, and he is given excellent support by Joan Bennet, the wonderfully repulsive Dan Duryea, and Raymond Massey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two strangers cover up a killing in self defense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An assistant professor, articulate and mild-mannered, kills a man in self defense, but then hides the body to protect his reputation and that of a mysterious woman he has only briefly met.Edward G. Robinson is perfect in almost every nuance, and Joan Bennett looks spectacular. There is a fundamental tension as two strangers, a man and a woman, decide whether they can trust each other. The movie is both sad and optimistic, and has a complexity which cannot be easily characterized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang and Edward G. Robinson Deliver One of the Best Films Noir in History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nearly unbearably tense and fantastic film noir from Fritz Lang.Edward G. Robinson plays a college professor who strays one night when his wife is away and finds himself in a married man's worst nightmare. Joan Bennett is the hotsy-totsy lady he finds there. He commits a murder that he and Bennett try to cover up, and we spend the rest of the film painfully watching as the investigation closes in on him, not helped by the fact that the detective leading it is one of his own friends.Robinson is a hugely likable actor, and we want to see him come away clean even though he's technically guilty. The movie throws in a surprise ending that should have left me feeling cheated, but instead left me laughing and loving this film.One of the best films noir I've seen.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Haunting Portrait In The Pawnshop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a man who is a psychology professor and knows the tricks of the human mind, it's interesting how Edward G. Robinson keeps trying to incriminate himself in the murder of financier Arthur Loft. It all starts with that painting that Robinson saw in a pawn shop, The Woman In The Window.After seeing off wife Dorothy Peterson and children Bobby Blake and Carol Cameron and after having drinks at his university club with friends Raymond Massey and Edmond Breon, Robinson pauses to stare at the haunting picture and lo and behold the model for that picture appears, Joan Bennett maybe even more beautiful in person. Maybe someone of stronger character might have resisted, but I'm hear to tell you who haven't seen The Woman In The Window that Joan Bennett would have taken a lot of resisting.Once up in her place and still while things were quite innocent the guy who's been keeping her Arthur Loft shows up in no mood for explanations. He starts beating up on Robinson and choking him when Bennett hands him a pair of scissors with which he stabs him to death.The thing to have done right then and there is call the police. My guess is that Robinson might not have even been given an indictment by the Grand Jury once the story was told. But both Bennett and Robinson are worried about scandal, him of course with his professor status on the line. They decide to move the body and dump it in the woods.After that Robinson through his friend Massey gets a lesson in forensics that would be great material for an NCIS investigation. He also picks up a blackmailer in the person of Dan Duryea. It all comes together in a very surprise ending.Fritz Lang directed The Woman In The Window and so successfully that Robinson, Bennett, and Duryea came back to do Scarlett Street for him the following year. Robinson gives one of his best performances as a mild mannered man in a situation that is Kafkaesque, but of his own making. Joan Bennett was never sexier on the screen.I suppose Lang might have put this in for some comic relief, but I got a real kick out of a more grownup Spanky McFarland as the Boy Scout who finds Loft's body. This is one mercenary Scout who has definite plans for the reward Loft's firm has put up to find their missing CEO.The Woman In The Window is a fine noir thriller in which the only criticism was that the ending might be a little too neat, you'll see what I mean when you view the film. Otherwise with the suspenseful mood and the acting by the cast, you can't ask much more of a noir thriller.</fullReview>

Suddenly he met her and the story starts, nothing good, all troubles and even crimes, he becomes tired of the situation, he does not want even to see her anymore, suddenly somebody wakes him up, so he was sleeping and having a nightmare or a dream. Good for him, who goes back home happy that everything never happened in his life. A very original film with good acting of Edward G. Robinson as usual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one could have been prepared for the woman Joan Bennett becomes in this film, seeing all her movies for the fifteen years before this one was made would have accomplished for a faithful viewer absolutely nothing. This woman has in effect murdered that early Joan Bennett, and in order to demonstrate her strength -- as her serpentine motivation reveals itself beneath circumstances -- is going to destroy all the tough guys that Edward G. Robinson ever played. The result, being somewhat ambiguous, provoked director Fritz Lang to reprise the entire relationship the following year in "Scarlet Street," featuring the same Bennett, Robinson and Dan Duryea. Only the names were changed, to protect the weak and evil. But one watching "Woman in the Window" experiences the texture of descent, whereas "Scarlet Street" begins and ends prone on the sidewalk.W.

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILER? Caught this extremely entertaining flick on TCM last night and was bowled over by its masterful manipulation of suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Wonderful cast, with Robinson, Duryea, and Massey, but I don't think much of Joan Bennett's acting abilities. It's Lang's masterful direction of a fine script that keeps the tension alive. It's true that the astonishingly cop-out ending flips the mood from tragedy to light-hearted comedy a bit too suddenly, but it doesn't detract from overall enjoyment. Good flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EDWARD G. ROBINSON was one of my favorite actors from the film noir period of the '40s and he had one of his very best roles here as the man who falls in love with a portrait of JOAN BENNETT--and she becomes the woman of his dreams.A tight, suspenseful plot has him caught in a struggle with her jealous ex-boyfriend whom he kills in self-defense. He and Bennett decide to hide the crime, but she is soon being blackmailed by DAN DURYEA, a plot similarity to Fritz Lang's SCARLET STREET wherein Duryea was also cast as a slimy blackmailer.The plot thickens when RAYMOND MASSEY, a detective friend of Robinson, starts to discuss the case with the man who committed the crime and has successfully hidden the body. He starts getting suspicious when Robinson lets information slip out that only the murderer could know.The suspense builds as a cat and mouse game is played--until the rather unsettling ending which had a lot of people up in arms over the sly deception--the kind that would have pleased Alfred Hitchcock.Well worth seeing, beautifully acted by a fine cast--and definitely one of Fritz Lang's best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . so there might have been "no place like home" for little Dottie Gale of Kansas, but there was no place like the club as far as psych prof "Dick Wanley" was concerned as MGM recycled a denouement from its back catalog to close THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW. Just five years after Judy Garland clicked her ruby red slippers so she could follow Frank Morgan home in the WIZARD OF OZ, Edward G. Robinson fingers his magic monogrammed pencil reclining in his club's Lazy-Boy to accomplish a similar feat. Just as an ice pack was enough to turn the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion back into Hickory, Zeke, and Hunk, a little rub of the led turns Robinson's business tycoon murder victim into his club's hatcheck guy, with his slick blackmailer morphing into the club's harmless doorman. My biggest disappointment is that MGM chose not to apply this winning formula to GONE WITH THE WIND. That would have been a much better film if it had ended with Vivian Leigh being woken up from her afternoon beauty rest at Antebellum Tara by all her beaus rushing in, shouting "Peace at last--Jeff Davis has freed the slaves!" Leslie Howard would turn out to be her family priest, and Clark Gable would be unmasked as the local tax collector.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Thriller with Excellent Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woman in the Window, The (1944) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Tense thriller from director Lang has family man Professor Richard Wanley (Edward G. Robinson) having a brief night out with a woman (Joan Bennett) who he had earlier seen a portrait of in a window. Soon a man she had been with in the past shows up in the room and the professor ends up killing him to save his own life. Not wanting to go to the police, the two decide to dump the man's body but it's soon discovered and the two begin to fear that the other is going to go to the police. This is yet another very impressive film from Lang who deserves a lot of the credit but so does the screenplay and performances. I think the film starts off a tad bit slow but once the murder actually takes place things start to heat up and by the time the ending comes your finger nails will have been bitten all the way down. What impressed me the most was Lang's decision to film the majority of the early part of the film in long shots. At first I thought it was rather strange that he'd film it this way but as we lead up to the murder and the scenes after it it becomes obvious that shooting in these long shots actually works because it really makes you feel as if you're a third character who eventually shows up to blackmail them. I thought this long shots were perfectly used by Lang because it really makes the viewer feel distant from what's going on but at the same time you're witnessing something you're not suppose to be seeing just as the characters themselves hope they're not being seen. Throughout the rest of the film we get more medium and close ups as the net around Robinson and Bennett begins to grow tighter. Robinson made a career out of playing tough guys but he was such a great actor that he could play someone much smaller just like this character. I thought he did a wonderful job especially in the scenes where he's about to crack from the pressure. Bennett made for a terrific femme fatale because she was so seduction but also very good in the more quiet moments where she too begins to fear the police. The supporting cast features strong performances from Edmund Breon, Dan Duryea and Raymond Massey. While this is an extremely good movie I still found some flaws including some of Robinson's actions after the police get involved. I thought there were a few too many clues that he throws out because of some dumb words he says or him pretty much leading the police to suspect him. I thought the clues were just way too obvious and I thought it went against his character to be this stupid. Then, of course, there's the rather controversial ending. I won't ruin it for people but I didn't like it. It's not downright horrible like many would have you believe but it just didn't work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fritz Lang directs this fulfilling film noir about a straight-laced college psychology professor entering into a surprising dalliance while his family is away. Richard Manley(Edward G. Robinson)sees the portrait of a beautiful woman, Alice(Joan Bennett), and lands in a world of hurt, when he meets the model and she invites him up to her apartment for a drink. It becomes more than one drink; there seems to be thoughts of romance, but Alice's jealous boyfriend(Arthur Loft) arrives and goes into a rage assaulting the couple. In self defense the professor puts a pair of scissors in the back of his attacker. Now there is the problem of disposing of the body. It gets a bit dicey, because Manley's best friend,(Raymond Massey), happens to be the D.A. working the murder case. And for more suspense, a blackmailer(Dan Duryea)slinks into the mix.Very crisp black &amp; white with just the right atmosphere, off and on rain showers. The story line of forbidden and doomed love is what movies are made of. Robinson is in top form and Bennett is absolutely beautiful. I'm a sucker for classic movies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great film noirs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The war years saw Hollywood's leading men unavailable - Clark Gable, James Stewart, and many others, were otherwise occupied. At this point, some of the better character actors stepped up to starring roles they might not otherwise have gotten. The darkness of the war years also did a bit to loosen the grip of the production code by allowing darker plots than would otherwise pass inspection, but the evildoers still had to be punished in the end. This began the trend of "film noir" - related to their predecessors, the precodes, by examining the seedy side of life, but emphasizing the duality of man's nature rather than the sexual angles and the evolving roles of women and men in society as the films of the early 30's tended to do."The Woman in the Window" is a great film noir starring the great Edward G. Robinson as a mild mannered New York City professor. He packs his wife and kids off to the country at the beginning of the summer as was the custom back before the days of air conditioning, and he begins his three month bachelorhood by joining two friends at his private club, one of which is D.A. Frank Lalor (Raymond Massey). Before entering his club, though, he appreciates a painting of a beautiful woman, "the woman in the window". His two friends see him staring, kid him about it, and they proceed to have a conversation in which the D.A. talks about how many cases he sees in which a small wrong step by an ordinarily law-abiding citizen leads to major crime.The rest of the film is basically a demonstration of what the D.A. spoke about when you mix Robinson's mild professor with the actual flirtatious woman in the window (Joan Bennett), add a case of homicide in self-defense under seemingly scandalous circumstances where there is no way to prove self-defense, and finally introduce a seedy blackmailing P.I. (Dan Duryea) into the mix. The film has many twists and turns and you can feel your guts wrenching along with Robinson's as he watches the police come closer and closer to his door with every update he gets from his friend the D.A. who thinks he is just sharing an interesting case with a professor of criminology.The end then takes a sharp turn and totally surprises you.This film was so good that Fritz Lang followed it up the following year with an even better effort - Scarlet Street - with Robinson, Duryea, and Bennett playing similar parts as they did in this film. There's even a painting as a central plot point in this second film as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost undone by its own cleverness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang, the praised director of German Expressionistic classics such as Metropolis and M, moves to the other side of the Atlantic and enters the studio system to direct this film-noir about a professor who sees a portrait of a beautiful woman in a window and ends up in a twisted tale of deceit, blackmail and murder. While the premise certainly isn't new, there are some interesting things in this story. For example, the fact that Edward G. Robinson's character continues to blurt out tidbits that could tie him to the crime is unusual. However, it is of my opinion that the great Robinson was terribly miscast in this role.Ever since he became a star in the gangster classic Little Caesar, I find it hard for him to play the type able to commit a crime and feel guilty about it. He was always better playing either a hard-boiled criminal or a tough, gritty investigator such as in Double Indemnity. Here he comes off as an idiot for getting mixed up in something so dangerous and apparently isn't capable of trying to protect his own skin. There are some nice noir touches from Lang, who experimented with the genre in Germany before it was completely explored. Still, the twist that comes in the end feels a bit too staged instead of coming from the characters' decisions. So, if you are a fan of film-noir, this is certainly worth checking out. But, don't expect it to hold a candle to films like Double Indemnity or Sunset Blvd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predecessor To a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Woman In the Window is like a folk tale told in an urban film noir context, a moral tale about temptation, yet Fritz Lang also puts his stamp on it. We know why he was attracted to the material because Edward G. Robinson's character, a psychology professor who opens the film giving a lecture with hues of the mindset of murder or violence, learns a lot about his dark side through a series of match-point incidents. If you saw Scarlet Street, two things could happen: You could see this and enjoy a film with the same cast, same director and same genre, or you could be satisfied with the far superior experience of having seen Scarlet Street.Like in Scarlet Street, we care a great deal about Edward G. Robinson's protagonist because he is a common man. But in Scarlet Street, our sympathy is intensified, because he lets people walk all over him. We hates his awful wife. We find his job as a banker as lackluster as he does. He never quite got to paint as much as he wanted to, which becomes his weakness. In many ways, Christopher Cross in Scarlet Street is a tragic character before the film even begins. One appreciates how the stress and burden of being a doormat for everyone else molds his doings, and how the world around him is conceitedly, slowly but surely receiving their comeuppance, simply by his disentanglement. In The Woman In the Window, the suspense comes from the incidental nature of his predicaments. We the audience know what the authorities will never have any reason to know according to the law. It is a good concept, but without the darkness and superdrama of Scarlet Street.Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea once again get the brunt of the film's utmost scenes of wickedness. Bennett, however, is not the vile and degenerate creature she was in Scarlet, which was so much more intense because hardly anyone was on our side, our side being Robinson's. Duryea, however, delivers just as well if not even better here than he did in Scarlet. He is really a master of playing the biggest jerk in the world.The twist at the end is a device that by now has been too commonly used, but in this 1944 noir, it works despite a viewer's contemporary seasoning because it's not a cop-out ending that takes the easy way out of a tense predicament. I do not mean my comparison of this film to Scarlet Street as an indictment of flaws. Really, I mean it as a recommendation to see the very same talents occupied to a much further extent of their abilities. Overall, this predecessor to a masterpiece is quite an entertainment.</fullReview>

Under Fritz Lang's direction, they are a magical team. I was as captivated by their performances as they were captivated by each other. The story, however, is somewhat of a letdown. I don't think the flaws are enough to mar thoroughly enjoying the film; it's sad, though, to watch an potentially extraordinary film falter. Mr. Robinson and Ms. Bennett are greatly supported by Raymond Massey and Dan Duryea. Mr. Duryea's supporting performance is particularity effective.

		<fullReview>Once I started doing these reviews on the IMDb, the first movie I came across that had a cop-out ending like this one was 1953's "The Limping Man" with Lloyd Bridges in the lead. I was so po'd by that ending that I gave it a moot review with the feeling that it came off as a cheat. Another one is 1942's "Man With Two Lives", but that one was made a bit more entertaining by the presence of a lot of scientific looking lab gizmos in support of a story that starts out like a sci-fi film and then turns into a gangster flick. This time, Edward G. Robinson really had me hooked with his predicament when right at the very end, the museum steward wakes him up! Nooooo - you're killing me!!!! I should have known it, Professor Wanley (Robinson) gives himself away just too many times, starting with the 'murdered' comment to District Attorney Lalor (Raymond Massey). Then, as the D.A. comments on the blood found where the body was located, Wanley shows him the scratch on his arm. Why? Later, while physically at the location where Claude Mazard was found, Wanley heads right for the exact spot, inadvertently commenting that the body was dumped at night. You know, for a college professor teaching a class on the psychological aspects of homicide, you would think he'd play his cards closer to the vest.But in the end, it just doesn't matter, because the whole thing never happened. Reading the other reviews on this board, it seems like this little factoid was missed by four out of five viewers who think the picture was just great. I would have too if they hadn't tacked on the last couple of minutes and just let Wanley nod off in his chair just a couple of seconds late on that telephone call from Joan Bennett. Honestly, didn't you get just a little impatient with her dealing with that dial telephone?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, it was a bad way to end a film but I didn't let that deter from the fact that it was still a well made film directed by one of the all time greats and starring a great actor. Like all Fritz Lang films this was beautifully shot and the exteriors and interiors play a big function on how the film looks. Great sets and designs. Edward G. Robinson stars in this film as a college professor who meets Joan Bennett and soon gets involved in murder. Then Dan Duryea shows up to try and blackmail Bennett. Robinson never received enough credit for being able to play normal guys. He was always thought of as a tough guy but in truth he could play a multiple of diverse characters. There was criticism to Bennett playing the Femme Fatale because she was not considered the type to play a role like this but I have to defend the casting because Robinson plays a middle aged professor who is a dullard and any attractive woman would add real spice to his boring life. This is also a rare occasion for Raymond Massey to play a straight role for a change. There is two pieces of trivia I want to mention. First, Lang got all three actors (Robinson, Bennett, Duryea) to star in his next film "Scarlet Street". And secondly, two of the "Our Gang" actors appear in small roles. Robert Blake plays Robinsons son and George "Spanky" McFarland plays a boyscout who finds the body. This was a fun and enjoyable film noir mystery and even though the ending keeps this from being anything really special, its still well made and acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment that means a lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang was the first director I discovered when I was a child. There was a series on TV with a dozen or so of his films. What a wonderful experience to realize for the first time that there is someone responsible for a good film (and presumably for a bad one). Of course there is the script and the actors but if you watch the films you sense a kind of directing style, even though you may not know what it consists in. I have been a Fritz Lang fan ever since and fondest in my memory was The Woman in the Window with beautiful Joan Bennett. I remember being totally captured. I just lived with Edward G. Robinson through this nightmare. I was delighted to meet Joan and I panicked when I found I had just murdered this C.M. guy. And how I despised Dan Durea. (And later after coming back to real life seeing him as a door man I thought, no, this guy is in disguise. He is too evil to be a door man.) Now I just watched the film again after more than 20 years and what a disappointment it was. Somehow the film seemed slow and predictable and one dimensional and I found myself zapping to a different program. But thinking about it now, there is just nothing wrong with the movie but only with myself. What a sad thing that I (and people in general) seem to be unable nowadays to just sit through a brilliant piece of film art. It just means that I have been spoiled by too many bad films, action and pseudo psychology. Normally I think there is no use in trying to enjoy a film intellectually and it is bad if you have to find reasons why a film ought to be enjoyed. But it this case I know that I loved the film and that it is great. So there is something wrong with me. The remedy will be forcing myself to only watching film noirs for a whole month.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good premise, screenplay has some problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story of a middle-aged man, Professor Richard Wanley, who inadvertently gets caught up in a murder has a lot of good points. For one thing it calls to mind the myriad of unfortunate situations an innocent person can get involved in and promotes an understanding of such situations. And it makes you ask what you would have done in the circumstances. I liked the setup with Wanley being friends with the district attorney and thus having an inside look at the investigation that increasingly points to him as the murderer. The black and white photography is good, but not as dramatic as in some other Fritz Lang films, like "M."I liked the period decor and dress.But I had some problems. Wanley is fascinated by a portrait of a beautiful woman in a store window. Late one night while walking home he stops to admire the portrait and to speculate about the woman. Then, miraculously, the woman appears in the flesh, strikes up a conversation and invites him up to her apartment. A beautiful woman taking up with a stolid middle-aged stranger in New Your City, not very likely unless she is a hooker. Maybe that was to be inferred but not allowed to be explicitly specified in a 1940s movie, but from what is seen this inference is difficult to make.There are many other plot points that put me off. I don't think it would be nearly so easy to kill someone with a couple of jabs to the back with a pair of scissors, particularly in such a bloodless manner. Carrying a 200 pound body around like Wanley did would be beyond his strength--a body is an awkward dead weight. As a lecturer on topics like "Some Psychological Aspects of Homicide," I think Wanley would have been smarter than to make some of the mistakes he did during the investigation. And so on.You might say that the ending makes my complaints moot, but then you have to believe that it is possible to have such a detailed coherent dream where, in less than an hour, the dream spans several days. And I think it is a cop out when a movie involves you and then pulls the, "Oh, it was just a dream" trope.As much as I dislike remakes, I think that this might be a good candidate for such. For example, I imagine that the scene that has the three 40-somethings sitting around proclaiming how "Men of our years have no business playing around with any adventure they can avoid," would play differently now, some seventy-five years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy to mix up with SCARLET STREET, but a little better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow--1945 was a very confusing year! Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea all made two movies together AND they were both directed by Fritz Lang AND they both concerned "nice-guy" Robinson killing someone and then covering it up!! Because of this, in my mind I had sort of combined the two films in one when I saw them years ago and only just recently saw them again--one after the other. I just reviewed the other film, SCARLET STREET, and this is my review for THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW.Edward G. stars as a psychology professor who is interested in the criminal mind. However, despite him being a very decent sort of man, he accidentally becomes involved in killing a man for self-defense, but goes to great lengths with Joan Bennett to hide the killing--instead of doing the right thing and calling the cops. His good friend is the Chief of police (Raymond Massey) and this friend tells him all about a murder he is currently investigating,...the SAME guy Robinson killed! What makes this film so brilliant is the wonderful ending as well as the awful (as usual) character played by Duryea. He's one of the slimiest characters in film history and it's great fun seeing him play (what else?) a blackmailer. The film is well directed and paced throughout. About the only negative is Robinson's character, who, at times, acts way too dumb to be a professor--practically handing important clues to the police on MANY occasions that could have resulted in his arrest! Still, it's a dandy film and a thriller well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woman in the Window Meets Dorothy at Oz- No Place Like Home **12</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting film is marred by the ending. While others find the ending to be an unusual twist, I found it to be a cop-out.Ed G. Robinson is a college professor who becomes directly involved in a murder after meeting the woman whose picture he becomes enamored with while staring at a window.The professor is an amateur at crime as we see by the mistakes he makes and we are amazed at the ability of the police, led by Raymond Massey, in picking up clues. You would think for sure that Robinson and Joan Bennett, the woman he kills for, would be found out at the end.There is a slick blackmailer who knows all the angles. It appears that Robinson and Bennett are done for and there is nothing left for Robinson to do but to commit suicide. Voila! The dream sequence ends. See Robinson run down the street like a frightened kitten when a woman asks him for a light. Come on. This could have been a thriller of a murder film. It is simply done in by the cop out ending.Even Dorothy upon waking up in Oz would have been annoyed with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overrated film-noir from revered director Fritz Lang, an adaptation by Nunnally Johnson from J.H. Wallis' book "Once Off Guard", has Edward G. Robinson playing a college professor and family man who becomes involved in a murder, desperately hoping to cover his tracks before the police close in. The cop-out ending aside, Johnson's screenplay is full of holes, silly characters and theatrics. The campus atmosphere should have been something we could relate to, but it doesn't resemble American academia at all, more like Hollywood, U.S.A. A real let-down, though Milton Krasner's cinematography isn't to blame. Lang's direction is weak, and Robinson is woefully miscast. Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea are not much better in smaller roles. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Worst Endings Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never have I seen such a throughly good movie so completely destroyed by the ending. It's hard to think of a worse cop out ending than this.Up until then this one really had me intrigued. Edward G. Robinson was a pleasure to watch, the cinematography great, it is classic film noir. A rating of 9 without that ending, down to a 4 with. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward G Robinson and Joan Bennett star in this film directed by Fritz Lang, one of Hollywood's best directors, in my opinion. While his family is out of town, a college professor (played by Robinson) becomes enamored with the woman who posed for a painting in a store window. One night, he actually meets the woman and spends the evening with her, but then he becomes involved in the murder of another man.This film could be a classic noir from 1944. I say "could be" because I'm not even sure what that means. All I know is that this is a good mystery film. The mystery isn't about who is responsible for the murder, but it's just to see if the culprits get away with it. Maybe that's what makes it a noir.In general, this film is worthy of your time if you enjoy this kind of story, or if you are a fan of Edward G Robinson's work. Joan Bennet does a good job, though I honestly think her part could have been played better by a few other actresses. The supporting cast also performs well in their roles. Overall, I would recommend this movie.***** Possible spoilers below *****Having said that, I personally would rate this movie a lot higher without the ending. For the first 94 minutes, the film is very good. The scenes are set up well, the editing is great, and the mystery and suspense are done very well. We know who committed the crime and we know why, but we don't know the victim. Eventually, we know the detective knows who committed the crime, but he's just waiting to see if the culprit will come clean on his own.But the ending is a complete let-down. In my opinion, it's bad enough to drop this movie down at least a couple of points. If the movie had ended about 5 minutes earlier, I would have easily rated this movie an 8, and possibly a 9. With the ending as is, I can't rate this film higher than 6. I think it's pretty sad, because this is a great film otherwise. The ending just ruins it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been spending time with Fritz Lang. Good time. I like him. But he disturbs me sometimes. He's something of an incomplete master. While he was working in Germany, he was attached to expressionism. That meant he worried about creating images, or sequences that were so powerful they could get the viewer in touch with his own consciousness. In those German films he did that practically every film, rarely with an integrated vision, rarely with a perfect assembly of all the powerful elements he could convey. But he always created moments that lasted.He had a social critic supporting his vision, and he explored characters, trying to bring out their depths. And he would hang all that in a powerful imagery, a vision. Images, basically. Here he does exactly the opposite. Here we have an image that generates a story. That could have been interesting, and indeed, as a concept, it is beautiful. But not well solved here.This is made when Lang is already fully immersed in the American production context and more than that it is made in a time when the noir has already established most of its rules (the noir which was visually forged in the German 20'/30' expressionism). This noticeable. Here he discards the social commentary (which was many times vapid, and only an excuse for the images). We do have some exploration of the limits/definitions of morality, but it's secondary. Instead, the focus here is (tries to be) in the plot. We have the woman, the man, the detective and the body. We are raised all sorts of questions about the crime, and we analyse, first with the inapt murderer and than with the police all the possibilities, all the clues. But this is a failure. We don't have doubts cast on the intentions of any of the characters. We know what happened, and except for how all will end, we know everything about every character. The woman has no secrets, she shows mysteriously under covered by an enigmatic image, but she really is what she says she is. The protagonist is a pawn in the game, but only due to his clumsiness, not because there's a bigger game he doesn't control. So, 3 years after 'the Maltese falcon', this narrative kind of construction was well studied.And the image of the woman, or the context in which it shows, is not powerful enough... it doesn't move us to another dimension as it should. it doesn't take us to the dream, like it took Robinson...My opinion: 2/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of Lang's best noirs (aside from the ending)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, Fritz Lang's the Woman in the Window, scripted and produced by Nunnally Johnson, is perhaps one of those seminal 'film-noirs' that- not knowing it of course- set a kind of precedent for others films of its kind for another decade or so (and so on). The script doesn't have the razor-sharp wit of Double Indemnity or the cool banter of The Big Sleep, but it does have a great dosage of the irony that is associated with many of the films of this sort. It is also a testament to Lang telling his story so compellingly that you really don't know where it might lead to...until that 'twist ending'. At that point I almost wondered if M. Night Shyamalan went in the way-back machine and tinkered with things in the story (or, just maybe, Johnson read A Christmas Carol one too many times). But taking apart those last couple of scenes, this is a very skillful drama with very limited room for real criminals. It's about people who are relatively law-abiding, until circumstances force them into secrecy, tense moments, and involvement in blackmail.Edward G. Robinson is very good in the first of a few collaborations with Lang, as a professor of psychology at a college (the beginning scene is really ingenious in how it cuts away at the end of a sentence that doesn't need to go on any further). His family goes away on a vacation, leaving him with not much to do aside from his fellow middle-aged friends (one a pharmacist and one a detective). But a particular image of a woman's portrait in the window- played in luscious, near femme fatale fashion by Joan Bennet- who appears and invites the professor up for a drink. When a man who she's been seeing off and on pays a visit while he's there, and his murder comes to him via self-defense, Robinson's character rationalizes to dump the body. An investigation ensues, and the professor is even taken as if casually to the murder site by his detective friend. They should be in the clear, but the man's bodyguard, played in maybe the juiciest performance of the film by Dan Duryea, demands some payment to not go squeal to the cops. What to do? Again, much of the real pleasure and excitement in watching a film like this is seeing it all as being very realistic, not stocked up with catchy lines or anything like that. Lang's world is one of looking over your shoulder, not sure at all what comes next. But un-like some of his earlier work, this isn't stylistically over-the-top, and it doesn't really need to be. His craftsmanship here is impeccable for what the story requires, and his actors are always on cue. Particularly fascinating is the scene mentioned previous where Robinson is taken to the crime scene, where watching his reactions and the fairly obvious dialog become some of the best parts of the film (typical to some, but still always worthwhile when given the best nuance and 'of-course' attitude of the script and direction). Also great are the scenes with Bennet and Duryea, who acts as a wonderful kind of precursor to what would come a few years later with the equally tough but 'charming' Richard Widmark's kind of criminal characters. And all through this the tension does mount very nicely, with the score punctuating where it needs to.But then there comes that ending. I knew something of a 'twist' would be coming by (perhaps unfortunately) reading many of the comments about the film and the main gripe with it. I would agree with the gripes, as it almost seems like it could have been tacked on by the studio against the filmmaker's wishes. But even with such a turn-around, I was very glad I saw the Woman in the Window, as its reputation of being one of the early seminal films apart of 'film-noir' is accurate and it provides some memorable moments for fans of the director and actor(s).</fullReview>
