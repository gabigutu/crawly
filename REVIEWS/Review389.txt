		<shortDescription>Postwar Bogart in a Derivative Yet Gripping Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Humphrey Bogart had ever decided to film one of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer thrillers, it would have turned out something like 1947's DEAD RECKONING. Although it's not actually based on a book, John Cromwell's tautly-directed film noir owes more than a little of its plotting and characterization to earlier classic crime novels-turned-classic Bogart movies. Indeed, when my husband Vin entered the room while the film was on, he began watching it with me and soon asked, "Is this THE BIG SLEEP, or THE MALTESE FALCON?" However, DEAD RECKONING is steeped in the kind of bitter post-war viciousness that distinguished Mickey Spillane's writing -- not that there's anything wrong with that! :-) Bogart commands the screen as Rip Murdock, a former Army paratrooper (lots of colorful references to parachutes and jumping here) and one of the most misogynistic good guys he ever played (not that you can blame Rip, after the wringer he's put through in this film). Captain Rip starts out trying to find out why his Sergeant and pal Johnny Drake (William Prince) has a Yale pin with the name "John Joseph Preston" on it, and more importantly, why Johnny bolts rather than accept the Congressional Medal of Honor for his wartime heroism. Rip's investigation leads him to Gulf City, Tropical Paradise of the South (don't take my word for it, check out the neon sign in the upper right-hand corner of the screen in the opening establishing shot :-), where he's quickly sucked into a whirlpool of secrets, double-crossing, murder, and such inventive mayhem as tossing napalm-powered Molotov cocktails at sinister smoothie Morris Carnovsky and his psycho henchman Marvin (THE MILLIONAIRE) Miller to make them talk. Standing in for quintessential Bogart leading lady Lauren Bacall (and original leading lady Rita Hayworth, who was hung up making THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI) is Lizabeth Scott as mysterious chanteuse Coral Chandler, the kind of dame guys go gaga for against their better judgment (she's got so many pet names from her various beaus that the first time I saw the film, I wasn't quite sure if her name was "Coral," "Dusty," or, of all things, "Mike"!). While Scott's no Bacall (don't get me wrong, Scott fans, I like her, but to my ears, her husky voice always sounds more phlegmy than sultry. Every time Scott speaks, I half-expect someone to offer her a cough drop!), she's certainly chock full of luminous blonde beauty, plus Scott has an air of wounded vulnerability that makes me empathize with her in spite of myself. Sometimes the film is gloriously, deliriously nutzoid. For instance, Bogart's speech to Scott early on about how men should be able to reduce women to pocket-size when necessary, and Scott's interpretation of this theory, must be heard to be believed. But when DEAD RECKONING works, it's dynamite (literally, when Bogart and Scott join forces with safecracker/explosives expert Wallace Ford)! Even when things get ugly, this movie is always gorgeous to look at, thanks to the stunning use of shadows and light in Leo Tover's black-and-white photography. If you love Bogart and you like your film noir grim yet glamorous and over-the-top at times, DEAD RECKONING is well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Bogart's best, a brutal Film Noir with a surprising ending, &amp; filled with sharp, witty dialog. Lizabeth has never looked more beautiful than here, &amp; although her acting ability is overmatched by Bogart, she would improve in her later films &amp; she's adequate in this role. There's glimpses of the basic "Maltese Falcon" plot here: Bogey searches out &amp; seeks revenge for his partner, even some of the dialog is similar in that respect. If you like Bogart or if you like Film Noir, you can't go wrong with this one! And by the way, this is a REAL Film Noir, not in the newer use of this phrase (recently, people have been calling any B&amp;W crime drama made in the 1940s a "Film Noir"). This film has all the classic Film Noir elements: lots of shadows &amp; stark contrasts (in the beginning, Bogart speaks from shadows so dark that one can hardly see his face), a spoken narrative, a "hero" who works outside the law, a murder mystery, &amp; a heroine who may not be a heroine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The bulk of this film, the middle of it, was just too slow for me, hence the so-so rating. The beginning and endings were very good, especially several scenes in the final half hour. There were several twists concerning Lizabeth Scott's character that kept you guessing.There were other things going for this film, such as Humphrey Bogart's narration. He had a lot of good lines in here, either narrating or talking to others. He and Scott were the stars but some of the supporting players also were great, such as Morris Carnovsky as the tough-guy aide, "Martinelli. " Also, they may not be big names but Charles Cane, William Prince, Marin Miller, Wallace Ford and James Bell all added nice performance here.Yet, with all this going for it, I didn't find the film as involving as it should have been. Perhaps another look someone will change my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Cromwell was a director that aimed to please, as demonstrated by the films he left behind. "Dead Reckoning" is a film that is satisfying while one is watching it, but later on, in retrospect, we question a lot of what we have seen as the plot doesn't make sense in many ways. All the elements of the Film Noir genre can be found in it. We have a war hero Rip, who is investigating the disappearance of his buddy, who he watches running away from a train in order not to testify with him in Washington. The action takes us to a Southern coastal town, where supposedly, the escapee has gone to. Little prepares Rip to find his friend burned to death in the morgue.Thus begins a tale of deception that has lots of interesting twists. The film benefits from its two stars, who play a game that on the surface seems to be one thing, and with a surprising twist at the end, turns out to be something else.Humphrey Bogart excelled in movies like this. He is tough, but he has time to have a great rapport with Dusty, the former singer at the local night club. Lisabeth Scott plays the siren with an air of mystery. It comes as a big surprise what happens at the end.Morris Carnovsky, a great theater actor of the time, is Martinelli, the crooked owner of the night club. Also a young William Prince plays the man who ran away to find a tragic fate by doing so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Neglected, Atmospheric Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it may not be one of the all-time greats, "Dead Reckoning" is neglected even in the Noir category. Most viewers see it because of Bogart. There is good reason: any doubts about his acting ability are erased by this performance. He really had a gift for delivering the archetypal Noir dialogue with which this film is loaded.Other cast members--Prince, Scott, Carnovsky--are very good. And a particular brand of Noir brutality plays a noteworthy role in this tale. But the main recommendation here is for the LOOK of the film. This is a prime example of Film Noir atmosphere at its most evocative. The opening shot of "Gulf City" at night is so beautiful, you want it to last much longer; Bogart's "confession" to the priest that frames the story in flashback is heavily shrouded in darkness; and the numerous nocturnal hotel scenes are threatening and darkly suggestive.Worth seeing for a not too-convoluted plot, Bogart, and the atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avenging A Pal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart and William Prince should be psyching themselves up for the big moment of their lives in Dead Reckoning. Bogey's put Prince up for the Congressional Medal of Honor. But Prince doesn't react to that quite the way one would expect. He jumps the train in Philadelphia on the way to Washington, DC and disappears and Bogey starts his own hunt for him and an explanation.The trail leads to Prince's hometown and Bogey learns that Prince was fleeing a murder rap when he joined the service. There's a girl involved to, Lizabeth Scott who Columbia was trying to build up into their version of Lauren Bacall. Of course the best way to do that was team her with Humphrey Bogart. Prince also winds up dead and Bogey's really on a mission now.Dead Reckoning borrows very heavily from The Maltese Falcon in terms of Bogart's character motivation. He was avenging a partner, admittedly one he wasn't crazy about, in The Maltese Falcon. Here he's looking for answers and vengeance on whoever might have murdered his war time buddy. That was a common theme in a lot of post World War II films. The audience, heavily populated with veterans, could understand Bogart's motivation back then easily.And because Humphrey Bogart is such a skilled player, today's audience can appreciate it. Dead Reckoning is not the best of Humphrey Bogart's films, but it's still entertaining.By the way, the ending confrontation is also out of The Maltese Falcon, though a bit more violent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long way behind "Gilda" in likability?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dead Reckoning" is somewhat of a rehashing of the plots and dialog of "The Maltese Falcon" and "The Big Sleep," but it contains much more visual violence? It is a typical Hollywood film noir of the post-war but a long way behind "Gilda" in likability? Bogart is again portraying his now all-too-familiar role of the sardonic cynic with his own moral code who, this time, is on the trail of a killer who has murdered a wartime paratrooper friend? Lizabeth Scott is cast as Bogart's femme fatale, obviously hoping to exploit her close resemblance to Lauren Bacall? Unfortunately, like Bacall, her first few films found her equally awkward and expressionless?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal but enjoyable noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, while certainly not the best film noir, certainly would be an ideal introduction to the genre, in large part because of its blatant banality. It does not even attempt to elaborate or subvert any of the genre's themes, so in that sense is ideal for someone wanting to get a feel of a film noir. All of the noir ingredients are there: man returning from war, femme fatale, flashback narrative, gambling, seedy clubs, suspicion, paranoia, etc. I've never seen Lizabeth Scott in anything else so can't really comment on her, but my goodness she seems to be trying to do her best Lauren Bacall impression. Certainly she's no Bacall, Lake, Gardner or even Turner, but is passable in her performance as the femme fatale. The plot is more complicated than someone used to contemporary movies may expect, and one certainly needs to pay a lot of attention to it. That being said, it can work in the same way as 'The Big Sleep' (a much superior film) if one disregards the plot and just soaks in the atmosphere. The city at night shots at the movie's beginning are incredible, probably the photographic highlight of the entire movie. I've read criticism about the direction and lighting in the sense that it switches between light and dark. I think that it is supposed to work in the same way that a movie such as 'Mildred Pierce' works in the sense that the juxtaposition between light and dark represents the character's state of mind. So in a scene where Bogie is content with Scott, the colors are extremely light, representing his state of mind. More suspicious scenes are thereby darker. I don't know, just a theory, and even if this was the director's intention its debatable as to whether its effectively achieved.All in all, an enjoyable noir, certainly recommended for fans of the genre, just don't expect any originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deja Vu All Over Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can't help wondering, while watching this movie, whether one has seen it before. Not for the first time is Bogart out to avenge a friend's death. He's gone after polished, Continental Mr. Big types before, too; and Lizabeth Scott looks an awful lot like Lauren Bacall. Some of the dialogue seems to have been lifted in toto from earlier Bogart films. Yet for all this, Dead Reckoning is still entertaining. Its cliches are at least agreeably packaged, and the setting, the Gulf Coast South, is unusual. Bogart brings sublime integrity to his world-weary and life-battered persona, and however artificial and predictable the story might be, the star's authenticity is absolute. One believes what's going on because one believes Bogart. This kind of thriller, which now falls under the general rubric of film noir, was losing a little steam by this time. For one thing, Morris Carnovksy's character of Martinelli had been done to death in the previous five years by everyone from Sydney Greenstreet to Otto Kruger. Marvin Miller's hulking, seemingly emotionally disturbed thug had become a commonplace fixture in such films; and while Miller is unique in his heavy-set, Orson Wellesian appearance, there's little that's new here, either. One can imagine script conferences of the day, with young screenwriters falling over one another trying to come up with a new psychological "complex" for the bad guy to be suffering from. Fortunately for the viewer, cliched though this movie is, it was made with extreme professionalism. Leo Tover's cinematography is understated, and nicely suggests the equatorial. John Cromwell was an old stage and movie pro by this time, though his usual magical touch with actors failed him with Miss Scott, he handles the tough guy stuff with suave authority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Film-Noir ? One of the Best I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one night after the Second World War, Capt. Warren 'Rip' Murdock (Humphrey Bogart) goes to a Catholic church and confess to a priest that he has been chased by the police and gangsters, and he would like to clean the name of his best friend, Sgt. Johnny Drake/John Joseph Preston (Wiliam Prince). He explained that Johnny was in love of a woman, Coral 'Dusty' Chandler (Lizabeth Scott). When they returned to USA, through the airport of La Guardia (N.Y.), they were confidentially sent by train to Washington. When they found that they would be decorated for their performances in the war, Johnny rushed to another train and vanished. Murdock decided to investigate the reason for such a behavior, and found in an old newspaper that Johnny was accused of murdering Coral's husband some years ago, and he had enlisted the Army with a false name, trying to escape from the crime. He moved to St. Louis, trying to meet Johnny, but instead he confronted a powerful mobster, Martinelli (Morris Carnovisky), had trouble with the local police and felt in love with Carol. "Dead Reckoning" is an authentic film-noir, with all the necessary "ingredients": the fatal woman, lots of money, sordid environment, crimes and dirty cops. However, the story of "Dead Reckoning" is magnificently developed in flashbacks and is very engaging, with many plot points, having a wonderful black and white photography, using perfectly the effects of the shadows, a very gorgeous actress Lizabeth Scott with a beautiful voice and Humphrey Bogart, my favorite actor ever. The dialogs are fantastic, having very sharp lines. I really liked this unknown film a lot, and I believe that fans of film-noir will certainly appreciate it. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Confiss?o" ("Confession")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart is the best thing about this noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart's performance in this film is what makes it rise above a 5 or 6. Columbia is obviously trying to replicate the elements of the types of films that Bogart did so well in the 1940's over at Warner Brothers. The oddest thing about this film is Bogart's dialogue, especially during his voice-overs. At times it comes on so strong as to approach a parody of Bogart as Bogart. If any other actor were speaking this dialogue it might evoke laughter if not confusion, yet Humphrey Bogart makes it work.Here Bogart is paratrooper Rip Murdock, just recently home from the war with Sergeant Johnny Drake, who is to receive the Congressional medal of honor. However, when Drake disappears right before the ceremony, Murdock gets permission from his superiors to find out what happened to his usually reliable friend and fellow soldier. Murdock follows his buddy's trail to Gulf City, a bar and gambling joint there that is run by a mobster, the girl that stole Johnny's heart - young and beautiful - and wealthy - widow Dusty Chandler (Lizabeth Scott), and a trail of clues fraught with mystery and murder. It's rather obvious that Lizabeth Scott is Columbia's answer to Lauren Bacall in this one, and that gangster Martinelli and henchman Krauss are attempting to duplicate the types of roles played by Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre in Bogart's successful Warner pictures. Although these three can't begin to match their Warner counterparts, and at times Scott painfully overacts, they do lend enough credible support to give Bogey a framework in which to play an interesting character in a rather intriguing mystery that has plenty of atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Front Rank Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, why does war hero Johnny Drake (William Prince) take a fast train away from the nation's highest military honor. It's an intriguing premise and the next 90 minutes tells us why. The movie's got noir icons like Bogart, Lizabeth Scott, and Morris Carnovski, plus a mysterious past, a smoky night club, and a barbecued corpse. In short, this ought to be classic noir, but in my little book it's not.I've got two basic gripes. First, Scott may look the part, but she's no Jane Greer (Out of the Past. 1947). Above all, noir's spider women have to be good actresses so that we never know their true feelings. That trickiness means we can get suckered along with the hero. But it also means we get suckered against our better judgement because we and the hero suspect their sincerity all along. Scott's performance lacks that crucial element of trickiness-- hers is essentially a one note performance with no hint of a gap between how she feels and how she behaves. Thus, there's no real revelation at the end because she looks and acts the same as before. As a result, the betrayal is all in the script and crucially not where it belongs-- in the performance.Speaking of the script-- the banter is too cute by-half. Practically every line out of Bogart's mouth shouts clever writer's device, whether it's baseball metaphors (strike one, strike two, etc), car metaphors, or the various other false rhetorical notes. For me, it gets tiresome, Bogart or no Bogart. Then too, Carnovski's queasy racketeer is made to enunciate his lines with perfectly parsed diction. Of course, that makes him a more interesting character and criminal mastermind. But, this again amounts to a device that calls attention to the words being said instead of to who is saying them or how the plot is helped along. It seems to me that a good script carries a story without competing with it. These are my two main gripes. There are other reasons I think the movie doesn't get beyond second-rate noir, such as uninspired direction (whether Cromwell's name is elevated above the title or not), overly long love scenes (after the point has been made), and menacing figures who don't really menace (Carnovski &amp; Miller). Together these undercut the strong points, such as the train scenes (how Prince &amp; Bogart have bonded) or certain good story points (the unidentifiable corpse, the poignant last scene). In passing-- this is not a gripe, but I suspect Columbia was using Bogart to build Scott into another Lauren Bacall. The two look somewhat alike, sound somewhat alike, and both built careers on appearance and attitude rather than ability. Here Bogart ends up calling Scott's character "Mike", just the sort of sidekick affection he shows for real life wife Bacall in their several movies together. Nothing obvious hangs on this, just a surmise that the movie may have been shaped for more than one purpose. However that may be, the movie amounts to okay but unmemorable noir entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the dialog sounds like Raymond Chandler clichés...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time HUMPHREY BOGART opens his mouth to say anything, it sounds like deja vu all over again. His role as a tough-talking ex-GI looking for his buddy's murderer and moving among a bunch of unsavory characters is the kind of material Raymond Chandler could have written with his eyes shut.The stock heroine is played with sultry charm by LIZABETH SCOTT, who seems to be subbing for Lauren Bacall throughout the murky proceedings. She even sings a torchy night club number in the same style as Bacall, but is not quite as alluring--nor does her chemistry with Bogart seem as strong.Bogart's string of one-liners make him sound like Philip Marlowe, detective, rather than a man on the hunt for a killer who gets drugged by the gambling joint owner and when he wakes up, discovers a corpse in his apartment. The corpse is a bartender who knew too much about the murder of Bogart's buddy.It's a typical Bogart movie of the '40s, film noir material that's well handled by director John Cromwell. While it doesn't have the impact of the high quality noirs like THE MALTESE FALCON, it will keep you guessing until the smart finish.Bogart gets all the nifty lines. "If you're looking for Easter bunnies, you're a day early." He delivers a solid performance that makes much use of voice-over narrative. Scott is okay, but she's had better roles in other films of the forties.Worth watching, especially if you like faux Chandler-type material. There's an Astor/Bogart quality to the final confrontation between Bogart and Scott. He even has the line that sounds like it's lifted from THE MALTESE FALCON: "When a guy's buddy dies, a man's gotta do something about it."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, albeit a bit typical film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The term "Film noir" is probably among the most difficult terms to describe when talking about films. To some it is a full-fledged genre, while to others (me included), its more a style of film-making that can bend to other genres giving them a distinct look. However, no matter what definition you choose, John Cromwell's 1947 film, "Dead Reckoning", will definitely end up being one of the best examples of a movie under the film noir label. With legendary actor Humphrey Bogart leading the cast and a story of mystery, crime and suspense; experienced director John Cromwell helms a film that while probably not very original, fulfills is intentions and delivers a good dose of entertainment."Dead Reckoning" is the story of Captain Rip Murdock (Bogart), who along with his teammate and friend, Sergeant Johnny Drake (William Prince), returns home after World War II to be awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and Medal of Honor respectively. On their way to Washington, Drake mysteriously disappears, so Murdock decides to follow him in order to find out what troubles his friend. The clues Drake left him take him to Gulf City, where Murdock discovers that Drake has died in a strange car accident. But this is only the beginning of Murdock's investigation, as his friend's past will unfold and Rip will discover that his friend had dark secrets that cost him his life.Based on a story by Gerald Drayson Adams and Sidney Biddell, the plot follows the conventions of film noir, although it packs more than a few surprises. The way it's written may not be very original (the narrative, the characters, some situations), but to its favor it has a very interesting plot and a well-handled mystery that just make the film an involving experience. It is also very dark, more than the typical film of this type, with Bogie's character being probably one of his meanest (quite a feat for the noir icon) and the whole film carrying an incredibly tragic (and very effective) mood.Stylistically "Dead Reckoning" follows the patter of noir style to the letter, and certainly takes full advantage of its elements. Cromwell's direction is simple, but effective, including a very good use of cinematography that ultimately creates an atmosphere of fake optimism, echoing the images of Gulf City as a false paradise, giving the film its distinctive tone. Cromwell makes the most of the elements he has to work with and makes the film excel despite its own limitations. Again, it may not be the most inventive film noir ever, but it's one of those that better demonstrate the style at its best.Humphrey Bogart once again demonstrates his domain of the scene and his knowledge of the trade, making a noir archetype turn into a powerful character that can go from being hateful and unlikeable to charming and worthy of sympathy in seconds. Lizbeth Scott plays Coral "Dusty" Chandler, Drake's romantic interest who aids Rip in his investigation. While Scott doesn't give a bad performance, frequently it shows that the character was written for another actress (in fact it was intended for Rita Hayworth), and even when her portrayal is really not bad, she feels inadequate and is easily overshadowed by Bogart. Morris Carnovsky is excellent as Martinelli, the man knows exactly what Murdock needs to know, and gives a classic noir performance."Dead Reckoning" is an excellent thriller that perfectly showcases the different elements of the noir style at its best, but as written above, it follows that pattern to the letter without really adding something new. While this in no way is an obstacle to enjoy the movie, it may feel clichéd to those familiar with the sub-genre. Fortunately, and even when the plot follows the noir pattern, the story is intriguing and has enough twists to make the mystery and interesting one. Some have criticized the story's complicated plot, but I think it added to the plot and help the film to have some identity of its own despite the already mentioned flaws.The film may not be as well-known as other Bogart movies about crime, but it still has that same magic that made his films unforgettable. The perfect combination of the film noir elements make up for its flaws, delivering a nice dose of entertainment. While it may have that legendary status that films like "The Maltese Falcon" have, it is a very recommended film, specially for noir fans. They don't make it like this anymore. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" The Smell Of Jasmine In Her Hair "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At this point in Humphrey Bogart's career, he was now a well enough established actor to be given free rein of his choice of director while on loan to Columbia Studios. He came up with John Cromwell who had given him his first break in the play Swifty, back in the 1920s. Cromwell decided to work with him again, but there was a problem, they had no story. According to Cromwell; they finally got this one , a noxious sort of thing , but I felt perhaps we could make something of it.' The 'noxious sort of thing' in question was Dead Reckoning, which turned out- unintentionally, it seems- to be almost a parody of The Maltese Falcon. Just like Sam Spade, Rip Murdock ( Bogart ) is trying to avenge the death of his partner; in this instance they were formerly paratrooper pals. It also borrows shamelessly from the film Double Indemnity, the same idea of a narrative voice-over commentary by Bogart. Even to the point of Fred MacMurray's repeated references to the smell of honeysuckle, in Double Indemnity, while Bogart harps on the smell of jasmine in the hair of co-star Lizabeth Scott. Sadly there is not the same friction and chemistry between Bogart/Scott as with MacMurray/Stanwyck. Bogart in this movie does not really seem interested in his sexy leading lady Scott, and it shows on film. Sadly for Lizabeth Scott, as an actress she was not lucky enough to have been taken under the wing of a brilliant Svengali-like director, which had been the main factor in setting Lauren Bacall on the road to success. But I still found her performance is exceptional under the circumstances and more interesting than Bogart's. While not near one of his best films, it is still a curiosity to see for Bogart fans and Scott fans alike. Either you'll like it or you won't, I'll let the reader decide for themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DEAD RECKONING has every possible element and cliché of 40's Hollywood film noir,with the disadvantages of an ill-chosen director,John Cromwell (who usually specialised in tearjerker or straightforward melodramas),a rather weak supporting cast,dated stereotypes and hackneyed plot.It would have ended up confined to B-movie obscurity had it not been for one factor:Humphrey Bogart.The story (war veteran seeks his fellow conflict hero buddy in his hometown,only to find out he gets killed,and tries to find out why),the dialogue and characterisations (cynical,hard-boiled) the settings (seedy nightclubs,plush apartments) characters and flashback structure were even in the mid-1940's when this film was made,so over-acquainted to audiences that such cinematic essays were teetering on the verge of parody.DEAD RECKONING perilously comes close to that said description,with it's lack of originality and style,but it is redeemed to the point of watchability simply by the presence of one of Hollywood's all time greats.He is given no chance to particularly stretch his talents,but Bogart was the all-time master of world-weary cynicism and nonchalant sarcasm,and by force of his sheer charisma rises above the mediocrity surrounding him.The supporting cast involved (Lizabeth Scott,Morris Carnovsky,Marvin Miller) are adequate but pale alongside Lauren Bacall,Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre who they are obviously trying to emulate,and large chunks of the story are inferior derivatives from such classics as THE MALTESE FALCON,THE BIG SLEEP and GILDA,with a monotonous voice-over which would have been unacceptably over-literal had Bogie not been it's instigator.DEAD RECKONING is fortunate to be saved by Bogart's cinematic persona,and the only truly memorable or imaginative touch is reserved for the film's very final shot;with the same studio (Columbia),Bogart would make a far better example of post-war Film Noir three years later with IN A LONELY PLACE,with a much more interesting and inventive plot,in-depth characterisations and directorial style.RATING:6 and a half out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart &amp; Scott Film Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyed all of Humphrey Bogart's films along with a very sexy actress, Lizabeth Scott,('Dusty' Chandler) who gave outstanding performances in their one and only film together. Bogart plays the role of Capt.'Rip' Murdock who is traveling by railroad with his Army buddy, Sgt. Johnny Drake, (William Prince) who is going to Washington, D.C. to receive a Medal of Honor award, but somehow disappears off the train. Rip decides to investigate his buddy's disappearance and runs into 'Dusty' and finds out she was Johnny Drake's ex-girl friend and he seeks her help and assistance and becomes very much in love with her. There are some very dark secrets that 'Dusty' is keeping from Rip and when these secrets are revealed this film will take you into another tricky ending. Great Classic and a very entertaining film which keeps your interest in the beginning, and gets rather slow and boring in the middle of the film, but the ending is a knock out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shades of "The Big Sleep", another and better known Bogart film, "Dead Reckoning" may not be as convoluted as it's precursor, but it will leave you asking just as many questions. Can you really come away from the film knowing who killed Stuart Chandler? By the time it's over we have three confessions over 'who done it', and each is patently logical, so take your pick and have some fun with this one.As a cab driver and Army Captain, Warren 'Rip' Murdock (Bogey) makes a great detective. As in "The Maltese Falcon", when a guy's pal is killed, a guy ought to do something about it. The pal in question is introduced as Sergeant Johnny Drake (William Prince), a fellow paratrooper whisked out of Germany along with Murdock to receive a 'Congressional' upon his Captain's recommendation. Trouble is, that might reveal his true identity, that of John Joseph Preston, Yale 40 as established by a university pin that Murdock sees by accident.When Preston/Drake winds up burned to a crisp in an auto wreck, the sordid trail leads Murdock to a sultry blonde, a gangster style club owner and a police lieutenant who seems to be everywhere. All the characters seem to be stand ins for more familiar Bogart supporting players; Lizabeth Scott for Lauren Bacall, Morris Carnovsky for Sidney Greenstreet, and Charles Cane for Barton MacLane or Ward Bond. Sanctuary Club owner Martinelli (Carnovsky) even employs an over-sized Peter Lorre type named Krause (Marvin Miller), who's main talent seems to be inflicting bodily harm.Most of the film employs a single flashback told in largely narrative style by Bogart's character, and to a priest no less while he's on the lam from mobsters and the law. It's generally done effectively, but I would have preferred more of the trademark 'Falcon' repartee from Bogey's character, though there is plenty of that too. The film hits stride when it catches up to real time right outside the Southern Hotel as the German lug Krause belts Captain Kincaid allowing Murdock to beat a hasty retreat; it's at that point where the movie started.You'll be hard pressed to come across a more chauvinistic description of women than the one Murdock shares with Coral 'Dusty' Chandler (Scott). In an odd way, she seemed to buy it, the analogy to a four inch pocket pal notwithstanding. The writers seemed to like it too, the comparison was used at least a couple more times in the story. That, and the old 'Geronimo' line, a not so subtle reference to Murdock's paratroop days.Though the movie's comparisons to "The Big Sleep" and "The Maltese Falcon" are transparent to Bogart fans, how about the short scene in the convertible with Dusty driving and Murdock a passenger? That one looked like it was ripped from the Paris auto scene in "Casablanca", though I don't recall Ingrid Bergman tossing her hair around so much. Later, Murdock finds a way to throw in a casual literal analogy - "My bet's on you, kid".For film noir fans, "Dead Reckoning" is a story full of the old cross and double cross, splendidly told in a way that leaves more questions than answers. By the time it's over, you're invested enough in the characters to be put off balance by the way it ends. Murdock turns out to be every bit as effective as a Sam Spade or a Phillip Marlowe, even if he does have to rely on a bag with a persuader and a couple of coaxes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic example of film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This slice of film noir isn't one of the better known ones, and the reason for that is probably because it doesn't have any real stand out elements about it; but the film does work excellently as a textbook example of the style of film-making. The most notable thing about the film is the fact that it features a leading performance from the great Humphrey Bogart. Bogart's personality has always been more than a little bit over the top, but it often isn't too noticeable. For some reason, however, it really sticks out in this film; but it somehow fits the dialogue like a glove, and the feel of this film is very much in the true classic style of noir. The plot is pretty standard, and follows Bogart's character; an ex-paratrooper, who is looking for a friend of his that disappeared after being accused of murder. However, he gets more than he bargained for when he hooks up with his friend's mistress, 'Dusty' Chandler. The atmosphere of the movie is dark and mysterious, and this blends brilliantly with the brooding plot line. The film manages to pull in many of the standard noir elements; best of which is the femme fatale; excellently brought to life by Lizabeth Scott. Overall, Dead Reckoning is a very good example of the film noir style of film-making, and while it's not one of the 'must see' films; it's certainly well worth bothering with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite all the noir ingredients, something's missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Reckoning appeared too early to have worn out and begun to recycle film noir's conceits and conventions, but already it has a tired, seen-it-all feel to it. Its director, the generally reliable John Cromwell (who three years later was to helm the great-grandmaw of women-behind-bars pix, Caged) works here with a by-the-numbers detachment that keeps the movie as limp and soggy as its "Gulf City" locale. Returning vet Humphey Bogart, en route to Washington with a war buddy who's about to be awarded some Big Medal, is baffled when said buddy suddenly takes it on the lam. His investigation into what happened and why takes him to a seamy town on America's south coast where, in a morgue, he finds his friend's body, charred beyond recognition. He also meets up with Lizabeth Scott (as Coral Chandler, or "Dusty," or, even, "Mike"), a canary in a local nitery run by heavy Morris Carnovsky. It seems she and the late pal were something of an item, and she teams up with Bogart to get to the truth.Or does she? The most problematic aspect of the film is that dealing with Scott -- game blonde or femme fatale? It's as if the scriptwriters or studio heads couldn't make up their mind about her, or as if alternative endings were contemplated, or even filmed. This doesn't help the viewer, whose empathy seems always to be out of kilter with what's happening in the plot. And this can't be written off as a teasing ambiguity -- it's a gross failure of filmmaking. So the sentimental, "redemptive" ending in the hospital ward, with high-flown talk of parachute jumps, tries to have it both ways. Well, it can't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the mistaken comments about "Dead Reckoning" being "film noir" prompts my review. Though there are certainly elements of film noir here (e.g, femme fatale, rainy scenes, night scenes, double crosses, post WW 2 production) there are also some significant omissions. For example, the big city element is missing. It's not an essential element (as is the femme fatale), but it is one of the main elements to look for. Also missing is the motley crew of bad guys. Here we have a duo, both of whom qualify, but the best film noir have a bunch of evil doers rather than a mere duo.We're also missing the cop/detective/insurance investigator, but Bogart's military man on a mission might qualify.But the two essential features that are missing are (a) the unfortunate ending for the protagonist, and (b) the protagonists' contribution to his own ill fate. Without these elements there is no true film noir. The film may be bleak or melodramatic, and it may even be nourish (as noted above), but it fails to be the classic film noir.In addition, Bogart's personality in this film veers away from the classic film noir protagonist. He's an award winning serviceman, with a pretty upbeat attitude, and a successful businessman. Of course he's also Bogart, so he brings with him so many of the film noir characteristics that we can be forgiven to see that in this film he is different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reckoning, Deduced.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a scene near the beginning of "The Maltese Falcon" in which Bogart as Sam Spade is staring down a hill at his partner's newly murdered body. A cop says to him, "Too bad, him getting' it like that. I guess Miles had his faults just like the rest of us but it's a shame, ain't it?" And Bogart, and director John Huston, do something extraordinary with the character of Sam Spade. Bogart puffs on his cigarette, pauses, says, "I guess so," in an almost indifferent tone of voice and then turns and walks away.I only describe that scene in order to provide a frame my judgment that there is no such originality in this story of an ex GI trying to find out why his decorate buddy was murdered after they return from the war.Most of the story is framed by Bogart's explaining his situation to a priest. It provides us with a narration by Bogart that is ripped fresh from the still-quivering flank of Raymond Chandler, only without Chandler's color or aberrancies. The lingo is plain pulp. "That's when your goons hit me with that sledgehammer cocktail," and the like.The plot is twisted, as such routine murder mysteries tend to be, and not worth detailing. Basically the writers have lifted everything possible from "The Maltese Falcon" without letting the audience in on the masquerade. Some of the dialog is almost identical. "When a guy's pal is killed you're supposed to do something about it." "Yes, Mike, you're going to fry for it." The performances are professional enough. I've always kind of liked William Prince as the knocked-off buddy, ever since he saved that kid's life by performing an appendectomy in Tokyo Bay. The story here indicates that Prince graduated from Yale. Actually he went to Cornell. Then there is the inimitable Bess Flowers as a party guest. I like extras who play party guests because I did it myself in the unforgettable cult classic -- "Windmills of the Gods." Or was it "Rage of Angels"? I forget.I don't think the movie is worth much more attention. Just another programmer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For fans of film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One reason to see Dead Reckoning is to see Lizabeth Scott if you're not familiar with her. She and Bogart are good in their only film together.Scott was in dozens of films between 1945 and 1957 and was touted as a Lauren Bacall/Veronica Lake actress. She is attractive but doesn't compare to Bacall. In Dead Reckoning Bogart refers to her as "Cinderella with a husky voice." Bogart plays a wronged man who wants to learn what happened to a missing army buddy. Scott is the ex-girlfriend who knows more than she lets on. The film looks film noir and follows all the noir plot conventions but it just doesn't equal the greater works. Still, it's fun to see if you are a noir fan.A piece of trivia: Marvin Miller plays a heavy and you won't recognize his face, but you may recognize his distinctive voice as Robbie the Robot from Forbidden Planet.</fullReview>

Light and shadow is used to great effect, especially in those scenes set in the morgue and Murdock's hotel room. Bogart is superb, as always.Some of the lines near the end seem to have been paraphrased straight from "The Maltese Falcon"("You're going to fry!") and Lizbeth Scott's character seems to have been inspired from Lauren Bacall's from "The Big Sleep" from a year earlier, but those are minor nitpicks. All in all, this is an overlooked film noir with a terrific ending.</fullReview>

He's an army captain who sets out to solve the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of a buddy. There's the usual quotient of danger and deceit and, of course, a femme fatale, well played by Lizabeth Scott who seems to have been born for this kind of part. Many of the plot points are either hard to follow or hard to swallow, and it's all much too talky, but it does have a memorable closing line! Worth seeing for genre buffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A defining but not amazing film noir. A must for buffs, and Bogart fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Reckoning (1947)"All females are the same with their faces washed." Or so says the Bogart role, dreaming of red heads in sloppy joe sweaters. This is a film about GIs coming home, and all they want is a girl. This is such classic noir attitude and situation, it's worth the ride just to appreciate the time. It's a defining movie because it not only implies the troubles of servicemen returning from war, it literally involves two of them, Bogart most of all. As he says, when stymied in his search for his buddy, "Stalled again, like a Jeep on synthetic gas."Nearly all is told as a flashback, until the final turns of events, and that's another common noir convention, and it works. I wish the movie was a classic, or that it built us up better before turning the tables on us. Director Cromwell is not known for being daring or especially memorable in his films, and we get a solid Cromwell movie, I think, good throughout, and sometimes vary good.Is Lizabeth Scott wooden and odd? Absolutely, but I've come to like her a lot. Is the writing a little forced (how many times can they push the code word "Geronimo" on us as a dramatic exclamation)? Yes, but as with many noirs, we take it in as part of the style. Is it sexist? More than usual, if you care. But again, we can write it off as a period effect.But is Bogart consistent (making a lot of a little)? Very much. We start to lose track of the original point of his mission there, and he's just the usual Bogart looking out for himself with a little reckless overconfidence. Which seems to work well for him. The story is strong enough, and filming nice, the pacing fast, the bit parts full of character, and so on. If it's not a great film, so what? Overlook the excess of narrative explaining and just get lost in the cross purposes and in Bogart's role. I mean, he's confused half the time, too!The end is terribly sweet and moving--by that I mean the last few seconds. A supremely subtle, sweet, and smart last move, bringing us back to what matters most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treachery &amp; Temptation In Gulf City</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dead Reckoning" is an entertaining movie which contains many film noir characteristics. The urban setting, dark rainy streets, a flashback narrated by the main protagonist, interesting use of shadows, a femme fatale and a twisting storyline are just some. Humphrey Bogart's performance as a guy who's both tough and worldly but also gullible is impeccable and compelling to watch.After returning from military service in France, Captain Rip Murdock (Humphrey Bogart) and Sergeant Johnny Drake (William Prince) are summoned to Washington DC to be awarded medals, but when Johnny realises that the ceremony is likely to be featured in the newsreels, he becomes agitated and when their train stops at Philadelphia and newspaper photographers want to take the men's pictures, he suddenly disappears. Rip is naturally shocked and decides to go after him.Rip goes to Johnny's home town, Gulf City, where he discovers that his friend had enlisted under an assumed name and is still wanted for the murder of Stuart Chandler, a wealthy local resident who was married to a cabaret singer called Coral (Lizabeth Scott). Johnny is subsequently killed in a car crash and Rip decides to do all he can to clear Johnny's name.At the "Sanctuary Club" Rip traces Louis Ord (George Chandler), who'd been a witness in the murder trial and he tells Rip that he has a letter for him from Johnny. Rip also meets Coral (the woman who Johnny had been in love with), club owner Martinelli (Morris Carnovsky) and also his sadistic henchman Krause (Marvin Miller). That night, Rip is drugged and framed for the murder of Louis Ord and this leads him into a determined pursuit of the missing letter and Chandler's murderer."Dead Reckoning" was made in an era which predated political correctness and as a result some of Bogart's utterances now seem rather anachronistic. He tells Johnny that "all females are the same with their faces washed" and also tells Coral the "women ought to come capsule size, about 4" high and when a man goes out of an evening he just puts her in his pocket........and that way he knows exactly where she is". He is then free to "swap a few lies with his pals without danger of interruption and when it comes to that time of the evening when he wants her full sized and beautiful, he just waves his hand and there she is........and if she starts to interrupt, he just shrinks her back to pocket size and puts her away". Coral's eventual positive take on these remarks would normally be regarded as astonishing but she is so duplicitous a character that nothing she says is genuinely surprising. She's cold, mysterious and remote and full of contradictions and although Rip is wary of her, he still finds her irresistible. Martinelli is also a puzzling character with his own contradictions as he's a brutal gangster who claims that "by nature I'm a gentleman, truly gentle". He also says that "brutality has always revolted me as the weapon of the witless" and seems to genuinely find seeing any violence deeply distasteful."Dead Reckoning" doesn't enjoy the status of some of Bogart's classics and is a bit narration-heavy, however, the strange complexities of its story and its characters are intriguing and make it thoroughly absorbing and enjoyable.</fullReview>

It's not a bad film, but it's a mile away from Bogie's best.It seems that 'Film-Noir' is an excuse for letting atmosphere rule over content and this film fails because the plot really doesn't hold up well and, I'm afraid, none of the characters give you much excuse to care about them. The ending is a surprise, but Bogie's unlikely reaction to them adds to the implausibility. Lizabeth Scott is no Lauren Bacall and seems to be filmed in fog throughout. It was a reasonable 100 minutes of viewing and Humph dominates the show, as ever, but it's not a film I'll be rushing to Amazon to buy and it failed in the end for trying to hard.Bottom line....would suit an audiobook version more than a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably mid-range Bogie in that it is not really in the same league as The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, etc but still several notches above some of his early Warner Bros fodder. In one respect it anticipates one element of The Manchurian Candidate inasmuch as in both movies a Major in the United States Army having recommended a subordinate for the Congressional Medal of Honor is then assigned to track him down. The connection is flimsy at best, for one thing they were different wars and for another the strong political element of the latter was completely absent in the former. Bogie has a nice line in throwaways as when club-owner Morris Carnovsky asks Bogie if he minds if he watches him shoot craps and Bogie comes back with 'sure, if you can stand it', or, of course, the even gaudier patter when Bogie is throwing fire-bombs in Carnovsky's office 'how do you like yourself, medium rare?' but in between the pace tends to sag and the wooden acting of Lisabeth Scott does little to help. As a Bogie vehicle and an example of noir it's certainly worth watching but not working up a sweat about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of this film noir thriller is much better than the second half. It's as if the writers and director ran out of crisp crackling dialog and innovative ideas after about 45 minutes. The ending in particular is very unsatisfying, as if those behind the camera were attempting to tack on a Sam Spade, Brigid O'Shaughnessy style wrap up, only this time instead of prison there would be a big sleep involved. Whatever the shortcomings of the film, it is still worthwhile and entertaining. The beginning is suspenseful. Two war buddies are on a train bound for glory to receive the coveted Medal of Honor for heroism under fire. Sgt. Johnny Drake (William Prince) on arrival is called for a photo shoot. He skips out the back way and runs, never to be seen alive again. His pal Capt. 'Rip' Murdock (Humphrey Bogart) is determined to find out why he ran away. What he uncovers is not pretty, except for the femme fatale Dusty (Lizabeth Scott) who is pretty but deadly.Of interest is the appearance of Marvin Miller as the gunsel Krause, a brute of a man whose solution to any problem is violence. He had a varied film and television career, perhaps best remember as Michael Anthony in charge of giving away a million dollars every week on the early TV series "The Millionaire." Also note the fine actress Lizabeth Scott who played in several films during the 40's and 50's. She was never given a part that would bring her the recognition needed to make her a star. Though almost forgotten today (She's still alive), Scott never delivered a bad performance. She is my wife's favorite actress.The dialog is clever with Bogart telling the story to a priest in the form of a confession. Though not on the same level as "The Maltese Falcon" or "The Big Sleep," this film is still a great film noir thriller.</fullReview>

Okay Scott isn't quite Becall but there is certainly movie magic between the two stars. Bogie turns detective to try to find his missing pal who turns up burnt to a crisp in the local ice-box. His trail leads to a local gangster and a sexy ex girlfriend played by Scott for whom Bogie quickly gets the hots for. The movie is narrated by Bogie who is retelling his tale to a priest at the beginning of the film. It really is a dark tale full of smokey nightclub scenes and darkly lit streets with bulky 1930's American cars with glaring headlights cutting through the gloomy nighlife evoked in this fantastic film noir !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) On the run from his pursuers US 82th paratrooper Capt."Rip" Murdock, Humphrey Bogart,slips into a church and is met by US Army Chaplin Father Logan, James Bell. With both Rip and Logan being in the same unit, the 82th AB, made thing easier for Rip to recount his story that ended up with him running for his life. Rip's story starts when he and his fellow paratrooper and close friend Sgt. Johnny Drake, William Prince, were returning from Europe on a special train to Washington D.C. On the train it came to Rip's attention that he and Johnny were to be awarder medals for bravery in the Europen Theater of War. Johnny instead of being happy and excited of being awarded the coveted medals starts to sweat and feel ill Before you know it, as the train makes a stop in Philadelphia, he checks out never to be seen again.Rip confused over Johnny's strange actions makes it his business to find him and see what exactly was the reason for his weird disappearance. Going to Johnny's home town Gulf City Florida Rip get's a note at his hotel from non other then Johnny himself telling him that he'll contact Rip within 12 hours. When no such contact happens Rip begins to wonder if something very bad happened to his troubled friend. Checking out back issues of the local city newspaper Rip uncovers Johnny's real identity and the reason for his strange behavior back on the train in Philidelphia. Johnny Drake, who's real name is John Joseph Preston, was suspected in the murder of a prominent Gulf City citizen Charles Chandler just before he disappeared in October 1943. Having enlisted in the US Army Johnny put his past behind him but with all the publicity about to come out of him receiving the very coveted Medal, Medal of Honor to be exact, the past that he tried to suppress for the last three years is about to resurface with deadly results. Rip checking out all leads later finds that Johnny's body was found outside the city burned to a crisp in what the police reported a car accident but Rip knew better; Johnny was murdered by someone who knew the truth about what was behind Charles Chandler's murder. Humphrey Bogart is at his best in this Film-Noir as Ex-GI Rip Murdock but not his usual private detective role that he plays in these kinds of movies. The husky voiced Lizabeath Scott as Johnny's girl that he left behind, and Rip love interest in the movie, is both smoldering and seductive as "Dusty" Chandler. The wife of the murdered Charles Chandler Dusty knew more about her husbands death and what Johnny had to, or not to, do with it then she was willing to admit.Morris Carnovsky as the mob boss Martinelli who Dusty works for as a singer at his nightclub, The Sanctuary Club,is also effective and the man with the plan who not only knows about what really happened to Charles Chandler but what Dusty was keeping from both her husband Johnny and Rip as well. It was the circumstances of Charles Chandlers murder that was about the only thing that had the hard boiled wise cracking and "I've seen it all" Rip at a loss for words for the only time in he movie. P.S Marvin Miller the future Michael Antony of the 1950's TV drama "The Millionaire" is Martinelli's music-loving mentally deranged and sadistic henchman Krause who likes to work over his victims to the sounds of the Big Bands and Cole Porter music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Noir; One of the Best Story lines Ever Seen; Tough. Fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a superior thriller with a wonderful storyline. It is lessened in its impact by the miscasting of Lizbeth Scott as a singer and as a villain. But the rest of the cast is very good indeed; and the suspense never lets up. This is a true noir, one that might have been done by Alfred Hitchcock or perhaps Leigh Brackett. It tells the story of Rip and his friend Johnny, who are being sent to Washington so that Johnny can collect the Medal of Honor. But Johnny is reluctant, strangely, and he disappears from the train that is taking them there. Rip follows him, remembering where his hometown is, and plunges headlong into a nightmare of lies, danger and suspicions. He seeks out Johnny's girl, Scott, a singer in a nightclub, and narrowly escaping death here and there and a frame-up for the murder of a man he questioned, he finally solves the murder of his friend--and finds out who really killed Johnny's wife, which was the accusation against Johnny that he what been running from in the first place. Veteran John Cromwell directed, beautifully; and the cinematography and sets, the latter by Louis Diage, are outstanding. Jean Louis did the costumes; and lighting, art direction and other elements are far-above-average. The story is by Gerald Dayson Adams, Steve Fisher and Sidney Biddell. Humphrey Bogart is at his best in this film, and it is also a good one for George Chandler, Morris Carnovsky and Marvin Miller. Charles Cane, Wallace Ford and William Prince as Johnny do well also; others contributing included James Bell and Ruby Dandridge. The story is a bit complex, but it believable at all points. The climax involves the use of weapons against the bad guy, by Rip, and an attempt on his life--by Johnny's girl, with whom in any case he has fallen a little in love. Tough dialogue, classic confrontation scenes, frame-ups, hard-boiled cops, a parachuting padre and a first-rate mystery; no wonder this film is so well liked. It deserves more attention than it has ever gotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a film noir fan and a Bogart fan, I had very high expectations for Dead Reckoning and for the most part I was not disappointed. Sure, there are many clichés of the genre (even from other Bogart vehicles) noticeable throughout but they don't really detract from the enjoyment because Bogart the legend carries us through and keeps us interested in the usual twists and turns of the plot. Bogart's character it goes without saying is totally admirable for his loyalty and Scott, although, not the most versatile actress, makes us understand why Johnny loved her so much. Martinelli and his stooge who 'likes the music' made for entertaining villains. Terrific entertainment. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a film noir fan, it's definitely worth seeing. Bogie plays Bogie and Lizabeth Scott plays Lizabeth Scott to the hilt. But the plot has too many completely improbable twists, and some of the dialogue (mostly Bogie's) must have seemed preposterous even in the late '40s. The contradictions in the Scott character (Coral Chandler?) are enough to drive anyone who thinks about it completely crazy. Basically, your attitude has to be, "who cares about believable plot or believable character when Bogie deals with mobsters, murder, mayhem, and a classic "do I love her, can I trust her, did she do it, do I care?" femme fatale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fine performances are wasted in "Dead Reckoning," and why critics and IMDb members admire this movie is a bigger mystery than the one portrayed. While the movie supposedly takes place in the deep South, only one character (a black maid) speaks with a southern accent. What southern city, for that matter, looks like the one shown in the movie? "Wild Things," "The Big Easy" and "Tightrope" all present better mysteries and atmosphere; yet none are as well regarded as "Dead Reckoning". WARNING: SPOILERSBogart spends two days waiting in his hotel room to hear from his war buddy, William Prince. Bogart has rented a radio that JUST HAPPENS to have a police band. QUESTION: How many portable radios in 1947 had police band, particularly rental radios? Okay, if we can get past that one, what's the likelihood of Bogart accidentally turning on the police bad AT THE EXACT MOMENT his buddy's burned body is discovered? The police lieutenant at the morgue describes the body as "a piece of bacon," Bogart describes it as "a charred lump," yet Bogart has no trouble identifying the body as his friends.Later, when Bogart discovers that Lizabeth Scott is a "bad girl," Lizabeth shoots Bogart AT POINT BLANK range. Bogart crashes the car AT OVER 100 MILES PER HOUR into a tree. Now, kiddies, automobiles didn't have seat belts, air bags and reinforced crash protection in the 1940s. Even today, there'd likely be little left recognizable of the two passengers. Nonetheless, Scott's pretty face is unmarred and Bogart has nothing more than an injured arm(!!)I don't believe Bogart had a bad performance in him. Likewise Scott, who's career ended over rumours of Lesbianism, not bad acting. Most of the rest of the characters are stock film noir, as is the hackneyed main plot. END OF SPOILERSI think "Dead Reckoning" is a dud. I give it a "5".</fullReview>

What a ridiculous convoluted plot. The idea of calling back to St. Louis to get a name of a safe cracker so that he can break into the mobsters safe and get the letter that his old chum from the army left for him is so far fetched that it works. All the stupid twists and him buying her lies. I kept expecting his buddy Johnny to show up alive having faked his own death. That would have been a little interesting. But am I the only one who saw shadowy gay stuff in the opening scene on the train? The great line about four inch tall woman who fit in your pocket is worth watching the film for as well as that great Downtown location shot in front of the Rexall Drug store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rip Murdock (Humphrey Bogart) seeks the help of Father Logan as he recounts the last few days. Paratroopers Rip and Johnny Drake are sent to Washington to receive the Medal of Honor. Johnny seems concerned upon hearing the news and goes AWOL when the newspapers come to take his picture. Rip starts investigating and follows him to Gulf City. He discovers that Johnny's real name is John Joseph Preston and he's accused of murdering wealthy Chandler. There's a charred body with a melted ring that's probably Johnny. He talks to witness bartender Louis Ord, and Chandler's wife Coral. Coral keeps losing when the dice keep coming up 7 and 11. Rip takes over and wins back everything plus $16k more. The club owner Martinelli drugs his drink and he wakes up in his room with the dead body of Louis Ord.This does have Humphrey Bogart in his natural hard-boiled noirish thriller. Lizabeth Scott is a second rate siren. She has a tendency to smile which takes away from the tension. She also needs to control her hair. There are a couple funny moments when it flies in her face. Her chemistry with Bogie isn't great. The directing is not great. This lays out a fine setup but the story drags along in expositions. The writing has plenty of hard dialogue but the story struggles to pick up steam after a nice first act. There are a few too many twists in the end. This is mostly for Bogie aficionados only after finishing off his classics.</fullReview>

Note his cohort is none other than Marvin Miller, who some years later made it big on television by handing out those million dollars to people in the hit show "The Millionaire."The film is rather slow moving and you really lose interest in it.

		<shortDescription>Reckon on a classic film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superb film noir incorporates the poetic, metaphoric dialogue that Bogart delivers so well, and the husky brogue of femme fatale Lizabeth Scott, as a sad-eyed singer and magnet for murder. Bogart is a returned serviceman who, along with GI buddy Prince, are about to receive medals for gallantry in the field of combat. But before they can be awarded, Prince does a runner, concealing a sinister background that ultimately leads Bogart to follow his trail. Along the way, he encounters the enigmatic Dusty (Scott - very Bacall 'esque) a reluctant acquaintance of corrupt casino owner Martinelli (Carnovsky) and his ape 'friend' Krause (Miller). Several plot twists later, Bogart finds himself a target, surrounded by villains, desperate to identify the puppet master.Great use of lighting, genuine-looking sets, and sympathetic supporting performances (Charles Cane as the beleaguered Lt Kincaid is a likable adversary) complement the might of Bogart and Scott, their screen presence all consuming. The scene in which Bogart and Scott take their last ride is a cracker, but unfortunately, the theatrical death scene that follows, isn't so engaging.Carnovsky and Miller make an odd couple of villains, but both equally memorable in their own brand - Carnovsky, the reluctant aggressor, composed and calculated, Miller, the antithesis of composure, ready to crack at the first opportunity. His penchant for 'music' when delivering beatings is a novel twist and the hiding he unleashes is slow and sadistic. As with a number of other film noir, director Cromwell has employed offbeat, unique aspects for distinction; here, most of the narrative is delivered by way of Bogart relaying a retrospective to a priest, as he desperately searches for an escape strategy. It's riveting stuff all the way, perhaps only denied greatness by a (in relative terms) weak conclusion.Classic film noir, not as well appreciated as "Dark Passage" or "The Big Sleep" (a couple of my other favourites), but highly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't you just love those film noir titles that just reach out and grab your interest, despite having no direct relevance to the movie content...? Obviously, like the pulp fiction book-source, it's a device to attract casual interest from passers-by looking at cinema-hoardings or book displays. This is definitely one of those and moreover director John Cromwell, not one I'd regard as being in the Hollywood pantheon, somehow manages to get his name above the title too.Good for him, because this is a cracking and mostly pulsating film noir, led by the inimitable Bogart again immersing himself in a meaty role, ostensibly a demobbed army captain but evidentially a sub-Sam Spade type adventurer who gets up to his neck in danger as he attempts to track down his army-buddy-with-a-secret Johnny and taking in encounters with a gambling-den boss, his hired muscle who gets up close and personal in a far from pleasant way with Bogart's face and Lizabeth Scott as the femme fatale playing both ends as you would expect.The movie starts with a straight-away drop-in to the action leading up, you just know it, to a lengthy flashback from Bogie, involving a fairly contrived unburdening of not quite his soul to an ex-forces padre. The background story is raw and pacy enough to hold your interest pretty much all the way through with taut and edgy dialogue, natch, only lapsing a little when Scott &amp; Bogart apparently hitch their wagons together and get all starry-eyed. Not to worry, a quick look at your watch tells you there are still 20 minutes or so to go and you know you're in for an exciting guns (and fires) - blazing finish.Bogart's great as per...and Scott is just fine for the most part in her Bacall-clone part, all smoky eyes and voice, even getting into a noir-trademark white outfit (a la Stanwyck &amp; Turner) for the second half, although she acts a pretty poor deathbed scene in the final reel and can't lip-synch her early-on torch song for toffee. The villains don't exactly come across as villainous however, which lightens the tension a tad, the henchman in particular wimping out when Bogart sets fire to the boss's apartment - you'll laugh out loud (as I did) at his pathetic scream as he exits through a window.Nevertheless, the movie crackles along satisfactorily until its downbeat er... reckoning and employs and respects enough noir conventions to keep aficionados happy...including me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Captain Rip Murdock lets friend Sgt Johnny Drake know that the reason for their trip to Washington is for Drake to receive the Congressional Medal of Honour, he is surprised to see Drake run away and go into hiding. Ignoring his superiors, Murdock heads out after Drake to his hometown. Checking into his hotel, Murdock discovers Drake has been expecting him and left a note that he'll be in touch. However hours turn into days and it transpires that Drake has been murdered ? perhaps in relation to an event years before where Drake fled into the army to hide from a murder rap where he plead guilty to murdering the husband of his lover Coral Chandler. With Drake dead, Murdock follows up the few trails he has ? a witness against Drake and Chandler herself, both of whom led him into harm's way with local "businessman" Martinelli.Some people have criticised this film and questioned its high rating on IMDb but I think they are being overly harsh and that the general good feeling for this film comes from the way that it more or less does just what you expect it to do. Opening with a confessional narrative device so we have the tale told in flashback, the film treads a familiar path but has a solid mystery to work with and pretty much everything one would expect from the genre falls into the place within this frame. We get the good use of shadows by the cinematographer, the sharp, hard dialogue, the femme fatale, the gritty hero, the gambling dens and the constant smoking. None of it is remarkable enough to make it stand out as a classic within the genre but this is not to say that it isn't any good.On the contrary it ticks all the boxes that I expected and is driven forward by a Bogart performance that also ticks the boxes and comes over as a standard turn in a solid collection of detective-style characters. A shame then that the supporting cast do not match his turn. Scott is not strong enough to convince and I was surprised by how weak she was here ? her failing does affect her side of the film and prevents it being more than basic. Carnovsky is an OK villain who is a smarmy presence however I wanted more menace from Miller's Krause. The selection of music was another weakness as it is too constant and too obvious ? with the lighter music being particularly jarring and I would have liked a bit more silence to allow the atmosphere to build from the characters and script rather than just the score.Overall I enjoyed it mainly because it delivered just what I wanted from a Bogart film noir. It is far from a classic but it ticks all the genre boxes and will satisfy those looking for that even if it offers little to viewers seeking more than the basics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the necessary elements are here for a film noir classic: mystery, smoking, drinking, gambling, murder, pouring rain, arcane cocktails, nightclubs, knockout drops, tough streetwise slang, and would it really be noir without first person narration? It's the overall noir vibe in a Post World War II setting that really makes it worthwhile and special. And that Bogart stars... In contrast to films like The Big Sleep, which was released only a year before this one, (but made earlier than that). Clean looking process shots add a new, modern quality to this feature. One odd sensation fans of other Bogart films might feel in watching this film is the deliberate mimicry of Lauren Bacall by Lizabeth Scott. Something the the studios were apparently trying to cultivate, which leads to a perceptible change in accents by the actress,sometimes within the same scene. But the genre is so much fun to remain in, that this imperfection becomes part of its charm. The ending is poorly conceived and the pacing finally falls apart about 15 minutes from the end. Still, very worth seeing and certainly a more obscure Bogart film for his newer fans to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic Film Noir with engaging plot and a splashy ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about this movie is the DVD Cover. I think it's the best of any Film Noir. This movie is a 6/10 for a film noir. To save space, you can read the plot synopsis elsewhere. Here are the essentials about this film. First of, this is an excellent movie because of Bogie's narration throughout the film and the engaging plot that keeps you wanting more than Bogie is willing to reveal at the moment. Nevertheless what could have been a masterpiece of a movie, gets ruined w/too many holes in the plot and unbelievable situations. Many questions pop into the viewer's mind about the problems in the film: The radio picks up police calls? Bogie falls in love w/a woman that his friend loved? Bogie learns how to crack a safe in about 4.5 minutes?? It seems that the moves Bogie makes in this film are so straightforward that there is hardly any suspense or question about where the story is going. However, notable is the use of dark/light contrasts by the director which is very well done in this film especially during the gorgeous church confession scenes. This is a very enjoyable movie to watch; its a fun film noir to explore but for me the test is whether it warrants a second look. Is this the movie one would want to watch again and the answer is "no". Once you've seen it and saw the splashy ending with a couple of twists, the joy is gone and the movie begins to seem less memorable. Its not a classic in the Film Noir genre, but a solid contribution to the whole body of the genre in both in spirit (having all the necessary elements) and the execution (great cinematography), but no so much in acting or story-telling.</fullReview>

The film takes place in a fictitious southern city, Gulf City (Tampa, Florida?) in 1946. Lizabeth Scott plays the love interest. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I don't "buy" her act.And by the way, if you don't know why Bogey died of lung cancer, just count the number of cigarettes he smokes in this movie.

Only its Bogey! Albeit at the midpoint of his career...so this could have been a much, much better film. However the acting is terribly wooden. Bogey looks tired and uninspired and there is very little chemistry between he and the "femme fatale" Lizbeth Scott, who was ostensibly cast as a Bacall look alike. (husky voice and all). The set was supposed to be tropical, but was shot in NYC. The green screen beach scenes looked fake. I could go on and on. One parting comment, though, regarding the incredibly sexist scene where "Rip" explains his philosophy on women to Coral..."Woman should be shrunk down and kept in a man's pocket...and taken out, blown up, and be there for him looking pretty." (not exact quote, by you get the picture) Gag me with a maggot. The ending was, perhaps, the worst death scene I have seen. After a horrendous car crash, (head on with a tree at 70mph)Rip has a broken arm and Coral (on her death bed), with a designer head wrap and no bruising, closes her lovely eyes and parachutes off to the great beyond. Pathetic. The movie works as a reference point for Bogey film buffs and little else. -Jim</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie again and, despite the many derogatory comments about Lizabeth Scott's acting abilities in the other reviews, I have to say that I found her far more interesting to watch than Lauren Bacall of that same period. She was certainly adequate to the role as written. FYI,she was under contract to Hal Wallis at this time (who released through Paramount)and was a last minute replacement for Rita Hayworth, who withdrew at the last minute because she didn't want to play another bad girl after "Gilda". The look of the movie is great, the supporting cast perfect and Bogart, as always, delivers the goods. I sense from some of the other reviewers that they are looking at this mystery (PLEASE, permanently retire that tiresome term, "Film Noir"!)in contemporary terms, rather than through the eyes of 1947 audiences, who generally went to the movies to be entertained, and not to over-analyze what is essentially a mystery. If one wants to have a good time, which was the idea behind movies of that period, you will be. Certainly far more than most of what is produced today, with forgettable faces, dumbed-down plots and questionable taste. I give this movie an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of Bogart's Final Films . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Cromwell's film noir thriller "Dead Reckoning" is the last great tough-guy movie that Humphrey Bogart starred in after he left Warner Brothers and went to Columbia Pictures for the last phase of his career. "Dead Reckoning" contains an oblique dialogue reference to the classic John Huston detective film "The Maltese Falcon." Bogart is cast as a U.S. Army paratrooper, Captain Rip Murdock, and his buddy, Sergeant Johnny Drake (William Prince of "The Gauntlet"), is slated to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor, so the military put both of them on a plane home. When Johnny learns that he is going to be awarded the medal, he skips out and Murdock lights out after him without any military help. You see, Murdock wants to keep it a low-profile operation.The bulk of the story occurs in a drowsy Southern town where Drake took the blame for killing a wealthy man. Johnny's girlfriend Coral (the beautiful Lizabeth Scott of "Red Mountain") is involved in the murder and Johnny wants to protect her so he scrambles out of town, enlists in the military and heads off to war-torn Europe where he becomes fast friends with Captain Murdock. Bogart's Captain Murdock tangles with some tough cookies, local mobsters who run an illegal as well as fixed roulette wheel and are up to their ears in corruption.They drug, beat up, and frame Bogie for the death of another man who testified in the court. The way that Bogie disposes of the body is rather neat. The story is largely related in flashback as Murdock confides in an Army chaplin in a Catholic church while the local authorities scour the city looking for him. Lizabeth Scott is the sultry siren at the center of everything. Morris Carnovsky is a tough guy who roughs up Bogart in one scene. Splendidly paced by Cromwell, "Dead Reckoning" qualifies as a top-notch, gun-toting nail biter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dead Reckoning" is a good, if not very original, film noir starring Humphrey Bogart as a paratrooper investigating his buddy's death. William Prince, who later was a more visible actor as a white-haired older man, has a small role as the buddy, who runs away when he learns he's about to receive the Medal of Honor. Later, he's found dead in his home town.There are the usual ethnic stereotypes - the de riguer black maid, the thug of Italian descent, and the torturing thug of German descent. The thug in this case is Marvin Miller, who later became the assistant of John Beresford Tipton on the TV show, "The Millionaire." He got to give people $1 million tax free. With prices today, they'd probably all laugh in his face.Lizabeth Scott is the woman "Johnny" (Prince) was in love with. She's an actress I always found heavy on style and slight on substance. Beautiful, with a warm smile, and one of the best voices in films, she never exhibited the acting range of, say, Bacall, whom she seemed groomed to follow. In this role, she's not very believable, which is great for the noir films, in which she excelled. You really didn't know how involved she was or wasn't in the crime at hand.All in all, a very entertaining film with a solid performance by Bogart. Regarding the film's reference to the "Geronimo" cry that paratroopers made as they jumped, I asked an actual war paratrooper about this, and he said, "We were usually so scared we couldn't make a sound."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor man's Maltese Falcon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem in Hollywood is that actors find themselves remaking the same movie over and over again. Humphrey Bogart was a victim of that in the Movie "Tokyo Joe", where he was playing a variation on his character in Casablanca. He's a victim in this, too, playing a variation on "The Maltese Falcon", where he is caught up in a web of deceit, lies and double crossing women.His character here is a bit of a stretch. He's a former taxi cab company owner from St. Louis with mob ties who somehow got a commission in the Army to lead paratroopers. His sergeant is about to get the Congressional Medal of Honor, but he discovers the man isn't who he claimed to be, but a suspected murderer on the run from the law.Lisbeth Scott plays the Mary Astor role as the woman who cannot really be trusted.Some interesting things here, this movie doesn't show Post-WWII America in the happy terms we all want to remember it. Things were hard, people came back into hard times, and there was economic turmoil.This is a harsher Bogey than we've seen in other movies, but he plays his classic "anti-Hero" to the hilt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love Bogie, but I can't recommend this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the lesser films from the latter half of Humphrey Bogart's career, so I was a bit surprised that its current IMDb rating is a respectable 7.2. That's because although the movie has many good moments, the film itself is rather confusing as well AND blatant ripoff of one of Bogart's most successful films, THE MALTESE FALCON. Again and again throughout the film, the plot is taken from the other film but it becomes much worse at the end, as Bogey's conversation with the bad femme fatale, Lizbeth Scott, sounds almost identical to the one he'd had with Mary Astor at the end of THE MALTESE FALCON. Once I realized this parallel early on, it was very easy to predict what would happen and I was absolutely sure that both Lizbeth would tip her hand and prove to be pure evil AND Bogie would ultimately do what's right. Considering it's a vastly inferior re-tread, this film deserves to remain in obscurity. Despite a typically good Bogart performance, this one is at best mediocre.By the way, a few reviews of this film went so far as to say it was one of Bogart's best films. With such hyperbole, I truly wonder if some of the reviewers have even seen Bogart's best films! They have a lot of nerve or short-sightedness to say this ranks up there with HIGH SIERRA, TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, CASABLANCA, THE MALTESE FALCON, THE BIG SLEEP, THE CAINE MUTINY, SAHARA, THE ROARING TWENTIES, TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT, KEY LARGO, African QUEEN, DESPERATE HOURS, THE HARDER THEY FALL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its all artificial, every movie, every story. What we see and allow along these lines is a matter of negotiation between us and the artists.But sometimes what we see is so clearly an inferior copy of what has gone before, we just cannot accept it. No negotiation, no cajoling will push it past the line of what we can accept. The best it can do is recall earlier, happier experiences.What we have is here is an old mix. Its motivated by wartime-inspired honor. It uses Philip Marlowe-based language and detective situations. And it pretends to be noir according to how noir conflates liquid fate with love of a woman. But on each thread of this confused braid, its weak.There mere appearance of Bogart isn't enough. Actually, he made only a few fine movies and a few tolerable ones. There's the average Joe beset by unlikely circumstances which turn him into a detective. There's the girl who is so magnetic one can't help falling in love, but she's "trouble." There's the mobster who predictably manages his empire from a cinematically appealing "club." There are the inept policemen with whom everyone toys.You can make a genre film that is robust, that is not a cliché. Genres provide lubrication, shorthand that sets context and rules for the viewer as part of that aforementioned negotiation. On that skeleton, a talented filmmaker will construct a body for us to inhabit.This, this is a skeleton, a plastic skeleton.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Bogart film-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you may notice about this film is that the film print has not been well preserved...it is far from crisp. And, the production values do not appear to be high to begin with...such as when you see those tall mountain in Florida!!! But, this was a Columbia film, not Bogie's usual higher-budget Warner Brothers pic.The second thing you may notice about this film is something that with me always gains a film a few points -- it's something somewhat different than the usual plot. Oh, definitely film noir, but a different type of story.And, the basic story is this: Bogart and William Prince are returning to the States and about to be decorated for their war service. When Prince discovers that, he immediately disappears at a train station. Bogart, the loyal friend, decides to track him down and find out why. He ends up in the imaginary Gulf City, Florida (there is a Gulf City, but in reality it has a population of under 100 people). Prince has been there, but has disappeared again...only to be found burned to death in a car. As Bogart tracks things down further, he becomes entangled in a murder mystery from the past in which his friend was directly involved...as is a racketeer and the sultry Lizabeth Scott. Who is the guiltiest? The racketeer or Scott? Bogie finds out the hard way, and there are some neat twists along the way.Humphrey Bogart is fine here...the good guy, but not so good that he can't take care of himself...although he gets beat up along the way pretty well. It's a perfect role for Bogart. I've always enjoyed Lizabeth Scott, though I like her most in the Martin &amp; Lewis film "Scared Stiff". This was only her third film, but the second to put her into a sort of film-noir persona. She's good here, but not yet at her best. It's noted by many that her role here is reminiscent of Lauren Bacall, which it is, although I think this was the persona Scott had in most of her films, not an obvious attempt to imitate Bacall because it was a Bogart picture. Morris Carnovsky is good as the racketeer; he did not often have such important roles in films. We don't really see much of William Prince as Sgt. Johnny Drake/John Joseph Preston, but after all, he is killed off pretty quickly in the film. You will enjoy seeing Marvin Miller as the second tough guy; Miller was most famous for his role in the television series "The Millionaire". Wallace Ford is around for a small part as a safe-cracker.This is a good film and I enjoyed it...although not enough for it to end up on my DVD shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth watching by anyone with an interest in Bogart or film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was recently shown on British television as part of a late-night season of classic film noir, and I watched it because it stars Humphrey Bogart, that quintessential exponent of the noir style. It begins with Sergeant Johnny Drake returning from World War II as a triumphant hero, on his way to receive the Congressional Medal of Honour. This should have been the proudest day of his life, yet en route to Washington he jumps from the train and disappears. His old Army buddy Rip Murdock, who was on the train with him, is given the task of trying to trace him and find out the reason for his behaviour. Murdock traces his friend to his home town, Gulf City, where he learns that Drake has been killed in a suspicious car accident. (Gulf City is a fictitious place, although the name may have been suggested by an abandoned ghost town of that name near Tampa, Florida).Murdock finds out that Drake joined the Army under an assumed name, his real name being John Joseph Preston, in order to avoid a charge of murdering his lover's husband. Murdock soon finds himself falling for Johnny's lover, a sultry blonde named Coral Chandler. (Rather confusingly, Coral is also referred to by the nicknames "Dusty" and "Mike"). He also finds himself involved with Louis Ord, a witness in the murder trial, and Martinelli, a shady nightclub owner, who may also be involved in criminal activities.Although Murdock is not a professional private eye, he is charged with investigating a mystery, and he bears a strong resemblance to other Bogart characters such as Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, being hard-bitten and cynical and yet retaining a basic code of decency. Coral is a typical noir femme fatale. She is played by Lizabeth Scott, who was to become one of the great noir actresses, but who at the time was a young starlet appearing in only her third film; despite this she achieved equal billing with Bogart. Scott bore a certain resemblance and a similar husky voice to Lauren Bacall, which may have explained why she got the role (which was originally intended for Rita Hayworth). It has been suggested that Bacall herself was not cast because Bogart did not want his wife to play a woman as amoral as Coral.The tone of the film, in fact, is notably misogynistic. Coral is seductive and glamorous but basically morally worthless. The main force which drives Murdock is not his sexual attraction (it never really deserves the name of love) to her but his loyalty to his old Army friend. Given the rigidity of the Production Code in the forties, it is highly unlikely that there was any intention on the part of the film-makers to imply that their friendship was based upon homosexual feelings, but it seems clear that Johnny is more important to Murdock than any woman. Such intense but platonic friendships must have been common among ex-servicemen in the days following the war, which had ended only eighteen months before the film opened. "Dead reckoning" is a technique used in navigation, but the use of the phrase in the title here suggests that Murdock is seeking a "reckoning", in the sense of revenge, for his dead friend.The film has proved to be a controversial one on this board, with some reviewers hailing it as a neglected masterpiece and others condemning it as an inferior rip-off of "The Maltese Falcon" and "The Big Sleep", the film Bogart made immediately before this one. While it is by no means Bogart's greatest film, or even his greatest film noir, it is by no means negligible. It has a lot in common with some of his other films noirs from this period, not only "The Maltese Falcon" and "The Big Sleep" but also "Key Largo" and "In a Lonely Place". It shares with those films a complex plot (although less so than that of "The Big Sleep"), dramatic photography with strong contrasts of light and dark, a tone of cynicism and pessimism and a powerful sense of atmosphere (in this case the steamy heat of a summertime city on the Gulf Coast). That it shares these characteristics has more to do with the conventions of the genre than with any intention to commit a deliberate act of plagiarism. (Few people would regard "The Big Sleep" as a rip-off of "The Maltese Falcon", despite the similarities between them). "Dead Reckoning" is certainly worth watching by anyone with an interest in Bogart or film noir. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DEAD RECKONING is a silly and cheap . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . MALTESE FALCON wannabe, with Humphrey Bogart co-star Lizabeth Scott an equally silly and cheap Lauren Bacall knock-off. She's not even a Mary Astor, not meriting the hangman's noose (an anachronism in FALCON, as Sam Spade's California had moved on to gas already). Scott's "Coral" or "Dusty" or "Mike" or whomever is a sleaze from Detroit, a dive known as much for its muscle women (think Aretha Franklin or Madonna) as its muscle cars. An alluring magnet for brain-damaged guys, most viewers will care very little what happens to Coral. If you can imagine FALCON without the black bird, Astor, Peter Lorre, and Sidney Greenstreet, you still won't be picturing how wrong-headed DEAD RECKONING is. It's full of dead ends--a coded letter, a jumping padre, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner are all dropped like hot potatoes in favor of a soap opera love yarn that all but the most obtuse know will lead nowhere. DEAD RECKONING is not unlike a patchwork quilt hastily sewn together by a blind-folded gent with one hand tied behind his back who's never take home economics. Poor Bogie is left grasping at straws here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some Heavy-Handed, Anachronistic Traits keeps this from being a Top-Rung Film-Noir. The overuse of the Paratrooper Theme that becomes almost Cringe Inducing as the Movie moves along, and the usual Hard-Boiled Chandleresque Patter just never stops (there can be too much of a good thing).The Dark Atmosphere and even Darker Characters are Welcome and there is some Sharpness to the Proceedings although it does Weaken in the Romance Area at times and comes off as an Odd Coupling between Bogart and Lizabeth Scott. This is an Overwritten Story that has some good Lines, but a lot of it seems Artificial, going against the Noir Strength of Heightened Realism. This Entertaining Movie is too long and padded out to an, again, Unrealistic and Sappy Closing Line and Shot. But there is certainly enough here to make it worth a watch and is unarguably a Film-Noir, but finds its Flaws keeping it in the Midland of the Genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Middle rank film, top Bogart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Rip's (Humphrey Bogart) army pal Johnny does a runner from the train taking them to Washington, it's the start of a shadowy street search that Rip undertakes to find out why his friend would do that. It soon becomes evident that Johnny was not who he said was, something that makes Rip's journey one that will involve murder, deception and one hell of a dame.Dead Reckoning has a mixed relationship with critics and Bogart/noir fans alike. Some are harsh on Lizabeth Scott who plays femme fatale Coral Chandler, while others have issues with the plot, calling it rambling and incoherent to the dialogue on offer. I disagree with both those things. Scott is just fine for what is a wonderfully well written character, her facial characteristics are indeed expressionless at times, but this to my mind adds an icy veneer to her character arc. She also has a knack of looking vulnerable, something that is very crucial to the film and her character in particular. The plot doesn't ramble to me, it's bonkers, yes it is, but that adds to the mystery of it all. Told in flashback as Rip confesses to a priest, all threads are however neatly pulled together to finally reveal a delightfully complete, yet surprising noirish whole. Yeah it's a jumble of conundrums, and twists and turns come and go, that's kind of the selling point really. To me at least anyway. Whilst some of the dialogue on show is as cheeky as Bogie got to deliver in the 40s. I was laughing whilst duly expecting something bad to be at the end of it.There's an air of genre familiarity with the piece, no question about that. And if implausibility factors are an issue, you best stay away. But it has a nice line in atmosphere, brutality is never far away one feels, and it's a nice shoot with Leo Tover's cinematography understated and at ease with the tone of the film. Bogart is just great, this is what we want from the great man, spouting put downs and pearls of wisdom in a grim crime movie. However bonkers it may be. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enyojable Film Noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember John Cromwell's "Dead Reckoning" (1947) for two reasons. The first is that it was my first ever "Film Noir", a genre I now know and love (one of my favourite films of all time is "The Maltese Falcon"). The other is that it was my first film with Humphrey Bogart, an actor who I very much like, having seen him in such classics as "Casablanca". The film has your usual Film Noir traits: femme fatale, seedy night clubs, mobsters, flashback narrative, and paranoia. Also there is some nice black and white camera-work. Bogart is great, Lizabeth Scott is alright if I remember correctly (I haven't seen the film for a while), and most of the supporting cast do everything just right. The plot isn't very original, but it dose it job. A film that most people will like, and its a good introduction to the Film Noir genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the third time I saw the film and every time it's like a different movie. I thought it was a classic film noir but now I thought it was quite corny even though it was atmospheric. There's so much strange things going on. Bogart's character called the girl Mike and he said he loved his friend more than her. She was going on and on about marriage only to turn out to be an untrustworthy snake, She does look great in the end with perfect make-up on...Lizabeth Scott was very good playing the femme fatale role. There wasn't much depth to the part but she gave it some spark. She did look like a cocker-spaniel with that gorgeous hair she supposedly hadn't washed! She was really dressed to the nines with those Hollywood gowns. I forgot she wore a Bonnie Parker beret in one scene. I thought Lizabeth was more appealing than Bacall. I wonder what it would have been like if Bogie had starred with Veronica Lake in a movie...! Gold!!!! Even though it's not the best in it's genre I look forward to seeing it again in a few years!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decent if somewhat overrated film noir about a man investigating the death of his war hero friend. Humphrey Bogart and some good dialogue make it recommendable but it's not without its flaws. Other reviewers have pointed out the many similarities between this film's plot and the vastly superior Maltese Falcon. So many similarities the "rip-off" accusation is sure to fly around and, in this case, has some merit. Icy Lizabeth Scott is the weakest part of the film. Scott always seemed like a third-rate Lauren Bacall wannabe to me. Unlike Bacall however there's no chemistry between Scott and Bogart. I haven't seen a movie of Scott's yet where I enjoyed her performance. She's a weak actress with a dishwater personality and zero sex appeal. Also her somewhat masculine face and husky voice are off-putting to me and make it hard to enjoy her as a beautiful femme fatale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart 's war buddy, who was in love with Lizabeth Scott, is killed and he wants to know what happened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always return to the classic noirs, even if they are less than fully classic like "Dead Reckoning" but have some classic attributes and even if I do not write a review but merely record impressions. Films like "Dead Reckoning" (1947) are, after all, very well known. "Dead Reckoning", despite its flaws, is an extremely attractive film that draws us back magnetically.This film has gorgeous lighting, which suggests that cinematographer Leo Tover worked well with director John Cromwell. The lighting in numerous close shots complements the deep emotional involvements of the characters. This is a picture made for screen shots.The performances of the cast are first-rate, right down the line. Bogey is called upon to deliver a great deal of narration through a lengthy flashback told to a priest, James Bell. This involves no plot points, often taken to be a criticism. But we gain from it. What it does is heighten the subjectivity of the exposition from his point of view, allowing us to share his feelings, doubts, confusion and judgments, especially about Lizabeth Scott. He's navigating with a compass of reason and knowledge of his war buddy, William Prince, but it's a compass whose needle is being deflected by Scott, a woman of great attractiveness who flawlessly can assume a role of helpless femininity. Bogie faces two complementary heavies in the persons of smooth-talking night club owner and mobster Morris Carnovsky and the sadistic Marvin Miller. He gets a tangential assist from Wallace Ford while George Chandler goes in and fatally out of the story as a bartender with a coded letter written by Prince that was supposed to get to Bogey but has fallen into Carnovsky's hands. Ruby Dandridge plays yet another role as a maid. At one point she assists Bogey after Scott ties up policeman Charles Cane and locks him in a closet.The movie has minor faults that are bothersome to some viewers and critics. I find them easy to overlook. There is too much voice over, even if Bogey handles it so very well. Nothing comes of Bogey's relation with the priest. One song is quite flat. The disposition and result of Chandler's body in Carnovsky's garage is left hanging. There is dialog that is quite close to the Bogey-Astor interaction near the end of "The Maltese Falcon". In fact, the whole Bogey-Scott relationship has the same pervasive question mark hanging over it as in "The Maltese Falcon". The fear of fire of Marvin Miller and his demise is unexplained. We learn the story of who killed Scott's first husband, why, and Prince's mistaken view of it in a hurried torrent by Carnovsky under threat of gun and fire. One wonders how Scott and Carnovsky could have kept their marriage a secret, especially after the murder of her "husband". One wonders why they even stayed in Gulf City after getting his money.Yet, we return to this picture again and again and that says that none of the picture's minor faults undermine or cancel its strengths of story, acting, execution and attractiveness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It is good that it was a little while back that we saw this movie, for it gave me a little bit of time to think about it," Kristl said."You changed your opinion?" Henry said."Well, I changed my point of view. I changed how I look at it.""If I recall you said it was a Maltese Falcon rip off? So, it isn't any longer?""Well.. it still is, but on the other hand there is nothing against making a movie that is similar to another. On the face of it, many stories are similar. A lot of stories have a bad evil rising and a good guy fighting and defeating it. Many stories have the idea of a discovery, usually in the form of an adventure in which the protagonist undergoes an experience and changes at the end.""Uhm OK.""The problem with Dead Reckoning isn't that it is similar to the Maltese Falcon, but that it doesn't work very well. It lacks all the great things that the Maltese Falcon makes such a great movie. The relation between Bogart and Scott has no spark, while the one between Bogart and Astor does work. Then there are no interesting side persons such as Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. In the Maltese Falcon the Falcon ties the story together and greed is the driving force, in Dead Reckoning there is nothing.""It is a rather confused story.""It is?""As far as I got it, Bogey plays a Captain who follows the tracks of one of his subordinates and close friend Sergeant Drake. He discovers that he is killed in a fire. So what next?""Well.. Bogey the captain, goes to find out. He meets some guy who works in a club and who gives him a letter from Drake and then follows some muddle with a club owner who is a mob boss. The story meanders. And somewhere we got a situation that is almost similar to the Maltese Falcon: a game played between the cynical and hard boiled bogey and the 'femme fatale' Scott. It just falls flat and it is boring.""Okay.""You don't say much yourself.""Well, it is and old movie, but a bit boring. Like many of these old movies are, unless it's an adventure movie, like one with Errol Flynn. Like eh the Adventures of Robin Hood or adventures of Don Juan. Swashbuckling movies, with a charming hero. I just don't like these dark cynical movies. Light entertainment. Make life enjoyable." Henry gave Kristl a smile."Oh.. I sort of like them..""I gather that. Seems you tend to the dark side, my lady, while I tend to the light.""That sounds very Star Wars like.""Definitely.., it is.""Well?.Yoda...just sit the next ones out.. and then it is your turn.""Good.. it is."www.meritcoba.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She was a woman who refused to be pushed around.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best film noir always features a sultry femme fatal out to get what she wants from a brooding anti-hero, and in the case of this one, she is Lizabeth Scott, the blonde vixen with more than a passing resemblance to Lauren Bacall, the wife of the star here, Humphrey Bogart. At first glance from Scott's profile, you may think if you are unaware that it is Bacall, but that changes once she looks up. Her personality is quite different, too-more pouty, quietly scheming, and in the annals of film noir, much deadlier.Bogart is a parachute specialist on his way to Washington D.C. to get a bravery medal while his pal William Prince is to get the congressional medal of honor. But when the press wants a photo of Prince, he takes off, and very soon, Bogart is out looking for clues to why, even investigating the morgue when he learns shocking truths about his pal's past.This connects him to the widowed Scott, a former nightclub singer with a past connection to Prince, and an unforgettable night in a gambling joint where he gets information on his friend's connection to an old murder case. Waking up next to a stiff, getting beaten up by the thugs working for the gambling house boss (Morris Carnovsky) and romancing the sultry Scott gets him in deeper where he may never escape.While Bogart and Scott are certainly an attractive couple, it is hard to judge their chemistry based upon the whole Bogart/Bacall legend and Scott's similar looks. Bogart is one of the few older actors who looked right with younger actresses, and it doesn't come off as some cheap attempt at expanding an aging actor's ego. There are lots of pieces to this puzzle, and half the fun is sorting them out before it all comes together. While Bogart is an expert at playing characters of mystery, he adds to that here with his cynicism towards women. Scott's smile always makes you wonder what is behind the supposedly happy face as her eyes display elements of craftiness which in most of her film noir appearances are never discovered until it is too late. The ending of this film features some truly violent developments and the fade-out may leave you with chills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dead Reckoning (1947) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Mildly entertaining drama has Humphrey Bogart playing a Captain who goes searching for his buddy who ran off just days before he was suppose to receive the Medal of Honor. Bogart is able to track him down but it's too late because he's been murdered. Staying on to try and solve the case he runs into an ex-girlfriend (Lizabeth Scott) who might know more than she's telling. This film has a pretty good reputation among film-noir buffs but I was left rather bored by it. It's certainly not a bad film and in fact it's far from it but on the other hand it's not very good either. Needless to say we've got Bogart in a role he was born to play but this is certainly a far cry from The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep. The actor certainly turns in another stylish performance but he doesn't have too much to work with. Scott has become a cult figure over the past few years but I found her rather dull here and a poor imitation of Lauren Bacall. The thick voice and her ways of coming off sexual really reminded of Bogart's real-life wife but she just didn't cut it. Wallace Ford has a brief small role and does fine with it but the rest of the supporting cast are rather mediocre at best. I think the biggest problem is the direction by Cromwell, which doesn't bring much to the familiar drama. There's really no visual style here nor is there any real suspense built up. Everything seems to be moving in slow motion but I knew I was in trouble when I thought the movie had been playing for close to an hour but then noticed twenty-five minutes hadn't passed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric Film Noir Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shortly after leaving Warner Brothers at the end of the 1940's, Humphrey Bogart made a few interesting vehicles with Columbia Pictures. Mixed in with films such as "Tokyo Joe", "In A Lonely Place", and "The Harder They Fall" is the film noir effort, "Dead Reckoning". Based on the novel by John Cromwell, it tells the story of GI Rip Murdoch as he tries to avenge the death of his friend at the hands a local mobster named Martinelli (Morris Carnovsky), along the Gulf Coast.Lizabeth Scott, an absolutely brutal actress and a poor imitation of Lauren Bacall to say the least, plays the female lead and is the target of Bogies insults degrading women throughout the film. In one scene Bogie tells her, "I wish that women could be able to grow and shrink on command. When a man needs them for love we could make them full size and when we are done loving them we could shrink them back to pocket size". A little later Bogie patronizingly says to Scott as her eyes well up, "big girl, no tears". As she continues he turns to her and says, "get back in my pocket". Although I don't think it's meant to be, it's somewhat comical and shows the subservient manner in which women in that generation were portrayed.Oddly enough, the story begins at its mid-point with Bogie hiding out in a local church as he tells his story to a parish priest. After his confession, and the viewer comes up to date with why he's there, the film continues as he battles the bad guys to conclusion. This is one of my favorite Bogart movies as he basically carries the entire film on his shoulders from start to finish. There is also some interesting interplay between Bogie and the film's heavy, played by Morris Miller. While there are no great character actors to speak of and the only person evoking an empathy is the Bogie character, it's an interesting watch as the footage from the train sequences is neat as well as the visual imagery of the Gulf Coast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart is good, the rest is a collection of deja-vu feelings ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To Have and Have Not" was a déj?-vu of "Casablanca"? with a novelty though, and not the least, it had Lauren Bacall in her first starring role. And she didn't just steal Bogart's thunder; she stole his heart too, revealing herself to be the perfect match for Bogie, in every meaning of the word and both on the screen and in real-life. The genuinely growing chemistry between them during the film was enough to cement the film's legend."The Big Sleep" was a déj?-vu of "The Maltese Falcon" and while it didn't have its colorful supporting cast (no Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre or Mary Astor) it did delightfully on the female casting department. Besides, as a Rubik-cube of plot complexity with one double-crossing, two lies and three false tracks by inches of celluloid that it was, it still had Bacall all the way. As long as she and Bogart ended up embracing, it was worth its ticket's price, the pop-corn box ? and the little spot in Hollywood's firmament.Where am I going at with all these comparisons?"Dead Reckoning" suffers from the same déj?-vu syndrome but without any redeeming quality. It only exists on the basis that the stuff film-noir was made on already worked, that all it took was to place Bogart in his tough-guy routine and let him go through it. Well, as much as I admire Bogart, he never did without partners, lovers or fitting antagonists. Here, he carries the film alone, and while it's always a pleasure to watch him as his typical lone rider with a soft spot for a female outcast, there has to be something new we remember the film from. Take "Dark Passage" for instance, it had Bogart and Bacall, it was far from being a masterpiece, but it still had that Hitchcockian vibe sweating out of each frame, it had Agnes Moorehead and the memorable fact that Bogart's face isn't seen for two thirds of the movie. This is where "Dead Reckoning" fails, it has everything to satisfy its audience, except the most important one: something to remember the film for. Granted its contrived plot was easier to follow than "The Big Sleep" but the investigation didn't have that punch-and-guts dynamite style, these brief flirtatious moments (like that slutty sister or that nymphomaniac librarian), it didn't have a sidekick, some comic-relief to drown our bitterness on, it had only Bogart and Lizabeth Scott. But while we care for Bogart, we never really care for Lizabeth Scott, who seems like a poor man's Lauren Bacall. This is not to dismiss her talent or anything, she could pass as a fitting love interest to Bogie and I loved that beatnik fashion she was dressed in, in the last act, but there's an obviously intended physical resemblance to Babe, and it's so blatant it is distracting, you can't help but making comparisons : same blonde hair, same facial features, same husky voice although I hated her accent which made her sound like Kaa the Python. Sssssseeee what I mean? And the director John Cromwell didn't pull much effort to let her exist on another basis than being a Lauren Bacall's second choice.Take the 1950 film, "In a Lonely Place", there was something that Gloria Grahame brought to the screen that only belonged to her, not even to Bacall, she had that dignified look but average beauty, that sadness and melancholy graved in her face, that lack of glamor and superficiality that could make her fall in love with a loner like Dixon Steele. But in "Dead Reckoning", Scott never quite makes it as a potential love interest for Bogie, because she's never given the choice. When she's not Bacall, she becomes Mary Astor-like villain inspiring a "you're good" rip-off (among many other stolen lines) but the tears in her eyes are as artificial as that goddamn rain scene at the end of the confession.Speaking of it, what was the point of even making it a confession when the listener, a priest has nothing else to do than watching the hero disappear before raindrops start falling as if sky was urinating (the lousy effect of a garden hose) Nothing really makes senses from the beginning. Bogart investigates over his army-buddy's disappearance, but is the paratrooper or the taxi-cab owner who does it, in both cases, where did he achieve his Private-eye skills, why not making it a PI movie from the beginning? Never mind, Bogart is good, even very good, but is that enough when the supporting cast doesn't hold a candle to the heavyweights I mentioned, not even Elisha Cook Jr.Morris Carnovsky as the mastermind Martinelli and Marvin Miller as Krause, deliver remarkable performances and it would be unfair to blame them, but I couldn't buy baby-faced Krause as a thug with sociopath impulses, if one thing, it was Bogart who seemed to bully him and we're almost glad when he gets it and Martinelli was just severely underused. But that wasn't even the problem; it's just that the casting didn't help elevating the movie higher than its timid level of entertainment. And I know there's something wrong in the film when I start talking about other movies, and seems like I broke a new record with this one.Well, to conclude on a positive note, at least, there is Bogie, and he's good, but the rest is just an ersatz of all his previous films without something new to hang our hopes on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quintessential film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogey is in top form, and Lizbeth Scott matches him measure for measure in this quintessential film noir. I have somewhat mixed feelings about writing this rave, because this is one of the more misogynistic movies of all time, but it is so terrific I have to put politics aside. The pacing and direction is taut, every little touch is perfect. And it packs an emotional wallop. Great use of shading throughout. If you like film noir at all, this is a must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing, if somewhat confusing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A well-made mystery/film noir. Bogart is in top form, Scott is as glamorous as any given femme fatale of the period, and Carnovsky is smooth as the well-spoken villain. The direction is no more than workmanlike, but the dialogue is superior throughout. My favorite line: "Maybe she was all right...and maybe Christmas comes in July, but I doubt it!" (***)</fullReview>
