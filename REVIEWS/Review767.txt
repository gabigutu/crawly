		<shortDescription>Hilarious take on traditional action/comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Key and Peele have established themselves with their show as two of the leaders of small screen comedy. Their brand of comedy pokes fun at stereotypes and generic film tropes, with heavy influences from the cinema world. Their skits are often cinematic and ridiculous, but in the best kinds of way. Now, they carry that over to an actual movie and the results are often times hilarious. While not always successful, when they are, Keanu is laugh out loud funny. With huge influences from traditional cinema, ranging from romantic comedy to 80's action, Keanu covers a range of genres, providing that same ridiculous kind of comedy fans are used to.The film kicks off with a bang, delivering a stylish opening action scene that introduces us to the titular Keanu, a cute-beyond-words kitten that you immediately fall in love with. We're then introduced to our dynamic duo, Rell, a man-child lacking direction in his life who has recently lost his girlfriend, and Clarence, the straight arrow of the two who is happily married, but is so caught up in trying to please everyone else, he never takes time for himself. Once Keanu enters the picture, the two find themselves spiraling downward into a world of gang warfare, crime, and mistaken identity, all in pursuit of retrieving the adorable little Keanu.If you've seen Key &amp; Peele, the humor here will feel familiar. Working under the show's director, Peter Atencio, and with Peele in the writer's seat, all have a firm grasp of how to craft cinema and then skewer it. Both characters constantly feel out of place while at the same time handling themselves well, and much of the comedy comes from both the familiar fish out of water story and some surprises. What helps is that the film never really feels forced. Our heroes never feel too unnatural in their actions, though it is slightly mystifying that they are continuously believed to be tougher than they actually are. The action is well done too, with it feeling like it wouldn't be out of place in an action movie. And Keanu replacing what would be a person in distress makes for a hilarious spoof on traditional damsel- in-distress type tropes. Our villains also fare well, with one particular hilarious scene seeing Clarence bond with other gangsters over George Michael music. As stated above, not every joke works, with several falling flat or getting little more than a chuckle, but more often than not the movie knows when to end a joke or just what to do to surprise or make the audience laugh. It also helps to know movies well to catch several of the references or tropes. Where the film could have made many missteps, it makes wise decisions in terms of balancing comedy, action, and drama and knows when it's comedy may be going too far and for too long. I often wondered if Key and Peele would take their comedy to the film world, as they have always clearly loved movies, and now that they've finally done so, they have delivered. Not a perfect comedy, but a very funny one and shows that the two have promise for a future in the cinema world. It's my hope that Keanu is just the beginning for these two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly Stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who hasn't been waiting for Key and Peele to put out a movie together? 'Key and Peele' was one of the best sketch comedy shows of recent memory. Their dynamic on screen is always must watch television and so we were all waiting to see how it would translate to the big screen. For the most part, Keanu works. It does a good job of incorporating the same humor from their show into the film. I just wish they pushed it even further. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, but the plot of Keanu falls back into clichéd territory far too often.It's largely a spoof of action films in the same vein as the avidly popular Jump Street films. Instead of going undercover to take down drug dealers, the duo played by Key and Peele, pretend they are drug dealers to win back the kitten that was taken from them. But besides that, the plot unravels exactly as you would expect. You could make the argument that it's not even necessarily a full on spoof, especially with its attempt at drama quite a few times throughout the film.With that said, when the laughs hit, they hit hard. There's something about the quick witted banter between Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele that it becomes addicting to watch after a while. I just feel they could have taken it a step further. The runtime feels a little long in the tooth too, especially towards the climax.The supporting cast is okay, with a few surprises here and there, but the real hero here is Keanu the kitten. It isn't named Keanu by accident, and I enjoyed how they played off his name throughout the film. But don't go in expecting Keanu to be the center focus. The kitten only gets like 25 minutes of screen time, but it isn't wasted.Overall, Keanu features the incredible duo of Key and Peele and fans of the sketch show will no doubt walk away loving this, but there was still some untapped areas to be tackled. Whether it's a sequel to Keanu, a return to TV, or a completely fresh idea, I'm down to watch anything these guys do.+Incredible duo+Brilliantly stupid premise-But it ends up feeling cliché and uninspired-Uneven6.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comedy Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the best comedies that I have seen in some time; that isn't to say you will fall out of your seat laughing - but the laughter was consistent from beginning to end, and that is pretty much the only thing that matters to me when I decide to go see a comedy. Seeing how this movie was a clear reference to Keanu Reeves "John Wick", at least as far as the marketing is concerned, I thought the movie would be more of a direct spoof of that movie; but it wasn't - it was more so just a general action comedy and I wouldn't even go so far as to call it a "spoof" movie even though they were certainly playing off well known action tropes. My bottom line: Is this movie worth shelling out the $ to go see in the theater, in my opinion, yes it is. Get some friends and go have some good laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Key and Peele. Their show was my whole existence and I still go around doing the "I said biiiitch" skit everywhere I go. So with this, I was expecting a good bit of laughs to come of 'Keanu' but I was left a little disappointed. 'Keanu' was not a total fail, it had its moments, in my opinion, but to me it felt like an overly drawn out K&amp;P skit on their show. Mostly a third season skit at that. Key and Peele themselves were naturally hilarious as usual. Their deliverance is perfect it was just the material was beaten to death to me. Overall, not terrible but not great. Just an average comedy from excellent comedians.... The cat was cute though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute cat but not much more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it is always difficult to combine excessive violence and comedy and come out with something that works. Here is another example of why it doesn't work. There is nothing funny about murders and gangs shooting it out. The cat who never grows past being a kitten is the highlight of the movie. It is watchable when there is a cute cat on screen. Most of the other stuff you have seen before. There's the club, the drugs and the salty redundant language.There is no need to pay to see this in a theater. It will play just as mediocre on a home platform. A cat might have nine lives. Unless you have time to spare, no need to waste it on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far From Purrr-fect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy is subjective. Trying to explain why something does or doesn't make you laugh is like trying to explain why you think certain foods are delicious; how do you make someone experience your experience? For example, the sketch show "Key &amp; Peele", while often a smart satire on race and sex, was simply and inexplicably hilarious to me. On the other hand, Keanu, a film created and starring the same dudes, has (arguably) nowhere near the laughs. Despite some all-in comedic performances from two of the most talented guys around, it simply isn't very funny. Through a series of unfortunate events, two mild-mannered men go looking for a kitten and find themselves in the midst of a war between competing drug gangs. Key and Peele display the same comedy-in-sync-ness they became famous for, and they deserve a vehicle much better than this to display their skill. Unfortunately the movie itself never quite finds its balance. It's an absurdist comedy that feels both too absurd and not absurd enough. The plot is shoddy at best, and the shallow levels of character give way to whatever joke seems to be funniest at that moment. None of that would matter, of course, if I just found the movie more consistently funny. Not that it's devoid LOL moments; Key and Peele both have a knack for putting a twist on a line or a facial expression to give it an added layer of wit (i.e. how they act when they think they're about to be killed). Unfortunately, they have created such anticipation through years of brilliant TV work, anything less than wall-to-wall guffaws can be a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend recommended this movie to me. I'd seen a few Key and Peele skits (some were funny, some not so much), so I thought I might as well try it.It wasn't bad, but not great either. The best way I can think of to describe it is "Meh." Some of the jokes were funny, but others fell flat. I often found myself laughing out of pity rather than at the scene itself. My sister described watching it as "second-hand embarrassment," which I think is accurate. It was almost painful to watch.I feel bad giving such a low rating, but I just couldn't find much to like. The cat was cute, but it didn't salvage the film. The plot was decent but choppy. I think maybe if I was more of a fan of Key and Peele, I'd have liked this better? I don't know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Keanu' is one of those movies that you watch the trailer for and think,"That could either be really good or really bad". Unfortunately for anyone that is a fan of Key &amp; Peele (as I am) you will sorely disappointed. I envy those that can watch a copy and paste movie and still find it as entertaining as the last movie that did that. Because I can't get sucked into a film that doesn't do anything new. And 'Keanu' doesn't do anything new at all. In fact it shameless rips tons of different movies off. Being a comedy, I expected this to happen here, but I also expected it to rip things off in a clever way. Never in the film did I get the impression that they were parodying any of thisThe most heinous, shameless rip off is it's plot line. Which was basically just a reskinned, less entertaining version of '21 Jump Street'. The story is literally about two guys that infiltrate a gang to find something or someone. Right off the bat it's clear they don't belong in this world but they do enough dumb things to gain the gangs respect.After getting in good they realize that they may be in too deep. There is even a scene where one or more of the main characters gets super high and hallucinates. Exactly like the Jump Street movies. The only difference here is that it is not done in clever or funny way.Most of the film is like this. Shamelessly ripping off other, better movies. The worst part is it neither acknowledges or makes fun of the way that it's doing this. It acts like everything it's doing is completely original and hopes that you won't notice. Not mention that most of the things that happen don't even matter to the plot at all. Nearly half of the film is filled with scenes that do absolutely nothing to further the plot. It stops the movie, tells a couple bad jokes, and gets back to things. Yet, it doesn't do it that quickly. There is one scene in particular where they are in a mansion with Anna Faris that drags on for way to long. It goes on for ten or fifteen minutes telling the same jokes on loop over and over."Oh, this isn't gangster man. Wtf". "You guys aren't real gangsters if you don't listen to this." And queue laugh track. (spoiler) As if the film isn't standard enough it even has the whole, one main character is actually a cop twist ending. By that point I was no longer laughing with the movie, I was laughing at the movie. And at all the incredibly dumb things it did.I kid you not there is a scene where a wife calls her husband and says that a trusted friend tried something bad to her. Naturally he wants to know what it was but she inexplicably hangs up before she tells him. Then she gets back to him and he just knocks the guy out. Like, I thought that was a friend. Plus, you don't even know what he did. No one on earth would do what you just did. Why did this happen?It, like many other parts of this movie, seemed to be thrown in just to get a laugh. The writers didn't think about logic or reason but instead opted for a cheap chuckle. The entire film was filled with moments that were so bad but easy to fix. It was clear that the writers didn't care about making a good movie and instead simply wanted to pump this out. Nothing made any sense and no one bothered asking about it.However, I will say that Key &amp; Peele continue to have great chemistry. They gave very committed performances and were one of very few saving graces. The only other one would be the absurd story. The plot is very tired, boring, and predictable but it's story concept is just absurd enough to work. It was fairly fun to see every single person want this random cat. And it made the odd motivations a little easier to forgive. That being said, I would not recommend this film. It's overlong, dull, flat, predictable, and remarkably unfunny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Assassins (Jordan Peele, Keegan-Michael Key) shoot up a drug factory. A kitty escapes. Rell Williams (Jordan Peele) is depressed after getting dumped by his girlfriend. He is lifted up by finding the kitty on his doorstep and he names her Keanu. His cousin and best friend Clarence Goobril (Keegan-Michael Key) needs to man up for his wife Hannah (Nia Long). Rell's home is ransacked and Keanu goes missing. Small time dealer Hulka (Will Forte) points the finger at a local gang. The guys take on gangster persona "Tectonic" and "Shark Tank". They meet Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish) and leader Cheddar (Method Man) who mistakes them for the assassins Allentown Boys.Firstly, the kitty is really cute. The guys have great chemistry. The ridiculous premise is set up for outrageous humor. There are some cute laughs at times but it doesn't stay at a high enough level. It's funny skit material but it doesn't fill out. It's a little thin. The movie tries to add a couple of comedic performances from Will Forte and Anna Faris. They only really hit singles rather than home runs. The movie needs to be more ridiculous. It needs to take on the gangsta genre in a deeper way. The guys are capable of more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KeanuCats make better buglers than dogs because they don't stop to sniff the night watchman's crotch.Unfortunately, the feline in this comedy is messed up in harder crimes.Recently dumped Rell (Jordan Peele) and his unhappily married friend Clarence (Keegan- Michael Key) receive unconditional love from Keanu, a kitten that randomly showed up on Rell's doorstep.Unbeknownst to them, Keanu belongs to two assassin brothers who desperately want him back. Rell and Clarence unknowingly impersonate the cutthroats to liberate Keanu from the drug dealer (Method Man) who stole him from them.While the absurd plot line lends well to the comedy duo of Key &amp; Peele, surprisingly neither brings their usual genius to this action-y buddy-comedy. Not to say it doesn't have its moments, just that it doesn't have as many as their television sketch show work.Incidentally, a crime boss is more apt to have a gamecock as their house pet.

		<shortDescription>Watch That Crazy Kitten Run!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw director Peter Atencio's hilarious, cat-in-the-hood, action-comedy "Keanu," I'd never heard of Comedy Central comedians Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key. I watch movies more often than cable so they were entirely new to me. As it turns out, I thought Peele and Key were such side-splitters that I'll have to check out their Comedy Central episodes. Comparably, they reminded me of buffoons like Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. Keegan-Michael Key channels Will Ferrell, while Jordan Peele is reminiscent of John C. Reilly. Hopefully, if "Keanu" scores adequately at the box office, we'll see more of these two. Not only do these jokers radiate charisma galore, but also they aren't obnoxious comics. Typically, the geeky Peele and Key routines shun bowel humor. Essentially, as an above-average comedy, "Keanu" mirrors their kind of offbeat humor. Geographically, "Keanu" is set in Los Angeles, but it imitates the Gotham lensed Wesley Sniper's crime thriller "New Jack City." If you relish "New Jack City" violence, "Keanu" provides a high body count, especially during the massacre scene, which alone justifies the film's R-rating. Basically, Peele and Key are two geeks caught in the crossfire of rival drug-lords in a vicious mob war. Very much a comedy of errors, "Keanu" focuses on a footloose kitten. This adorable brown tabby dashes evasively through this bullet-riddled gangsta saga and ties everything together while it propels the plot forward. This Warner Brothers release chronicles the efforts of two cat-friendly geeks to retrieve the eponymous kitten from some violent Hispanic and African-American gangstas. Mind you, I'm a sucker for any movie with a cat in it so I enjoyed this nonsense. Incidentally, seven kittens stood in for the titular Keanu. For the record, the filmmakers used rescued cats from the pound for the seven.Initially, Keanu is a kitten called 'Iglesias.' A notorious Mexican cartel chieftain, King Diaz (Ian Casselberry of "Triple 9"), owns the frisky little fellow. He amuses himself at work with his playful pussycat. Two hardcore assassins interrupt his reverie. They look like a combination of actor Danny Trejo and a voodoo witch doctor. Known by their lethal reputation as the 'Allentown Boys,' Oil and Smoke Dresden are gruesome gunmen who kill without a qualm. They launch a surprise attack on Diaz's drug manufacturing facility. (Incidentally, Peele and Key doubled up to play not only these villains but also the two protagonists Rell and Clarence.) The opening massacre scene resembled one of John Woo's outlandish Hong Kong thrillers, along the lines of either "The Killer" or "Hard-Boiled." These dastardly daredevils, who perform back-flips while they are blazing away with their pistols, wipe out everybody in the facility, including King after he surrenders to them. Before they eviscerate King with a knife, Oil and Smoke spot Iglesias and admire the cuddly kitten. Suddenly, the LAPD bursts in with guns drawn, and Dresdens flee. Little Iglesias flees, too. Taking it on the lam, Iglesias traipses around Los Angeles. Eventually, the hungry little critter winds up at Rell Williams' door.Rell (Jordan Peele) is devastated because his girlfriend has dumped him. He has been smoking large quantities of pot in a bong to alleviate his anxiety. Rell's married cousin Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key) swings by Rell's house and tries to console his distraught cousin. Between the time Clarence phones Rell and then finally sees him, something magical has happened to Rell. Before Clarence arrives, Rell hears somebody at his front door. When he opens it, he finds an adorable kitten mewing on his doorstep. Christening Iglesias as 'Keanu,' Rell becomes hopelessly attached to the tiny tabby. Similarly, Clarence finds Keanu captivating, too. Later, in a secondary subplot, Clarence's wife Hannah (Nia Long of "Friday") leaves Clarence for the weekend off. Hannah cruises out of town with their mutual friend Spencer (Rob Huebel of "Little Fockers") on a weekend outing with Spencer's daughter as well as her own daughter. Spencer lies to Clarence that his own wife is sick from food poisoning and cannot join them. Clearly, the adulterous Hannah is cheating on poor Clarence.Clarence accompanies Rell to a movie that weekend. When they return to Rell's house, they find the premises trashed. Worse, Keanu is missing! Hulka (Will Forte of TV's "The Last Man on Earth"), an amiable drug dealer who sells Rell pot, lives across the driveway from him. Rell grilles Hulka about the burglary. Our geeky heroes learn that the infamous 17th Street Blips smashed down his door and took Keanu. The Blips are ferocious gangbangers that have been cast out by both the Bloods and the Crips. Our geeky protagonists mislead these heinous hoodlums that they are the Allentown Boys, but they use aliases. Rell nicknames himself Tectonic, while Clarence adopts the moniker Shark Tank. They palaver with the gunslinging Blips chieftain Cheddar, (Method Man of "How High"), but Cheddar refuses to sell them Keanu. Cheddar calls Iglesias/Keanu by another name 'New Jack' and has him decked out in a do-rag. Rell insists Cheddar sell Keanu. Cheddar changes his mind on the condition that Tectonic and Shark Tank shadow his people on a drug deal. Cheddar promises to hand Keanu over to them as a gesture of respect if everything works out. Predictably, all hell breaks loose with our heroes struggling to avoid getting shot and recovering Keanu alive. No, Keanu doesn't die during all the gunfights and brawls.Ultimately, "Keanu" concerns more than just an itinerant cat. When director Atencio and scenarists Jordan Peele and Alex Rubens aren't plotting the feline's next foray, they skewer the clichés and stereotypes of African-American crime movies. Like the violence that punctuates it, "Keanu" bristles with profanity, particularly the slang version of the N-word. Before fadeout, several more hostile encounters occur, but our heroes triumph over these obstacles. Mind you, they don't get off scot-free. Peele and Key's misadventures evoke memories of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby movies. Suffice to say everything ends on a positive note for our protagonists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What has been achieved here is almost illogical. A couple of what some people would call rather bland characters are going through personal crisis of their own. One day, Keanu, the most charming kitten ever put on a movie, makes an appearance, only to be "catnapped" a few days later but not before he has left graphic proof that he is one most charismatic and photogenic four-legged creatures out there. It becomes apparent that we need to have a striking animal to portray Keanu, or any of his various incarnations. He has vivid, beautiful eyes, and he appears to hit every mark exactly. Our couple of heroes are promptly surrounded by some very nefarious criminals, people who wouldn't think twice before coming up with some nasty resolutions to solve their problems. One of them has fallen for Keanu's charms, and we see how Keanu is properly attired to fit in his new surroundings. Deals are made, things get more and more complicated, with people being quickly eliminated when they pose a problem or become annoying because these bad guys have a very short fuse and jumpy nerves.Although most of the action is average and predictable, what one enjoys the most is the silliness of the whole thing as our couple of naive characters are soon seduced by their newly found popularity and fame. Here we are some average people attracted to the world of the bad guys, sometimes realizing every action has a consequence, especially as the number of murder keeps going up.There's a great scene in the middle as one couple of criminals goes into an affluent client's home and is soon involved in a very strange series of games, with Anna Farris doing a great and absurd take on the ultimate crazy millionaire. If this is odd, the induction into the music of George Michael doesn't get any weirder and hilarious. This is what classic comedy is made off, to have the wonders of writing and cinema take you into fresh and unexpected places.Come in and follow the adventures of a really cute kitten, something that will somehow soften the impact of what otherwise could have a rather pedestrian and a bit intense excursion into a dark and violent world.</fullReview>

The two comedians are a amusing as a pair of bored, bland suburbanites who's lives are turned upside down when a former drug lord's kitten wanders into the life of a recently heartbroken Rell (played by Peele). They get deeper and deeper into a major crap fest by pretending to be major players in a notoriously vicious drug gang, all to get Keanu the kitten back. It's absurd but there are plenty of laugh out loud moments of stupidity and great, second banana support from Method Man (as a scenery chewing rival gangster) and Will Forte as Rell's space cadet weed supplier. If you don't go to this movie expecting some Oscar nominated job like Schindler's List but instead go for some silly, buddies-getting-into-major-crap-and-it-only- gets-worse-from-there flick, then give this film a shot; it is entertaining.</fullReview>

However once the cat runs away it is up to Rell and his best friend Clarence(Keegan-Michael Key) to get him back. In the story they go to strip clubs meet with a gang were they pretend to be gangsters to get back there cat. The way the story is done is quite a lot of silly and fun humor as well, and it is quite enjoyable on its own. The jokes hit usually and it just a overall and fun story I would recommend Overall it is a lot of fun to see and it is defiantly something I would recommend as it is sooo much fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keanu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fans of the TV series Key &amp; Peele (like me) are familiarized with the irreverent and incisive humor from comedians Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, whose ingenious sketches satirize popular culture, the contradictions of North American society and the ethnic stereotypes which political correction prefers to ignore. I expected to find the same creative recipe in Keanu (the first film with Key and Peele in leading roles), and to some point, that was what I obtained... but rounded by an "action comedy" structure which doesn't always harmoniously adapt to the style from these comedians. Nevertheless, I smiled with quite a frequency and I even laughed out loud during certain moments of Keanu, even though I would have preferred them to be more frequent. The humor which works the best in this film is the one coming from the interaction between Key and Peele, whose genuine friendship in real life is translated into a natural and amusing chemistry on the screen. As a good comic team, each one of them is supported on the other one's talents in order to laugh at as many social, political and cultural clichés as possible. If the whole movie had only consisted on their characters talking while driving through the city in search of a cat, I would have been left satisfied. But Hollywood rules dictate the necessity of a conflict, and that's where the "gangsta" gang mixes the main characters up with two killers comes in. The humor keeps a good level during those scenes, but they don't particularly enrich the story; they are just arbitrary pieces of a puzzle which never finds the correct position. So, Keanu works better as a comic routine from Key and Peele than as a film, and I can give it a moderate recommendation because both comedians fully display their talent. Having said that, I have to mention that the humor is something very subjective, and I can't guarantee the fact that the adventures from Key and Peele won't have the same effect for everyone. But the fans of the frank and provocative humor from Louis CK, Chris Rock and Aziz Ansari will probably enjoy Keanu, even though for the comedy more than the action. And the fans of cats finally have a film which challenges the hegemony of dogs in Hollywood. But, don't worry... the dogs will be back.</fullReview>

If you're unfamiliar with their show, it's similar to Saturday Night Live but with less cast, a bit less improv and slapstick but much more indulgence in socioracial satire. If you have a low tolerance for slang and slurs, parody or sheer silliness then keep right on moving. If you liked the type of humor and content in 'Don't Be a Menace...', 'Scary Movie', 'Soul Plane', 'Friday', 'Next Day Air', 'How High', 'Anchorman' or 'Malibu's Most Wanted' then you'll enjoy 'Keanu' at least enough to make viewing it worthwhile. I was fully expecting a highly satisfying viewer experience given all this prior knowledge, and the bonus inclusion of a cute kitten had me thinking "holy balls!". I wondered how could anything go wrong.It failed to meet my elevated expectations, though it did not fall flat. It at least ranks somewhere within the top 7 of the 12 comedies I've seen so far this year. The movie was awash with opportunities for jokes and humor of all sorts, although the director -or whomever- simply picked out one and kept elaborating on it, not offering us much fresh. A point had to be whipped like a dead horse: That our two protagonists are so subdued and contrary to street culture, that they're hopeless against their "thug life" enemies and surroundings. Humor pointed elsewhere was in short supply, cheapening what could have become a comedy classic. This made for a very long culture clash joke punctuated with funny kitty moments, a repetitive George Micheal tribute, some good action sequences, and an uninsightful mind trip.The typically hilarious Anna Faris appears for a scene as portraying herself (sort of), but that only supplied a giggle. It was hard to tell whether she was bored or simply wasn't given very good material. The scenes with Method Man (Cheddar) and the kitten (Keanu) were a pleasure to see, they look like movie-poster gold. The kitten is actually used to reference dozens of iconic films, and a few of Keanu Reeves' most memorable. This is often done without any subtlety, but adds fun especially for cinemaphiles. I wouldn't hesitate to watch this one again, but I'm not rushing out to add it to my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining film with some enjoyable performances, but most of the jokes don't land and the plot is very generic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Keanu', Key and Peele's feature film debut, focuses on a couple of guys who pose as gang members in order to retrieve a stolen cat. The premise isn't all that interesting, but the main draw of the flick is the two leads. Their comedy central sketch show was hilarious at times, though it too was uneven. This movie suffers from being too complex for its own good, coming across as a fantastic short sketch dragged out to become just an alright feature film. It is funny at times and always remains enjoyable, I was kept entertained for the majority of the run- time. The plot simply can't withstand the pressure of the run-time, with film structure seeming to only get in the way of the comedy. There's the arbitrary act breaks and action set-pieces, which feel more like obligations than extensions of the premise. Simultaneously, it is also quite compact and doesn't go the places I thought it would. It plays it safe for the most part, though there is some racial based humour, and falls flat sometimes because of it. The movie tells its story whilst dealing out the comedy in fairly large but contained doses. It doesn't feel too improvisational or too written, with the humour fitting the scene it's in. Its nice that the flick is lead by the plot rather than the jokes, as it makes for a more refined and consistent journey. The plot isn't great though, meandering a little in places and featuring a few unbelievable - and almost unnecessary - set-pieces that use way too much slow-motion. On the whole, the script is good with a tangible sense of heightened reality. The banter between the two protagonists works well, feeling genuine if a little stereotypical. For me, most jokes didn't hit and the ones that did only garnered a grin or chuckle; there's no belly laughs here.Keegan Michael Key and Jordan Peele are pretty good in the lead roles, the latter even co-penned the script, but they ultimately play characters we've seen before in their sketches. It works for the most part and because they are comfortable with their parts they are both likable and instantly relatable. But it is when the pair slip into their 'alter-egos' to blend in with the gang that things become a little annoying, especially after a while. I found Key's character in particular rather grating - with his exaggerated cadence, accent, excessive use of profanity and lowered (by an octave, I think) voice culminating in an irritating act that's only tolerable in small doses. Unfortunately, these false personas perforate the majority of the picture. The other actors are good in their roles, though all of them are generic and generally quite uninspired. There's a little development here, but none of the gang members have an arc and the wife is barely on-screen. The titular kitten is cute and well trained, being extremely feeble yet surprisingly durable. However, the kitten seems to have some hypnotic powers as characters are constantly making questionable decisions just to get their hands on him. I get it is a cute cat and people like cats, but some of these hardened gangstas are dropping their tough personas and risking lives. It didn't make a lot of sense to me. The film is rather contrived with a few odd coincidences, as well as some forced revelations that don't feel earned. The tone is consistent and the pace taught, with little fat that could be trimmed. I liked that it didn't waste too much time, knew what it was and didn't pretend to be profound or anything other than silly popcorn entertainment. The direction is competent but nothing special, with the cinematography and editing being clean and easy-to-read.Overall, the film is entertaining throughout with some enjoyable performances and a couple of funny segments but most of the jokes don't hit and the lead gangsta personas were tiresome. It was well made but generic and, ultimately, pretty forgettable: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bye-bye Sandler and other's from the past, new guys are in town!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am really glad that there are still comedians representing some quality humour today. The Key &amp; Peele duo are really some unique entertainment for the audience nowadays. Their sketches and funny scenes are always giving some critics about something, that are known from the mainstream media with perfect sense of solid parody and satire. Sometimes in the past Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey and others from Living Colour and SNL maintained the pop-corn entertainment for the audience for more than a decade, but as the ol' same ol' executions appeared on the screen the comedy scene on the territory of pop corn movies lacked quality and always just came with gold-digging agendas. Also, other parties like Seth Rogen's struggling to make different style of comedies with slapstick humors and literally dope stories for more easier entertainment.But Key &amp; Peele represents something that for example Kevin Smith's Clerks did back in a day due to their Social satire and criticism with sometimes harsh manor However with this duo this is more lighthearted and digestible for easier enjoyment. The movie Keanu is something that is not serious at all, it makes fun of some of the most knowable types of genres movies are made in for really long time in Hollywood with really solid cast, writing and directorial work and oh my god an adorable cat. It's fun ride following several moments of great laughs and enjoyment from the bottom to the top. I'd definitely watch similar movies like this despite of Adam Sandler's and Seth Rogen's dump they produce like every darn year.Long Story Short: Key &amp; Peele for the win!It's easily a 7/10 but it can shape up for 8 by me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Keanu!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Key and Peele's first foray into the world of feature films is everything you'd expect from two such talented comedians and individuals.The style and type of humour that we are so accustomed to from them is not compromised by chasing a possible bigger audience, this is without doubt a 15 rated film.So the film in question focuses upon characters called Rell and Clarence, played by Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele respectively, two rather middle class individuals at different stages in their respective lives, Clarence is married but possibly facing a midlife crisis whereas Rell has just been dumped by his girlfriend and nothing it would seem could make him get out of this slump, but then literally the cutest kitten turns up at his door and he instantly finds a connection and calls him Keanu.What then proceeds is a series of bizarre events revolving around the theft of the new arrival Keanu by a local gang of drug dealers whom Rell and Clarence then have to channel their inner gangster to infiltrate their organization in order to get Keanu back safe and sound.Yes it is as bizarre as it sounds but it is only the better for it, it does have all the familiarity of a classic Key and Peele sketch only stretched out to a feature length idea, so therefore there is a little bit of flabbiness when it come to the tightness of the storytelling and to a probably more obvious degree the feeling of a lot of different funny sketches thrown together, it certainly is too long, ten minutes at least could of been knocked off the running time and the film would only have been better for it making it leaner and slicker as a whole.But the more pertinent question however is simply 'is it funny' and the answer is most certainly 'hell yes' I probably haven't laughed this consistently throughout a comedy this year, this is obviously mainly in part down to the brilliant chemistry that Key and Peele have as an on screen presence that is different from the vast majority of comedians currently presiding in the U.S. entertainment industry, they certainly give a different comedic perspective on social situations, even if it comes with a high level of bizarre also attached.The support is pretty good as well, principally the white weed dealing neighbour of Rell played by The Last Man on Earth himself, Will Forte, there's also a nice piece of casting for the gang leader of The Blips with Method Man putting in a very funny turn which adds nods to his appearances in The Wire, even the fellow members of the gang get funny moments with one particular memorable moment being a George Michael singalong.The action and violence is quite brutal at times but that is an angle that gives it an edge and so I suppose it comes down to how sensitive you are to the suggestion of violence on some level being funny in how you take the tone it presents you with, I personally went with it so to say and went with that dark humour.So as I said some editing could have been made to make the film a bit slicker and effective on the plotting so therefore running time but overall I thought it was consistently funny, some may say it's a one joke film and although I could see that point of view I would debate it and I would reply...well it is a funny joke and it didn't tire for me, I found it to be a consistently funny and entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cat-tastic venture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of Keanu (Wild Cat Boys) (spoiler free) *** (3/5)Cast: Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele, Tiffany Haddish, Method Man.Plot: Friends hatch a plot to retrieve a stolen kitten by posing as drug dealers for a street gang.I just want to start by saying this is the second funniest comedy this year the first being The Nice Guys (2016). This is comedy done in a very interesting way it is an action-comedy which have been done before however none of which have a cat running for its life. Meet Keanu he is an adorable little kitten who we meet at the beginning and he is on the run from a gang called the Allantown gang that is basically the plot of this insane comedy. Key and Peele's debut comedy is just balls out fun and some of the hilarious scripting was written by Jordan Peele himself alongside co-writer Alex Rubens. Keanu is then met by Rell (Peele) who is at the start very lonely and you can see straight away that he is going to be a great character, he finds the adorable Keanu at his door. Now you must be thinking is the cat named after Keanu Reeves? No he is not Peele announced that himself however Keanu Reeves did read some of the script and he said that he wants to be involved in some way, so he was. The core genre of this comedy is revenge and this was written 3 years before Keanu Reeves revenge thriller John Wick (2014) even came out. It is about revenge because Clarence and Rell (Key &amp; Peele) only have the cat for one day before he is viciously catnapped by a vengeful antagonist named Cheddar (Method Man). During this crazy adventure they meet up with loads of unique characters including an insane cameo in the form of Anna Faris and it just gets even more bat-s**t crazy from there. I've told you enough about the story. The soundtrack in this film is amazing for reasons of at the start it is sort of opera-esque and then a soundtrack featuring Clarence's favourite artist George Michael and then it turns into hip-hop and then again when it comes to the action opera again that is literally the most intriguing soundtrack ever and more movies should use it. At the end of this crazy and hilarious venture there is an awesome action scene that is just bonkers along with a car chase what I'm trying to say is this is a hilarious comedy filled with gags.Here are some as to why this is this year's second funniest film:Insane story: The story is well written by Peele and Rubens and well directed by Peter Atencio. Many action-comedies have insane stories but none like this, this story is literally the most insane in an action-comedy. The story also shows that Clarence and Rell have amazing friction as the two best buddies they also argue along the way but that is beside the point What I'm trying to say is if you can get a more insane story where is it? Because this, this is just bonkers as I said before.Characters: All the characters have their own back story and they all get crazier let's start with Clarence and Rell these two are the core characters and are the ones that drive the story, they are two best friends who in their real life they are lonely and lost because their life is a nightmare until they meet Hi-C (Haddish). Hi-C is a member of a gang run by Cheddar and basically that is when Clarence and Rell's lives begin to take a turn and they are turned to the gang life but Keanu is with Cheddar. So the two best have to change their identities but I won't say because spoilers. This is when the characters journey becomes insane.Action: The action is also insane from The Matrix-esque start to the slow motion end the action isn't there all the way through but when it does get there it makes the whole experience worth it as it is well crazy. No other comedies are done this way except from maybe a few.This is hilarious balls out comedy action that is just one hell of a ride I really hope that America's funniest duo makes more movies because they are hilarious and this was just a debut.Verdict: Balls out comedy that is a load of fun in this debut by America's funniest duo this is comedy at its best. Meow. It's literally a cat-tastic venture.7/10 insanely funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very clever Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one those comedies that made me laugh at the dialogue and the slap stick. There are subtle humorous aspects; such as the name of the strip club. I won't tell you the name of the strip club, that would be a spoiler. I laughed out loud throughout this movie. The shoot-out scenes are ridiculous in a funny way. The acting is actually very good. I do not see how they kept a straight face in some of the scenes. The name of the gang still makes me grin from ear to ear and chuckle at the humorous tangent on reality. The soundtrack is well mixed into the action and comedy. The choice of tunes also made me chuckle. In fact, they worked it into the plot. See this movie. If it can make a gator laugh, you will laugh, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ill keep this short and sweet. Key and Peele have done it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keanu was a surprising delight. If you are a fan of Key and Peele you will love this movie, it has the feel of a long Key and Peele sketch. I was skeptical when I heard they were going to be producing and staring in their own movie. But, all of my assumptions were wrong. The performance by both Key and Peele speaks to their talent as actors and comedians. Within seconds they can switch from their mellow and tame characters "Rel" and "Clarence" to their alter ego's "shark tank" and "tectonic." This movie is NOT for children or immature pre-teens who will run around quoting it and getting them selves suspended for a day or two. However, there is quite a few memorable lines and scenes in the movie that are reiterated and come into play more than once through out the film. All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this film for anyone who is looking for a movie filled with laughs and witty banter, But not looking for an extremely deep and emotional story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a fun and amusing ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always found this two duo to be pretty hysterical, especially their skits. So I was actually looking forward to watching this low budget comedy. I really like these types of comedy where the whole thing is a misunderstanding. Where characters try to act tough and build a reputation to get their mission accomplished. Or actual tough guys that people are afraid of actually being nice guys. And most of the humor comes from Key and Peele trying to act like tough guys. When in reality they are nerds that enjoy the simple things in life. The whole plot revolve around a kitten named Keanu that gets stolen, so the duo is on a mission to get their kitten back. The plot is about breaking out of the comfort zone and facing some actual tension in the duo's life instead of just sticking with the routine. This is a comedy that doesn't try to be overly crude or offensive for the humor, instead it comes from classic comedy formula. So yeah, just about everything that happens in this is actually quite predictable but it was still a amusing and fun ride.7.2/10</fullReview>

A black guy being George Michael's fan, sounds kind of weird but very nicely portrayed. Movie has some fresh jokes which are not very humorous but will definitely bring a smile on your face. Saw Anna Faris in new movie after quite sometime as usual she was funny as well as crazy in it. How can someone come up with names such as Shark-tank &amp; Tectonic instantaneously in a movie but it was funny. A sophisticated good guy pretending to be a rugged criminal is humorous.

		<fullReview>First off, I love Key &amp; Peele... I was devastated when I realized that the last episode was their series finale. The movie plays as a weird surreal action movie... I guess it's like Ride Along but played with less slap stick. After watching the trailer multiple times, I figured Keanu was going to have a lot more... but the trailer had all the best parts and the best punchlines.The plot is a bit shallow as the premise is a runaway kitten and then being found and then going to get the kitten back from captures. I guess you can compare this with Pineapple Express which basically is a simple story of stoners running away... but Pineapple Express has a ton of interesting characters and weirdo situations. Keanu had a couple of weird situations and no real interesting characters except one cameo. Watch the trailer and you're good - it pretty much sums up the entire film and all it's jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thin and Over-Stretched, This Concept Doesn't Have the Legs for Feature-Length</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Key and Peele, in their first starring vehicle, play a pair of soft suburban dudes who somehow find themselves acting like thuggish, grizzled killers to retrieve a stolen kitten (the titular Keanu). It's a terrible screenplay, but at least the laughs are there for the first act. After that, it falls into endless re-hashes, basically telling the same two or three jokes against a different backdrop for the length of the picture. I loved these guys on TV, but Keanu doesn't do a great job of highlighting their versatility and eventually goes beyond satire to become exactly the type of movie they're lampooning. Would've made a hilarious five-minute fake trailer on the small screen, which may shine a light on the type of growing pains to expect if they continue this transition to feature-length material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Friends hatch a plot to retrieve a stolen kitten by posing as drug dealers for a street gang." We actually don't know much about Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele's work, but the chemistry that have in Keanu is quite impressive. They bounce off each other extremely well.The movie has loads of hit and misses when it comes to the comedy elements throughout the whole film. Mind you, there are loads of jokes that work, but also a lot that flop. The movie is a combination of "John Wick" and "Boys N The Hood." And the combination does work quite well! A lot of the humor resolves in getting people to laugh at the "over the top violence" scenes, which, again is a hit and miss. But the whole idea of doing all this for a kitten is genius! The real star of the show is Keanu. He is the best Cat actor ever! Well trained, and his timing and presence on screen was adorable! I really do believe this movie is worth seeing. It's definitely worth a rent on Netflix. Autistic Reviewers give this 3/5 stars/7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent mix of comedy, action, and CAT! There were some jokes that other people in the theater laughed at that Tom and I didn't get, but there were still plenty of laughs. There was less comedy and more action than we were expecting, and that's all to the good. The action was excellent, and some of it was physical comedy, and that really worked.I wanted to see this movie because I love cats and the star is a kitten. AND it's not aimed at little kids. I usually look at cat stuff on the internet instead of movies or TV because the media-generated cat content is mostly aimed at children, so I prefer the user-generated cat content on the net. But when I saw the trailer for this movie in the theater when Tom and I were seeing a Marvel movie, I could tell it was aimed at grown up cat lovers. I convinced Tom to take me to see it even though he was afraid an entire movie of Key &amp; Peele comedy might get to be too much silliness. We were both pleasantly surprised at the action to comedy ratio, and by how well the cat was worked into the action and the plot. 9 out of 10 stars because a few of the jokes fell flat but other than that it was a purr-fect cat movie all the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stupid, fun, and surprisingly good comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keanu actually surprised me not only as a comedy, but as a movie. Oh, and that has to be the cutest kitten ever seen on the big screen. I wonder if they called it Keanu because Keanu Reeves was John Wick, and Keanu is kind of a parody of that. Keanu is really stupid though, but it knows its stupid and doesn't try playing it off as anything different. I'm a huge fan of Key and Peele and if you are then you will enjoy this, because its basically a 90 min Key and Peele special episode. All the roles were perfectly written for the certain actors chosen, although the acting in the movie can be so intentionally and funnily exaggerated. There are a lot of callbacks and references to movies as one of the main characters is a huge film buff and likes to take pictures of Keanu in different famous scenes from movies. One of the characters stays in character as an overly exaggerated ghetto gang member where the other one breaks character as they walk out of a club and that character says, "Your not Daniel Day Lewis". It was funny if you know anything about Daniel Day Lewis as he is a very provocative actor who tries not to break character. The character logic near the end is so ridiculous and unrealistic that it kind of took me out of the movie and think " I don't think it would go like that." And then near the end of that certain scene, one character retracts to the fact that they should go to jail. Also, stay for the main credits; they're hilarious and appealed to me as a film buff. So even if its so ridiculous its crazy, its a funny and ironic comedy that is self aware.8/10 Worth memorizing lines from the script and annoying everyone around you with references.

		<shortDescription>Considering this movie as a comedy its the funniest movie of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a real dearth of funny movies these days imho and Keanu is by far the funniest movie as far as 2016 is concerned. At least up until now. There are some scenes that will genuinely bring out tears of laughter in your eyes. To expect stellar performances and a riveting storyline from this movie is to have great expectations. It is what it is a funny movie, designed specifically to tickle your funny bone. The story is simple but the shenanigans very real and very hilarious. 2 cousins end up losing their cat to gangsters and they set out to retrieve the cat. In the process they end up posing as renowned hit men and are forced to get into a drug deal in return for their cat. The funniest parts are when Rell and Clarence are trying to convince the real gangsters that they are the real deal. Couple of scenes are worth mentioning, one where Clarence tries to convince the gangsters about George Michael and how he got his scar and second - when they get made. There are other very hilarious scenes too and I must say that the movie deserves to be seen. Cool cameo by Keanu Reeves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are not familiar with the sketch comedians Key and Peele by now, then I doubt you will have any interest in this movie. However, if you happen to love their sketches, then you need to see this movie. Both of the main characters shine and truly show that they can carry a movie on their shoulders. Action comedy fans should give this movie a try, especially if you can relate or have experienced any of the criminal/gang/urban LA subculture that is very prominent. Do yourself a favor and do go in thinking this is a comedy, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised with the drama and action involved. This is a low budget comedy but does not feel like it. This is definitely no MacGruber, but I would put this film in the same realm of production, just not quality, because it is much better. I would have given this film an 8 on my enjoyment, but my critical side instead thought it more honest to award it a 7. Still a great action comedy, and an incredible first major film outing for the two leads.</fullReview>

However, there are plenty of laugh out loud moments to make it worth investing your time.Believe it or not most black people know how to speak proper English and resent being misrepresented by the ebonics crowd. But, I never get tired of Key and Peele taking it to another level with their exaggerated proper verbiage.Will Forte steals the show with his rendition of the white guy who grew up in the hood and acts more black than actual black people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kitten, please.Hilariously over-the-top and ridiculously fun, Keanu is one blast of a movie. I enjoyed every minute of it and had a smile on my face through the entire runtime. Key and Peele are comedic geniuses and knock it out of the park with Keanu. Has some pacing issues, but other than that I really, really loved it. Definitely a movie that is very re-watchable. And I know it's what everyone has been saying, but Keanu truly is the cutest cat I have ever seen. Now, please excuse me as I go listen to George Michael.8.5 (A-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've ever wished there were a movie filled with songs by both George Michael and Future, then this is the one for you.Keanu is engaging right from the opening scene, where two shadowy figures craftily shoot up an entire drug operation inside of an old church.And so it begins. After wrapping up their eponymous sketch comedy show, Keegan-MIchael Key and Jordan Peele embark on their first film together. Written by Peele and starring both of them, Keanu follows Rell (Peele), who has just suffered a major breakup. And on the verge of of a downward spiral, he discovers a kitten on his doorstep. This kitten is Keanu. Immediately falling in love--like anyone would with a kitten--it fills the void that his ex-girlfriend left. This is pretty much the first and last time his breakup is mentioned in the whole movie. Within days, Keanu is stolen. And Rell, along with his cousin, Clarence (Key), ventures into the depths of an underground drug circle, infiltrating a gang called the Blips (a combination of the Bloods and the Crips). They pretend to be drug lords as well, forcing them to talk more aggressively and "gangster", fearing their "white-washed personas" will get them caught immediately.There are some very funny bits in this movie. Sure, many jokes go on for too long, while others awkwardly flop, but with Key and Peele, it's the awkwardness that makes them funny. Even when the two of them aren't making you laugh, you can't stop watching them try to be funny. You might even catch yourself smiling at it a few times. Some details about the plot are unclear, but nothing too frustrating. From the earliest scenes, there are a handful of holes in the logic of this film. A main one being: how would any experienced gangster not be able to snuff out two obvious phonies? But it's a comedy that prides itself on silliness, so we shouldn't care too much.Like any good comedy, there are more hits than misses. It narrowly undershoots the mark of being the next 21 Jump Street. It's consistent, but it's never groundbreaking. With less formulaic beats, maybe it could've been just that. Though I'm convinced formula is what they are going for, taking references from old buddy action films of yesteryear.Plus, there's a subtle Bill &amp; Ted reference, giving it extra points from me.For those of you who are fans of Key &amp; Peele's show, you'll enjoy the humor. But not to fear, it's not just one long drawn-out sketch. It's a solid action-comedy, but with a familiar brand of humor. As for others, you may be slightly caught off guard. You might leave the theater feeling like you've accidentally stumbled into an arcane universe that somehow you never knew existed until now. But the movie's feel is familiar enough that you'll still enjoy yourself. I guess their plan worked.Twizard Rating: 84</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will be saying 'Keanu, Gangsta kitten' for a long time now. Love Keagen Michael Key, even more now. Kitten is adorable. Action was spot on, not over the top. I am curious if Keagen used what he learned from whose line is it anyway during filming. He nailed this role. I love that shelter cats were used then adopted. The kind of movie to see again and again. I hope there will be a Keanu 2 movie.. It's hard writing without telling things you just have to see. Keanu steals the show,. But not so much that you don't know what's going on. . This movie hits the ground running and keeps on running. Classic yet unique action comedy movie that meets adorable. Keanu, gangsta kitten.. It's catchy. . I could watch a series of movies based around Keanu, Key and Peele.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's 48 minutes I'll never get back. That's right people, despite the film being 100 minutes long, 48 minutes is the absolute maximum I could watch this garbage. Poor casting, which is unsurprising considering lack of decent story line or content. It begs the question, do the financiers of movies like this have nothing else to squander their money on? Please, next time, give it to the poor or homeless.Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I am simply voicing mine, but there is not a chance that this "film" should have a rating of 6.8 on IMDb. It makes you wonder if all those involved in the making of this are intentionally rating it 10/10 to prop it up. If I could, I would rate it 0/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll say this, the cat is adorable. Other than that, this is a complete letdown. Really, they needed to try much harder than this. On paper, a Liam Neeson-type action movie about a cute kitten is a comedic goldmine. At least that's what the film is being advertised as. Honestly, this film has no idea what it was trying to be. A good portion of the movie doesn't even focus on the kitten. It's all over the place. Some might call it an extended Key and Peele skit, but that's to say that the material here is as funny as the show itself, and it isn't. Key and Peele are a great comedy duo. They belong in a better movie. Save for a bizarre (yet way overdone) running gag about George Michael, I barely laughed. It's a sin when comedies do this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'KEANU': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Action-comedy flick, starring Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key; who also paired together on the TV shows 'KEY AND PEELE' (which they created) and 'MAD TV'. The duo also co-produced the film, and Peele also co-wrote it; with Alex Rubens (who was also a regular writer of 'KEY AND PEELE'). Peter Atencio directed the movie (he was also the regular director of 'KEY AND PEELE'). The film also costars Tiffany Haddish, Method Man, Nia Long, Will Forte, Luis Guzman and Keanu Reeves (as the voice of Keanu). The movie tells the story of two cousins, trying to rescue a kitten, that was found on one cousin's doorstep, from the drug dealers that stole it. The film is funny, and Keanu (the title kitten character) is adorable!Rell (Peele) has just been dumped by his girlfriend, and is taking it very badly. So when an extremely cute kitten mysteriously shows up on his doorstep, he feels happy again. He names it Keanu, and starts doing creative photography projects with it. Then one night, while Rell is seeing a movie with his cousin Clarence (Key), Keanu is stolen by gang members; which broke into his house mistaking it for his drug dealing neighbor's (Forte). Rell then convinces Clarence to go on a crazy mission to get the cat back. Being a cat lover, I absolutely loved this movie! My cat Keno (who was my best friend in the whole world), passed away recently; so this film really brought back special feelings for me. I also really like the movie's crazy storyline, clever dialogue, and absurd comedic situations. I was already a fan of Keegan-Michael Key's, from seeing him in other films and comedy skits (like the one alongside President Obama), but I was unfamiliar with Jordan Peele (having never seen 'KEY AND PEELE' before). They make a great comedy team, and they're both hilarious in this film. The supporting cast is all good as well, and the seven tabby cats (that played Keanu) are amazing!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHm0V1TOCkg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comedy Masterpiece (with some tears)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying I just lost my cat of 12 years and was worried about seeing this without balling my eyes out in public...... With that said, I'm a huge Key &amp; Peele fan. Their humor is very clever and edgy and is NOT for everyone. I wouldn't expect someone who didn't like their show to enjoy this film. The film starts off with some ridiculous matrix shooting and the kitten's voyage to Peele who just broke up with his girlfriend. While it was cheesy there were some tears shed as the 2 bonded. It was done so well that you actually cared if he found the cat. Key is as witty as ever doing his "white guy" slant most of the film but there was a balance that made it somewhat believable and entertaining. Peele steals the show though in the end and you're left smiling as you leave the theater. All in all a fantastic 90 minutes for kids over 16 with a couple breasts but a ton of "F" and "N" words done comically.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie kind of green with Key and Peele. I seen a few of their sketches online and whatever popped on Facebook, but I didn't follow them like their usual fans.When I first heard about this movie I was intrigued. I've been to the Cat Video Film festivals and knew how fun cats can be to watch, so of course being the crazy cat lady that I am, I decided to give it a whirl. I expected most a few laughs and an easy way to spend my evening with the bf. As the story opened up I was already blown away: drug lord? epic fight scene? a kitten on the run!? Then enter our two main protagonists: suburban nerds one of which is getting over a devastating break up, and the other who is as his wife says "too wound up and uptight". What unfolds as Keanu finds his way to one of their porches and adorably "meows" for help, is the set up for what will become the two cat hero's epic adventure for this fur ball, but also a journey on their own personal level where they learn to live a little and let loose. I can honestly say the movie had everything; action, suspense, a little romance and tons of comedy. I can't remember the last time I laughed this hard at a movie (maybe Step Brothers?)And one thing I loved about this movie is that it wasn't too raunchy, if not at all. I'm not sure why this has to be a thing with some movies. Key and Peele have proved to me they have certified comedic chops without needed to lay on the sexual innuendo like so many other "comedy" movies do. Also it is a bit of a head scratcher for me how this movie received bad reviews and makes me question if these are just trolls in general. This movie succeeds in breaking general stereotypes about black (lead) males in movies as well as cats in movies. Not all leads who are minorities are gangstas (although they wanna be'ed hilariously in here) and not all cats in movies are little jerks who just want to take over the world. Best part? Key and Peele actually toured animal shelters promoting adoption through this movie. What's not to love?But the best thing about this movie? KEANU. You will fall in love, be warned. He certainly steals the shows and you will leave the theater wanting to go hug your fur baby, or even better, make you want to go adopt one.This movie will become a cult classic and be on my repeat (watch) list for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's fresh, silly, and smart as hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to being a 'gangsta' (or um 'gangster' is the way to say it but I usually see it spelled the former way), people tend to come in that lingo of "H.A.M" (Hard as a Moter-effer). If you want to be part of a crew doing things like slinging drugs or hanging in the back of a strip club, you got to have a walk, you got to have the right talk, you got to know that guns will be part of it and probably doing drugs from time to time as well (and if you got to plug a few people along the way, well, all the better for street cred). But this is also something we see a lot in movies and television (even, of course, The Wire had its gangster elements in a strip club/drug slinging world), and it's very much in both a real world context and the movies in tandem that Key and Peele come in with their characters in the extremely, surprisingly funny Keanu.The trailer promises some fish-out-of-water fun, where the comedy duo (coming to movies for the first time following a successful Comedy Central series also skewering race and pop culture in expert ways), playing basically middle-class dorks, have to descend into the criminal underworld of the 17th Street Blips (you can find them on 17th Street, naturally) in order to retrieve Peele's character's cat dubbed the title character (posters for other Warner brothers HAM classics like Heat and New Jack City, the latter being ironic for a couple of reasons, don his walls). There were a couple of things I knew I could expect - George Michael jokes to be sure, though not quite to the extent where Key gets the others in the gangster crew, well, into that s*** - but I didn't expect that they could keep up the humor throughout. They can, and they do.I think what helps is that you believe this action-thriller movie world. It has an authenticity not unlike Hot Fuzz; this is made by people who, I suspect, really love these scuzzy, ultra-violent action flicks (and the whole angle of the cat comes from John Wick, albeit it's not quite *that* violent, few things are). There's an affection that seeps through, and it's also telling a story that makes it so that Key and Peele aren't just one ting throughout. They can both be comic relief or they can be the straight guy; something in a scene or happening just before it will trigger one of them to get even 'more' into character. That last part is a lot of what drives the humor, and it helps that a) they commit to these 'characters' within their characters, and b) there are other "roles" being played by others. With the exception of Method Man's Cheddar, almost none of the major or supporting characters is quite who they seem to be.This is also a joy when you watch Tarantino flicks, though here the tone's more like a Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle: the tone is constantly irreverent, and often the laughs - massive ones, from the guts many times over - come from these guys being funny together, having perfect timing, and that they keep on coming up against greater and more dangerous obstacles (i.e. those two silent creepy killers that set the chain of events in the film at the start). But the strain of satire on class and culture is the other thing keeping the comedy and even the action fresh and alive. The attention to how ridiculous these movies can get is one thing (again, Hot Fuzz), and some of the casting helps a great deal with that (two words: Anna Faris, good God she nearly steals the show, but just nearly). But I can't help but keep thinking about how it's so fresh to see what it means to be "black" (in quotes, certainly) in culture and in the movies and then reflected back in life again. Showing just a smidgen of being a dork is a no-no, but what's refreshing is how the others in the van start bopping their heads to George Michael and one of them gets a tattoo with his name (!) It commits to everything it's going for.In other words, in Keanu being a H.A.M. drug-slinging killer may be one thing, and acting like it is another, and to be both is worth a lot of comedy (especially when it comes to these guys when they, you know, get to having to deal with things like guns that they're clearly over their head with). How does one get into that mind-set? Watch a lot of movies and try to make sure one curbs the Richard-Pryor-imitating a-white-guy-voice. And if there's a cuter thing than Keanu in movies this year then I'll have to resign as a film critic and get one myself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Keanu" is a very good first foray into feature films for the funny duo of Key and Peele.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. Although many are already well-acquainted with the duo, the comedy "Keanu" (R, 1:38) is their first feature film together, serving as their introduction to the unitiated. Although they have each done projects on their own, these two comedians are best known as a team who met as cast members on MADtv and then starred in "Key &amp; Peele", their own sketch comedy series, which was on television's Comedy Central for five seasons (2012-2015). That show was critically-acclaimed and award-winning, but underseen by the general public. The end of "Key &amp; Peele" served as the beginning of Key and Peele's pairing in movies and "Keanu" proves to be a great vehicle for their pop culture aware and racially insightful comedy, not to mention their significant chemistry.The title character is a cute little kitten (actually, one of seven used in filming), which shares his name with a certain movie star, that name meaning "cool breeze" in Hawaiian. At the beginning of the film, the kitten avoids injury and escapes the scene of a shoot-out at an illicit drug production facility. The kitten belonged to drug dealer King Diaz, whose place and people were shot-up in that first scene. The shooters, a pair of very scary, long-haired, darkly-dressed, ninja-like specters called the Allentown Boys, also take a shine to the kitten, which runs off as the massacre is ending. The little guy runs through the streets of L.A. until he ends up on the doorstep of a depressed man whose girlfriend has just left him.Rell (Jordan Peele) quickly and deeply bonds with the kitten, whom he cleans up and names. Keanu's considerable cuteness brings Rell out of his emotional funk and Rell, a photographer, starts creating photos of the kitten in mock-ups of classic movie scenes. When Rell's cousin, Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key), comes by, he's also immediately taken in by Keanu's charms. Clarence's wife (Nia Long), who has joined their neighbor (Rob Huebel), on a weekend getaway so their daughters could spend time together, urges Clarence to use that couple of days to have some fun and cut loose. Clarence heads across town to Rell's place for a weekend that turns out to be much more than anyone bargained for.After coming home from a movie, the pair discover that Rell's home has been ransacked and Keanu is gone. Rell desperately asks Hulka (SNL's Will Forte), his neighbor and drug dealer, if he saw anything. Hulka says he had recently seen members of the gang the 17th Street Blips (gangbangers who had been kicked out of the Bloods and the Crips) nearby. Rell and Clarence find the Blips at a strip club called High Priced Vixens (HPV for short) and see that Cheddar (Method Man), the Blips' leader, has adopted Keanu. Rell and Clarence try to play it cool, mentioning that they like the cat. Mistaking them for The Allentown Boys, Cheddar says he'll give them the cat if they go with his crew on a job and teach them a few things.Rell and Clarence aren't exactly thugs. They argue over who talks more "white" and Clarence is obsessed with the music of George Michael. But they do their best to live up to the badass reputation of the Allentown Boys long enough to get Keanu back. Rell and Clarence join "Hi-C" (Tiffany Haddish), Trunk (Darrell Britt-Gibson), Bud (Jason Mitchell) and Stitches (Jamal Neighbors) on a delivery to the home of Anna Farris (as herself) which becomes comically bizarre ? both for those who go inside the house and those who wait outside in their van. Before Keanu's fate is finally determined, Rell and Clarence party with the Blips, run into the real Allentown Boys and meet a drug kingpin (Luis Guzman) who recognizes Keanu as his cousin King Diaz' kitten and insists on having the little guy. (That's one popular pussy cat!) "Keanu" is an understated but fun movie, and a great initial foray into feature films for Key and Peele. In keeping with their sketch comedy background, the story and the characters are humorously unrealistic, but are good for more than a few laughs. The script by Peele and Alex Rubens overplays some of the gags, but includes some smart plot twists. (Whether you see them coming or not, they are pretty enjoyable.) Director Peter Atencio keeps things moving and strikes a good balance between light-hearted and serious, obviously helped by his two talented leads. It's the charm and chemistry of Key and Peele which accounts for much of this film's appeal. (And a certain adorable kitten is also a big part of that appeal, unless, of course, you're a soul-less cat-hater.) This modern day Abbott and Costello effectively entertain with "Keanu", and it's obvious that their first feature isn't their last. "B+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comedy Filled With Jokes That are Clever and Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about Keanu, a feature film debut for the comedy duo Key &amp; Peele I was very excited because I love the show. Key &amp; Peele have consistently shown that they are clever comedians, and Keanu only serves as further proof of their talent. Keanu is often funny, mostly because of the infectious chemistry of it's leads, despite a few narrative weaknesses. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Keanu is the originality of the jokes, in a day and age where comedies are typically very lazily made.A lot of comedies today are like modern horror movies, they are extremely lazily made and not very good at what they are supposed to do. Keanu features some very clever jokes that are really funny, and border on being hilarious. Some of the jokes fall flat, and this isn't the funniest comedy I've ever seen, but a lot of the jokes are funny, and original. The movie is at it's best when the two main characters are on the screen, as their chemistry is electric.The biggest selling point of this film is Key &amp; Peele, because those two comedians have proved to be hilarious, and are even better when they are together. The two main characters, played by Key &amp; Peele, are the obvious focus of the film, as every other character in the film is clearly an afterthought. Given how the story progresses it's easy to care about the two main characters, but all other characters lack the same depth, making the clear focus of the film Key &amp; Peele, but sacrificing quality in the process.While the film is clever, somewhat original, and often funny it also has a few too many plot holes. Like most comedies today, the story of Keanu was written simply to tie a long list of jokes together, and because of that it feels weak. There are multiple moments where the cleverness that was infused in the jokes, is abandoned for the story. The film's story is also not as original as the jokes, as the story feels at least a little like Taken.All-in-all the jokes are what matters in this film, as many, if not all, who see this movie will see it for the humor and not the story. The jokes are clever, fairly original, often funny, and don't fall short very often. For those who like Key &amp; Peele, this movie will not disappoint, and may even exceed expectations. If you like their style, or if you like funny movies, this movie is definitely for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally think their sketch comedy is borderline brilliant. So I was really looking forward to this movie.This movie is just plain awful. i am honestly not sure what movie others were watching when they said it was laugh out loud funny. it is not.It reminds me of a lot of recent Paul Rudd-Seth Rogan movies. You know the kind: these guys think they are so frickin' hilarious just being themselves that no script is needed. That is what this movie felt like. I truly feel there was no written script; that there may have been vague "ideas" of what they wanted to have happen, and just threw the actors in and said "be funny; say something funny." the whole part with Anna Farris in the house and the rest of the guys waiting out in the car -- nothing came out of that scene that was remotely funny.And the cat? Way too little of the cat. And when he was on screen, there was nothing funny about it.The weird wife-friend sub plot went no where. Thank God.Gosh, guys. For your first movie, was so expecting better</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a friend who thought a kitten in a dew rag was funny and wanted to see this film-- I believe a 100 minute film needs more substance than a kitten in a costume- so, I watched the trailer. 3 minutes of trailer later: I saw absolutely nothing funny- in the end even my friend had to admit this movie was simply God Awful. The jokes are tired - you can see the punchlines coming from a mile away. There is an action/comedy scene that is actually disturbing and unfunny. In the end we are left to believe street thugs who deal drugs are actually really nice people and worthy of our friendships. Words can not describe how bored I was and how much I hated this film-- I do admit I chuckled twice- but that was probably because my mood wasn't totally spoiled- as I didn't buy the tickets.

		<fullReview>I don't know Key and Peele extremely well, I've seen them show up in a few cameos and such but I do have gist of what their comedy is like. Am I surprised this got theatrical release? Yes. It feels like a long sketch. However, as silly as it is, it has a dark overtone, it's shocking and ridiculous and appropriately satirical and I would imagine that their fans will love this. It seems to be showing up on a lot of under- rated film lists and I get it. It does grow on you and some of the ridiculousness definitely wins you over. It might be stupid toilet humour but secretly brilliant I don't know? It is definitely over the top and definitely pokes fun at certain taboo limits (like the N- word for instance) and Black culture but I think this is a thing with their comedy? The plot is undeniably weak, I mean, the cat barely makes sense in the film and yet they force it in there to build a comedy routine around. I can respect their comedy though. I love good satire and while this is dumb...it's dumb I can wrap my head around. I see the idea and as I said I think Key and Peele fans will enjoy it. Jordan Peele is the nervous, depressed, moody one of the two and his comedy comes from being more like Eeyore from Winnie The Pooh. He's okay but I feel like he gets buried amongst the louder more influential characters. Keegan-Michael Key steals the show as the loud, over-the-top husband who is on a wild adventure when his wife is out of town. Considering Key and Peele are a comedy duo, this film does nothing to showcase their chemistry together. Much of the film they spend apart and their characters are so different that they don't jive. Ironically, the supporting cast are all almost forgettable and yet one of the high points of the film are the cameos. Anna Farris, Keanu Reeves (obviously) and Luis Guzmán and George Michael (sort of) all have great little cameos. Method Man and Tiffany Haddish are okay in their respective roles but certainly aren't mean to have any great development. Again, maybe I need to invest in some Key and Peele skits but I just don't get the film. I mean, it's so dark and twisted and yet goes for the silly comedy angle too. I'm just genuinely surprised this got a theatrical release. Director Peter Atencio has a history in sketch type comedy but not a lot of background in a feature length film and same could be said for stars Key and Peele and maybe that's why this feels a little weaker than it should. Still it has it's moments, its not a total write off but far from this summer's best comedy (or I hope anyways) It passes time but is mostly forgettable. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie Has More Than One Cute Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Weirdly enough, though I know about and like Jordan Peele and Keegan- Michael Key, I just never got into their act or their show and it took this movie for me to finally develop a crush on Jordan Peele. What a hottie he is!Already, I'm side-tracked, but it does blend into my main concern here. Since I know about them and seen some sketches of theirs, I know they're funny. Sometimes super funny. So what happened here? I spent the grand majority of this movie wondering if this was, in fact, a comedy.Sure, I chuckled a few times. But I actually never laughed. I can see where sometimes they were trying to be funny. It just didn't work and I would highly expect more out of these two than this script of almost zero-fun. (What's funny, though, Peele co-wrote this. Maybe, perhaps, they needed both men's input?)As the clever South Park episode of years past said: The Simpsons Already Did It. In this case, John Wick already did it, but with a highly entertaining film, instead. Basically, broken up Rell (Peele) find a cat (or the cat finds him) and when he's stolen, his cousin (Key) and him get deep into the gang land to retrieve the cat with the title's name.It's not a bad movie, and has its moments, but overall it isn't funny at all. It really should've been. Sad.***Final thoughts: The one good thing that came out of this was when I got home from the movie, I immediately ordered John Wick on BluRay. It's coming tomorrow and I cannot wait to see that a second time. I just won't be watching Keanu a second time?despite how cute Peele appealed to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny sketch that is expanded into a full length movie, some of it works, some doesn't but its very funny and worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Let's just go check it out, what's the worst that could happen?" Clarence (Key) is a loving husband, great friend and a huge George Michael fan. When his wife leaves on a weekend trip he stops by his friend Rell's (Peele) house and meets his new cat. When they return home the house has been broken into and his cat is missing. Now the two will stop at nothing to find that cat and bring him home. This is actually a very funny and smart comedy. The premise is absolutely ridiculous but the fact that everyone plays it straight really makes it work. I have never seen their comedy series but after watching this I think I might. All that said, this is not an amazing movie, and not worth theater prices but I did laugh quite a bit throughout. The humor is over-the-top, dry, intelligent and stupid and it all works. This is a great comedy to rent, don't think I'd buy it though. Essentially though it is a funny sketch that is expanded into a full length movie, some of it works, some doesn't but its very funny and worth seeing. Overall an absurd movie that kept me laughing the entire time. I give this a B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The two "whitest", milquetoastiest black guys hop in their minivan, crank up their George Michael CD, and pose as thugs from da hood, go on a drug run, kill people, and infiltrate a street gang, in order to get back their cat.Did I really just type that, let alone watch that? Darkly violent, with a really creepy looking pair of killers who meet with a particularly gruesome demise (yet who also inexplicably reanimate in the post-credits scene) this movie features a ridiculously contrived and outright stupid premise, which isn't that funny to begin with, and is made even more unfunny by the overly graphic violence. But they go for plenty of the " Awwww, it's such a cute wittle kitty!" jokes whenever possible, to try to balance things out, unsuccessfully. The humour is far too weak, and the violence is far too over powering.There was only one other person in the cinema at the time. He laughed quite a bit. I'm glad someone liked it, because I sure as hell didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Key and Peele have major success in comics and comedy sketches, they might just be the best comedians in recent times. After several seasons of excellence, their transition to the big screen does have the same gravitas but the humor might feel imbalances at times and it tends to dive into predictable escapade. Still, the charm and spark from their skits are still pronounced.Strangely enough, this is a movie about a kitten, perhaps the most wanted feline in criminal world. Two ordinary guys get caught up in shady dealings trying to win back this cute kitten. It all boils down to identity switch, parody of gangster antics and eventually slow mo shootout with George Michael serenading audience and on screen characters between the sequences.It may look odd enough at certain parts, and their signature may carry the majority of the movie, but the pacing is uneven. It struts too long on certain aspects, which also become too familiar to old action comedy shtick. Fortunately, the movie's verbal gags are more approachable than its slapstick moments and it's arguably where Key and Peele really shine.Keanu, ironically like Keanu Reeves, may not deliver hits every time, but when it does, it's pretty enjoyable and a decent foray from skit to full fledged movie for the duo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and charming in spite of itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been a fan of the sketch work that Key &amp; Peele produce together, I was a bit nervous to see how it would work stretched out into a feature. My main concern was that it would feel like one, over-long sketch.Thankfully, I was mistaken. Both comedians have crafted a movie here, the scenes feel like they could be their own self-contained sketches, and it's a genuinely charming experience from start to finish. It's definitely silly, and occasionally treads into the land of stupid, but I got some solid laughs out of it, and if nothing else that's what you want from a comedy. You want it to make you laugh, and produce all those feel-good chemicals in your brain.The premise is silly, the movie follows suit, and Key and Peele are extremely funny and watchable. Not to mention, the cat is heartbreakingly adorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Key and Peele fan. They do push the envelope at times and some of their skits are too over the top for me. Even with that I wanted to go see this movie. I hadn't seen a comedy on the big screen in ages so this was a first for me in a sense.I won't say the movie disappointed but it certainly didn't live up to what I'd expected. Honestly, I expected a laugh-a-minute and I expected to be sweating with laughter. I got none of that but it did deliver on some laughs.The story was something new and the movie wasn't just a skit fest. There was a point to the plot and they drove steadily to that final point with some wacky events occurring along the way. I wouldn't be averse to them producing another movie if they used this movie as a feeler just to gauge public reaction. I almost felt as though they were holding back just a bit. I think they could've gone a little wackier and played a few more characters--that would've been more in their wheelhouse and far more appealing in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KEANU: Key and Peele may be the best comedy team since Martin and Lewis only with much more versatility in the characters they can create. Individually, they are very fine actors. Even though it's parody, they fully inhabit their characters in a very realistic and believable way, which makes them all the funnier. The premise is absurd, but that's what often makes comedy. Keanu is a kitten belonging to a drug lord who escapes after a raid by a rival drug cartel and is found by Peele's character (Rell). Rell's house is mistakenly taken for his next door neighbor's and raided by another drug gang who have also kidnapped Keanu. Rell talks his cousin, Clarence (Key) into infiltrating the drug gang in order to get Keanu back. Talk about fish out of water, these two suburbanites pretending to be bad asses are in way over their heads, or are they? If you liked them on Mad TV and their show on Comedy Central, you'll get exactly what you'd expect. Score: 7.5. Go. It's a 90 minute Key and Peele show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've ever wished there were a movie filled with songs by both George Michael and Future, then this is the one for you.Keanu is engaging right from the opening scene, where two shadowy figures craftily shoot up an entire drug operation inside of an old church.And so it begins. After wrapping up their eponymous sketch comedy show, Keegan-MIchael Key and Jordan Peele embark on their first film together. Written by Peele and starring both of them, Keanu follows Rell (Peele), who has just suffered a major breakup. And on the verge of of a downward spiral, he discovers a kitten on his doorstep. This kitten is Keanu. Immediately falling in love--like anyone would with a kitten--it fills the void that his ex-girlfriend left. This is pretty much the first and last time his breakup is mentioned in the whole movie. Within days, Keanu is stolen. And Rell, along with his cousin, Clarence (Key), ventures into the depths of an underground drug circle, infiltrating a gang called the Blips (a combination of the Bloods and the Crips). They pretend to be drug lords as well, forcing them to talk more aggressively and "gangster", fearing their "white-washed personas" will get them caught immediately.There are some very funny bits in this movie. Sure, many jokes go on for too long, while others awkwardly flop, but with Key and Peele, it's the awkwardness that makes them funny. Even when the two of them aren't making you laugh, you can't stop watching them try to be funny. You might even catch yourself smiling at it a few times. Some details about the plot are unclear, but nothing too frustrating. From the earliest scenes, there are a handful of holes in the logic of this film. A main one being: how would any experienced gangster not be able to snuff out two obvious phonies? But it's a comedy that prides itself on silliness, so we shouldn't care too much.Like any good comedy, there are more hits than misses. It narrowly undershoots the mark of being the next 21 Jump Street. It's consistent, but it's never groundbreaking. With less formulaic beats, maybe it could've been just that. Though I'm convinced formula is what they are going for, taking references from old buddy action films of yesteryear.Plus, there's a subtle Bill &amp; Ted reference, giving it extra points from me.For those of you who are fans of Key &amp; Peele's show, you'll enjoy the humor. But not to fear, it's not just one long drawn-out sketch. It's a solid action-comedy, but with a familiar brand of humor. As for others, you may be slightly caught off guard. You might leave the theater feeling like you've accidentally stumbled into an arcane universe that somehow you never knew existed until now. But the movie's feel is familiar enough that you'll still enjoy yourself. I guess their plan worked.Twizard Rating: 84</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute Cat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keanu (2016): Dir: Peter Atencio / Cast: Jordan Peele, Keegan- Michael Key, Method Man, Will Forte, Nia Long: Crime comedy about the bright elements within dark places. Keanu is a kitten that survives a violent gang shooting and ends up in possession of Jordan Peele. He is depressed after his girlfriend broke up with him but the arrival of this cat brightens his perception. Keegan-Michael Key plays his best friend who arrives to cheer him up. He is married and not impressed that his wife is on a trip with another man. Central plot regards the cat being stolen and the boys struggle to get Keanu. This lands them within a situation where they pretend to be gangsters in order to get the cat back. The results are quirky but the climax is extremely violent and not as funny. Peele has heart and cares about nothing more than the safety of this cat but he is forced into a situation where he is thrust into a lifestyle that he is not familiar with. Key steals his scenes accepting his freedom from marriage briefly and finding a link with these gangsters especially when his obsession with George Michael is revealed. Method Man plays the main antagonist villain and the role is cardboard. Nia Long plays a female gangster whom will become romantically linked with Peele but her role is also flat. Will Forte is funny as a dope dealer who ends up in the trunk of a car with a large python. Theme regards the reality that these two characters are so opposite to how they are perceived by the gangsters. The cat is cute and resourceful and the production is explosive and in the end the cat has a new home. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another comedy from the summer of 2016, Keanu is about two cousins who come across a cat but little did they know this cat belongs to a gangster and is then stolen from them...and so off they go on a quest to get the cat back. Us British moviegoers were treated to this delight much later than the American audience, and when I say delight I mean the complete opposite as this was just unfunny, pointless and completely ridiculous. The film stars Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key, who I can only assume were popular to American viewers as I've never heard of them before, and a few other stars like Anna Faris and even Keanu Reeves. The acting was fine, slightly over the top for a few gags, but that is not what makes this unwatchable. It's actually the fact that nothing was funny, I did not laugh once (again, I dislike most comedy films, probably because I have no soul). The only funny scene was with Anna Faris, who was the only highlight of this film. Sure the cat was cute and the action was watchable, but when the film reuses the same two gags (one including George Michael songs and the other involving the main characters pretending to be gangsters) it's just not funny and grows incredibly tiresome. Don't even get me started on how this whole film started because the cat decided to show up on one of the lead characters's house, completely coincidental...if only it chose a different house I may have saved myself 100 minutes. Overall, this was a bad comedy film that wasn't actually funny with a terrible script...but the cat was cute.- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun action comedy, but I expected a bit more from Key &amp; Peele</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film from comedy duo Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele (whose Key &amp; Peele show on Comedy Central is probably the best sketch comedy show of the past decade or so), this is a pretty fun action comedy. I think it probably should be even better given the talent of Key &amp; Peele, but it's hardly a disappointment. The plot involves two cousins (K&amp;P) who are looking to find Jordan Peele's new kitten, who has apparently been kidnapped by a group of drug dealers. K&amp;P are suburbanites, and a lot of the humor comes from them trying to put on a tough front on in front of the gangsters (led by Method Man). Other recognizable actors in the cast include Will Forte, Nia Long, Rob Huebel, Luis Guzman and Anna Faris. The real star of the film is the kitten Keanu (voiced by THE Keanu in a dream sequence), who is absolutely freaking adorable. In fact, he's so cute the film starts to lag when he's not around.</fullReview>

Their skits are brilliant, efficient, and although they can be a bit pushy, the jokes rarely fall flat.Most of this film was the opposite of those things. While there were a couple hilarious moments in the film, it wasn't nearly enough to keep me entertained for 90 minutes. The writing was really the main issue with this film, it honestly couldn't keep up with Key &amp; Peele's acting. Their acting was fine for the big screen, but their jokes were very poorly adapted for a feature-length work.For now these guys ought to stick with shorter-form content.

		<fullReview>Okay, I'll admit it, the cat was cute. Rather the five or so kittens that were used to bring the adorably fuzzy little Keanu to life were cute. Who ever trained the kittens to mew on command, jump into people's arms and pose for a movie parody calendar deserves an award of some kind. As for the movie itself...meh.The infinitely talented sketch comedy performers Key and Peele play Clarence (Key) and Rell (Peele), two hopelessly inept cousins whose lives are change forever with the arrival of Keanu the kitten. The kitten itself was a witness to the execution of cartel lieutenant and for unknown reasons is being hunted by the notorious "Allentown Boys" (also played by Key and Peele). In a cosmic coincidence the 17th Street Blips ransack Rell's house mistaking it for his neighbor's pad, a drug dealer named Hulka (Forte). They take Keanu, Rell and Clarence track them down, they talk a big game to get into the room and steal back the cat; mayhem ensues.The film won me over in the first five minutes with an inspired comedic shootout inspired by the work of director John Woo. I was further taken in by the characters of Rell and Clarence both of whom are happy in their geeky, innocuous ways. Sure they were a bit goofy and sure their nebbishness occasionally became over-broad but their easy chemistry and inspired moments of back-and-forth made for an easy introduction. Once the plot kicked in however, the film slowly deflated from a loving send-up of action movie clichés into an extended one-note joke that wears out its welcome right quick.Make no mistake, you take away the film's leads, this film is essentially a remake of Corky Romano (2001) only instead of recovering evidence our heroes are looking for a cat. The direction in Keanu is so woefully pedestrian and bereft of personality that all the humor, and I mean all of it is provided by extended moments of improvisation. Key and Peele are certainly great at winging it as proved by their energetic sketches on their Comedy Central show Key &amp; Peele (2012- Present). But those sketches last at most ten minutes, this movie is an hour and forty minutes of two bungling idiots pretending to be hardcore.Ironically it's during those cringe-worthy moments of fronting and street speak that an underlying theme emerges, thus saving Keanu from being completely forgettable. In the beginning of the film it is clumsily mentioned that Clarence worries so much about other people's opinions of him that he can't seem to just let loose. As Clarence is exposed to Cheddar (Method Man), Trunk (Britt-Gibson) and the rest of the Blips through his alter-ego "Shark Tank," his character goes through a warped kind of progression. Though the communal trappings of the gang life he finds the approval he struggles to get from his wife (Long). Could this be a commentary on struggling to find a sense of identity while sifting through the minefields of social acceptance and blackness? It is not for me to say though it's not like Key and Peele have never mined such themes for the sake of good chuckles.The film is serviceable as a comedy, doling out just enough laughs for people to feel they got their money's worth provided they don't think too hard about the plot. Keanu however is not worth repeated viewings. It's completely undermined by the faddish improv-cut-paste method that has all but taken over American comedy. It's the type of comedy that begs the audience to laugh instead of focusing on the story elements and letting the laughs emanate organically. It's a shame too, that Keanu is one cute cat.</fullReview>

Mel then descends into the drug underworld to track down his lost pet, only to find it is now in the hands of a tough kingpin. Though not as funny as some of their comedy skits, Key and Peele do an adequately humorous job as they will do anything it takes to get their cat back. The backbone of the story itself is a little stretched, and though it was intended to be this way it often seems so far fetched that grown men and women are killing each other over a kitten.

There were a lot of violent scenes that were too graphic for what was supposed to be a comedy. I was expecting a Pineapple Express or Hot Fuzz kind of movie but was disappointed by the final product. A lot of the scenes don't go anywhere and the writing could have been better.I have no issues with mindless goofy comedies but this didn't work. The story is all over the place that it doesn't work as a full movie. The concept would have worked better as a sketch on their show. Oh well, better luck next time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the worst film I've ever seen. And I say this after years and years of going to movies. Extreme, gratuitous violence and explicit language, to an extreme in this film. I can accept violence and language in films and really don't have a problem with it. In this film however, those two components are used to a ridiculous extreme for shock value by the filmmakers. The F and N words were used pretty much every 10 seconds throughout the film. And a shooting occurs literally every 45 seconds throughout the film. Many of these scenes are actually darkly disturbing. This is supposed to be funny? I cannot believe the amount of positive reviews there are for this film. Were people watching the same movie I was? There is no reason to go to this extent with the violence and language except if you are trying to go for shock value. The cute kitten was the only saving grace. There should have been more Keanu and less violence and explicit language. It's kind of a cute premise, A guy gets dumped by his girlfriend and he is feeling low. A stray kitten appears at his doorstep and he immediately falls in love with it. After returning home from meeting a friend, he finds his apartment vandalized and the kitten missing. His drug dealing neighbor gives him some clues as to who might have broken in and stolen the cat. He then enlists the help of his friend to retrieve the kitten from the drug dealers who committed the break in. They could have taken out at least 50 percent of the violence and language and actually made a movie that was watchable. However, even though it bills itself as a comedy, I didn't think it was funny in the least. Instead, I felt relief that the movie was finally over! I should have just walked out after the first 30 minutes and reclaimed an hour of my time back.</fullReview>

So sad that these talented individuals (the humans--not the kitties) stooped so low as to try to eek out humor in such a poorly presented-stereotypical way. Although Key and Peele were funny when they did their own show, it was painfully obvious that their "THANG" doesn't work for a feature film. I really REALLY wanted to like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of Key &amp; Peele, I find their comedy very hit &amp; miss, but the trailer for this film looked great and promised a silly good time, which is something I seek out. I actually laughed harder at the trailer than I did during the film, because of how it was edited. In the actual film almost every single joke is run into the ground so much that it stops being funny. The plot revolves around a Slacker, Rell, who comes across a lost kitten and takes it in. When the kitten is stolen by a thug ransacking the wrong house Rell recruits his high strung cousin Clarence to go after the criminal and his gang to retrieve the kitten, only they end up having to work with him. The plot doesn't really make any sense and is unfortunately worn thin by the end credits. There are, however, a couple big laughs in the film, one involving a hilarious celebrity drug deal gone wrong which had me in stitches. Unfortunately, even the ending slightly unravels the brilliance of that scene by explaining it with an unnecessary reveal. There are some great performances from the supporting cast, including Nia Long and Luis Guzmán, and Key &amp; Peele themselves do a pretty good job, but the script definitely could have used more work; injecting some more variety into the comedy and perhaps not beating to death the jokes that initially work. It's entertaining, and worth watching for that one brilliant scene, but I do think it could have been a lot funnier throughout and less clichéd at the end.</fullReview>

Weed Legitimization will be necessary for KEANU to become a Cult Classic, since it's obviously shot by potheads for potheads. KEANU won't make any sense unless the viewer understands that it was shot by a stoned cast and crew for a toking audience. A few folks were giggling in the back row behind me at my showing, and I realized that the place was beginning to smell a lot like the Quad at U of M on April 20. Of course, who's to say that absent this second-hand smoke, I might have rated KEANU as just a "5"? Strangely enough, this web site will NOT let a user submit two reviews for the same flick--one to enlighten Stoners, plus another for those who are stone-cold sober. Suffice it to say that KEANU is like the elephant surrounded by the proverbial blind guys. Each fellow describes the pachyderm differently, depending upon whether they've latched onto the trunk, a tusk, a foot, etc. Descriptions of KEANU will vary widely as well, depending upon whether someone saw it while in their right mind--or impaired, like that egg frying in the skillet during the TV PSA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want to see more films from Kee and Peel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two friends(Kee and Peel) set out to rescue a cute kitten they named Keanu, only to discover the kitten is at gangster nightclub, so they both pretend to be drug dealers, but soon find themselves in over there heads. Will they get out alive, and hopes to rescue Keanu before it's too late? Keanu is an entertaining comedy that you could watch and forget you everyday problems, it's just one of those types of comedies. Kee and Peel are just funny like crazy, it's great when hilarity ensues on them. Funny watching those two trying to act gangster, and we the audience see right through them. I hope to see more films from this funny comedy team. The rest of the cast are entertaining as well, Kee and Peel play off on them as well. The cute kitten is also adorable to watch.If you are looking for a comedy to pass the time and make you laugh, then give Keanu a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Key and Peele bring a certain type of comedy that is not for everyone. Similar to Will Ferrell movies, you just have to be in to that type of humor. For me, this movie did not disappoint. There were a few real laugh out loud moments, and a lot of chuckles. Overall, I was entertained, and can see the humor in the entire movie being about a tiny kitten. For me, Jordan (Peele) was the funniest in this movie. When he went in and out of the characters they were pretending to be around the "bad guys", it was believable and he played both characters really well. Key seemed to be a little too far out of his comfort zone. Overall, I would recommend going to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Keanu", starring Jordan Peele-Wunderlust, Little Fockers; Keegan- Michael Key-Vacation_2015, Let's Be Cops; Tiffany Haddish-A Christmas Wedding, Meet The Spartans and Method Man-Trainwreck, The Wire_tv.This is a great action comedy featuring Key &amp; Peele in their first movie together since their TV show, Key and Peele, ended last year-it was on from 2012 until 2015. If you liked their TV show-I did-you should enjoy this movie. But be warned, it is rated R so it has certain things you wouldn't see on their show. Jordan and Keegan are cousins and Jordan finds a kitten, Keanu, and falls head over hills for it. After a mishap gets Keanu stolen, Jordan &amp; Keegan go in search for him, ending up at a local drug dealer, Method, who indeed has the little fur ball. Tiffany is Method's right hand enforcer. To get him back, Jordan and Keegan- who are now being mistaken for some real cold blooded killers, which Jordan and Keegan also happen to play-must do some work for Method which leads to some funny cameos-look for Will Forte, Anna Faris, George Michael and even Keanu Reeves gives his approval by making a vocal contribution. In case you were thinking that this is just a parody of the movie 'John Wick', it's not-in that movie, Keanu Reeves was going after the people that killed his dog. Jordan and Keegan have said that it was just a coincidence that their story lines were similar. This is just a plain old action comedy. Make sure that you stay after the end credits because there is a scene at the very end. It's rated "R" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 38 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While this isn't spec-cat-cular, Keanu is a lot of fun and a good film start for Key &amp; Peele</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Transitioning from television to film can be difficult for comedians. The world of television allowed them to take their style of comedy slower and to let their audience warm up and accept their brand for what it is. It may not always work, but this has been a fine basis to find out what kind of comedian one could be. Tim Allan worked well on Home Improvement as his "Tim the Tool Man" character gave him advantage to use his dry-style of high ego that was good at in his stand up. Same thing from Jim Parsons from Big Bang Theory as his speech tone made Sheldon's Asperger's arrogance likable. Both of these guys have had success on television, but making the next jump into film has proved hard.Today's movie considers the two comedians Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. They hit the scene as the creators of the Comedy Central sketch comedy, Key &amp; Peele. I have seen a couple of their segments and found them pretty funny. And while I have seen them in bit parts, hey have never headlined their own movie. That all changes with the parody of John Wick, Keanu.Clarence (played by Keegan-Michael Key) and Rell (played by Jordan Peele) are two friends in LA that different lifestyles. Clarence has a family, lives in a nice house and has really taken to then suburban culture while Rell is an aspiring photographer and pot smoker who lives in a small apartment in the city. After a bad break up, a little kitten (as the movie says, "the worlds cutest cat) shows up on Rell's doorstop. The two bond and Rell spends much of his time either taking cat photos for a personal calendar or training him to claw up pictures of his ex. He even makes Clarence say good bye when he and Rell go to catch a movie.When the two return home, the cat now named Keanu, has been taken in a burglary. They visit Rell's next-door neighbor, a pot dealer Hulka (played by Will Forte) who reveals that a local gang was responsible for the robbery. Clarence and Rell make it to their strip club where they pose as drug dealers just to see their leader Cheddar. The two manage to put on enough of a show where Cheddar (played by Method Man) agrees to give them the cat in exchange for participating in some drug deals.As far as first films go, Keanu is a pretty good start for Key and Peele. Both guys were in full comedic force, playing off their personalities at the right moments. They work a lot with the movie's "mistaken identity" joke, which happens to be the one long joke of Keanu. In the same vein of North by Northwest and Date Night, everything strives on how long our heroes can keep up their charade, to which they do well (one of my favorite jokes involves the use of the music of George Michael).As I said, Keanu is a one-joke movie that barley stretches it enough to the ninety minute running time. I would have liked to have seen another side plot of some sort, but at least the movie makes up it's thin plot by also having some fast-paced action whenever the guns are a blazing. You certainly want to make it to the end as the cat they got for Keanu is truly an adorable thing. This is the kind of animal that would have become a hit on YouTube. While I don't know I would infiltrate a gang to get it back, you definitely want to see these guys get their cat back.I'll give this eight cat paws out of ten. Keanu is totally self aware with how silly and dumb it is. Most people might miss that this is a parody of the darker John Wick. You don't have to know Key &amp; Peele before coming in as you'll quickly establish whose who. While this isn't spec-cat-cular, I enjoyed this pet story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 hours of my life wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was such a disappointment. 2 hours of my life wasted. Bad acting, stupid plot and definitely not as funny as the tailor implied. The acting was poor, the story is very unrealistic and a little insulting to the intelligence of the viewer. I'm sure they could have had a better plot, even if it revolved around rescuing a cute kitten. They could have still made it more realistic. I was watching it and thinking seriously! That's what the writers thought would be a good twist? To me a good comedy would be something like the hangover, okay it's unrealistic but it's still not stupid.. If the hangover is a 10 then Keanu is a -30. In summary, I think the actors, writers and directors could have done a better job, Such a disappointment and total waste of time. Don't watch it, there are plenty of good comedies out there and this is NOT one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the multi-talented comedians Key &amp; Peele, I went to the theater with a moderate expectation for this film, based on the limited reviews given to it. The trailer for this film leaves much to the imagination, which I can appreciate. The movie was filled with surprises (cast included) and was very unpredictable. The soundtrack made a great theme for the film and Keanu's cuteness never let down. Although great performances hold more value to me than special effects, this movie has all of the elements to entertain: Comedy, Action, Drama, Romance, Suspense and more. Every character is unique and well played. They demonstrate how powerful love can be, especially among timid folk. Whether or not you are a fan of Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele, comedies or kittens, you will enjoy watching this movie more than once. There is enough nudity, language and drug use to make this movie inappropriate for young viewers. If you're wondering about whether to wait through the credits... yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently dumped by his girlfriend, slacker Rell (Jordan Peele) finds some happiness when a cute kitten winds up on his doorstep. After a heartless thief steals the cat, Rell recruits his cousin Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key) to help him retrieve it. They soon learn that a thug named Cheddar (Method Man) has the animal, and he'll only give it back if the two men agree to work for him. Armed with guns and a gangster attitude, it doesn't take long for the hapless duo to land in big trouble.My take- Oh Key how doth you struggle so.....this feels like a five- minute storyboard that's outstayed its welcome. Keanu is the most recent victim of a grossly underdeveloped sketch extended to feature length (90 minutes in all). The lights should have come up at 10 though....The jokes are increasingly belabored after the cat leaves the scene and the aggressive voice Clarence adopts to dupe his new crew is amusing at first, but grows tiresome as he continues to grossly exaggerate it for cheap laughs. By the time Clarence screams "wordness to the turdness", the humor has all but evaporated. The same goes for an interminable running gag involving Clarence's intense devotion to George Michael.If there was a strong enough story to latch the jokes on to, Keanu might have worked. I think that viewers will watch the flick the first week of box office out of pure curiosity, then as word gets out of the lack of subsistence this movie has, will avoid the doors like the plague. THIS MOVIE FALLS FLAT ON ITS FACE. MOVIE GOERS BEWARE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Key and Peele make a movie!? of course it's funny!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you were about to kill yourself form depression after Key and Peele canceled their sketch comedy show, Keanu comes out, and so does the gun from your mouth.It's very funny. Key and Peele play two of the whitest black dudes ever, who have to rescue the cutest little kitten I've ever seen from a group of deadly gangsters lead by Cheddar (played by the legendary Method Man (who played a character called Cheese on The Wire coincidentally)It's a Rated R comedy that like most of the sketches on Key and Peele poke fun of how from from gangster this Dynamic Duo is. Peele plays a stoner for life who finally gets up from his couch in order to save a little kitten he found on his door step, while Key plays a goodie two-shoes who found his knack playing a fake gangster, despite his undying love for George Micheal.If you like Key and Peele, like I know we all do, the movie takes a similar approach as a lot of their sketches, only on a more massive level.Though it's not as funny as the sketch show, most likely just harder to sustain a story for 90mins, it's a good first effort that I hope to see more of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not enough Keanu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Key and Peele. I think their first season on Comedy Central was amazing, and even though the second season kind of died down a little, it still had its very funny moments. Keanu looks and feels like an hour and a half long episode of the star's main show, and sadly after a while it got a little old. My biggest problem with the movie, and this saddens me to say, is that a lot of the jokes were not funny, even by Key and Peele standards. Not only were they not funny, but the non-funny jokes were repeated constantly. That's not to say that all the jokes were un-funny, because there were some freaking hilarious ones too. I just expected more. My other problem was that I don't feel like they showed Keanu enough. Through the middle of the movie they are focusing on something else entirely. It was a part that was essential for the movie moving forward, but they went way to long with it, imo, and the cat was nowhere to be seen, heard, or even talked about in that period of time. I did love all the George Michael songs in the movie, and in fact a majority of the funniest moments from the movie had to do with him. Even though a lot of were not funny, the truly funny ones were hilarious, and overshadowed the un-funny ones. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Key and Peele's humor. I still have much respect for those two, and though I wasn't a fan of the movie, I am still a fan of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangsta cat vs. Mousecop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Key and Peele: the movie." The sales meetings for Keanu must have been even more hilariously quick and to the point than the ensuing film itself. "Plot? Who cares! People have watched them do so many things in so many sketches through the years, they'll easily spend an hour and a half watching them do one thing. Chase a cat? Sure! People love cats. I know. I can Internet." How right you are, sinister figurative corporate movie goons... That cat is damn cute.Populist simplicity need not be a bad thing, however, and Keanu is as hugely enjoyable as it is simple in scope. More than Liam Neeson (who gets a name check here, in, thankfully, the dynamic duo's only overt nod to their sketch show), they've clearly got the recent 21 Jump St. on the brain, as its similar vibes of undercover, role-reversing, safely crass buddy comedy lend the film its momentum. It's all pretty safe territory, working in scenes of familiar Key and Peele playing with the performativity of racial and masculine stereotypes (albeit without the sharpness or profundity of some of their more incendiary sketches), timely celebrity cameos, and making its mark as the second film of 2016 to ground extensive gags on the music of George Michael (you can practically hear Deadpool snickering in the background before stampeding off on a rainbow-excreting unicorn). There's even a good gag reinforcing the consequences and banality of the genre's wanton collateral damage and property destruction, which, while still amusing, would have landed better if Hot Fuzz hadn't neatly bagged the joke nine years prior.That said, what the film lacks in originality it more than compensates for in its nimble screenplay, and the sheer chemistry of its leads. Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele are just as outrageously funny and infectiously sweet here as in the best of their sketch work, and they're sensible enough to consistently own up to the sentiment of their characters to sell both the jokes and the story as a whole. Committing so unabashedly to the emotional core of their respective subplots (Key needs to learn how to unwind and find an identity outside his wife; Peele trades a failed obsessive relationship with a woman for one with a kitten) helps them feel infinitely more relatable and less rote, while gearing the film around Peele's fixation on his cat lends the film a tone bizarrely reminiscent of the superb Jean Reno mind-of-a-child action blowout Leon: The Professional (a feat reinforced by the slyly 90s synth-heavy musical score). The supporting cast contribute strong work as well, including intimidating posturing by Tiffany Haddish and Method Man, and amusing cameos by Will Forte and Anna Farris. Still, there's no question that it's the rapport between Key and Peele that lends the film wings, and their characteristically impeccable comedic timing suggests they've got several more promising collaborations left in them (please!).Also, did I mention how damn cute that cat was? Because it really was. Damn cute.The perfect example of a shallow star vehicle coasting perfectly on the sheer pleasure of its leads, Keanu is a fairly disposable but hugely enjoyable Friday night romp. The comedy action is fun and snappily orchestrated enough to get Key and Peele's cinephile bellboys exploding with exuberance, but the film's real joy lies in just giving them the freedom to interact, banter, spar, and do their thing. Like most of the great comedy duos, the draw of Key and Peele exceeds any framework they use as a springboard, and for fans or the uninitiated, Keanu is a tremendously fun and occasionally raucously funny night at the movies. So let's go ahead and green light Keanu 2: Gangsta Cat meets Mousecop.-7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cat comedy with Key and Peele had me hooked from both the concept and the actors. I enjoyed Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele's eponymous Comedy Central show so it is cool they are getting a chance to make movies. I can see that a kitten would be a difficult animal to work with but they pulled it off. Keanu is funny, action-packed, and has a very cute kitty running around throughout. There are some slow parts to Keanu and like most comedies, the plot is lacking, but overall it is an enjoyable time at the theater, especially if you are a fan of kittens like I am. Key and Peele play to average dudes, Peele's Rell is a stoner who is depressed because he just broke up with his girlfriend and Key's Clarence is a humble father whose wife leaves to go on a trip with their daughter and another man. Rell finds Keanu, the cute kitten on his doorstep, after the kitty escaped from a deadly drug hit. The rock-paper-scissor playing hit men are also played by the comedians.</fullReview>

The story is juvenile and sub-moronic, looking like it was created by a three-year-old.The entire concept is just plain dumb. It's inconceivable how someone could possibly come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining. The jokes are also completely lame. If you haven't seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. If your morbidly curious as to how bad this movie is, please don't make me describe it. Words can't express how completely awful this movie is. This isn't just bad as in being a bad movie. Even those have cohesion, if not entertainment value. This. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever told and multiply its badness level by 5,000, and you still haven't come close to how awful this movie is. After giving BRATZ the Movie one point, giving this movie one point seems like nothing short of charity. That's how bad it is. Did the producers and directors even take film classes? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film. It looks like some amateur high on paint thinner made this film. If you rented this, please take it back and ask for a refund.
