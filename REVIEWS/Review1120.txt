		<shortDescription>An entertaining and interesting movie ? but those who sneer at McDonalds or fat Americans are missing the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living with his vegan girlfriend, Morgan Spurlock decides to try and eat McDonalds for every meal for a month. At the same time he reduces the amount of exercise and walking to match that of the 'average' American to make for a fair experiment. After an initial bit of sickness he gets to enjoy the food and eats it three times per day. However after a week or two, his doctors begin to notice significant increases in body fat, cholesterol and blood pressure. Interspersed with this are interviews with experts on the nutritional value, marketing and impact of McDonalds and fast food generally.Several years ago I read the book Fast Food Nation and basically that ended my interest in the main fast food outlets and saw my consumption of processed foods drop quite a bit. I did not become a born again Christian and still eat rubbish food and am no role model for healthy living! However, what I have notice in the press and in the audiences for this film is a rather smug 'look at them' attitude as if this has no impact in Europe and Americans are some sort of freak show and nothing to do with us. This film may focus on McDonalds because it is the world leader in fast food which is high in saturated fats but if all you take from this film is pleasure at seeing McDonalds taking a kicking then you are missing the point. The film was challenging to me and I hope it was to many viewers ? but I have not eaten in McDonalds or Burger King since 2001 and a bad bout of food poisoning in early 2003 ended my ability to enjoy KFC. So why did I find it challenging? Well, because like many others, I eat too many saturated fats and, regardless of where they come from (oven foods, ready meals or fast food) I need to cut them down. Spurlock sends this message in a really entertaining way while also having good digs at McDonalds.His relaxed style is refreshing and allows the facts to speak for themselves. He clearly doesn't like fast food as a concept but he is no Michael Moore and is only slightly biased. He is certainly a lot more interesting than his vegan girlfriend who is one of those overbearing self-righteous types who look down their nose at anything. His good humour makes the film but it is the documentary rather than the gimmick that kept me watching. The facts on obesity do speak for themselves and they are frightening and all the more so when you actually sit and think about what you eat ? sweets, colas, ready meals, crisps, processed foods; whether it is salt, saturated fats or sugar, any of these foods spells trouble if they are not part of a balanced diet. My only fear of this film is that many viewers will look at McDonalds and say 'they are to blame, lets get them' and simply ignore that it is very easy to eat an unhealthy diet ? go to any supermarket and you'll find 'easy' food served up quickly but without the things your body needs. I was challenged because I can easily veg out for several days and be too tired to cook decent food and this reminded me why I need to ? hopefully many viewers will take that challenge and not just turn from one fatty diet (McDonalds) to another (ready meals).I personally didn't find the film as funny nor as shocking as many commentators have said it was but it was still consistently entertaining and interesting, true not the most scientific of experiments but that is not the point. True, very few people eat McDonalds every day but many, many people do eat foods high in saturated fats everyday even if they are not all happy meals and, in this way, maybe Spurlock's experiment wasn't so far-fetched and, lets be honest, like their own lobbyist said ? McDonalds are part of the problem. That the film has had an impact is undeniable ? the super size option has been removed and how many salads did you see in McDonalds this time last year? It may seem unfair and I can understand why McDonalds has been quick to counter it and call it unfair and, in a way it is unfair ? why should they carry the whole blame for an overwhelming surge in unhealthy eating, but I suppose that's what you get for being the market leaders!Overall this was a very entertaining film that mixes its gimmick well with humour but also a good core of a documentary with interesting talking heads who don't rant or rave but simply look to the figures in most cases. However, I would say this; if you only see this film to sneer at those visibly unhealthy or to tear a strip off McDonalds then you are missing the bigger point ? it is easy to eat unhealthy, cheap food no matter what brand it is ? eating it every day and having a poor diet is a major problem and, if nothing else this should challenge all of us to look at our own habits and not just point and laugh at others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a GREAT movie, but definitely a good and important one. (***)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fast food is good. I freely admit to running through fast food drive-thrus (Wendy's, Taco Bell and McDonald's being my top 3) often, sometimes several times a week. And I'm not the only one. I'm also one of the many millions of people in the country who are, uh...not thin. Think there's a connection?In "Super Size Me", a documentary from talented debut filmmaker Morgan Spurlock that manages to be both entertaining and horrifying, he attempts to draw a parallel between the fast food culture we live in and the rampant (and ever-increasing) rate of obesity in America. To do this, he launched into a little science experiment. A 33 year-old New Yorker in excellent health, he would eat nothing but McDonald's for an entire month, to gauge the effects on his body. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner at McDonald's and whenever they asked him to supersize, he would have to accept. Before starting, he consulted three doctors, a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist, and a general practitioner, all of whom said this experiment obviously wouldn't be GOOD for him, but that the damages would be minimal. Instead, the results were pretty shocking. Spurlock gained almost 30 pounds (over 10 in the first week), saw his cholesterol skyrocket, and experienced frequent nausea, chest pains, mood swings and loss of sex drive.During this month he also drove around the country, interviewing several different people on the topic (including a "Big Mac enthusiast" who has eaten over 19,000 Big Macs). His research on our fast food culture definitely yields some interesting information, especially when he interviews a group of 1st-graders, and more of them can identify Ronald McDonald than Jesus or George Washington. "Super Size Me" isn't perfect. It's a little repetitive and has a certain thinness to it (no pun intended!) that prevents it from being one of the truly great comedic documentaries of recent years like "American Movie" or "Bowling For Columbine". But even if it falls short of greatness, it's an entertaining and thought-provoking film (especially if you're, uh...not thin).Spurlock is a witty and engaging host (sort of like Michael Moore but not as much of a windbag), and I also liked his girlfriend (a vegan chef!) who looks on his experiment with a mixture of amusement, horror, and dismay. Just like we do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a report to do on childhood obesity, and I could use this documentary as one of my resources. May I say that I was glad that I watched this film. It is very terrifying what the fast food industry has done to this country. I'm not trying to bad rap them, they're a business. That's what they do, they try to make money. Do I agree with all the law suits going on with people blaming McDonald's and Burger King for making them fat? No, nobody is shoving the food down their throats. But there are so many people out there that are heavy users of fast food, and this documentary shows what the damaging effects can be of eating fast food. I gave up fast food, and have not had any for over a year now, and my health has boosted up majorly. Watching this film might make you want to stay away from the fast food restaurants, but if not, it'll make you think more about what you are eating.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary film by Morgan Spurlock asks the intriguing and topical question: What would happen to a normal 33-year-old man in perfect health who stands six feet two and weighs 185 pounds if he ate nothing but McDonald's fast food for thirty days?Well, it is not recorded that he shrunk. In fact, Spurlock, forsaking his vegan girlfriend's healthy cuisine, gained about 25 pounds and saw his cholesterol level shoot up to dangerous levels as he huffed and puffed his way three times a day through myriad Big Macs and fillet o' fish sandwiches, milk shakes, sodas, fries and other not-so-delicate items from the menu of the world's largest purveyor of fast food. He had hired three doctors and a registered dietician to check his vital signs and give him a thorough physical exam prior to this experiment in not-so-fine dining. Before the gorging was done all three doctors and the dietician advised him in the most uncertain terms for the sake of his health to stop eating the sugar-laden, fat-smeared, nearly fiber-free "diet." But Spurlock, trooper that he is, amid the McTingles and the McPukes, hung in there until the very end. I can report that he survived the experience. Whether the viewer will is another matter. If you yourself (God help you) are seriously overweight you might want to pass on this excruciatingly detailed misadventure under the Golden Arches. All that fat slapping against those waddling thighs (Spurlock mercifully fuzzed out the faces of his subjects, allowing us only body shots), all that jiggling flesh under those XXXL garments might be too uncomfortably close to home for some sensitive viewers.But was this a fair test of the harmful consequences of eating Happy Meals and being super sized? After all, Spurlock eschewed exercise during the experiment, and of course nobody (?) actually eats every meal at McDonald's as Spurlock did. Furthermore he actually doubled his normal caloric intake from about 2500 calories a day to about 5000. Regardless I think we can say that his experience was indicative.The real question to be asked here (and Spurlock asks it) is whether McDonald's (or as some have dubbed thee) whether McDeath's can be or should be held responsible for the epidemic of obesity that is sweeping the country. Spurlock implies that McDonald's should be held responsible at least for its advertising aimed at children. I agree with this. But I also think that adults ought to know what they are doing. If they choose to chow down at a place that loves to super size and under nourish them, perhaps they themselves should be held responsible for the consequences. However, some people feel that the advertising has been so insidious for so long and the food so addictive to susceptible individuals that McDonald's ought to be taken to court just as the tobacco companies have been.For more information on the epidemic, its consequences, and what can be done about it, I refer the interested reader to The Hungry Gene: The Science of Fat and the Future of Thin by Ellen Ruppel Shell; Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fastest People in the World by Eric Critser; and Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal by Eric Schlosser. Schlosser appears in one of the bonus features being interviewed by Spurlock. This interview is one of the highlights of the DVD. Schlosser is articulate, candid, and very well-informed.Spurlock of course is a performer as well as a film maker. His directorial style owes something to that of Michael Moore, and his playful on-camera muggings remind me of Ian Wright of PBS's Globe Trekker series.See this as an introduction to this most serious threat to the nation's health, especially as it affects children. Morgan Spurlock is to be commended for bringing the reality of the epidemic to the attention of the general public.By the way, "McTingles" are those highflying, scary feelings you get after rapidly injecting massive amounts of pure sugar and caffeine into your system, usually by gulping your way through a 64-ounce McCola--and to think when I was a kid, Coca-Cola came in six-ounce bottles. How ever did we survive? "McPukes" are self-explanatory.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. My daughter and I have been anxiously awaiting the release of this film since first reading about it months ago. Director (and lab rat) Morgan Spurlock takes on a fast food exclusive diet for 30 days and fills us in on the painful steps and sickening conclusion. Many have attacked Spurlock for picking on McDonalds or for not selecting the healthiest thing possible at every meal. These people are missing the point. He explains in the movie that McDonalds is the selection because they so dominate the fast food scene in the world and especially in Manhattan (where he lives). He also explains his meal selection by showing that most McDonalds orders include burgers and fries. Personally, I wondered more about his numerous milk shakes and parfaits. These seem to be the items that were a bit extreme. For the most part, Spurlock does an excellent job proving that we eat too much fast food, that it is very harmful to our bodies, and that there is evil at work conditioning kids that fast food is real food. The most frightening part of the story was the school cafeteria segment showing how kids eat when parents are not around and when school administrators pay no attention. This is the crux of our problems. The Georgetown professor compared it to the early candy cigarettes that condition kids that cigarettes create happiness. The same can be said for fast food and its happy meals and playgrounds. I did not agree too much with the doctor's comparison of Spurlock to Nic Cage in "Leaving Las Vegas". Cage's character was trying to commit suicide, while Spurlock was running an experiment and even considered quitting when the doctors were begging him to. Overall, a nice documentary without the total disregard for decency and the truth shown by Michael Moore in most of his films. I believe this should be required viewing for all junior high and high school students, as well as all expecting parents. This could be an educational tool to convince people to put a little more effort into their health.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Supersize Me" is an original, humorous, disgusting, shocking, and -- overall -- scary film. Spurlock takes us on a whirlwind tour of the downfall of American health through poor nutrition, padding a lot of information with anecdotal footage of his own foray into a McDonald's-only diet.What amuses me about the negative "reviews" for this film at IMDb is how the majority of the naysayers focus on exactly one thing: Spurlock's 30-day McDonalds binge. Heck, you could pick that much out of the trailer, and write a slanted review based solely on the imperfections of that particular plot device as an overall impact study and call it a day. I wouldn't be a bit surprised to find out that's what's happening, either. Certainly, anyone who's watched the political BS pour in to commentary for Michael Moore's documentaries knows how it's done. However, if you actually take the time to watch the film, you'll see something quite different emerge: a pattern of childhood indoctrination, poor nutrition, inadequate exercise, and skyrocketing obesity rates, that's sweeping this nation like a plague. Spurlock's self-afflicted experiment is, as I've mentioned, a continuity device that unifies the broad range of the film within a single case study. In the total scope of what's addressed in this film, it's a relatively small part, and many decry it as unrealistic. But Spurlock never claimed it was entirely realistic! He says as much in the film: he ate as much McDonalds in a month as *nutritionists* recommend one eat in 8 years or more. However, the problem is, a lot of Americans are eating as much fast food in a year as he ate in a month. What is the net effect going to be after five years? After 10? Spurlock further restricts himself to an AVERAGE amount of walking exercise, typical for our national population. The problems he exhibits after 3 weeks on this diet are NOT unique, they are the ones that people around the country are exhibiting in spades: weight gain, fatty liver, depression, inactivity. It cannot be overemphasized that this condition is widespread. Those arguing "personal responsibility" have to answer the question of how it is that suddenly, over the last 30 years, so many people have "chosen" a life of sickness and self-destructive addiction over one of health and common sense. The effect of mass-media indoctrination is an obvious factor, and the film addresses it well. Spurlock also takes us behind the scenes at school lunchrooms and gymnasiums around the country, where we find out a little bit of what's been happening to the kids of America. Is the "french fry" truly the only vegetable we can afford to serve to school kids, aside from the dubious catsup? How children could be expected to show "personal responsibility" above and beyond that exhibited by their likely-obese parents in such an environment of brand franchising, 2nd-rate meal "programs", and cutbacks in PE/recess time is a matter that I invite all fast-food apologists at IMDb to explore.For pure entertainment value, I have to deduct points for an uneven pace (especially near the end) and insufficient exposition from some of the people in the film. Still, "Supersize Me" stands as an indictment of the prepackaged food industry, its marketing hype, and its congressional lobbyists. It also serves as a warning to Americans trapped in demanding low-activity jobs which leave little time for lunch or exercise: don't eat the fries!8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock undoubtedly aspires to follow in the path of Errol Morris, Roger Moore, Joel Sucher and other leading documentarians. A young man with an adoring and beautiful girlfriend, he decided to unmask the evil of fast food and its impact on an increasingly obese America. That Americans eat too much fast food - too much of any kind of food - and eschew exercise is hardly news. But a full-scale documentary examining sloth by the bucket-full focusing on one major commercial phenomenon hasn't been done before.Spurlock decided to eat at McDonald's and only McDonald's for a full month. That's three meals a day with no other food source. Before launching on what actually was a death-defying trip (literally since for variety he consumed Mickey D's food in Texas, L.A. and a lot of other places) he had a full baseline workup with a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist and an internist who gets more screen time than his medical colleagues-he gravitates between being supportive and alarmist, the latter increasingly the right response to Spurlock's bizarre quest.Spurlock also has a nutritionist/dietician and a physical trainer to keep tabs on him. The only specialty missing, in retrospective one who might have been useful, was a psychiatrist. His girlfriend, a vegan chef no less, looks forward to the month with a mixture of humor and alarm."Supersize Me" has lots of scientific information on the nature of fast food and its impact on an America that eats out more than it dines at home, a change from a past where mom or a wife faithfully prepared most meals. Nutritionists decry the change in our culture, educators point out the impact of fast food in school cafeterias on kids' health, a former Surgeon General gravely decries the menace and the usual person-on-the-street suspects shock viewers by their bumbling inability to define such terms as "calories." A food industry spokesman is blithely unaware that he is being set up to look like an ass. And, of course, there are multiple shots of Spurlock vainly connecting with polite drones at McDonald's HQ seeking an interview which never comes. Does this all sound familiar?Spurlock's month-long consumption of McDonald's products gets old fast although he and the director try to add some novelty like showing him vomiting after downing a supersized meal. Periodic visits to get his bloods and body checked reveal the insidious impact of a bizarre diet. His puzzled internist tells us several times he's never before seen a liver compromised by a high fat diet.The problem, though, is that Spurlock is like those laboratory rats who develop arcane tumors after consuming the equivalent of something that no human could ingest in ten lifetimes. His peregrination from one Mc D's to another becomes boring as his health is clearly threatened and he stubbornly refuses medical advice to give it up.The best part of "Supersize Me" is the well-presented information on schools and fast foods and how a few are resisting the commercial tide that aims junk at kids from kindergarten through high school. Even inmates, we're told, can be well fed at no greater cost than the fat-laden diets these essentially sedentary wards of the state have shoveled at them.Technically, this is a well-filmed documentary with creative use of multiple images and graphs.I hope Spurlock has more ideas for documentaries. He's had a lot of time to think about it-an epilogue informs us it took him almost a year to regain his former fitness and health thanks, partially, to his vegan lover's detoxification diet.Oh, and McDonald's is phasing out supersized meals, a minor withdrawal in a serious public health war.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super Size Me is a great documentary. Enlightening and informative, it uncovers the fast food industry's conspiracy, that it's not about the people they serve, but its about the money we give them. They manufacture and process foods so that we HAVE to have more. "You just can't eat one chip" isn't just good marketing - they really put stuff in the food, even in our meat, to make it more addictive! The food industry in general is just another self-seeking money making machine, no better than the big companies that outsource their manufacturing to inhumane sweatshops in third world countries. They exploit the poor to feed their gluttonous and materialistic appetites.It took a lot of courage to go through with this experiment, risking your own body for a greater cause. This film will hopefully help change the way the fast food industry thinks and operates, exposing the conspiracy. If nothing else, Super Size Me will inspire you to eat right, exercise, and possibly become a vegan. At the least you'll be motivated to eat better.Though the film is a bit slow at times, considering the content, it's definitely worth seeing. As a result of watching this movie, I don't want to eat fast food EVER AGAIN!!!! We need more films and books like this one.Anyone who cares about what goes on in the world should see this film. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I thought it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about Morgan Spurlock's 2004 documentary "Super Size Me", I was pretty jaded, because common sense would dictate that if one eats fast food, they are going to have weight and health issues. Indeed, this is what happened to Spurlock, however the magnitude of the health deterioration was astounding.Presented in a sometimes humorous format, "Super Size Me" is an experiment conducted by Spurlock in which he would only eat McDonald's food, three times a day, with the caveats that he would have to eat everything off the menu at least once, and that he would limit his exercise to the amount of exercise the "average" American gets per day. Therefore, if he is nearing his walking limit for the day (measured by a pedometer he wears) he would have to grab a cab or find another way to get from A to B without walking. Predictably, he gains a lot of weight, (though the rapidness of the weight gain is alarming ? at first, 10 pounds in one week) but it is his actual health tests that are the most frightening. By the end of the second week, his doctors, who originally approved his experiment (with some reservation, naturally) were practically begging him to stop. Other than the experiment itself, "Super Size Me" is peppered with facts about the fast food industry and various interviews with industry insiders.I definitely found the film enjoyable, and somewhat informative (though having read Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation, a lot of the information was old news) but there was something missing that is hard to grasp; perhaps the film needed a little more substance and cold hard facts instead of watching him constantly eat. However, it is my understanding that the supplemental materials on the DVD are extremely informative and even include an interview with Schlosser, so perhaps more insight could be found there. Spurlock is a great presenter, however, because he is just a regular guy who has a great amount of charm and good camera presence. He was entertaining and likable enough to really illicit concern when his health was so obviously starting to become effected. Ironically, his girlfriend (and now wife) is a vegan chef, so it was mildly humorous to watch her preparing a detox menu for him using the most apropos vegetables to clean out his system.The aim for most documentaries is to present a thesis and then not only prove it, but provide supporting evidence. Though the thesis of "Super Size Me" was kind of a foregone conclusion, Spurlock manages to provide us with supporting evidence that doesn't make the entire film one big "Well, duh!" which is what I kind of expected, going into the film. If you have seen or plan to see this movie and are interested in the subject matter, I would highly recommend reading Schlosser's Fast Food Nation to gain even more insight on the business of fast food. It's a very interesting read and would make a good companion piece to this documentary. 6/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eating 5000 calories a day leads to weight gain? My God, let's give this man an Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was ever any doubt that Americans on the whole are not the sharpest knives in the utensil drawer, the massive success of "Super Size Me" at the box office settles it. I've wanted to write a review on this ridiculous film ever since I was forced to watch it in a college health course many years ago, but frankly there are so many things wrong with it that it was too daunting a task; since these complaints have already been mentioned in a host of other user comments, the best I can do is try to catalogue them in a single list, henceforth: THINGS WRONG WITH 'SUPER SIZE ME':1) Spurlock ate 5000 calories per day, for 30 days, with no exercise. The last person to go on this diet was Jabba the Hutt, and that was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Obese people generally become obese over long periods of time. What Spurlock did here is basically a suicide diet; whatever conclusions he reached about the devastating effects of fast food were at best irrelevant or dishonest.2) Not to mention he was eating the SAME foods every day, limiting the types of nutrients he received. The *only* people to do this wind up dead or in hospital beds, as almost happens to him in this film.3) Spurlock was a vegan before starting this experiment, meaning his body was completely unprepared for the insane amounts of sugars and fats he suddenly thrust upon it. No wonder his liver failed.4) The film makes no attempt to actually *connect* the obesity epidemic with fast food, although this is implicitly assumed from the very beginning. Not once does Spurlock bother giving us information as to what exactly the average obese person is eating, much less whether it has anything to do with their weight (you may have heard the saying about correlation not being equal to causation). Fast food has been around since the 1950s, yet the obesity phenomenon did not appear until the 90s, a strong indication that other factors such as genetics and extremely sedentary lifestyles are to blame (and yes, as the film points out, food portions at these restaurants have increased, but surely not to the point where they alone are responsible for the Goodyear-blimp levels of bodily girth seen today).5) The food at McDonald's is not unhealthy. I know that sentence may blow a mind or two, but the idea that a low-fat diet and increased fruit and vegetable intake is good for your health is a *myth* that was debunked in 2006 by three large studies undertaken by the American Medical Association (all readily available online). Spurlock's personal health crash was obviously caused by the first three points mentioned above. It's not as if we're living in Upton Sinclair's time where rat parts are ending up in our hamburgers; we actually have an FDA these days which determines the food we eat will not make us sick. Eat more, weigh more; eat less, weigh less; eat a variety of foods, receive a variety of nutrients: that is all anyone really needs to know about nutrition.(There's a ludicrous addendum to the DVD of this film called "The Smoking Fry" in which Spurlock puts McDonald's French fries in a jar, and after 10 weeks, they have not decomposed: this is supposed to be "proof" that they are some kind of devil food that will wreak havoc on your body. When I saw this in my college class, some dolt remarked, "If they're not decomposing in the JAR, you really have to wonder what they're doing in your BODY." Well, what do you THINK they're doing, genius? Dancing? Your body simply absorbs the nutrients it can use and discards the rest, like it does with anything else. You don't need to be terrified of fried potatoes.)6) The film is shoddily made. It adopts the same smug, juvenile, provocative tone of Michael Moore's documentaries, but whereas Moore is actually (I'll admit) a talented filmmaker who can create moods by editing his scenes together effectively, Spurlock simply throws a bunch of abrasive cartoon imagery and pop music together which never adds up to a coherent style and is more or less an insult to the form.So there you have it, all the most egregious problems with this film in a single package. And yet for some reason, none of these were enough to stop it from getting rave reviews, box office success and an Oscar nomination, leading me to wonder if I could have similar success making a documentary wherein I bash my head repeatedly against a wall for 30 days and prove that doing so leads to brain damage; not only would I probably be drowning in laurels, but I'd be well prepared for a long and fruitful career in Hollywood. I give this failure of a film 0/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a documentary for those who hate documentaries. Funny, relatively fast-moving, and a cautionary tale without being preachy. Spurlock is a funny guy and treats his subject with good humour, making us laugh and shake our collective heads over our own poor decision-making. There is no "Ronald is Satan" message here, and no "look how bad Americans are." It is simply a down-to-earth, well paced, insightful and humorous look at how insidiously entrenched The United Corporation of America has become in our institutions and minds, and the consequences therein.One of my favorite scenes was a peek into a school where the now-famous (and irritating) Jared Fogel (you know...fat guy becomes skinny guy !thanx! to Subway) does a "get fit" speech. Spurlock interviews a mom and her significantly overweight daughter, and the daughter actually laments that of course SHE cannot lose weight like Jared because...and this is priceless...SHE cannot afford to buy/eat two Subway sandwiches a day!

		<shortDescription>Interesting But Misses Out On A Very Valid Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year seemed to be a battle between FARENHEIT 9/11 and SUPER SIZE ME for winner of the most controversial documentary award . I know Moore's style , I know Moore's agenda but knew nothing of Morgan Spurlock . Right from the opening scenes of Spurlock's documentary I was impressed by his style , he does engage the audience without resorting to polemical opinion disguised as fact and for that we should be thankful . Spurlock decides to find out why Americans are becoming obese by living on nothing but a menu from a certain fast food chainSo far so good , but is he missing a point I wonder ? American fast food chains are notorious for serving processed food with an incredible high fat high sugar content which probably won't do you any good health wise . But they also serve food in very large portions which is also very good value for money . Think about it for a moment - You go into a fast food chain with a couple of dollars and have a meal high in fat and sugar but the meal itself is relatively cheap . Would you rather spend 50 dollars getting a single meal in an expensive restaurant and leave the table still wanting ? I think most people visit a fast food chain to kill the hunger pangs and still have enough money to pay the bills . Watching Spurlock vomit because he's eaten too much is a kind of back handed compliment to a certain food chain for selling extra large portions Unlike Moore Spurlock doesn't appear to have an axe to grind and does try to be objective . He makes the point that the high rise in obesity may be down to the fact that many American states don't have a compulsory sports syllabus in schools . Certainly this doesn't help to keep children in good health but he then points out another fact that one of the few states that does have compulsory school sports - Illinois - has the third highest rate for childhood obesity in America . Cause and effect ? The problem I do have with SUPER SIZE ME is that Spurlock doesn't exactly hammer home one very valid point - Perhaps the only valid point - as to childhood obesity and that's parenting . When you were a child what was your parents attitude to what you eat ? I know what mines was : If you didn't like what was put down in front of you then too bad and I think perhaps in the Western world this attitude has disappeared , parents are far more likely to give into their children's demands nowadays in search for an easier life . If they like chomping on burgers then so be it if it keeps the little ones quiet . Remember what I said about big portions and cost ? It doesn't really matter if the food itself is far from nutritious as long as it's plentiful and affordable which means for a lot of parents on low incomes it's a practical choice . Over here in Britain the government are actually discussing putting a tax on junk food . Would hitting parents in the pocket change their attitude ? Is it morally right for a government to do this anyway ? Why is healthy organic food infinitely more expensive than unhealthy processed muck ? Just a couple of points that aren't addressed So SUPER SIZE ME is an interesting documentary but a rather flawed one that often works better as entertainment than as a serious film making . It can be informative but doesn't really come up with any answers and blames fast food companies rather than parents for childhood obesity .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The startling conclusion of this documentary is that if you stuff yourself with nothing but junk food and take no exercise for 30 days you'll get fat, and your body chemistry will be so banged up that on paper you'll look more like a flashlight battery than a human being..Spurlock must be an interesting guy. The first time he tries to eat a super sized meal at McDonald's he pukes out of the car window. I thought the air remained tangy throughout the rest of the movie.He drives himself and his crew around the country, seeming to enjoy being on camera, winking and smirking at it as he eats. But soon enough the diet begins to get to him. He's just not the same energetic guy he used to be. He complains of headaches, of a gassy feeling, of depression. His girl friend tells us he no longer has the sexual energy he used to have. (She has to get on top.) It isn't that Spurlock can't have erections anymore. Oh, they're there alright -- and solid too. But, somehow, he's just not the same guy he used to be. By this time I was laughing so hard to was a little difficult to follow the on screen spiel.The PR people at McDonald's get a few minutes of screen time trying to explain that people should be free to make choices. They make asses of themselves, of course. Kids are shown as limp airheads who gobble down junk foods at school lunches and afterwards can recognize Ronald McDonald but not Jesus.Everything looks pretty bad for McDonald's. But the movie is a fraud, to an extent that only its makers can determine. What is a "calorie" he asks a dozen or more people. Nobody knows. A dozen people who are asked what a calorie is -- from prepubescents to mature adults -- do not have any idea what a calorie is. He must have asked two thousand people to identify a calorie before finding twelve who were dumb enough to have no idea.There was one talking head that I listened to with real interest, a man whose identity I now forget but who was on screen for a minute or two. He observes that smoking was once epidemic and that now smokers are being "hectored" constantly. How long, he wonders, before we begin to hector the large people among us? It's a question with some point. It's corollary is: Why do we hate people whom we define as weaker than ourselves? Why do some of us enjoy humiliating and punishing others who are defenseless? Why do we buy supermarket tabloids and gloat over pictures of celebrities now grown old or fat? I have a feeling the answer lies deep in human nature and if anyone ever looks into it, it will taste worse than prune yogurt. I also found the statistics kind of enlightening. God, we collectively put away a lot of sugar and salt! But one of the nutritionists had me puzzled, saying the most of the sugar Spurlock had put away was refined, implying that this is the worst kind. I'm no nutritionist but I'd thought that all starches -- as complex as pasta or as simple as raw sugar -- were broken down into monosaccharides in the gut before being absorbed. What I mean is that the body can't tell organic Tupelo honey from a Moon Pie as far as its sugar content is concerned.I may be wrong on this point but it really doesn't matter in context because Spurlock's movie is rather obviously so wrong on so many others. I hope nobody is going to call this an "experiment." Let's call it a "stunt," which is what it is. An engaging one, but a trick nonetheless. So Spurlock feels depressed after so many days of McDonald's. You want me to feel depressed? Tell me that I will be applauded by an audience of alfalfa sprout mavens at Sundance, make a million dollars, and become famous, if only I can truthfully say that I feel depressed. I guarantee you that at the end of a few days I'll be on the brink of tears. As insurance, I can even manage to dig up a girl friend who will testify that although I have erections with the dimensions of Sequoia trees and the tensile strength of titanium, they are somehow, I don't know, just not the same as they used to be.Sometimes I wish Michael Moore had never made any successful movies. The imitations are beginning to roll in. What next? The TRUTH behind the Miss America Pageant? For what it's worth, I've spent thirty years doing research in the behavioral sciences, and in my opinion this guy not only cooked the books but did a much clumsier job of it than I've ever done. Gives me a warm glow to be able to say that. Feel as if I'd just eaten a raw free-range organic broccoli spear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The latest statistics say that two out of every three Americans are overweight, and about one out of every three of those persons overweight is obese. Morgan Spurlock, an MTV alumnus, decides to eat three meals a day at McDonald's for thirty days to see how it will affect him. He must eat every item on the menu at least once during the thirty days, and he must super size anything he orders when suggested to by employees. A lot of people are criticizing Spurlock for setting up a situation where the predetermined outcome is maximized by his decidedly biased decisions. He doesn't exercise, and he limits his incidental walking to a mile per day. This may be partially true, but Spurlock wisely chooses a humorous approach to his topic; because, the reality is few people really want to discuss or listen to how overweight they are and why.Taking a more serious, preachy tone would wear down audience interest quickly. Besides, the film isn't just about what happens to Spurlock after eating at McDonald's for thirty days, the results of which far exceed his three medical consultants' worst expectations. The film also attacks corporate America in general in the way it tailors its advertising to influence the most vulnerable Americans: children. From kids that know Ronald McDonald better than Jesus and George Washington to school lunch programs that mercilessly serve junk food to the nation's children, Spurlock illustrates how we are our own worst enemies. As in any good documentary type film, there are always incidental moments that reveal more truth about its subjects than the filmmaker could script. One such moment is a conversation with an obese fourteen year old girl and the Subway advertisement guy. In between each humorous episode or interview, Spurlock serves us some facts and statistics about our love affair with and ignorance about fast food in small portions, along with a side order of humor. He doesn't let us off the hook, as he repeatedly demonstrates that personal responsibility must play a role in our lives when it comes to nutrition, just like it does in anything else we do. Spurlock stops short of a Michael Moore, "in your face" approach, and is successful on his own terms in persuading the audience to take heed about fast food without being heavy-handed. McDonald's scaled back its super size menu shortly after the film's release, although corporate bigwigs claimed it had nothing to do with this film. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning May Contain Spoilers I don't think Super Size Me was intellectually honest. I think the "rules" that he used in the 'documentary' were used to exaggerate his results. Everyone knows that McDonalds is generally unhealthy and that if you were to eat every meal at McDonald's and Super Size them every time it was suggested you would gain weight and suffer from a variety ill effects. Super Size Me works from the presumption that people are incapable of choosing what to eat on their own and that, if given the chance to spend more and eat more that they always will - even if that means overeating to the point of vomiting.Super Size me tries to be to McDonalds what Silent Spring was to DDT only to less effect because it works from a false premise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock's documentary, "Super Size Me," is an eye-opening look at the world of fast food, and the McDonald's company in particular. Through the use of humor and statistics (some frightening), we discover how the fast food industry has ingrained itself into the American psyche and has contributed to the ever-increasing rate of obesity in our nation. The most shocking aspect of this film was seeing the effect this has on our most valuable asset: today's children.Until I watched this movie, I did not realize how many public schools have allowed commercial fast food restaurants to infiltrate their school lunch programs. When offered fast food for lunch every single day, accompanied by the vending machines filled with candy, chips and soft drinks, America's children are hard-pressed to find a piece of fresh fruit or a true vegetable on their lunch trays, unless they bring one from home. Parents who send their children to school without a packed lunch need to view this film in order to educate themselves about what their children are REALLY being served at lunchtime. Parents trust that the schools will feed their children well, and that trust is being betrayed on a daily basis. What adult would want to eat lunch at the same fast food restaurant every single day? What adult would think that is healthy? Yet that is exactly what we are doing to the children by allowing the commercial restaurants to provide the school lunches.At the same time the children's Physical Education courses and recess -- i.e. exercise time -- have been dramatically slashed. Some kids get less than 20 minutes away from their desks each day. By contrast, when I attended grade school in the 1980's, we had P.E. class every day for a full hour plus three recess periods of 20 minutes each (less if we misbehaved). That's 2 full hours of exercise time during the school day! And it was a very important 2 hours; it was time to burn off our naturally abundant childhood energy, to strengthen muscles, to forge friendships with children who don't live near us, to learn the rules of new sports and games, and to build social skills like good sportsmanship, team-building, anger management, and leadership. I pity today's grade schooler who gets no time at all outside of the classroom to pursue these all-important activities. As any parent knows, a child needs vitamins, minerals, fresh air, and lots and lots of exercise. Because so many of today's children receive none of these, it is no wonder that so many are overweight and prone to illness. Children who grow sluggish and sleepy from their fat-laden, fast food meals are often labeled "lazy" by their parents and teachers. Meanwhile, other children are anxious and restless for exercise, but they are given drugs instead of recess to help them sit still. These children need our help! Thanks, Morgan.

		<shortDescription>Why'd you think they call it junk?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excepting an obsolete form of Chinese boat, the word "junk" is generally applied to only three things: heroin, rubbish ... and fast food.Determined to get under the sagging skin of America's dysfunctional eating habits by existing on a McDonald's-only diet for one entire month, Morgan Spurlock deftly shows how closely these three are related.Eating three squares a day from the chain's menu and going super size whenever he's invited to do so, it's a long and painful odyssey as he throws up his first lunch and surfs downhill on a tide of grease from there.Even with regular medicals, it's not long before the processed fats, sugar and salt are turning his liver to pat, piling on the flab, killing his libido and leaving him depressed, lethargic and fighting off headaches relieved only by the next fix of junk food.In fairness to the Golden Arches, Spurlock guns for America's eating habits and the fast food industry as a whole, but there's little doubting McDonald's is among the worst offenders ? the way it ruthlessly markets itself at children is perfectly captured with a montage of Ronald McDonald capering with the kids to Curtis Mayfield's Pusher Man.In a gluttonous First World intent on filling its boots with unhealthy, unethical garbage, Spurlock's is an intelligent, perceptive and often droll plea for sense and moderation ? not to mention essential viewing for parents and anyone else who thinks the siren song of fast food is just a bit of harmless fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I'm not sure I have a good handle on the difference between documentaries and performance art. It is blurred enough whenever Michael Moore or Ken Burns take control. Here, the situation is even more confusing. I think that is the intent and why this little thing has appeal.The documentary half of this Frankenstein concerns the international epidemic of obesity that is overwhelming the industrialized world. The numbers and images are memorable enough to form the basis of an essay.The complexity of this half evaporates when it is reduced to a matter of blame, as is always the case (the reduction to blame and the unworthiness of the result). Pictures of chunky kids notwithstanding, there are some interesting fundamental problems here revolving around whether we are capable as a society of making decisions; whether 'freedom' doesn't, even can't work.But the other half of this is performance art. A professional actor binges on McFood and tells us (as effectively as Chris Guest might) about getting the McTingles and the McPukes. His doctors raise the alarm. Will he abandon the project, his mother begs. His girlfriend testifies that she can tell that McErections aren't as good.All this is amusing enough to occupy your time, I suppose, if you don't have much of a life. The problem is that the latter half masquerades as the first. Unhappily, we cannot tell the difference, and the reason is the real scandal: political 'education' (and talk radio) has taught us that anecdote and metaphor are reasonable substitute for the real thing.So one leaves the theater feeling that just like McDonalds brands its product with a clown, so has this film branded the case against McDonalds with a clown. Same same.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

It always seemed to me, if you think fast food isn't good for you, well then the obvious solution is not to eat it. Guess I was wrong. Apparently, people don't have free will. Apparently, we are somehow forced to consume copious amounts of junk food. We have no will of our own... at least according to this incredibly ridiculous movie...

		<fullReview>I never thought I'd see a documentary as unsettling as this based on fast food products. It's so suspenseful at one point that I actually asked myself whether this really was a mere documentary or a dramatic film.As crazy as it may sound, director Spurlock underwent a one month long "therapy", consisting of a McDonaldesque menu - at all times of the day. It may sound mesmerizing for some, but, in the end, the results are frightening.The issue of being fat is a modern tale in America. When people are too well off and lack one or another essential trait of a normal human being strange things start happening. What's so delightful in a very grotesque sort of way is that Spurlock doesn't only sacrifice himself on the altar of junk food in order for the public to admire some devastating effects on the human body, but he does it with style. Structured on chapters and similar in the making with Moore's "Bowling for Columbine", Spurlock's film is still enjoyable and pretty to the point. It's serious when it has to be, amusing when it can and extremely captivating. All in all, one hell of a "documentarian" ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Help! Help! The mean old corporations are stuffing me full of food! Save me government! Save me from myself!" - That's the message of this movie so it's sure to be a big hit with the fascist proponents of socialism that run amok at events like Sundance. (No wonder it was such a hit) Will this flick be anything more than a joke to clear thinking individuals? Doubtful!The events of this movie seem highly suspicious. He claims to have gained 25 pounds in 30 days. To those who are not informed, the human body must have a surplus of 3500 calories to gain a pound of fat. This means he must have had a surplus of over 2900 calories per day. According to the McDonald's website a Big Mac - the universal yardstick of unhealthful food - contains 600 calories. To get that surplus you'd have to eat 4.8 extra Big Macs! Remember this is a SURPLUS, it means you have to eat that in addition to the normal amount of calories you'd have to eat in a day which would likely be somewhere between 2200-2500 for him! This means the guy's daily caloric intake would have to be over 5000 calories a day! The movie doesn't give the impression that his goal was to consume as much food as possible in 30 days. Instead, his goal is show how McDonald's used some sort of mind control to force him to eat what he did. When asked if he wanted it Supersized, he was a victim and had absolutely no power to say no. He wants to show how easily others can fall into this evil corporate trap! I hate to say it, but this seems to be a film on par with a Micheal Moore *ahem* documentary where inconvenient facts are ignored and convenient ones are fabricated on the fly. Gullible people who buy into his conclusion will not care about little details like facts, but anyone with an open mind will probably enjoy the ride like a B horror movie and feel smugly superior to those who actually bought it.I'll save you a few bucks and explain why Americans have a problem with obesity. Unlike other cultures we have quick access to great tasting cheap food (Kidney Pie? Not here!). The American economy is the most modern in the world meaning we've "outsourced" labor-intense tasks to machines. From cubicles to robotics in factories to remote controls our modern life has reduced the amount of physical work we need to do. Healthful (and far cheaper) foods are still plentiful, but millions do not have the willpower to forsake short term convenience for their long term health, so when combined with a lifestyle that requires less physical output we gain weight.Duh - not a difficult concept! Those who choose to be fit can still do so, and those who choose short term gratification will become a pile of lard.BTW, if society ever degenerates to the point where people can successfully sue food corporations for their own dumb choices, will that mean corporations in the fitness industry will be able to sue their customers for their successes? Think about it; if you acquire great health from Gold's Gym shouldn't Gold's have a *right* to some of the wealth you will accumulate because of your improved health? You'll live longer (meaning you can work longer) and you'll need less of that expensive health care! Surely if a corporation can be at fault for making you obese then a corporation can be at fault for making you healthy! If they are going to be financially responsible for obesity then they should gain from "giving" people health! Of course that will never happen because this obesity nonsense if rooted in the anti-capitalist movement. What a shame we have so many ignorant people in this country who only see one of those two situations as absurd.</fullReview>

My freshman health class consisted of us seeing this for most of the year and the end of the year project for us was to write an essay on this. I didn't write one praising this like I'm sure most of my peers did, but the straight up truth about this self-declared "accurate documentary".Morgan Spurlock did what the description said. He would eat nothing but McDonalds for 30 days to see what would happen to him, highlighting the health consequences of over indulging in fast food--trying to explain the "obesity epidemic" that is taking place in the United States.But, what goes down has been proved to be incorrect and wrong. In a documentary responding to it, it shows that Spurlock couldn't have gained the amount of weight he did in that amount of time. And with his nutrition logs for that times never being disclosed, there's no way to prove anything.The documentary, by Spurlock, implies that people who eat fast food are lazy people who won't lift a finger if it doesn't mean picking up a hamburger. Spurlock's documentary also suggests that people who eat fast food are stupid and the fast food industry is holding a gun to our heads to get that value meal or "super size"; which isn't true. While having poor nutrition can lead to health problems, SSM undermines the intelligence of not only fast food eaters, but the viewer in general.This documentary contains very false information and paints Americans as moronic, lazy fools who have weak wills. If you want a documentary on fast food, go watch Fathead, which is what Super Size Me should have been. No lies. No filler. No bologna.Don't waste your time on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not just about what you would think (over eating). If you look closely you will see the conscious attempt to edit objectively to present, for the 1st time ever, a range of new/candid opinions from experts. This is the real shock and what sets it apart from anything Michael Moore has tried to rock the world with (his work can be subjective and forcefully moralistic).When you look at the categories presented in 'Super Size Me' (represented by clown paintings), you glimpse a personal opinion, then the following footage shows simple images that can be linked with the caption, without forcing any ideas. He never preaches, which is refreshing and startling, as it leaves you wanting to know more after the film has ended.This film is a gem because it lets you think what you want from an array of tasty choices. The audience I was with all responded with laughing, gasps, choking, coughing, and squeaks at different sequences, as well as some of the same. This is unusual for cinema, since films are normally engineered to make audiences react in the same way to the same stimulus, but not this one.Depending on who you are, what stage in life and what your personal battle is, you will see what is relevant to you. It has a fortune cookie ability to gift you what you need, right now. It's more about fast insight, than fast food.My Rating: 10/10 at every level. The editing, especially, displays superior understanding of psychology.Who should see this film? Everyone! Even people who don't eat fast food, because of the presentation, it can be seen as metaphorical for other issues (personal and social) that need addressing. But... there are discussions directly relating to sex, so it may be unsuitable for younger children.Why should you see this film? You will know why, once you have seen it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock directs and stars in "Super Size Me", taking his life into his own hands for 30 days to see what can happen if you take "fast food" to the extreme. I was impressed by a couple of things. First, he did it right, getting several physicians in different specialties to examine him before and, at several stages, during his "experiment." That was, with blood work, weight, and BMI, the data necessary to make a more objective evaluation of his ordeal. And second, he presents a very balanced viewpoint. He does not say everyone who eats fast food will suffer from it. He states that his eating nothing but McDonald's foods and drinks for 30 days is an extreme. But he did find a man who eats almost nothing but Big Macs. And he found people, including students, who were very regular patrons of fast food joints.As would be expected, he gained about 24 pounds in the 30 days, and his blood-work went from just about "perfect" to what one physician termed "toxic." He was even encouraged by them to terminate his experiment before 30 days. In addition to the measured effects, he also reported "feeling bad", but after a time just grabbing some fast food made him feel better, almost as if he were addicted to it.I am fortunate. I very rarely eat fast food, except when on trips. (Hmm ... that may explain why I sometimes feel poorly when traveling.). I limit my intake of fats and sugars, and exercise regularly. But this nutrition is a real health issue, and now all over the world since fast food joints like McDonalds are all over the world. The biggest problem may be with the children who are growing up on fast food, because their parents are too busy to prepare healthy meals.I am glad Spurlock made this film. I think it has had an impact already. He's glad he made it too, costing about $300,000 and taking in over $11 Million already, plus DVD profits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Size This!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a landmark documentary I think every American should see Supersize me is an incredible chronicle of fast food and junk food in general in America. Morgan Spurlock is the documentation who is behind all of this. I knew McDonalds was bad for you, but I did not realize this bad, but aside from the McDonalds aspect of the film there is a lot of good information in here on how ingrained unhealthy food is in this country, the film is quite incredible. I knew that lobbyists and the like controlled much of the law making process. But I never knew how ingrained they were. The film is centered around an experiment by Morgan Spurlock. What he did was spend a month doing no exercising, and eat McDonalds for the entire month. The rule he had was he has to eat everything on the menu, and every time he was asked if he wanted it supersized he had to say yes. He enlisted the help of a number of different doctors, to look at his progress. Also in the film are various facts about the food industry in America, and various interviews, ranging from health food advocates to lobbyists for various restaurants and stores. Not only is the documentary very informative it is well produced. And in a time when obesity is an increasing crisis this movie is so important, it shows the problems that are out there, and how it sadly seems like these restaurants and stores want us to get fat, and sadly after watching this movie, you have to wonder if that's the case. A lot of people that are critical of this movie say that it is inaccurate. I disagree. I know a lot of people that are or were like him, I was. There was a time when I did little or no exercise, and I ate a lot of fast, or unhealthy food, food that was from McDonalds, or other bad food. A lot of America is like this, and this is a problem that needs to be corrected. There are stories in this film about people that were like him too. There are other facts about fast food that I can identify with, but I will not give it away as I do not want to spoil the film for anyone. Also a lot of people say why is it that he did not cover Taco Bell, Burger King, and other similar fast food restaurants. He said in later interviews that all fast food is as unhealthy as McDonalds. The reason it is so critical of McDonalds is because it is the largest and most recognizable fast food chain in the world. And in America the food is the most unhealthy compared to food served in other McDonalds restaurants around the world, and I know this from experience as well, haven eaten at McDonalds' in Germany, and what can I say? The food was actually good! What a surprise. McDonalds has by far the largest profit of any fast food chain, so the largest fast food company is definitely the most important. Even if you disagree with what the movie is trying to say, it is an interesting movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock created this documentary as a commentary about obesity in the United States. He does this by eating only McDonald's for 30 days. He lines up a few physicians to help him with his experiment. Morgan then attempts to document his display of how unhealthy and toxic fast food is.It was entertaining and had glimmers of information. However, he presented his little experiment's results as being proof of the extreme harm of fast food. The fact is that he did a few things in his methodology that are highly questionable and lead to exaggerated results. (And I am someone who eats often at McDonald's.) One, what exactly did he eat day in and day out? Did he intentionally eat the worst of everything? Shakes seemed to be an overly regular item in his diet. Look at the Big Mac lover. Two, his level of sickness through his blood work may also have been a result of toxic shock in essence. He went from a highly health conscious diet to immediately binging on McD's. The body does not take that kind of drastic change well at all regardless of what the change is. My own blood work does not come anywhere close to those numbers in the movie. I'm not saying they are wrong, I'm saying that he shocked his body and it rebelled.Three, he went from staying actively in shape to doing nothing. Again, the body does not react well to immediate changes. This is the same concept that runners use when they carbo-load. The body overreacts to drastic changes. Anyone who lives in places like Minnesota, North Dakota or other states that have drastic weather changes also understand this. When the temps change quickly the body does not accept those changes easily, but when the change is gradual the body can adapt. Morgan shocked his body in a number of ways thus compounding any results AND ruining the validity of his evidence. The result is almost shocking. What I did learn is that Morgan is a drama queen, his girlfriend is a "granola" vegan chef (ick) and that expose documentaries are getting worse by the year. For entertainment this was a decent flick. But, since it calls itself a documentary it has to be downgraded. Grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have had an overeating problem my entire life.I have frequented all of the big name fast food joints you can name.I have always known that this was not the healthiest food in the world,but something over the years has always kept me going back.When I rented this film,I pretty much knew what to expect going in.Something told me that this man was going to really drive the point home about how unhealthy this food really is.Really,I was hoping to be scared into going on a permanent diet.It worked,at least for the most part.I watched this film about two months ago,and I have been on a diet since.I won't lie and say that I haven't been to a fast food place since.I have.I get in a hurry sometimes and don't have time to grab anything that's healthy.Part of the reason these places exist is because they know we often get in a hurry and have little choice but to get something that's made quickly. For the most part though,I have eaten a lot healthier since viewing this,and I have shed pounds and am feeling much better,though there is a long way to go.This movie frightened me as well as any horror flick has over the years.Who would have thought a documentary could do that?I did object though to the scene where the film's maker,Morgan Spurlock,lost his lunch out of his car window.I don't believe it was necessary to see this.Otherwise,it was a true eye opener.It won't be going in my personal video collection though.Once is enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Super Size Me" (with "super size" used as a verb, not an adjective) is an obviously agenda-driven and skewed documentary all about its creator and his one month fast food binge designed to prove that McDonalds food is not all that when it comes to health. Indie maker Spurlock spends one month chucking down nothing but Mickey D's chow all around the U.S. while serving up heaping helpings of fat statistics, man-in-the-street interviews, info about his progress from doctors and nutritionists, and repeated attempts to hear from the other side of his war on obesity, the McDonalds corp. If you don't know that eating at McDonald's is not healthy eating, this flick is a must see. Otherwise you might want to give it a look just to see what happens to Spurlock as he pukes up the fast food, packs on the pounds, and, according to him, suffers from a vast array of symptoms. In short, take Fahrenheit 911, substitute Morgan Spurlock for Michael Moore and McDonalds for Bush and Iraq and you have "Super-size Me". Not documentary film making at its best but a fun watch anyway. (B-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, who's hungry?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock, a filmmaker, took on a funny, though definitely audacious task- start out relatively healthy, and then plunge into a three course meal-a-day plan for a month at the quintessential fast-food restaurant on the planet. As one who was a slave to McDonald's quick fix of burgers and fries and so on (and got out of it, thank goodness, though I haven't let go as much as slowed down), I found the documentary on not just McDonalds but health in America to be enlightening, if not a great look at it. Nothing about the film has me ranking it as one of the best in the genre, however it did go over my expectations. I thought when it first came out in theaters, 'what would be the point of doing this, as I know that McDonald's is the nutritional equivalent of watching wrestling from the WWE?' Well, it turns out that, like a sort of Michael Moore persona, Spurlock goes into the topic against all odds, and in the process tries (and just does not quite get) to talk to the powers that be.Inter-cutting between the separate days Morgan goes through quarter pounders and Big Macs (sometimes getting sick in the process), he interviews kids in schools (some of which know Ronald McDonald and don't know Jesus), nutritionists, a lawyer responsible for representing the kids in the lawsuit against McDonalds, and one particular "Big Mac Guru", one of a few laugh-out loud parts of the film. Soon I knew where the film was headed, and like a Moore film, the angle was assuredly biased. But then again, I'm not sure I would like, or at least respect, the film if it was hypocritical of its message. By the climax, Spurlock hits his points across, and it's done in a well-presented serio-comic way - it gets your mind thinking about the way you eat, whether or not you're healthy (if you do, it may be preaching to the choir), but is also entertaining with animation bits thrown in with the hard facts. By the way, if you do seek this film out on DVD, whether or not you have already seen it, the special feature called "The Smoking Fry" is near priceless. A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not bad. I have just watched this on TV in Britain. Very much in the style of Michael Moore, but without the attempted interview with McDonalds' head of PR, which could have been fun! An awesome array of stats -- too many really to take in. But the overall lasting impression is the long-term impact of all this junk people are eating: I think he said that it is estimated that 1/3 kids born in 2000 will end up diabetic if present trends continue. I feel the most interesting aspect was the brainwashing point -- kids who do not recognize other famous faces like George Washington or Jesus, but instantly name Ronald. Or adults who could not recite the Oath of Allegiance (I think), but could come out with McDonald's advertising slogans. It is quite scary to think how manipulated people's brains are. If these companies continue in their efforts to dominate the world's nutrition, we are in for some major problems in the not too distant future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead (preferably not a McDonalds!)*Avoid At All CostsDocumentary film-maker Morgan Spurlock attempts to eat nothing but McDonalds for a month.He sets himself a few ground rules:1.)He must try everything on the McDonalds menu at least once.2.)He must eat a McDonalds snack for the three main meals of the day,breakfast,lunch and teatime.3.)If ever he is offered the chance to go "super-size" (which he frequently is) he must do so.Along the way,he enlists the help of three medical experts who monitor his health as he pursues his experiment.My interest in this film up to the point of actually going to see it fluctuated from eagerly anticipating going to see it when I first heard of it,to turning against it shortly after it's release after starting to consider the premise rather stupid.But having looked forward to it for so long,I decided to go and see it just to be sure.And,while Spurlock's idea remains a little silly,the film does itself an almighty favour by casting an all round critical eye on America's obesity epidemic without focusing on the knawingly irritating premise too much.We learn of the 19 and 14 year old girls who unsuccessfully attempted to sue the McDonalds Corporation for causing their overweightness problems,how they entice kids into their unhealthy eating plan with indoor play areas,merchandising gifts inside kids happy meals and such and how their empire has expanded into such unlikely locations as airports,service stations and even hospitals!All this manages to keep the film on an engaging track,along with all the other interesting facts and figures we learn along the way.The film hardly ever manages to be as funny and to apply as much comic relief as it had the potential to,scenes of graphic surgery and Spurlock vomiting will doubtless upset any particularly sensitive viewers out there and the film does sort of manage to drag a bit towards the end.But that's it's bad points.2004 has been the year of the documentary,and along with Michael Moore's box office breaking Fahrenheit 9/11,this attention-catching flick has managed to be an earning little gem.It is a documentary,and certainly worthy of it's title,as,despite it's flaws,it still manages to engage you right through to the end.It obviously didn't have that much of an effect on me though!Where did I go straight after seeing it?!?Straight down Broad Street......for a McDonalds!!!****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm glad that I didn't see this documentary at a theater but rented it on DVD. The extra features give a bit more insight to director/writer/master &amp; commander Morgan Spurlock's intentions. Unfortunately, the theatrical cut isn't very cogent on its own."Super Size Me" is the new, fashionable kind of documentary that Michael Moore paved the way for and even more so than Moore, Spurlock relies on editing and biasing the movie, so that it brings across the message, which reflects his own point of matter. The more conspiracy theories contrived, the better. It's not that I don't believe that McDonald's and the other fast food companies are greedy bastards who don't give a damn about how unhealthy their products are but to me the documentary just doesn't prove a thing. We see Spurlock throwing up after he had a meal at the Drive-In, we hear him whining about how sick he feels, how addicted he already is to fast food, we see some doctors (whose integrity we just have to accept as a given thing) going on about how bad Spurlock's condition is... what does it prove? We don't even know if Spurlock has kept his promise and did actually eat nothing but McDonald's menus for 30 days. Unfortunately, the movie is basically centered around Spurlock and his experiment and many interesting aspects about the world of McDonald's that could have been included, are not dealt with (like who designs McDonald's products, where are the toys in the Happy Meals made, what's the history of McDonald's). Instead, we get to see an interview with some weird guy who once ate about 9 Big Macs on one day. Aha... very interesting. I mean, yeah, freaks like that are entertaining, but it just makes the whole thing completely non serious. Spurlock says in an interview on the DVD that he didn't want to do any finger pointing in the movie, yet, that's exactly what he seems to be doing. Undoubtedly, fast food companies almost educate children (and grown-ups, for that matter) with clever advertising to eat their meals, but hey, it's still the people's choice to go to these restaurant. And let's face it, they could sell anything to us, when we're hungry, as long as they serve us quickly. And no one goes into a Mickey D restaurant and wants to take a look at the nutrition list before ordering something. I mean, I understand the principle, that one should be able to get information about all the ingredients in his food, but that's not the problem. People just don't care what's in there. I believe, that most people already know that junk food isn't the healthiest of all options, but they accept it, thus they have to live with the consequences.As I said, on the DVD there's bonus material that sets a few things right, as well as some deleted scenes (one of which is actually quite alarming concerning the daily garbage McDonald's produces, another one with an interesting experiment with fries, on which further investigation would have been of interest). The most precious feature, however, is an interview with Eric Schlosser, author of the book "Fast Food Nation". In less than 20 minutes Schlosser brings his point across better than Spurlock in his whole movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Super Size Me" is a documentary in the same way that Michael Moore's "Bowling For Columbine" is a documentary -- a subjective point of view about the cause of a social problem (in Moore's case, America's culture of violence; in this case, America's abysmal state of health). However, its subjectivity doesn't mean it doesn't make a valid point -- it does, and it makes a point that won't be made by mainstream media, the government, school, or any other major source of information in our daily lives. And, like Bowling For Columbine, Super Size Me makes its point in an often funny and always entertaining way. If you're looking for objective observations about the fast food industry, you should read "Fast Food Nation" by Eric Schlosser, but if you're a fast food eater and clueless as to why you shouldn't be, this film is a good eye-opener. It's not preachy, it's just intriguing, all the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important as an alarm signal, flawed as documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Super Size Me is a Michael Moore type documentary about the health hazards of eating fast food on a regular basis. Concerned about the fact that America has become the fattest nation in the world Morgan Spurlock looks at the hypothesis that part of this tendency is due to the exaggerated amounts of fast food that people are eating combined with their lack of physical exercise. Recently this hypothesis has been the subject of a high-profile trial where two teenage girls sued McDonalds for causing their health problems (read: obesity). The trial was considered valid, but ultimately dismissed as the attorneys failed to prove that McDonalds willfully produced harm to the girls.The truth is not very complicated, although some aspects are not as obvious to everyone. Fast food is dangerous. Even the McDonalds salads have a ridiculously high calorie and sugar (!) content. The sizes of all portions have quadrupled and more since the original fast foods were created. Customers are encouraged to go for the "super size" meal deals and a lot fall for the lure of saving a few cents and doubling the amount of food they get. Customers are subjected to intense advertising and particularly children are a main target of McDonalds campaigns: happy meals, birthday parties, children playgrounds all these make it almost impossible for a parent to deny their kids a McDonalds meal once they had their first one; and once childhood pleasant memories become associated with McDo the pleasure of eating there persists as a teenager and even adult. Morgan's solution to that was to "punch my kid in the face each time we pass in front of a McDonalds, this way he wouldn't have pleasant memories about it!" :) All the conclusions and aspects above are explored by the documentary as Morgan, starting as a person in above average physical shape, embarks on a 30 day exclusive McDonalds diet in order to analyze its effects on his health. He also limits the physical exercise he usually performs to the average amount an American walks daily and chooses to accept the super-size options each time they are offered to him. Morgan does mention all aspects of the fast-food influence on modern American society, including the fact that people _do_ have the choice to say no to fast food, only it is less convenient for most of them to do so. However, the overall tone in performing his experiment is one of significant exaggeration. He throws up after his first super-size meal, he points out every minimal reaction that he seems to notice as a result of his diet (mood swings, minor stomach discomforts, etc.). His girlfriend (a vegan) compares eating meat with heroin addiction... He gains a total of 24 pounds in a month and apparently his liver is significantly affected to the point where his doctors recommend him to go to the Emergency Room at the smallest sign of discomfort. (Umm... as if someone would look at him in the ER if he came there saying he believes he has a liver failure from eating Big Macs!).As a documentary Super Size Me has a clear bias which is obvious in both the protagonist, his girlfriend, some of his doctors, and of course, a lot of the interviewed people. However, like in Michael Moore's case, it manages to drive a point across, managing to raise an alarm for many Americans who, although they were aware of the dangers of eating fast food and drinking gallons of soda daily, they mostly ignore the risks. Perhaps the most important segments of the movie deal with the food offerings in US high-schools which, in most cases, lead to children being virtually forced to eat junk food on a daily basis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a well-written and produced documentary that looks at fast food and the relationship to health problems in America. It is an advocacy piece, so it isn't necessarily balanced, but I think it is very fair and honest. It is neither a shameless propaganda piece like a Micheal Moore film, nor is it like the polished documentaries of Ken Burns.The most salient point of the movie for me was the boundaries between personal responsibility and corporate responsibility. Going into this movie, I felt that what we eat is 100% personal responsibility and that the recent lawsuits against McDonalds and KFC were frivolous. I haven't shifted too much from that perspective, but it made me think about this issue in a different and more complete way. I *am* very concerned about the movement to junk-food style outsourcing within the school lunch programs. That was news to me. Since children are less capable (in theory, although sometimes I wonder!) to make good decisions, this trend is disturbing. Make sure you watch the movie through the epilogue. There is some interesting information at the tail end that I won't spoil.The highest compliment I can give to an advocacy documentary like this is that it made me think, and I broadened my understanding of an issue that is a little more complicated and worse than I expected. This goes well beyond the 25-second news blurbs and political sound-bites that form so much of public opinion. My wife and I had an extended discussion on the issue after we watched it.I recommend this to anyone who eats!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grueling and Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got around to seeing this documentary. Timing is, as they say, everything; seeing this after a big meal probably wasn't an act of good judgment on my part.Watching this film is a grueling experience by any measure. It's hard to believe that people will voluntarily eat this kind of food (and I use the term loosely) with regularity... but the fact is that they do. It's a testament to the effectiveness of the movie that McDonald's eliminated it's "super size" option soon after "Super Size Me" hit the theaters, but that in itself doesn't change the basic nature of factory-produced, highly-processed fast food. Yes, most people know that this stuff is bad for us, yet millions of us still eat it, some of us with frightening repetitiveness.Anyone with an ounce of empathy will find watching this film to be a harsh experience, even if one doesn't indulge in fast food fatality-baiting themselves. The criticisms that this film is biased, that it somehow misrepresents the facts, will vanish utterly for anyone who sees it. There is no doubt about Spurlock's findings, about the nutritional value (again, using the term loosely) of the food itself, or the state of public health in America.Having said all this, though, the documentary itself can be a bit slow and heavy-handed at times. It has moments of going too far unnecessarily; in particular, I have to ask if it was really necessary to show the regurgitated results of Morgan Spurlock's first attempts at consuming an entire super-sized double quarter pounder with cheese extra value meal.I watched this film on DVD, and it is well worth watching it this way for the extras that came with the film. In particular, the conversation between Morgan Spurlock and "Fast Food Nation" author Eric Schlosser is quite worth seeing, as is Spurlock's experiment of seeing what happens when McDonald's food is left to decay. I won't give it away, but let's just say that the results with the french fries are rather unexpected and more than a little disturbing.All in all, I'd recommend seeing this documentary. Just make sure you do it on an empty stomach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With some hesitant expectations I popped the movie Super Size Me into the DVD player tonight and was surprised and shocked at the content.The basic context of the movie is a man named Morgan Spurlock , a very fit and healthy man I may add, who after seeing on TV the story about two young girls suing McDonalds for their weight gain, decides he will experiment a little by eating a diet fit for a King or a McFattie as the case may be. He will eat three meals a day, all ingredients of his meals must be items purchased over the counter from McDonalds. Spurlock quickly goes from 185 pounds to 205 and experiences many health risks including liver problems and heart palpitations as the process continues. It was a little scary for me as I watched and compared the conditions Spurlock had from his diet to the ones I had with a similar diet. Fast food is a billion dollar industry and one that I contribute A lot of money too, lets just say that I have nothing in my fridge pretty much anytime of the day and I know the best times to go to my local McD's to get fresh fries. SICK.Spurlock spends the beginning of the movie meeting with health and fitness experts who give him two thumbs up on his body status this guy is a healthy and fit man, whose girlfriend happens to be a vegan chef, not quite the guy upon meeting him who you would think would be into something like this, but who does a very good job.Except for the occasional vomiting scene-totally disgusting- this movie gives you a sneak peek at the obesity issues that are haunting North America, it's scary to see what the kids of today are eating, and what some will look like. This movie definitely deserves at the very least an 8 out of 10 quite shocking to see that this came from a virtual nobody.All I can say is after watching this movie I will never here "Would you like fries with that" again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Waited a long time to see this documentary after watching the always watchable Michael Moore Docs. The newcomer Morgan Spurlock came up with an intriguing very real documentary about a deadly problem in North America. His documentary was complete and unbiased, he put the facts out there and didn't appear to need to use creative editing to get his point across. The people he interviewed (especially those that were spokespeople for these fast food corporations) were factual enough to give up the evidence needed to prove their food was poison more or less. On top of the great info he got he threw in the jaw dropping spectacle of eating nothing but what is served over the counter at McDonalds for thirty days straight, eating three meals a day. This is really what holds the movie together because you have to watch him do this and feel literally ill as he does it. The best part of Spurlock doing this is he was actually in absolute pristine physical shape before he started. He was a model health patient. That way it was easy to see the change in him as he carried out this task. For all those people that said his task was extreme, and pointless and unrealistic, try again. I know that I personally have been (sadly) guilty of partaking of McDonalds AT LEAST once a day probably 3 out of 4 weeks in a month. I also know for a cold hard fact I'm not the only one doing that. Spurlock's documentary made all the facts very clear, and very disturbing. If I had been the judge in a case of Spurlock vs McDonalds...McDonalds would be paying dearly. I must say the doc really never took off, it always kinda had the same tone throughout and it was definitely watchable and I suggest it for anyone. It wasn't quite as riveting as a Michael Moore Documentary but then again Michael Moore goes for entertainment value and that's not what Documentaries are for. Great movie, check it out!! A hearty 6/10!</fullReview>

Almost two months later, and my children are still bagging on McDonalds and the rest of the junk out there. My kids are now more active in sports, spend less time watching TV, and are feeling healthier than ever. If your kids are hooked on junk food, it could be your fault as parents. If you want to do something about it, then I suggest watching this film as a family. Better than Weight Watchers, Slim Fast, or even that trendy new South Beach Diet, "Super Size Me" really works and has to be the best diet film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Eighteenth century monarch King Gustav III once sentenced two murderers to 'death by tea and coffee', to prove they were poisons. Both convicts happily drank the stuff daily, until they passed away in their 80s. Now, just when you thought it was safe to go back to the Golden Arches along waddles 32-year-old documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock to suggest that guzzling nothing but Mickey D's for 30 days may be injurious to your health.Well, duh. There's a (much) larger issue to be ingested here, obviously, which concerns the insidious grip fast food marketing has over the globe ? on Americans especially, whose obesity levels are reaching critical mass. And the movie chews it over very well. You'll laugh 'till you barf. As a tour of US school cafeterias (inundated with big-business junk-food concessions) shows, it's elementary to see where the rot begins. Things take a downright sinister turn when a bunch of 5-year-olds fail to recognise a portrait of Jesus, but all recognise Ronald McDonald. Spurlock's an engaging host as we follow his hilarious-cum-horrifying journey from fighting fit to farting fat. 'Your liver's like pate!' his astounded GP cries. Did we mention the chest pains, depression and impotence? McDonalds, incidentally, announced their intention to phase out its Super Size range shortly before this picture emerged.

Not a groundbreaking thesis you you might think but Moran Spurlock's film isn't about stating the obvious so much as making the dangers of a poor diet evident with an immediacy and urgency unthinkable in any other medium. Whats so effective about Super Size Me is that it takes a truism like fast food is junk and bad for the system, a fact self-evident to most but not important enough to effect their eating habits, and cystializes it, making it a real threat as opposed to an abstract danger that a lot of people acknowledge but don't act upon. A timely lecture on the public health effects of bad dieting is welcome but Spurlock's gimmick - consuming nothing but Maccy Ds for 30 days, 3 times a day, brings the series of facts about salt content, sugar content, saturated fat and calories etc.., sharply into focus. You're not just hearing a lot of nutrionalists telling you you're insane to eat this crap, you're seeing the effects personified by the likable filmmaker who's health you become gradually more concerned about as the whole horrible experiment proceeds despite worried doctors telling him to give it up. You had to sympathise with Spurlock's Saddam look-a-like doctor who told him he risked liver failure and DEATH if he continued - and the man still had 10 days to go. Spurlock never becomes sanctimonious about the whole thing and endearingly maintains his humour throughout despite his deteriorating physical condition, vomiting and loss of libido. His McDiatribes on Corporate responsibility, marketing to children and commerical opportunism are nicely balanced out with a reflection of personal consumer choice and taking responsibility for your own dietary habits. You'd have to be insane if you didn't think twice about your your diet and your personal fitness having watched this movie - in short its the kick in the McArse so many of us need. Essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most important films of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know fast food is cheap processed garbage. It takes guts to put that much junk into your body. This should become the staple film for wellness programs everywhere. This isnt just a film about McDonalds. It covers the food kids eat in their school cafeterias as well. This movie could have been a snorefest, but it balanced information with a sense of humor. Admittedly, Morgan's sense of humor starts to be drained as he packs on 30 more pounds. One notable scene, has him barfing out the windows of his car. Sweet! This movie will have you swearing never to eat at McDonald's ever again. I hope that this starts a new movement where big business becomes more morally aware. Thanks Morgan!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you still go to McDonald's after seeing this movie - blame yourself. I was not going to McDonald's before I saw this one, rarely no other fast food places at all except for pizzas - and - I'm a vegetarian. I feel very good about it, but I felt disgusted by actually seeing the progression of this movie. That McDonald's were not about to pay any notice about it's customers, more than getting them more addicted - that's no news to me. I really like the way the whole story is told. It reminds me of how Michael Moore used to do his movies before he got "that" famous, mixing up serious issues together with a sense of humor. Please do see this one, bring your whole family, your friends and everyone else. See this one please! And after that you might consider to turn a vegetarian, but I'm happy for you if you only chose to not eat at McDonald's anymore ! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a McDonald's employee, I'm lovin' this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movie fan, I thought this was a funny movie. Morgan broke up his McDonald's binge diet with interviews and other footage, including going into schools, surgery, and his medical exams.But on a more personal level, I can't help but feel a little guilty. I'm overweight and I'm doing some of the things that the other McDonald's employees, in the movie, did. I still ask if you want to Super Size (or now we are supposed to say Upsize though I still say Super Size - whatever, just as long as suggestive sales are still happening), and I very seldomly ask if people want to switch the fries with a side salad, partially because I am lazy - I'm the one that makes the salads {side and bacon ranch} in our particular restaurant. I've done supersizing on kids who looked like they should be going outside and running around.I really could identify with the Big Mac guy. He seemed to be relatively healthy and not terribly overweight. He eats the sandwiches and rarely eats the French Fries. I am like this as well. I eat a sandwich in my break, and a small Coke or Fruitopia, while I drink water throughout the rest of the shift, unless I really, really need a caffeine fix (hey, the pop is free so I can do whatever I choose). I never touch the fries, even though it would be so easy to eat a whole bunch every day. With just the sandwich as my lunch, and an afternoon snack of carrot sticks, a cheese slice, a couple chips, or a salad that I made at home (not a McDonald's salad - I already said that I'm lazy), my being on my feet during the shifts, and biking and walking to get around, I am gradually losing weight.I also identified with the school lunches. When I went to university, I lived in a dorm where they provided the food for us, and we weren't allowed to have stuff like hot plates or microwaves in our rooms (fire regulations). I gained so much weight then. The food was awful. I made lunch my big meal because they tried harder to make it better because faculty would eat lunch there but not at supper because they went home by that time. Let me put it this way, the meatloaf was horrible but you ate it because there was no guarantee that the chicken was cooked properly, and steamed vegetables aren't supposed to be greasy.All in all, this entertaining movie struck so many chords in my life. I think I'm going to take a super long bike ride tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film after putting off seeing it for so long. Several people told me it was an excellent and eye-opening documentary and I now agree wholeheartedly. I thought it was going to just show some guy stuffing his face (like the promotional poster) for shock value. Instead it turned out to be an intelligent piece of filmwork worth recommending to all your friends. I have always been aware of the over processing of quick foods which is everything from TV Dinners to fast food and thought I have heard it all but this movie changed that thinking. I will no longer eat at Mc Conalds, no not even the little yogurts, nor the ice cream sundaes or my beloved pancakes. The filmmaker, Morgan Spurlock, is to be commended for going out on a limb to bring us this nugget of information. I consider him one of the muckraker greats in History. This film plays out nicely and never drones on (another assumption I had about it.) It is entertaining, informative and FUNNY. So go out and get away to rent this video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>entertaining and frightening documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If we are to have documentaries they should entertain as well as inform, otherwise the experience becomes too grim. Michael Moore, with his built-in humour does it superbly well, and so too does this one. I sat there chortling and did not entirely succumb to the Euro view of America (crap president, corrupt corporations, fat and stupid people) because we were given plenty to admire as well as despair of. In fact, a trip to Dublin and its teeming Macdonalds, often unfriendly and unhelpful people, and filthy streets should be considered by anyone who thinks all things European are inherently superior. So to the movie and its brilliantly executed combination of analysis and experience. The bizarre experiment in which a man deliberately changes from a healthy diet to one about as unhealthy as it's possible to imagine is hardly representative or scientific, but it did prove that fast food is bad. It's lacking in all the basic good things we need for our bodies, it's bad for the environment, it makes people bad-tempered, depressed, slow, lazy, addicted, etc. Since watching it I must have eaten a dozen apples, given up my morning biscuit,doubled my intake of juice, and felt even more resistent to these ugly, incongruous junk-food palaces that riddle the centre and suburbs of Dublin. I like films of this sort and look forward to many more.</fullReview>

NO? You might be surprised. That however was not the only focus of the movie. It was about America (and face it the world) getting fatter (or obese if you will). Why are kids at school being fed crap? Whats wrong with a healthy meal? He did a really interesting comparison against a main stream school and one with "troublesome" kids. Funny how the troublesome kids got a great healthy meal and not only were well behaved, but actually were more attentive in school.I could go on and on. Morgan Spurlock has given everyone an opportunity to see what goes on with the food industry in America. This movie should be required watching for all parents, and kids of school age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is even better than "Fast Food Nation"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly the best of the guerrilla documentaries since Bowling for Columbine and even Fahrenheit 9-11. The movie appears to be in 5 parts:Prologue--Morgan talks about the several types of devastation obesity is having on the citizens in the U.S who eat nothing but fast food, and how McDonald's may be the main culprit in the triggering of such obesity.Part I--Morgan did the right thing to tell 3 doctors that he is going to be on a 30-day McDonald's diet. Through this very risky diet, he was trying to figure out if a lawsuit against McDonald's on 2 children who got severely obese was a result of them eating too much fast food for a very long period of time was absolutely true. In the beginning days of his McDonald's diet, he ends up vomiting 25 minutes after eating a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese too fast. Seeing that ugly vomit on the street made me realize that Morgan's 30-day McDonald's diet is going to be a roadway to his very poor health.Part II--Morgan also is helped by two nutritionists and we had found shocks on the excess calories some of our favorite foods have, like most of the granola-laden parafes, or the Big Gulp drinks, which can, which one nutrition expert said, "can pack as much as 600 to 800 calories depending on how much ice." Morgan ended up packing 10-15 pounds after 14 days into the McDonald's diet. His cholesterol and BP went into the dangerous zones, and he ended up with steatohepatitis--also known as fatty liver syndrome. (And that part where a piece of hair was stuck on a parafe...I hope that an eco-terrorist did not do that. But this also smacks of the Anna Ayala incident too.)Part III--It is now 15 to 27 days into his McDonald's diet. At that point, things start to worsen for Morgan. In addition to gaining about 10 more pounds, his cholesterol ended up still dangerously high, and his liver problems are starting to get worse. He is also told that he is also about to damage the kidneys (as well as his liver) by way of hyperuricemia. One of the doctors warned him that his hyperuricemia could start a vicious cycle of kidney damage, starting with gout, and then stones, and then possibly, end-stage renal disease that you can't reverse.Morgan's sweetheart realizes that things must change for Morgan soon--or he will possibly die. Worrying particularly that Morgan could suffer cirrhosis, she prepares a detoxification diet for Morgan to reverse all of the damage that Morgan had done to his body because of his extra pounds.Part IV--As his 30-day McDonald's diet ends, Morgan follows his girlfriend's detoxification diet and eventually loses weight but not until at least 8 weeks. Eventually, Morgan's BP and cholesterol go back to normal and his liver damage was reversed. Morgan gives a moral at the end of the movie: You better make some healthy food choices, because by not doing so, you could lose your health, your life, or even both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an indictment of McDonald's but rather a general warning to America: we aren't getting any smaller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2002 I was overweight and eating way too much. I wasn't severely obese and in fact I'm kind of big and bulky by nature so a lot of the weight was just due to my general size. But I knew I had to lose the extra weight so one day I just said, "To hell with it." I quit eating pizza, I started working out and lifting weights. I took up running and other physical activities and watched my diet - high protein, low fat and calories. A lot of lean meats and natural vegetables and fruit.Eventually I lost all the excess weight. I'm now about 130 and gained around 20 pounds of muscle so I lost about 70 - 75 pounds from December 03 to December 04.I watched "Super Size Me" with all this in mind. I had been through all this. I could relate. And I knew precisely what filmmaker Morgan Spurlock was trying to say - many people misunderstand the film. I've heard friends and reviewers say, "Of course you're going to gain weight if you eat at McDonald's every day, no one does THAT!" Well, first of all, that's not Morgan's point. Its message isn't, "Blame it on the food companies!" "Super Size Me" promotes a message to viewers: it is equally our fault. Yes, we're bombarded with ads, hidden facts and misleading marketing. McDonald's in particular has such a firm grasp on America as a whole that it's rather frightening.But Morgan's point is that we can't blame America's obesity solely on the fast food companies - it starts with us.We need to start cutting back on fast food. Morgan presents facts from doctors and uses himself as proof - too much can seriously harm your health, and only two of one hundred doctors in the film recommended you should eat at McDonald's (or any fast food chain) more than a few times a _year_.That means for the people on the go who stop by McDonald's or Burger King or Pizza Hut or Wendy's for a quick bite are risking a lot. They're paying out of pocket for non-nutritive, fatty, calorie-loaded, heart-clogging food.Morgan isn't saying with "Super Size Me" that we should all go out and sue the burger companies. He isn't saying we should "never" eat fast food. He's saying we're becoming too closely associated with the franchises; twenty, thirty years ago it was a treat, a luxury; now it's hard to imagine a child under the age of 5 not knowing who Ronald McDonald is. And that's kind of scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock directs, writes and stars in this documentary feature that takes a stark look at obesity and the evils of fast foods. Spurlock pledges to eat three meals a day at McDonald's for one month. His plan is to eat every item on the menu at least once...and SUPER SIZE every time it is offered by the McDonald's employee. Spurlock and his team of doctors and advisers keep records of the physical and psychological repercussions of this dietary disaster. It was not even a week before Spurlock began to feel ill...albeit the McDonald's fare still tasted like a comfort food. The once moderately healthy filmmaker rapidly becomes more lethargic and depressed...and his sex life is close to nonexistent. His girlfriend Alexandra is a vegan chef and constantly urges him to abort this unhealthy regime. Spurlock manages to complete his eating experiment...but it takes many weeks for him to detox. One viewing will suffice and eating at McDonald's will make you think twice. Starve out obesity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A National Obsession and an Epidemic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Super Size Me" was a well-made documentary and a harrowing story. The filmmaker Morgan Spurlock goes on a month-long binge of McDonald's food much to the detriment of his health. We follow Morgan's journey and learn of his mood swings, liver problems, and excess weight from his full-time diet of McDonald's restaurants across the country. When the doctors were advising him to end the experiment after three weeks, he should have followed their instructions and ended the film experiment right there. This documentary did not quite make the point that people need to be responsible for diet, calorie intake, and choice of restaurants when eating out. That responsibility includes parents overseeing their children's nutrition, plus monitoring their children's lunches at school. The lawsuits against fast-food establishments like McDonald's are well known and well documented. I'm not sure that this film added any vital new information to such a familiar topic.The film primarily addressed the national obsession with food and the run-away epidemic of obesity in America. I watched "Super Size Me" on the Showtime cable network, and the program that followed the film was the sitcom entitled "Fat Actress." 'Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone in the forums said about this film something like "people with a normal number of brain cells should know that fast food is bad".Quite true! They should. But then again they should also know that smoking and drinking are bad! Or taking drugs. Or speeding on the highway. Or not exercising regularly.Just that they do it anyway. Evolution of course sorts it all out. Just like with the plague for example. The fittest will survive plague, fast food and AIDS. The rest will be bye-bye.Still, considering fellow taxpayers (to whatever state we happen to live in..), I'd like to think that we do NOT need to lose all of those thousands or millions of otherwise useful people-years, tax-dollars and medical bill dollars because of this kind of silly dietary issues?I mean, people could get a better deal if they really just stopped eating this crap and demanded better, couldn't they? The word "boycott" comes to mind. Yet other words like "ignorance" and "stupidity" comes through much louder..Spurlock is right when he compares fast food to smoking - both are "quick fixes". And, both can be done away with setting up some reasonable regulations. Limit the menu of any food establishment to 80% healthy and require the marketing budget to be proportionally the same and I think the tide may turn yet. Fast food corporations need to be forced to take better care of their customers by legislators. Cigarettes may not be smoked everywhere because they are unhealthy and the same rules can be applied to junk food. Just like casinos are not allowed to be built everywhere so shouldn't places where you can gamble with your health.Easy.</fullReview>

But the director also wants to make a point here, and denunciate MCDonalds that encourages customers to eat more (super size your meal type of commercials and at the counter) and the other hand says that eating its food is not dangerous.And the fact of showing in a spectacular way (you can see his health getting worse day after day) the effects of eating mc do for a month in a movie for a large audience will probably make people realize them more.Foe example everybody knows that driving fast is dangerous and can cause death (this is obvious right ?), but many people need to see dead corpses and accidents to really realize it. Otherwise they would just continue driving as they used to. That is why, in England -in France too-, they started to show real accidents or shocking sequences to make people understand.I hope you understood what I meant ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You would have to be exceedingly ignorant to get anything from this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was actually anticipating the new "Michael Moore-like" documentary "Super Size Me" by Morgen Spurlock. I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one who was intrigued by the stunt of Mr. Spurlock only eating McDonald's for 30 days, much like when we watch "America's Funniest Home Videos" to watch our fellow human beings humiliate themselves or injure themselves. Also of course, exactly what will happen? Is he going to die? Well, I was, however dismayed to discover that Mr. Spurlock has a very black and white view on the world; Most if not all people in America who are overweight or obese are in that current state because of fast food, and it's all their fault, no wait! It's McDonald's fault! Or something like that. I had the daunting task of trying to determine which side the film is against.No matter what the cause however, I'm sure that this film his "proved" positively nothing. Basically, Morgan Spurlock is going to eat nothing but McDonalds for 30 days. He will have to "super size" every time he is asked to. And, he will have to get an extremely limited amount of exercise. This of course is also the fault of the successful cooperation McDonald's, or not. This may mean only one thing; he is determined to gain weight for our viewing pleasure. Okay, that's fine. Although I originally thought this film was about the consumption of fast food, the fast food mainly being McDonald's, and not select qualms about the American lifestyle. In no way is any kind of advertising or fast food the catalyst to a person choosing to live a sedentary lifestyle; and so the film goes on to accuse fast food companies of our unhealthy food decisions. Mr. Spurlock makes a dramatic change in his diet. And I mean dramatic. In fact, he regurgitates his first quarter pounder with cheese meal. Not to mention he literally stuffs his gut with the food at every meal to full capacity. A more credible film would have another participant eat like this at restaurants that aren't "evil" so that we may view the results. I would even like to see what would happen if someone ate like this choosing "healthy" food or non-fast food-serving alternative restaurants. This would be positively essential to make any kind of conclusion about the "experiment" of Mr. Spurlock. We don't get this, or any information regarding how much soda or ketchup he consumed. But I did have one reassurance, Morgan Spurlock is a credible, unbiased, highly educated source for health guidance, or not. The fact that he feels he can prove points by an experiment on one person and by interviewing some select people reveals a lack of knowledge for science. In this film we get all kinds of statistics; the amount of obese or overweight people in the United States; the state that is the heftiest; the amount of McDonald's in the world, in America, in New York City. We are missing one critical number, though. Exactly how many morbidly obese people even eat at McDonald's? And if so, how often? I guess the film answers the questions when one heavy person states he eats there about 3 to 4 times a week. I guess they couldn't find a person to say he or she eats there everyday. There is not doubt in my mind that they would have used that valuable footage. This film is the kind of film where facts like genetics, heretics, and major issues that are causing obesity are ignorantly swept under a blanket in order to label people while supposedly attacking the fast food corporations. Yes genetics. Morgen gained over the course of his Micky D's binge 24.5 pounds. He actually at one point even lost a pound going from 203 to 202 pounds. I can tell you that if another person with slower a slower metabolism ate that way, they could have pulled triple digits with a belly to match. Some others may gain about 5. I was expecting a biased film, but I was surprised at the elementary level that this film was handled. The Michael Moore approach is nothing new, but there were some funny moments in the movie. The movie is made for people who have short attention spans, so it is humorous with some tidbits on the side containing some health information regarding some of the food. Also, about how large the servings of fast food has grown over the years. One scene that did irk me though was of a teen, not too overweight from what I can see, who was complaining about how society seems to glamorize being stick thin. The screen while she is talking is filled with a collage of models until they completely cover her face with a door-closing sound. Now, what does that mean? We are all supposed to be sticks, or anorexic like a lot of models have the reputations for being? There is a saying, "talk to people not at them". This unnecessary scene was disturbing. It revealed the true disposition of the creator of this film. The disposition that is common is so many. Why so much hate is geared toward people with a weakness with food or inactivity still baffles me to this day. They are only hurting themselves. Anyway? Do I think this movie will "help" some of the problems associated with the golden arches? Maybe a few, a very small few who never much cared for the food, will contemplate eating there again. Some will probably crave the stuff upon finishing the movie. Vegans, non-Mickey D's eaters, and even unhealthy thin people will pat themselves on the back and glare at over weight people thinking, "why can't those "fat pigs" stop eating there"? And so continues the vicious cycle. 1.5/4 stars</fullReview>

Did we really need a ninety-minute lecture on that?? In this inane, pointless documentary, an average Joe takes on a "McDonalds Diet" for a month and charts the effects. It's like watching a movie where you can guess the ending. Of course this guy will get sick! Of course he'll gain weight! Of course his innards will be affected! Your point?? No fool in his right mind---or monetary means---would dine at Mac's or any other fast-food joint three meals a day. I would've respected this guy's attempt more so if he had ate there maybe three times *a week*. Like your average person on the go who needs a quick bite sometimes. But to expose yourself to this cuisine 21 times a week! You deserve what you get. I keep seeing the line "You're missing the point" to people that didn't like this flick. I'm not missing any point. Yeah, it's bad for you. Why not tell me in a more acceptable fashion. Have Spurlock chart his progress over a *year's* time. That's more realistic. One month makes the production look rushed and paints a filmmaker who wants some quick exposure. Spurlock is an engaging guy, who admits his love for junk food. But talk about biting the hand that feeds you. And what in the living hell was the point of sticking Mac's burgers in jars so we could watch them decompose over time?? And the fries didn't....so? They've got good preservatives, who cares? I've been eating this food for 20 years and have never been sick once. On day two this guy is puking out his car window. Maybe his body wasn't equipped for it. If anything, this made me wanna go out and get a Super Sized Double Quarter-Pounder with Cheese Meal. As a matter of fact....(grabs keys).</fullReview>

All Spurlock did was prove that eating thousands of extra calories every day is unhealthy, demonstrating the absolutely obvious.A more interesting film, and one that might have actually been of some value, would be to see what happens if you were to eat a diet of nothing but McDonald's but try to maintain a 2,000 calorie diet doing it, as balanced as possible using just items on their menu.

		<fullReview>When "Super Size Me" came out, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it. As a Libertarian sort of guy, I have a strong attitude that people should be allowed to do what they like provided it doesn't hurt others. If they want to be fat pigs, fine--but don't blame others for your fat pigginess. So, one of the basic tenants of this film, that fast food is evil, is something I could care less about--eat it if you want and avoid it if you want. But, I was VERY happy when I saw that although the film clearly is anti-fast food, as least it did NOT go where I assumed--to try to legislate healthy eating--something that is anti-freedom all the way. On the other hand, the film did have some compelling arguments--even if it did not turn me into an anti-fast food sort of guy.Morgan Spurlock stars in the film--and that is THE reason I watched. I LOVED his documentary "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold". In "Super Size Me" he decides to eat nothing but McDonald's food for an entire month to see that might happen. The results were pretty impressive to watch--Spurlock put on almost 25 pounds and he felt miserable. Now few SANE people would eat fast food that much--but the health problems that were documented with multiple doctors and blood tests were very sobering. This sort of diet will kill you. Though, of course, no one will eat the same very limited range of foods Spurlock did (why didn't he eat McDonald's salads and who super-sizes every time?!).What I also really appreciated in the film was its discussion of school lunches. I am a retired teacher and hate some school districts which have taken every ounce of fun out of eating--banning cookies, cakes, etc.--even when brought in by students to celebrate birthdays and the like! Spurlock doesn't address this--but he does show the opposite--how some school lunches are essentially garbage--nothing but fatty crap with hardly any nutritional value. This was sobering and quite sad, as some kids receive almost all their nutrition from school meals.Overall, while I think Spurlock came down too hard on fast food and not nearly hard enough on personal responsibility, he was not a far-leftist who seemed unreasonable. He posed a lot of good questions and the film did make me think. I might have given it an 8, though scenes of his rectal exam and puking knocked off a point (YECCH!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Size Menus Create Super Size People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Super Size Me is a documentary directed by Morgan Spurlock and released in 2004. This documentary is a direct critique of fast-food restaurants in America (especially McDonalds) and also to the American way of life. In order to do this, Spurlock eats three times a day at McDonalds (breakfast, lunch and dinner) in one month. His aim: demonstrate how unhealthy that sort of food is by using his body as proof of the damage caused.To carry out his complaints Spurlock set several rules:He could only eat food served in that famous chain. He had to eat the whole meal. He had to have the super size menu when offered. He shouldn't walk more than 5,000 steps per day, which is the estimated amounts of steps that an American does.During the movie, the protagonist has three doctors that track the changes his body suffers. After that month, the doctors told him that his liver was severely damaged, his cholesterol was very high, and he significantly increased his weight among other consequences. In fact, he had eaten 90 meals which is more than the amount of junk food that a person should eat in eight years.The first time I watched this documentary was four years ago and I almost forgot the facts that Spurlock shows in it. I thought that after coming to the US it was a good moment to re-watch it. We have McDonalds, KFC, and many other fast food chains in Spain but it is not like here. Everything is one step further in America. For example, the medium size here is equivalent to the big size in Europe. Furthermore you are not able to re-fill your glass. You pay for a single drink and if you want more you have to purchase another one. I would love to have free refills in Spain but I think it is a very bad habit because it makes you over consume.I think that the US has a serious problem with food. People do not have time to go back home for lunch time and they end up going to some fast food restaurants because of the lack of options. In Spain, we go t fast food places as well but also it is possible to go to a normal restaurant where you can purchase a daily menu for nine dollars. It is a bit more expensive but healthier. Spurlock points out another issue: Americans do not walk at all. Those 5,000 steps are a very poor rate which provokes a lethal combination: unhealthy food and lack of exercise. When I first watched the movie I could not understand why people didn't walk but when I got here I saw what the cities are like. Mainly, they lack good public transportation system. Therefore, everyone has a car decreasing the exercise done daily. Finally, he was asked nine times if wanted a super size menu. Seven, out of those nine, were in Texas. Everything is bigger in Texas, even people. According Spurlock's research, Texas is the fattest state in the country. Thus, not walking and eating super size meals super sizes you.I think that the results of this documentary showed that Americans have to change some habits. However, it doesn't depend only on people's willing but also on the opportunities offered by those restaurants. Corporations have a lot of power and I think that it would be essential that the government establishes more controls over that market to protect people's health. Otherwise we will keep super sizing ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to be really really scared by it, more than any horror movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the documentary that everyone should watch at least once. Being realistic wasn't well utilized like that before. It fitted, big time, to spread the message of scaring. And that was the point.I went through a sorry experience with junk food. And the result was bad; high cholesterol, fatty liver, .. the whole nine yards. I wanted to warn everybody, especially the ones who see nothing wrong about it, or slight the matter. Sure Morgan Spurlock did it, that good.Spurlock injected himself with the junk, as what millions on that plant do daily, yet to observe, record, and educe. To tell you the truth; what he found out wasn't new, but showing it, that way, on public, was new and effective.The plan was perfect. He went all through it no matter how sick he turned into. I'll never forget the moment of the kind fatherly doctor "Please stop !". It takes a boldness to prove a point like that. The 2 parallel lines, of Spurlock's little Odessa and the scientific monologues, did work. There is couple of moments that moved me highly, the first is concerning the surprising amount of sugar in every liter of cola, plus what it does (the school sequence), and the other is the most dangerous, concerning turning into Big Mac's addict. Well, take it from me; you better believe it, Spurlock wasn't acting there.The talk about obesity, the not genetic though, as another evil habit like smoking is different and absorbing. Nowadays, the hectic life we live, the emotional stress we suffer, and the fast-food corporations we have made being fat like a fate. However not many bring up the subject, because it's a game of big corporations. See how important this ? as a movie ? is. Its sense of humor isn't abundant, unlike the status in Michael Moore's documentaries. In fact, after the educational lovely intro, things went hmmm, educational then ! Maybe that was meant to concentrate on the message and intensify the case's melancholia. Or maybe, Spurlock isn't a funny movie maker in the first place (despite how funny the joke of "I'll hit my kid whenever we pass by a MacDonald !" is). Junk food is a curse. This documentary tried stoutheartedly to embody that as crazy as it could. And it managed to translate the taste of fear finely. Sometimes being realistic is the best form for horror, and to everyone doesn't know or want to learn; sweets, sodas, ready meals are ? to great extent ? horrific !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing in spots, but hardly a hard hitting expose....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film essentially makes it point in 20 minutes. Eating nothing but fast food for a month can really make you sick! Wow! This is not the most Earth shattering conclusion ever reached by man. Who doesn't know that fast food is bad for you? And if you eat it for a month without anything to balance it, yeah, you'll probably get sick. It was amusing to see Morgan puke a lot, and feel very ill (my sense of humour can be rather dark at times), but then, you knew this would happen to him (and he knew it too). So, there is some entertainment value here, but this film is about an hour too long (which is kind of bad considering the film is feature length), and you really don't know anything new after seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>super captivate us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Morgan Spurlock announces it in the first minutes of his documentary film about the thumping phenomenon of the fast-food industry: "everthing is getting fat in the United States: firms, lands, fast-food restaurants, portions of the menus they offer and even (it's sad to say) millions of American people. To test the perils of bad diet, Morgan Spurlock decides to have all his meals at McDonalds' for one month to show us how dangerous it really is. At a pinch, his experience is useless because one is virtually sure of the disastrous issue from a physical standpoint. That's not all, under our eyes, Morgan mentally, morally and even sexually wanes. And the junk food he eats has effects similar to drugs. As soon as he ate his menu, he feels overjoyed and later depression overwhelms him. Without mentioning an increasing addiction.The risky experience Morgan Spurlock goes through is a kind of a leading thread to an investigation during which he raises the problem of the proliferation of fast-foods. Reproducing the methods of the Michael Moore stable: the director goes in many fast-food restaurants and places dealing with the dangers of a bad, dangerous diet, interviews many passers-by in the street or people in high places, Morgan Spurlock points his finger on the irresponsibility of the food industry who is obsessed with profit and neglects good eating habits. Towards the end of the film, Spurlock tries to get through on the telephone to an important member of the McDonalds firm but can't manage to do so. It paves the way to the conditioning of children at an early age with the unhealthy food they're given for their lunches at school and later adverts about McDonalds seen on TV, the latest menus offered to customers that become increasingly fat (the menus) but also the efforts made by overweight people who try to lose weight through different means. All this is shot in a hard-hitting way and without too many didactic methods. Spurlock didn't put aside black humor too: "one can find McDonalds everywhere. In the streets, malls, airports and even hospitals. You understood well. You'll be on the spot in the case of an infarction".At one point, Spurlock interviews a French woman in the street who think that overweight people who try to sue fast-foods because they deem them responsible for their obesity is a silly idea. That's also my opinion and it is common to many French people. In a way, the fast food industry encourages people to behave in an irresponsible way. At the end of his project, the director calls upon our responsibility and good sense. Either you continue to go regularly, even daily to eat in fast-foods. Either, you'd better stop or at least to put a brake on your junk food consumption. And it is a thoughtful way to end a heartfelt assessment about a major problem in the United States but also in Western Europe. One to muse on.One learns at the end of the documentary that the "super size" menu was definitely removed from the list of dishes available at McDonalds. The film didn't really help to this action but it is a promising step.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie, I'm 5'7 and about 160 lbs which seems ideal. But in this country and especially in the black community I am labeled as too thin. Because everyone else is fat and over weight. Hey I don't tout myself as being the most healthiest person in the world, but I consider eating out at fast food joints strictly occasional. Maybe it was my upbringing my mother always cooked at home. It seems today no one cooks anymore for their kids. Coupled with TV, video games and computers, it's no wonder that people have become so fat. I remember growing up (I'm 39) and seeing a fat kid was being a minority, obviously now it's becoming the exact opposite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fascinating documentary of filmmaker Morgan Spurlock's self-imposed 'McDiet.' For one month, he limits himself to eating from the famous Golden Arches, tracking the gradual decline of his health and expansion of his waistline. The seemingly simple premise isn't for a moment dull, and his journey is guaranteed to make you think twice before picking up that greasy burger for supper. Spurlock also splices in an interesting look at the affect of fast food and commercialism on society as a whole, particularly on children. And unlike the work of Michael Moore -- to whom Spurlock has been compared -- none of it comes off as mean-spirited. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Life Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is a real life horror movie that shows what could happen to a perfectly healthy, fit, energetic, and in general happy man when he decides to spend a month on the "Mc-diet": for a month, he has to eat and drink only the items that are on McDonald's menu; he must consume three meals a day and super size his meal if asked. Before our eyes, he goes through the scary transformations, gaining 25 pounds, ruining his heart and liver, elevating his cholesterol level and his blood pressure to the cosmic heights, making his sex life non-existent, and gradually becoming a junk- food junkie. While killing himself softly with the mountains of saturated fat, he tries to find an answer to the burning question ? why and how did America become the fattest country in the world. Paraphrasing the old saying, "Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you who you are"...It is not like I am totally against McDonald's or other fast food restaurants. Their food could be enjoyed and I remember fondly when the first McDonald's was opened in Moscow back in 1980s, we used to go there with our young sons once in a while on weekends, and it was fun, it was new for us. I think, these are the key words ? "once in a while" and "to eat the fast food in moderation". The food itself does not kill you unless you kill yourself with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you lovin' it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who works for what would be considered "fast food", I approached the documentary "Super Size Me" with some hesitation. I know that the movie's creator, Morgan Spurlock, chose McDonald's and not the fine establishment of In-N-Out, which I work for, to show how this food is terrible, but it still deals with the very food I work with day in and out (pun intended). I believe his intention to show how awful fast food has become is achieved, but I think there is a serious flaw in the way he does this. Yes fast food is terrible, but who eats it 3 times a day? NO ONE! Spurlock goes to the extreme for his cause, and decided he is going to go on a one month diet of only McDonald's: three meals a day, seven days a week. And to add to the fun, anytime he is asked if he wants to super size his meal, he MUST say yes. Spurlock begins by going to some "doctors" and getting checked out before he begins this suicide mission. His weight is a mere 186, and his cholesterol is a wonderful 165. In other words, he is in fine shape. Now, one thing that made me suspicious about this film was the doctors. You never know who is real or not. One might think Spurlock wouldn't use just actors, and the credits give the names of doctors playing themselves, but I still found it a little suspicious that his GP (general practitioner) was always wearing the same blue blazer with the black shirt underneath, and was always unshaven, with the same amount of shadow. After a month, you'd think he might have changed his clothes a couple of times and shaved, or not and have a beard. And as for the GI, we never see her actually doing anything. She is just always sitting behind the desk with her hands clasped, nodding her head. A little suspicious if you ask me. Anyway, back to the movie. Spurlock begins his day by going to Mickey D's for some breakfast. McMuffin sandwiches, which I must admit I've eaten before, but only out of desperation because I was hungry, and there was nothing else to eat. He continues his diet at lunch time, getting a double Quarter-Pounder with cheese meal and for dinner, non other than the Big Mac meal. Already, after just one day, he is starting to look a little ill, but he is really into it, cheering as he bites into the burgers. After 5 days, he goes back to the "doctors" to get another check up. He has gained 10 pounds already. His "GP" advises him to go to a nutritionist, who thinks Spurlock is insane for doing this diet, as does his girlfriend, and even Spurlock himself, but the cause is too important, and so Spurlock continues on! Along the way, we meet a colorful "cast" of character, from lunchroom workers, to middle school students, to diabetic patients receiving gastric bypass surgery. Perhaps the most interesting of them all is one Dan Gorske. Now, if you don't want to have the fun spoiled, and it is quite a shocker as to whom this man is, then I would skip down to the next paragraph now, otherwise, continue reading. Dan Gorske has set a record for eating Big Macs. He absolutely LOVES them. In his interview with Spurlock, he tells us that in one year he ate over 700 Big Macs. Now obviously there are only 365 days in a year, so this means he is eating 2-3 burgers a day! Spurlock is absolutely amazed, and probably a bit disgusted, as I was, but the most incredible thing was that this man was not obese. And it is later revealed that his cholesterol was normal. Pretty crazy if you ask me. After 12 days, Spurlock goes back in for another weigh in. His weight is 203 pounds. That means he has gained 17 pounds in 12 days! But it is not enough to stop Spurlock. He continues on! In the mean time, he gets sick, he has chest pains, and towards the end, his "doctors" tell him his liver is failing. He also experiences male "dysfunction" which his girlfriend complains about. On the whole, I would say it is well done. Some of the ways Spurlock filmed this were a tad annoying. The scenes jump so rapidly, that you don't have much time to ingest what is going on, (not that you would really want to anyway). The movie was also extremely washed out, which made it very difficult to focus on the details of the scenes. While I wouldn't necessarily say that I enjoyed this film, or liked it, I would recommend that everyone see it, at least once. It was very interesting, and if truthful, very scary as well. The funny thing is, we all know that McDonald's is junk, but we still go there. My manager at In-N-Out once said to me, "We expect them to serve us crap, but we still go." Why? One place I can recommend is In-N-Out. To quote their theme song:"That's what a hamburger's all about!!!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film does try to criticize the 'fast food' mentality, which is fastly becoming the nr. 1 problem in the West (not just the U.S.). Off course no one can keep up the diet Spurlock has in Supersize Me, but that's not the point. It's a statement.But Spurlock makes his point in the first 30 minutes, everything after plays mute. I was especially irritated by the 'very dramatic' scene's where family members express their fears for the life of Spurlock. I mean: c'mon, that didn't have to be in the final cut. This was for dramatic effect and had nothing to do with the subject matter.But still a good docu that enables him to hire the best personal trainers to work the pound off again. I noticed that everyone was counting calories in the movie. Perhaps you can count this: Domestic gross: 12 million.

		<shortDescription>An Eye Opener for Fast Food Junkies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a documentary made by a guy from West Virginia actually who now lives in NYC. The overall premise of the film is he eats nothing but McDonalds for 30 days. Three meals a day, no cheating. If asked to super size his meal he must agree to. Everyone knows fast food is bad for you but this is the most graphic example of it. While making this film he regularly got checkups from three doctors. 21 days into the experiment he was having such difficulty with his pickled liver that he could seriously injure himself or possibly die if he continued with his diet. He trucked on for the full 30 days somehow.Many other great points were brought up by this film and discussed. They review the diets that kids have in school lunches and if their meal is actually as nutritious as it should be. Marketing tactics are broken down into startling statistics showing why fruits and vegetables are so commonly overlooked as snacks. They also interview some strange McDonalds fanatics. An old couple who has collected decades of merchandise in their garage and a man who is known for eating two or three BigMacs every day of his life! He is still relatively healthy though (he doesn't eat the fries). The wildest experiment involved placing regular food and McDonalds food in glass candy jars (not airtight) and letting them set for many weeks. The regular food naturally decomposed as expected. Some McDonalds food like the BigMac lasted a couple weeks without any signs of trouble. Scariest of all was the McDonalds french fries which sat in the jar for over two months and showed no visible signs of decay whatsoever. Makes you think twice about eating fast frankenfoods. I haven't eaten at McDonalds in years but I know other fast food chains aren't any better for you. This is definitely an interesting film that you should check out when you have some time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking film, but some questions left unanswered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Supersize Me" is a thought provoking film that humorously but intelligently examines the fast food industry in the US, focusing on the leader in the field, McDonalds. It raises issues concerning how fast food is advertised and sold and the effects on health, but it leaves some questions unexamined.The film stresses that Spurlock gained over twenty pounds during his 30 day diet of McDonalds breakfast and lunch menus, his cholesterol levels skyrocketed, and his liver became so affected his doctor compared it to the liver of someone set to drink himself to death, like Nicholas Cage's character in Leaving Las Vegas. Yet the film contains an interview with Don Gorse, a man who is famous for eating at least one McDonalds Big Mac every day of his life since 1972. Gorse's image is seen in the sequence that caricatures McDonalds' "super heavy users"; people who eat McDonalds food three times or more per week. All the other super heavy customers are portrayed as exactly that, super heavy. Gorse is as thin as a rake. The end credits state his cholesterol level as 140, which seems low. Spurlock emphasizes that fast food dangerously increases the weight of many people who eat it frequently. Why then is Gorse skinny with no apparent cholesterol problems? Is it simply because he doesn't eat the fries? Also, the film includes information about the food industry in the US and how agents working for General Mills and other large food companies put pressure on Washington to advance their interests. Surely McDonalds, Burger King and the like are part of the problem, as the spokesman says... but so are General Mills, Kellogg's and other manufacturers. "Supersize Me" encourages the audience to skip the Golden Arches and eat at home, but what are they eating at home? Not all families have mothers like Spurlocks who cook from scratch every night, or people like Spurlock's wife who cook only organic vegan dishes. McDonalds is a bit of an easy target. I can see Spurlock's point that he chose an all McDonalds diet because of the lawsuit brought against it by the two teenage girls who blamed their obesity on Ronald McDonald. The film shows that it isn't just the fast food industry overwhelming TV with advertising... the McDonalds ads are joined by ads for candy, snacks, cereal and other sugar and fat laden products, many of them aimed specifically at young children.I would have liked to see more debate about the lack of education in schools regarding nutrition and the need for more physical education classes, more health classes, and classes in cooking (for both sexes). Most of all I would have liked to see more debate over the companion industry to the fast food and processed food industries, the diet industry. It would have been revealing to see how the fast food restaurants and food companies' sugary and high fat foods lead into the market for diet versions of the same foods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a movie everyone should see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie &amp; used to eat a LOT of fast food. After seeing this movie I stopped eating at McDonald's almost completely (I still desired their Egg McMuffin w/sausage and no cheese meals). A few months after seeing this movie I decided that it was time I did something about my eating habits. I slowly began cutting out as much fast food as possible. Back in May of this year I finally decided to truly do something about my weight. My decision I believe, was made in large part to this movie.I knew fast food was bad for you, but I had no idea how bad until watching this movie. If you have not yet seen it, and you are overweight or have other health problems, you NEED to see this movie. It should help you change your eating habits or at the very least, consider changing them. Incidentally, of the fast food places, the only ones that are truly acceptable to visit are Wendy's and Arby's. They are the only fast food places that truly try to include a healthy section on their menu.I am currently seeing a dietitian to lose weight and she has even said that Wendy's is fine to eat because they have real salads and provide fat free dressings, etc. One of the biggest surprises I got from this movie was learning that almost EVERYTHING (including salads) on the McDonald's menu has sugar in it. And if you use their dressing for the salads, you may as well eat a Big Mac because that's how many calories and fat are in the salad after adding their dressing. Wendy's Oriental dressing on the other hand, only has about 2 - 4 fat in their dressing. There's a HUGE fat difference there. So be careful of even ordering "healthy" items from the Mc D's menu!!!Incidentally, since stopping eating bad fast food (I still eat at Blimpie's, Subway, and Wendy's on occasion and if you order the correct things it's not bad for you), and seeing a dietitian, I've lost 17 pounds in 2 months and I've already dropped 2 - 3 dress sizes and I've never felt better (and I'm still going strong on my diet)!!!! And you know what, I do NOT miss fast food which truly surprised me since I was probably the Queen of fast food eating! All I have left to truly say is "Thank you Morgan Spurlock for opening my eyes all the way!!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made documentary on the perils of a fast-food life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock directs, writes and stars in this, a frightening look at our dependence and addiction to fast foods. And here I am reviewing the DVD which offers great value in both the deleted scenes, extra scenes and a powerful interview with Eric Schlosser, author of "Fast Food Nation". He commences the movie by having a complete health evaluation by several professionals and is given a clean bill of health. His energy zooms from the screen. Added to this is his engaging commentator style, one gets to like Morgan Spurlock! He formulates a plan to eat three meals a day at McDonald's for one month. He also acquires a pedometer and resolves to do the same amount of exercise as an average American does. The plan is simple - he gets to eat every item on the menu at least once, and gets to SUPER SIZE if asked by a McDonald's employee. Within a week, the toll is being recorded on Morgan both physically, psychologically and addictively. He begins throwing the food up within a few days (a great warning) but soon he is depressed if he is not eating it. His body is slowing down, he is getting heart palpitations, he is seriously depressed and lethargic between feeds of his drug. He is affected sexually and his healthy girlfriend is becoming more than concerned about him and his changed personality. Added to this are his doctor's urging after only two weeks to stop the diet as he could die from the impact on his liver and have a cardiac arrest. But Morgan persists. I found his mix of humour and fairness appealing. For instance, he interviews a man who has lived on Big Macs for years and years with no adverse effects. However, the bottom line is that the real cost of McDonalds is never recorded. The low wages and no benefits, the garbage generated daily, the hooking of kids so early in life on a lifestyle that will shorten their lives not to mention affect the quality of their lives, the effect on the planet of the huge "mills" that it takes to generate all the pork and beef that McDonalds uses. One startling fact was that there could be bits of a 1000 cows in one burger. Now there's a thought. The Chicken Mcnuggets harbour bits we don't want to know about. And also the feed given to these poor captive animals is the leftovers from their slaughtered relatives. Happy Meals are anything but. And the shelf life of cooked fries from MacDonald's that are allowed to sit in a jar? No change after 10 weeks and still counting, they threw them out. Scary. 9 out of 10. It should be required watching for children. What I found particularly edifying were the solutions that Morgan offered, particularly the interviews with the high schools that had completely turned around their cafeterias and made gym a requirement for all students every day. Bravo, we need more such movies....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll never McLook at McFast Food the McSame Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Super Size Me is an exploration of the obesity epidemic that has been sweeping the US over the last decade. The idea for this film seems to come from the many McLawsuits that have sprung up over the past couple years from people suing the fast food industry for making them fat... or so they claim. Did these people really become fat from eating McDonalds food? And if so, how much of that food would they have to consume to suffer the adverse effects of fast food? This documentary follows one man, Morgan Spurlock, on a mission to answer those questions and more. Spurlock (under the advice of not one, not two, but three physicians) decides to undergo a 30 day diet of eating nothing but food from the McDonalds menu. Spurlock puts a few restrictions on himself such as: if they ask him if he wants to "super-size" he has to say "yes." Also I think he had restrictions on how much physical activity he could do. There were a few other restrictions on how much he was able to do in regards to McDonalds food as well, but I can't remember them.What occurs over the next 30 days really is astounding in that Spurlock transforms his body into an unhealthy mass that is full of high cholesterol, high blood pressure and excess body fat. The changes are so dramatic that even the physicians and his nutritionist are amazed and all warn him to stop the diet before completing the last week. Spurlock pushes forth and ends up gaining almost 30 pounds in 30 days.I really enjoyed this film not only for its decent production values, but also because even though this is documenting reality, you really feel sympathy for Spurlock for what he is going through (depression, chest pains, relationship problems, etc). I feel that Spurlock hits home how harmful this food is for you if consumed on a regular or even semi-regular basis. He handles a lot of these difficulties with humor and a smile, but as time continues on, Spurlock's smile is less frequent and he's less excited about the idea of eating another McDonalds meal.The only real criticisms I have for this film are that Spurlock is a bit too sympathetic to the fatties that sued the fast food industry in painting them like unwilling victims who had no idea that a Big Mac and a large order of fries are going to put them in the grave faster. These are people who clearly don't want to accept any responsibility for their poor decisions and instead see a cash cow (pardon the pun) in the form of McDonalds.It makes sense why Spurlock would take aim at McDonalds as the sole purveyor of unhealthy food. I mean McDonalds is the leader in the fast food industry and has been since Ray Croc was president. I think this also ends up being the film's weakness since Burger King, Carl's Jr. and Taco Bell all have just as unhealthy offerings on their menus.Overall, a really well done film that seems to arouse in one's self utter disgust followed by a resolution to never touch fast food again.By the way, don't forget to check out the extras on the DVD - most notably, "The Smoking Fry."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most important documentary ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Super Size Me is a documentary concerning the increasing problem in the United States concerning obesity. The film follows a short period of New Yorker Morgan Spurlock as he begins a quest to relate obesity with fast food, preferably McDonalds. Morgan will eat nothing but McDonalds for breakfast, lunch and dinner for thirty days. Morgan's prime goal is to relate the health risks of fast food with the increasing threat of obesity.Morgan goes all over the United States, eating at various McDonalds and giving facts as he goes. I have to admit that after seeing this I never want to go back to McDonalds after seeing how they make chicken nuggets and all of the sugar that is rushed into there products. As the film progresses Morgan is overcome by mild depression and nearly gains 30 pounds in one month. The film is powerful in presenting the way Americans are becoming so overweight and how obesity is being ignored and the fast food industry is doing nothing to help. Morgan Spurlock keeps the film going with his witty remarks and comments. The educational sides are placed just right to blend with the interviews and remarks of loyal McDonald fans, employees, and lawyers. You'll be well educated and have a good time while doing it. Spurlock has made an exceptional and very important documentary providing an important message to every American. Obesity is growing in the US and this film is leading the battle against it. The film is probably not popular with McDonalds employees but it hit the company and even caused the removal of the super size option at McDonalds. This film should be seen by every American just to educate those about the horrible health risks in fast food.Super Size Me. A documentary featuring Morgan Spurlock.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SUPER SIZE ME (3+ outta 5 stars) There is a certain amount of "preaching to the converted" in this documentary's tone... I mean, everyone pretty much agrees that fast food is bad for you... and subsisting for 30 days on nothing BUT fast food... well, I don't think that anyone can be surprised at how it all turns out. Still, the movie does make some very good points and provides a nice, little history of the birth and growth of the world famous "Golden Arches". Writer/director/guinea pig Morgan Spurlock keeps the movie interesting with some amusing observations to help sugar-coat (uh, oh... sugar) the message. I did find it a little off-putting that Spurlock got sick and heaved up a huge portion of McDonalds' cuisine ON THE FIRST DAY!!! Uh, dude... if you can't handle your first super sized meal maybe you aren't the best test case? In fact, I'm surprised that he wasn't spewing up McFood at later points in his experiment. One solid week of McGriddles would have me upchucking at the mere *idea* of having another. I really wish the film would have included some of Spurlock's girlfriend's vegan recipes that later set his body back on the road to recovery... after watching him stuff Big Macs into his face for 90 minutes some of those vegan dishes looked delicious!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not eaten at McDonalds for about 3 years, now. This is not because of some weird diet thing that I have, or prejudices against the "Golden Arches" - I just haven't really felt the need."Super Size Me" is an entertaining documentary made by a brave man named Morgan Spurlock. His goal: to eat nothing but McDonalds three times a day, for thirty days straight, and to experiment on how our bodies would cope if we all did the same.Spurlock is either a genius or completely insane. Spurred on by the new rather worrying statistics about the obesity levels in the USA, he has taken the subject to heart. The end result is both interesting and clever. I do have one word of caution: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE WHEN YOU ARE FEELING A LITTLE PECKISH!!Ahem.It works on both levels - you can be easily put off by the facts and figures, but then, when you see one of those burgers or fries or whatever he is eating at the time, you start doing really good impersonations of Homer J Simpson: "Mmmm. Burgers!"But Spurlock uses the opportunity to have a go at McDonalds to have an even bigger go at the whole of the fast food industry and even the school dinners that are fed to America's kids. Now, I'm from England, and just recently this chef named Jamie Oliver has been running around campaigning for healthier lunches. The results have been really positive, with very big promises made by the government because it affects everyone. I can't help wondering, after watching with horror the state of the lunches, whether someone should do the same in America. There was an example of a school that fed really healthy lunches to its pupils, and therefore has managed to fight back the misbehaviour of the students. Plus, states Spurlock, it costs the same as the current food programme set up!Spurlock is not as funny as Michael Moore, who you can instantly draw comparisons to. (Incidentally, I wonder how many times Moore goes to McDonalds a week?) However he does raise an issue and makes a film that everyone can take note of and watch. The trouble with some of Moore's work - say, for example, "Farenheit 9/11", which I wasn't too keen on if you read my review from that - is that he can be too anti-government. There is no problem with this in "Super Size Me".Overall the film is fun and a very good warning to us all. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going for a run. Just as soon as I've finished this quarter pounder with cheese...7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Size Me (2004)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock has noticed, like many people, that Americans are getting bigger and bigger. After seeing how two young girls are planning on suing McDonalds for making them fat, Morgan decides to live out the dream of many an eight year old child and only eat at McDonalds for a whole month. The rules are as follows 1) He can only eat things supplied over the counter at McDonalds 2)He must have three square meals a day 3) He must have everything on the menu at least once over the next month and finally 4) If asked if he "Would like to super-size" his meal, he must reply "Yes". Many people seem to have a problem with this film because no one in their right mind would eat three meals a day at McDonalds, because everyone knows they are unhealthy. Maybe so but Morgan says this at the end of the film, this is an extreme situation. Let's face it it wouldn't be anywhere near as interesting if he ate four McDonalds meals a week over a long period of time. Morgan chooses McDonalds, not to be mean, but because it is the leader of the fast food world. Morgan supplies some not so shocking statistics, such as McDonalds serves more customers a day than the entire population of Spain. At the beginning Morgan is checked over by three doctors, all of whom seem confident about the experiment, and don't think anything too bad will happen. It is amazing to see how they change their minds, as Morgan piles on the pounds, and his cholesterol increases etc. During the film Morgan doesn't exercise, as he is attempting to simulate the average American. It is an interesting and entertaining documentary, Morgan comes across sometimes like Michael Moore as both are very humorous, but Morgan doesn't seem as biased. Morgan soon becomes addicted and is told he must stop and that his liver is turning into Pate. At no point does Morgan say we shouldn't eat McDonalds, but when he shows Americans who do not exercise, and go to McDonalds 4-5 times a week it is time to worry. Especially since McDonalds aims so much advertising at children, and the schools aren't exactly a healthy place for the people of tomorrow to start out. The film does go on a bit, after all we get the point after the first weigh in of how bad McDonalds food is, and it doesn't tell us anything new, apart from demonstrating the extreme dangers of fast food.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I invite you to drive-in to this review of a documentary film that will "bowel" you over. "Super Size Me" is documentarian Morgan Spurlock's brainchild of how ingesting fast foods can cause you to slow down rapidly. Spurlock ate Mcdonald's munchies for an entire month. Day and Night! Talk about your Mcdaddy! This weighty culinary experiment caused him liver damage, enormous cholesterol levels, mental depression, sexual dysfunction, and an enormous amount of culinary farts. The documentary pounds in much footage of nutrition medics presenting that "grease" is not the word when it comes to salud. "Super Size Me" is a groundbreaking documentary on the wellness of nutrition and most notably the dangers of malnutrition. However, the doc did have its few flaws. I did feel it was a personal attack on Mcdonald's. For example, there were a minuscule amount of references on other fast food companies such as: Wendy's, Jack-In-The-Box, and Burger King. Nevertheless, "Super Size Me" admirably sized itself as a "phat" documentary. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Been meaning to see this for awhile, was about as good as I expected. Both disgusting and humorous, it will make you think twice about ordering any fast food in the future and at least plants a seed for us to think a little more about what we are putting in our bodies and the long-term effects. The only issue I have with it, is that it's really not a 'documentary.' The filmmaker has a set vision in mind and knew his opinion before he started his experiment. But in defense, are there really any balanced "documentaries" left? Go rent "Naook of the North" if you want a slice of documentary film-making, rent this to educate as well as entertain. Unless you work at McDonald's, then file a lawsuit. That's what America is all about - sue a person, then eat a cheeseburger and feel great for about 15 minutes, then nap. Wake up people! Be nice to each other, have a nice chicken sandwich or fish every now and again and read a book for Chrissakes.... Anyhoo - 8 out of 10. Straight up B.</fullReview>

Whether or not it does, the movie has an overwhelming effect on its audience. All Americans call relate with one another on a number of scales. Most if not all Americans differ from one another, still, all of us at one point has ordered and ate at a McDonalds. This Universal truth connects all Americans. Therefore this movie has an audience of over 250 million Americans. There are very few movies that can make you laugh and cry. There are moments where you laugh while you go along with Morgan's journey of truth and sloth. Other times, you are on the edge of your seat, covering your mouth with one of your hands as you realize this is far from a comedy, this is your life. Would you like fries with that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock has assembled a wonderful comic documentary about what the fast food industry is doing to America. You'll be convinced that if the fast food companies can get away with serving the public shredded newspaper, they would do it in a second. Unlike the heavy handed Michael Moore, Morgan Spurlock is a light-hearted and likable host. His doctors are fun to listen to (Dr. Issacs reminds me of Robert Newton) and just the wild mixture of typical Americans Spurlock assembled makes the film a treat (I especially liked Don, the MacDonald's eating champ and the tiny school cafeteria employee "All you need is a box cutter and you got lunch.") The DVD commentary track is worthwhile and hysterical. (Especially the bit about "Outback")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock's kamikaze documentary seems to be under the impression that the whole world hadn't a clue McDonald's was bad for you. We all knew that, man. But the criticisms his methods have met with are unfair.Many people have complained that over-eating is bad for you no matter where you eat from. But Spurlock does not over-eat. He only has 3 square meals a day. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. And still he became very unhealthy, rather alarmingly so.The point seems to be lost on most of us though. I don't eat from McDonalds and I won't. But those who do won't stop because they've seen this movie. I'm going to assume this will be the attitude the world over. McDonald's did abolish their Supersize option shortly after the film came out but claimed it was nothing to do with Morgan Spurlock in an attempt to distance itself from this documentary.Spurlock even tries his absolute hardest to get an interview with a high-ranking McDonald's executive but fails miserably. Which only serves to prove, even further, how faceless and careless McDonald's is when it comes to public relations.Though Mickey D's is not the only monster to be skewered here. America's health issues and obesity problems in general are tackled by Spurlock. All in a rather cartoony, easy to follow fashion. If overbearing documentaries like F 9/11 put you off the genre then don't worry. Supersize Me is lighter but still as sophisticated and darkly comical.The extras on the DVD are actually quite good. The deleted scenes in particular. One of them focuses on decomposing food, trust me...you'll NEVER look at McDonald's Fries the same way again.The DVD is in 1.85:1 non-anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 2.0 sound.</fullReview>

I went into this knowing that fast food wasn't good for you, but I never realized how dangerous it was for you. It almost, but not quite, makes me want to never eat fast food again. If anything, in moderation fast food is okay. Morgan certainly went to extremes, but he pointed out many facts that I was unaware of. This film is certainly anti-fast food, and it singled out McDonald's without comparing other establishments. However, McDonald's is the king of fast food and I doubt most would disagree with that statement. Very convincing to say the least, Super Size Me leaves you with the impression that Morgan Spurlock has a bright future ahead of him. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

I wish this movie has been made sooner. I always ate out but this film has changed my views on fast food for life. My Mom stopped cooking for us when we were about the age of 12. So I stronger feel that cooking should be taught in schools for kids such as myself. That way fast food won't be your only option. People don't realize the health risks they are putting themselves into until it's too late. So I strongly recommend everyone to watch this. Hopefully you'll learn from it as I have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was incredibly good. The narration was both hilarious and eye opening, the experiment was unbelievable, and the over all movie was excellent.We start out with an incredibly healthy man, Morgan Spurlock. He goes to three different doctors and finds out that health wise, he is pretty much perfect. He then reveals that for the next 30 days, he will be eating nothing but McDonalds for every single meal, and if the employee asks if he wants it "Super Sized" he MUST say yes. As he begins his experiment, he becomes extremely ill, at first just not being able to keep his enormous meals down for more than twenty minutes, to then fidning out that his liver is basically turning into a solid. He gains over over 20 pounds in the entire month, gaining around 7 in the first week (incredibly bad for the heart). The film, I'm assuming, was inspired by the law suits put against McDonald's for "making people fat". He wanted to prove just how bad fast food is for you, almost killing himself in the process.What makes it worse is that his girlfriend is a vegan chef...Not only does the film focus on his experiment, it also follows schools to see what they are serving their children, goes straight to McDonalds to ask for a nutrition sheet (showing how much fat is in their foods) and in most cases, not getting one to take home.The film untimately made me feel sick to my stomach while I was watching, you know the feeling where you eat too much of something that isn't exactly good for you...yeah, that one. It shows every possible bad side effect of fast food (laziness, depression, decreased sexual activity...not just because of a girlfriends lack of interest but also because of lack of being able to do anything at all, and of course, death...)The only thing that I found wrong with his experiment was him not walking anywhere while he did it, walking only a few miles a day instead of the normal 5-6 most New Yorkers walk...I think that to just show the effects of food, he should have kept his normal routine to show how much harder it gets...Other than that, great movie, really eye opening...not one to watch with popcorn.I give it 8.5/10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock stars as himself in a documentary to see if there's any credibility to the rise in lawsuits against McDonalds and other fast food restaurants, and nearly kills himself in the process. Woah! Maybe the fact that Spurlock ate nothing but super sized McDonalds meals for 30 days has more to do with his condition. I don't think even the overweight people in all the footage shown here did that, even if there are people in the world who do. Spurlock also has a cute girlfriend, who's a vegetarian. I don't know about you, but I'd rather nibble on a girl who looks like her than a monstrous Big Mac. With a style similar to Michael Moore, this movie seems to lay a lot of the blame on food lobbyists wielding their influence in Washington and within school districts, but isn't oblivious to the issue of personal responsibility.As for my own health, I'm sure the fact that I've always been such a picky eater has made it so easy for me not to fall into the trap of obesity. I don't eat at fast food joints every single day, but I do eat all the wrong foods, and don't do that much of what passes for exercise. Yet I've only been at an average weight since I was 35 years old, and until then I was underweight. And I don't have diabetes, high cholesterol, or any other problems nutritionists think I'd have from my diet. In fact my cholesterol level is amazingly LOW!I missed the movie in the theaters, but I did see it on DVD. They showed a pair of McDonalds Happy Meals with Kim Possible-related promotions, and it didn't sway me for or against of fast food. It just made me want to watch my copy of KIM POSSIBLE: THE SECRET FILES, which I considered doing anyhow prior to seeing the movie. If this is an attempt to get people to stop going to the local fast food chain, it certainly failed with me. But now I think it would be funny as hell if we started bombing famine-stricken countries like North Korea with Big Macs, Whoppers, 7-11 Double Gulps, and similar giant sized fast foods. How about it, President Bush?</fullReview>

It is truly disturbing that our kids health is being auctioned off to the lowest bidder, and that food companies manipuate our kids through slick and highly polished marketing. This film makes those points, and will have you laughing at the same time.And it is also a sign of the times; 20 years ago nobody would have thought it was that crazy to eat nothing but McD's for 30 days; now it seems like an act of lunacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a long time junk food eater, and someone who has been changing his dietary and exercise habits, I was interested in this film, but waited for DVD (more to do with theater prices than perceived quality of the film). When I finally saw it, I was sickened. Not by the message, but the sight of the food and what it was doing to Morgan Spurlock. Due to economics, I didn't eat out much; but when I did, it was predominantly fast food. I don't want to go near the stuff anymore. I had started to reach that conclusion when I ate at a McDonalds on a recent trip, after dropping 30 pounds over the previous 6 months and eating more healthy foods. The food tasted awful, especially the fries. After watching this, I'll never go in a McDonalds again, nor am I likely to consume fast food.With good humor and relative objectivity, Spurlock shows the effect of a steady diet of fast food. Granted, he took it to the extreme by eating all meals there, which is not the norm, but there are a significant number of people who eat regularly at fast food restaurants. The damage they are doing to themselves is far less, but still detrimental. Spurlock makes it clear that people choose to consume this food, but that they are also bombarded with advertising from childhood onward to consume this product. He also documents the difficulty to obtain nutritional information in the restaurants and the amount of lobbying the industry does to protect itself from legislation that would require it to provide more honest information about its products. So how do consumers make informed choices if the necessary information isn't there for them?We watch as doctors and loved ones plead with Spurlock to quit, and the physiological problems that arise. He finds himself listless and depressed when not eating the food. He wakes up in the middle of the night with chest pains and shortness of breath. He feels odd sensations in his body. In the course of 30 days he gains approximately 25 pounds and loses muscle tone.The most damning aspects are the footage of school cafeterias, where students are fed a diet of french fries, chips, sugared drinks, fatty meat with heavy sugar sauces, and starchy vegetables. Nowhere do you see green vegetables and lean meat or vegetable protein. Not until you go to a school for troubled students, where a corporation or the FDA are not dictating the food. Instead, they have lean meats, plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables and the complete lack of soda. Only one state requires physical education classes, Illinois. Most students across the country are gaining little exercise, and consuming nothing but fat and simple carbohydrates.What's not seen in the film is the most sickening. In the DVD extras, is footage of an experiment Spurlock conducts. He places a Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, Fillet-O-Fish, Fries, a homemade restaurant burger, and freshly made french fries, in glass jars. Each is placed in a separate container and their breakdown is filmed over the course of several weeks. The homemade burger and fries turn moldy fairly quickly, while the McDonalds' food takes far longer. After EIGHT WEEKS, the McDonalds fries show no signs of mold! Ugh! Just think how long it takes your body to digest that, compared to potatoes that you cut and fry yourself!Now, there are many factors to consider in watching this. One, Spurock engages in no rigorous exercise. Two, he eats three meals per day from McDonalds. Three, although he tries everything on the menu, most of his meals are the worst foods. Four, he adds condiments to the foods items. Five, he supersizes the meal when asked. Taken in moderation, or with regular exercise, his weight gain would have probably been less significant, but would his cholesterol levels and heart rate been any lower?I don't think this film is necessarily a call for a vegan lifestyle, although his girlfriend makes that point. However, it is a wake-up call to America to put thought into what it eats and to engage in regular exercise. Sometimes, it takes the extreme to get people to act. See this film and act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting how fast you can get fat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although there was no new nutritional information for me, it is all pretty well known. However,I found it very interesting how fast can you go downhill if you diet changes to junk and you give up exercise and vitamins/minerals supplements. Many people say it this movie is a little bit of a fake, but was it really? Maybe average American does not eat 3 meals in McD, but it is not the only junk food place. McD was just an example as it is the largest venture of this type in the world. Fast food is in the USA for the longest time and 60% of adult obesity rate did not came out of thin air. I agree that in the large part it is due to inactivity, however if you do not eat right you will not have energy to exercise and that point was pretty evident in the movie.I do not think we should blame fast food places alone, but the truth is they started this unhealthy revolution in the food industry -including GM food, chemicals and hormons additives that we consume on daily basis(I recommend reading "Fast Food Nation" by E. Schlosser).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super Size Me is one of the greatest Documentaries I have ever seen. It is only recently that we have the chance to see documentaries on the big screen through the emergence of these Docu-films. It was fantastic, especially the facts a figures about how many Fast Food Outlets there are in every square mile in America. What was also fascinating was that McDonald's point blank refused to provide a spokesperson to answer Morgan's questions. I think their silence spoke volumes in admitting their guilt. The comparison of how the sizing's of Fries and cokes have increased over the years was particularly worrying, and when Morgan actually showed the sizes of the fries cartons and coke cups on screen, I was shocked that a Super Size USA Fries and Coke is nearly twice the size of a Super Size UK Fries and coke.The fact that McDonald's have ditched their Super Size option, partly due to the court case and this film I think is great, as it shows democracy on such a grand scale can change even one of the biggest capitalist Companies. The only trouble watching this film is that it puts you in the mood for a McDonalds. I went out the very next day and had a large McChicken Sandwich Meal!! As the movie highlights, McDonalds do not drag people in and force feed them their food. The stuff is cheap and cheerful, and if eaten in moderation, is fine. With the amount of scare stories in the press surrounding so many foods, it is refreshing to see that this film does not say NEVER eat McDonalds, but rather be aware of what it could do to your system if eaten on a regular basis.I would Definitely give this film a Super Size McTen out of Ten!!</fullReview>

During those 30 days he has to try every item on the menu and supersize any meals where the staff ask him.In between detailing the dire effects on his health, Spurlock includes a series of more detailed studies of aspects of fast food culture, including talking about addiction, "heavy users" and "super-heavy users" (McDonalds' terminology apparently), children's meals, branding, the lobbying power of the food industry, legal issues...I would rate the movie as a must see - but only once. Some scenes (especially his first supersized meal and the surgery to staple one person's stomach) were (deliberately) pretty gross, but would lose impact over time.</fullReview>

There simply has to be reasons for this and while fast food may not be the sole culprit there is no longer any denying it is the largest one. Well, that combined with what has become the most physically lazy age in history. The lack of people even walking today is simply mindboggling. Spurlock is pointing out how easy it is today to damage one's body, spirit and relationships with unhealthy eating - the role diet plays in every day existence. And I know many people who subsist almost entirely on fast food diets. The most interesting part of this for me was the school for problem behavior (criminal) kids and the absolutely amazing results they were achieving not by disciplinary means but by diet and exercise. I would like to see a documentary explore these results. Bottom line: I like what Spurlock has done here. He's given us a (mostly) honest and entertaining look at ourselves and one of our super sized problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes it is crazy to eat 3 meals a day at any fast food place except for a rare few. But it is not unusual for many people in America to eat at least once a day at a fast food place. Think of SSM as an accelerated example of the dangers of eating fast food, or for that matter any processed food.I do not believe an individual should be allowed to sue a food company for their health problems, because it is their's or their parents fault for their condition. That would just be one more case of Americans blaming someone or something else for problems they created.But make no mistake that Food Companies are doing everything they can to grow their businesses. That means sell more food. Do you think McD's or ANY fast food chain cares about their Heavy or Super Heavy Users? They love them alright, and they gladly fuel their addiction. I guess they might be upset if they die, but only because that is a lost revenue stream. Coke and Pepsi's strategy since the early 80's has been to get people to consume more soft drinks, do a Google search on 'Soft Drink Consumption' to see how successful they've been.SSM message is this. America has a SERIOUS problem with obesity. There are huge corporations spending BILLIONS yearly to encourage people to consume more of their products that 90% of are unhealthy. The majority of School lunch programs in the USA are unhealthy. Eating large quantities or regularly at fast food establishments is bad, possibly even terminal, for your short and long term health. SSM wasn't perfect and there were a few times I felt he distorted the truth or sensationalized things but overall what he presented was accurate. Yes going from eating healthy and exercising to eating fast food and no exercise is an extreme change BUT it does not disqualify the results. Think about this: How easy/hard is it to eat a healthy diet, how easy/hard is it to eat an unhealthy diet? Not to mention the cost of healthy vs unhealthy diets.I use to think this saying was silly and trite but it 100% Truth... "You are what you eat!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Big Deal (Even a Super Sized Deal) For a Reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While those who say it's not well executed have a slight point, Morgan Spurlock does make a must-see film. The film doesn't do much to inspire other filmmakers within it's presentation, it is a perfect compliment and non-distraction to the film's real meal (pun intended) - it's genius content.Does a fast food franchise deserve to be sued for making customers obese? Is it solely to blame? Are people's beliefs about their food exaggerating, or horribly understated? These a re some of the questions Super Size Me asks. And, how to answer? Simple - make yourself the guinea pig and record every twist and turn along the way.Morgan begins an experiment which, to not give too much away, probably both doesn't meet but most of which exceeds your expectations. He'll eat Mickey D's 3 times a day, for 30 days, and tackle food and weight related issues, and the developing results, along the way. He can only Super Size it (note: no longer a possibility for us, as McDonald's removed the option for mega sized meals just more than a month after it's Sundance premiere - just a coincidence, of course . . . ) when asked at the counter, he must work through the entire menu, and can eat nothing not sold over the counter at McDonald's. On the way, he'll meat with three doctors, face the caring wrath of his vegan girlfriend, and meet some interesting people.Filled with intriguing ideas and some questions for the food industry that can hit as hard and leave people as stunned as Michael Moore on politics, Morgan goes from the state of health in schools and their cafeterias (where he helps the audience to draw up most of their own conclusions, especially from one interview he has with a teacher who expects way to much out of tens, and I say that as one myself), to the differences between the weight of his home city to another, and everything in between. What comes together is a movie that's well paced, and well if, again, not inspiringly and groundbreakingly executed, and filled attention grabbers in each scene. The DVD shows Spurlock has great directing instincts, and cut many interesting scenes which were simply too long or didn't add anything to either side of the argument. In the end, the suspense of the results pours on, and the movie becomes as addictive as it's subject matter (I was forced to watch the movie over two nights, and it killed me). By the end, Morgan has graced us with a little more than we wanted to know about the experiment, but enough to both terrify and amuse us on the way. It's a classic documentary, and for those few haters who will tear the movie apart for it's average composure, everyone has to admit that it's classic just for it's content, and the DVD will always be special to me for the Bonus Footage of the metamorphosis of some McSandwiches and Fries over the course of nearly 3 months. It's classic, and I don't know if this guy can top it - check it out, you won't be sorry.</fullReview>

I much prefer arby's roast beef sandwiches and salads. but even then only 1 or 2 times a month.America, wake the hell up. you are getting fatter and fatter and fatter. it will get worse before it gets better, there is always a time lag in these matters. what a tragedy. and the next generation gets brainwashed and enticed into cramming a pound of sugar a day into its gullet. shameful and completely avoidable.I hope to see more such films from this producer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd seen this film advertised at the marquee of my local theater for months and never saw it until it came out on video. On a whim, my girlfriend and I rented it last night. What an eye opener! I have long since sworn off fast food in favor of cooking real, unprocessed food, but mainly for the simple fact that I did not want to give my money to a corporation for food of mediocre quality. Morgan Spurlock's film reinforces the main reason to boycott fast food; it is unhealthy. Further, the might that fast food giants and other corporate interests wield on children is nothing short of shameful. During his introduction, he showed that there was an average of four McDonalds per square mile in Manhattan! More McDonalds than fire stations, police departments or public parks! Also, children are subjected to a staggering 10,000 advertisements a year! During an exercise with school children, most were unable to identify photos of George Washington, George Bush or a likeness of Jesus, but they sure knew the Wendy's girl and Ronald McDonald! The film follows Spurlock as he eats three meals a day at McDonalds, and is filled with factual interviews with health care professionals, dieticians, and a former Surgeon General of the United States. It is brilliant in its simplicity and at each new shocking revelation my girlfriend wondered aloud why Spurlock was not sued by McDonalds! To his defense, he did not slander or libel them in any way, but merely showed what happens to the human body and mind when subjected to an exclusive diet of McDonalds for thirty days. His accurate and comprehensive documentation of his exact state of health before during and after was commendable. I was shocked to learn the real and dangerous changes his body rapidly made. His liver deteriorated, his blood pressure rose and his cholesterol skyrocketed, not to mention the fact that he gained nearly 25 pounds in a short 30 days. Coincidentally, after this film was screened at the Sundance Film Festival, McDonald's stopped selling its 'Super Size' meals. This is a testament to the power of the independent filmmakers of the world. I applaud men like Morgan Spurlock and Michael Moore for using their artistic talents in addressing real issues in our society and not creating just another film in an endless stream of Hollywood tripe. Hopefully you will see this film and it will compel you to act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spurlock did it out of badness. That's the only way to explain how someone would want to eat McDonalds for 30 days straight. What's even more puzzling is how he could get through the entire breakfast menu in nine days if he says so, declaring boredom in the process. If you can understand the mathematics the nutritionists and doctors give out, you have a very entertaining and interesting movie, not that anybody else will say that. If you want to see a healthy vegan get sick from food and apparently laugh it off, by all means watch Super Size Me, the movie that single-handedly stopped McDonalds from handing out their Extra, extra, extra large fries and drinks. Being Canadian and not having ever seen fries or drinks "Super-sized," I was quite intimidated by the size of the order Spurlock had to eat (and eventually puke). Other gross out moments Spurlock loved all too much to display is the obesity surgery one fellow had to go for to save his life. A movie that will inspire plenty of independent thought, Super Size Me is a movie you must watch before you dine out at a fast food restaurant ever again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unimaginative style, but still very powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Supersize me" is filmed pretty much like a conventional documentary, with a very businesslike point-by-point style of dealing with health issues related to fastfood. The ongoing experiment of eating nothing but McDonalds food is the recurring theme that binds whole thing together. But don't be fooled by it's conventional and predictable style, this is a powerful film. Halfway through I suddenly got very conscious of how I eat and what I eat, and I kinda felt guilty because I was eating while watching the movie (it was an apple for cryin out loud!).There are going to be people who say that eating *only* fastfood is a no-brainer and that this is like labrats developing cancer because of a huge overdose of something. But those people should understand that there are marketing drones who will say anything to sell their fastfood, they'll even say it's healthy. This film unnerves these claims. Moreover, it quantifies the problem (albeit vaguely). We knew fastfood was not that healthy, but is it really that bad? Apparently, it is. "Supersize me" has often been compared with Michael Moore's work, and some people feel it's better than Farenheit9/11. I don't. No good documentary is unbiased, anybody who tells you that is lying. Be it moderate or extreme, the film should reflect the makers opinion in the best possible way. This one is no exception, just ask a McDonalds spokesperson. Morgan tells his story with wit and honesty, but he is definitively biased, and he lacks Moore's ability to find the surreal and the absurd. The way in which he approaches the subject is not as imaginative and surprising. (think of "Bowling for Columbine" if you're a Bush fan and feel too strongly about f9/11).7/10</fullReview>

That said, I'm a vegan and therefore biased against the fast food industry anyway, but I really did enjoy this film. It isn't really revolutionary, of course, but Spurlock is a fairly entertaining guy and the movie itself is fun. The best parts aren't really related to Spurlock's crazy attempt--the globalization of McDonald's and other fast food companies, the childhood obesity epidemic, etc, are the most entertaining and educational. Spurlock is a lot more approachable than Moore has become--whether or not you like the man, you can't deny that he comes off as pretentious.The film definitely could have gone more in-depth, but all in all it's worth a look. And while you may not enjoy Supersize Me as much as some have, anybody who gets really angry about the content might just see a little too much of him/herself in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary film targets specifically MacDonalds, but also attacks the wider problem of obesity in the United States and the extent to which fast food id responsible.After hearing about two teenagers trying to sue MacDonalds for causing their obesity, New York film-maker Morgan Spurlock decides to eat nothing but MacDonalds food for thirty days, to see how justified the claims are. The rules of his experiment are: He can only eat food on the MacDonalds menu, he must try everything on the menu at least once during the experiment and finally he must "super-size" his order if asked.Before the experiment Spurlock (whose girlfriend is a vegan chef) is a picture of health, and the film documents the toll the experiment takes on his body.The news that MacDonalds food isn't exactly healthy, can surely come as no surprise to anyone. People do have a choice whether or not to eat healthily, and, of course, most people don't eat every single meal in a fast-food restaurant. But the most effective scenes in the film show the havoc that the whole fast-food culture wrecks on people's health. not just MacDonalds but the food that is served in schools as well. The film is very entertaining, with Spurlock coming across as a more likable version of Michael Moore. I am one of the many people who enjoys eating fast-food and, although this film will certainly make me think a bit before going into my local fast-food outlet, I won't be going on a diet just yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A one line diatribe that is entertaining and possibly even effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a similar style to Michael Moore's diatribes (against firearms of the U.S. government), Super Size Me takes a heavyweight pot-shot at the fast food industry ? notably McDonalds. Morgan Spurlock looks at the general wailing against fast-foods and their disastrous effect on health and obesity. Under the watchful eye of several doctors and his vegan girlfriend, he embarks on a month-long regime where he will eat and drink McDonalds and nothing else. As expected, his health goes from very good to pretty awful. Super Size Me is a bit of a one-line rant, but entertainingly and effectively shot. If it doesn't put you off fast food maybe nothing will. In the closing credits, the film points out that McDonalds altered their marketing a few weeks after the film opened at the Sundance Festival, pushing apparently 'healthy' foods and revoking the 'super-sizing' offer (which allowed an extra big upgrade for a nominal amount). So it may have had some social impact already (which McDonalds, of course, deny). The film is funny and disquieting, though hardly rigorous. Perhaps the most unsettling fact it makes plain is the masses of corporate control over unhealthy meals in the school, and the powerlessness of parents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, those funny things in life. Last Sunday me and a group of 4 went out to watch a movie, and most of us wanted to watch either Michael Moore's new project or 'that other American documentary', Super Size me. Now, in fact, we went to see Almodovars La Mala Educacion, and I watched this one 4 days later with my girlfriend. Still, the comparisons between Super Size me and Moore's previous product, Bowling for Columbine, are so obvious, it's almost scary.What does Spurlock want with this movie? I think that's in important question, because we are dealing here with a documentary. What is his point, what do we need to know? And why is that important?No matter how you put it, Spurlock's main point is that eating at McDonalds 3 times a day is not healthy. Right. Now, I may be a dumb guy, but I know what love is. Erm, you mean health there, Forrest.At times, Spurlock stumbles (there's no other way of putting it) onto some serious issues: McDonalds seem to advertize in particular towards young kids. Now, do we want that? Good issue. Then he finds out McDonalds isn't too clear on how many calories and fat exactly is in their products. In fact, he ends with a quote that in a newly introduced salad there are no less than 51 grams of fat. Don't we need to know that? Isn't that important? Good issue.But these important issues are presented and then taken away again immediately. It seems what the director, actor and writer really wants to do is have some fun and not focus on the serious stuff too deeply. So in the end, we're kinda puzzled... what is the point of all this.In that sense, it truly is a Bowling for Columbine about the food industry. But at least Super Size Me has some nice animations...6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The value of this documentary is the way it actually changes your way to look at fast food. It did not follow one important guideline for a fully trustworthy documentary, i.e. to be objective at all times, but at least it tries to. To me, the film is more of a commercial (against fast food) than a documentary.The documentary tries to achieve much of the trustworthiness through Morgan's anxiousness, showing how he enthusiastically digs into the meals with great desire. He loses some of his enthusiasm as the days goes by, but continues with a determination that seems to stem from abstinence. Morgan's energetic appetite together with him actually being a funny and charming guy, keeps the film going. My eagerness for fast food (and especially McDonald's) was more affected by this film, than from reading "Fast Food Nation" (although the book had other good aspects to it). The film should be a good choice for anyone considering cutting down on fast food.It got a 6 from me, mainly because of it's good intentions and Morgan's enthusiasm.</fullReview>

In no time in the history of man have we been so well (over) fed then now. We have access to high calorie/fat foods and our bodies have not had time to adapt to this huge influx of calories. I believe the WHO (World Health Organization) has declared that we have as many over-fed people as we do starving. What a dichotomy- that the Sudanese are starving and we in first world nations are struggling to lose weight. Excellent work to the producers and all who contributed to the success of "Supersize Me" . I also think it's a compelling statement that McDonalds didn't respond, but to come back with salads (hi fat) and will stop the Supersizing. hmmmmm And this was not due to this incredible film?

As I walked out of the theater, I saw many enormous popcorn tubs in the trash, their contents only partially consumed. My advice is to save your money; go in with a bottle of water and sip constantly to soothe sympathetic nausea and stomach cramps.It's a shame this documentary ended up with a PG-13 rating. Parents, this is an important balancing viewpoint, and should be viewed by all kids of all ages. The language isn't too awful, the sexuality is all in the abstract, and you know how kids love a gory surgery scene...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say Morgan Spurlock, from the swing state of West Virginia, makes a unique and interesting reflexive doc here. Unfortunately, the hype of the film upon its' debut at this year's Sundance Film Festival and frequent talk about Spurlock's efforts dampen the film a bit. From a technical standpoint, it is almost not nearly as crisp as anything that Barbara Kopple or Erroll Morris have put forth in recent years. There are some scenes in the film- such as one in an operating room- which are genuinely disgusting and were not neccessary in my view. I also thought his girlfriend's revealation of his 'bedroom capabilities' were on the overindulgent side. Nevertheless, this is a good look at how corp. America manipulates our psyche as children and how they really don't care about what we eat. As a former reporter, I felt for Spurlock in his efforts to get through to Big Brother McD. Toys R Us was similarly rude to me and that was over a story about X-mas toys! I think as Americans we need to wake up and look at the dark side of our nation. This merely taps into the vaste wastelands that each of us has ignored or overlooked for far too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that makes you think twice before eating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Super Size Me - a documentary that was done so well, its made me think twice before I pick something to eat. This film we done extrememly well; camera movement was shaky at times, sometimes having problems with focusing, however, I believe that that adds to the documetary style. This film had a very small budget. Just good old fashioned film makers doing what they do best. Sacrificing his heath, Morgan takes on a diet of nothing but McDonalds food for a full month. The results are amazingly startling. This film is not just about McDonalds, however. Morgan goes to schools to investigate the students lunch options, and other suppliers for foodstuffs around the country. This film was excellently excecuted. I would suggest that you view it. And if not, at least take a look at what you are eating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I did not expect too much from this doc. It would be easy to make it into some David Blaine type "BigMac and Circus spectacle", but it actually turned out to be a good documentary first with a clever premise, rather than a clever premise with a documentary thrown around it as filler.Spurlock did a solid job of making his point which is much more than just "dont try this at home kids, even though you do it at home all the time." No, it went further than that talking about how the cards are essentially stacked against us. Not only do you have a mighty marketing machine "branding us" and conditioning us as kids to come eat bad food, there is a whole industry using every opportunity to convince us through giant lobby groups, massive advertising campaigns and countless product tie-ins, that its fun, its great, its a part of our lives and its always the real thing. See it in the theaters if you can, or for sure rent it on DVD when it comes out. It was worth it.</fullReview>

Seeing what 30 days of Mcdonalds does to a healthy young man (more inside than out) was eye-opening. For those of you who don't end up seeing this movie, at least take home this message. DO NOT RAISE YOUR KIDS ON FAST FOOD! That sounds like common sense, but it's really important.

		<fullReview>I went to see this film shortly before parting to Texas for some work, and I came out knowing rather more about local eating habits than I expected. I must admit to now reserving a hotel room with a kitchen so I can do my own cooking and avoid the LardFest that seemingly awaits me.The documentary itself has a lot of things going for it - the form of the piece is very straightforward, and our host and his girlfriend are likeable and easy going. I particularly enjoyed the interaction with the team of doctors and experts who over the course of the film were seem gawping in horror, warning sternly to stop, and finally shaking their heads in disbelief as the rollercoaster ride of saturated fat consumption continued.Also effective are the sequences of statistics (all performed with cute graphics and suitably twisted soundtrack) and the sections where our man visits the schools and colleges that churn out the next generation of belt-busting heart attack victims. Looking at the school restaurant manager who convinced herself that the children who just bought fries were really sharing them and had brought their own brown bag lunch, or the face of the "cook" who no longer had to do much except open boxes and reheat gunk, you couldn't help but feel the decline of the United States was already well under way.Tellingly, in a sequence with the lobby group for the grocery trade, a spokesman let slip 'that we are part of the problem'. The look on his face was worth a thousand pictures, as he realized what he had said was now captured on film. Unsurprisingly he is no longer employed there.Finally, the whole thing slides along at a pleasant pace, there is no sense of 'I have a message and I am going to pound you with it for 2 hours' that I sometimes feel with a certain Mr Moore. All round a great piece and worthwhile watching just for the smug (in my case) feeling that a) I am from Europe b) I don't eat fast food c) I take exercise. Enjoy the thought as you shove another chocolate in your mouth at the cinema.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indoctrinating children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother rarely cooked. My family had a rotating junk food roster: Dominos, Red Rooster, the sort of Chinese takeaway that includes prawn crackers with your order. I was intimate with the junk food circuit ? the plastic trays, the fluorescent lights and greasy bags. As an account of that intimacy, Super Size Me begins perfectly. A chorus of smiling children chant the names of fast food joints - "McDonald's, McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and a Pizza Hut." (I remember going through the motions at school ? hands tucked under my arms for KFC, the Pizza Hut roof made over my head.) Junk food's penetration of the youth market is a given, as is the particular joy a visit to McDonald's holds for a child. The film joins the dots on the way McDonald's actively recruits children: the playgrounds, the birthday parties, the warm early memories of eating with one's family. In one scene, director Morgan Spurlock holds out images for children to identify: they recognise Ronald McDonald more readily than Jesus or George Washington. He draws on our concern for children. He visits school cafeterias ? in the States, largely given over to junk food ? and physical education programs, draws our attention to the effect of obesity on self-image. The usual rhetoric about consumer choice ? no one forces you to eat junk food ? seems dishonest when you are indoctrinating children. (Give us your children and they are ours for life.)Michael Moore's strength as a filmmaker is his tendency to dramatise his material. In Bowling for Columbine, when Moore gets a gun with a new bank account, it is a perfect demonstration of the mad availability of firearms. Spurlock was evidently watching. He hit on a great conceit: for a whole month he eats nothing but McDonald's. With the assistance of a battery of doctors, he measures the effect on his health. The figures speak for themselves. In a fortnight, he gains ten percent of his body weight. (We watch as he steadily develops a paunch.) He does serious damage to his liver: the doctors liken his diet to an alcoholic binge. With disarming frankness, his girlfriend confides that their sex life has also suffered. Meanwhile, we meet an assortment of lawyers, school headmasters, teenagers ? and a man famous for his prolific intake of Big Macs. (He has eaten almost 18,000.) His local McDonalds keeps a running total on their sign outside. This is a fun and ultimately scary essay on American excess. We recoil in pleasurable disgust at every burger and half-gallon of soda.</fullReview>

I'm always on the good, at work, and school, out with friends. so i don't exactly eat in very much. my on the go life leads me to fast food daily. while i don't eat fast food three times a day, i consistently have fast food or lunch or dinner or both. so my diet is similar but not parallel to morgans. in the film his weight reached 210. i weigh 208, i almost scared me that he reached my weight by eating similar to me, and he was so unhealthy. i felt like i was doing the same to myself. granted i do participate in roller hockey and am on my skates for about 2 hours, 4 days a week. but it still hit me. I'm almost afraid to get a physical because i feel like ill get the same numbers. but because of this I've started to turn my eating habits around, the change starts with the individual. but morgan tackled this issues like michael moore tackled the GM planet closing or americas obsession with gun control.being a great filmmaker comes down to finding an issues and going with it and making the audience walk out of a theater going "wow". so hats off to you morgan, you got a great future ahead of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, educational look at a troubling American epidemic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** I have rarely taken the opportunity to view documentary films, films which detail particular problems, subjects, and daily life in the eye of the camera. Call me crazy for those big budget, major concept films, who discriminates the like of these independent insights, but I usually would rather engage in the discovery channel for this kind of matter. However, I was instantly interested and intrigued by the subject of this documentary, focusing on the hazardous, unfortunate, augmenting epidemic which is obesity in America and the drastic, perhaps horrifying effects an unhealthy diet produces upon even the most healthy individual. Spurlock, a masterful, innovative director in producing insightful documentary, questions the why and the how about America's disturbing "fat formation", and even embarks upon a personal experimentation wherein he will indulge nothing but high-calorie, unhealthy McDonald's food for the duration of 30 days. Preceding his experiment, Spurlock ventures into the world of the health department to assess his health- blood pressure, heart rate, weight; the essentials in maintaining proper health. He is informed that his health is perfectly fine and that his future "diet" could alter some components of his health, yet nothing of grave significance. Throughout the film, Spurlock indulges incessantly in McDonald's food, to the extent of obsession and health defection. He discovers that various aspects of his once healthy cycle have been drastically, regrettably altered, namely his liver, which has been abused as severely as that of an alcoholic (One doctor even links his liver to that of Nicholas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas, which eventually results in tragic cirrhosis death). Simultaneously on his journey of experimentation, Spurlock delves into America's parallel problem of constantly feasting in the most insalubrious of foods, as the epidemic of obesity has now become, to some degree, a normalcy among many communities (i.e. Houston), and has become just shy of the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., behind only tobacco. Spurlock examines this problem so productively and effectively, with humor and serious attention, through statistics, pictures, graphs, interviews, etc., and discovers for himself and for the audience, that fast food is literally sickening, especially excessively, and in conclusion, poses the provocative and educated question, "Do you want to live in misery, in sickliness, in eating fast food and literally destroying yourself(statistically said to be the leading cause of the current obesity epidemic), or would you rather wake up, face the facts, and avoid any such health defects as were evidenced by Spurlock's shocking experimentation? McDonald's, a corporation supposedly interested in only its customers and their happiness, rejected to even interview Spurlock for a discussion of the repercussions of "McMeals". Look out for yourself, and regard Spurlock for a critical, scary example of the effects of dangerous, malicious "fat" food. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary should be shown in all schools in America. Children are at the mercy of the food industry. A nation of fat people has been created by the unscrupulous merchants that have no qualms to resort to advertising and sponsoring children's programs to hook the young minds into being the industry's main source of revenue.Morgan Spurlock's experiment centering around McDonald's operation is an eye opener. Of course, he does go into extremes in order to illustrate his point. The fact that his health is affected by a diet full of the wrong things, will ultimately be anyone's downfall. In fact, as it's pointed out in the film, there are people that eat at McDonald's on a regular basis. The nutrition value of what's consumed is nothing, at all, plus the fact that eating it regularly will make anyone sick.The documentary uses a very light tone, but it packs a heavy message for those that are unconvinced about the harm of this type of food that is the staple of a lot of people in America. The fact that everything is being super sized, contributes to the problem, which is what Mr. Spurlock is trying to tell his audience.There should be more Morgan Spurlocks out there to put things in perspective for all Americans. He must be hated by the McDonald corporation after this expose. Good job Mr. Spurlock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a time when obesity runs rampant in America, we wonder who's to blame. Is it the fast food industry? That's a question Morgan Spurlock tries to answer in his documentary "Super Size Me." To make this movie, he embarked on a 30-day diet of eating nothing but McDonalds food. The result is this very informative study of fast food's proliferation in the modern world. McDonald's has franchises all over the planet (83 locations in Manhattan alone!). Many aspects are analyzed, such as fast food's use of advertising, its focus on children, and the use of sugar in the food. Seeing this movie will make you laugh, and shock you as well. How it changes your eating habits is up to you.</fullReview>

This intelligent, indie film opened my eyes to just how harmful fast food can be.The creator of the film subjected himself to three medical examinations and visited these three doctors through the one month he ate nothing but McDonald's. He gained 25 lbs in on month, and put his liver at serious risk.His girlfriend is a vegan chef and managed to put him on a detox diet,which got him back to normal after 9 months. I won't give up fast food. It's usually tasty and convenient. But I will moderate my intake of it.I'm really happy that a film like this was shown at a mainstream theatre like Grant Park.

		<shortDescription>More insightful than entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock has created a documentary that documents just how harmful the fast food industry is to the health of this country. By going on a month long McDonald's binge, he was able to gain 25 lbs. and become an unhealthy person. He did this, not by overeating, but by simply having one Mickey D meal, three times a day. So in that regard, he has made an important film that should wake Americans up. However, I have to be honest, I did not find Mr. Spurlock to be the most entertaining or endearing narrator. On many occasions I felt he was overdoing stuff in order to make his message more powerful. He just tried too hard to show the outlandishness of his project. So, whereas many people in the audience were laughing hysterically, I was not. But let me say again, the message of the film was still valuable. The corporations of the world are pushing poison on us. They do this because it allows them to make a greater profit. They could provide more healthful food, but it would hurt their stock reports.Moreover, we have a federal government that does everything it can, to help the fast food industry accomplish their sick task. God Bless Mr. Spurlock for exposing this, even if I did not think he was that funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many comparison's have been made to Michael Moore's "documentary" style. Spurlock's "Super Size Me" is funnier, more authentic, and less sarcastic than a Moore film, but takes on the serious issues of obesity and pre-fab school lunch programs as well. Watching Spurlock descend into the pit of fast-food hell with a grin on his face is a kick as he pokes fun, sometimes graphically, at his body's own reactions to the "food." Meanwhile, his doctors are seeing red flags and his vegan wife wants to shake some sense into him.Criticisms have been leveled at Spurlock with respect to his calorie intake and lack of exercise during the 30-day period, but no matter. It was still only a month, and the extent of his problems is still a shock.I was lucky enough to see this at the South by Southwest Film Festival in March with a large audience that was so animated and wild that their laughter sometimes drowned out the the next line of dialog (well, *that* aspect wasn't so lucky). At the time McDonalds had announced the elimination of supersizing - definitely in anticipation that the film would hit big.I'm hoping the film does well, but I have to admit - with all the McImages coming at me, I've been really craving a Quarter Pounder.</fullReview>

The effect of a month's worth of McDonalds on Spurlock were quick and dramatic, leading to some real drama about whether he could continue the experiment. Of course we all know that McDonald's isn't healthy, but he goes on to make some chilling points about the way we are feeding and raising our children.This is really the kind of movie that makes you come out of the theater thinking very hard about your own lifestyle.

		<shortDescription>McBinge, McFix, McPoison, McFat, McSick, McDie (?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First time writer-director Morgan Spurlock seized the right moment to ride the wave of public interest in our national epidemic of obesity and overweight, and the important role of popular reliance on fast foods in contributing to this problem.As everybody knows by now, Mr. Spurlock, a fit fellow in his early 30s, dedicated himself to a month of eating exclusively at McDonalds. His self imposed rules: 3 meals every day, trying every item on the menu at least once; saying yes whenever a clerk asked if he wanted to alter ("upgrade") his order to the "Super Size"; and eating everything he ordered.He was initially evaluated by his primary care physician, a gastroenterologist , a cardiologist, a registered dietician and an exercise physiologist. They also checked him at regular intervals during and for months following his binge. Up till this binge, he ate sensibly (his partner is a vegan), had only 11% body fat and ran a cholesterol of 165. At the end of a month, having eaten at McDonald outlets in Manhattan (where there are 83 vendors, we learn), California and Texas, he had gained over 25 pounds, his body fat was up to 18%, and his cholesterol was now 225! Moreover, he showed as much as 10-fold increases in hepatic enzymes, indicating acute inflammation of liver cells, most likely due to acute fatty liver. His blood pressure had risen significantly. He was having regular headaches, fatigue and depressed mood, all of which could only be reversed by the next McMeal. His libido had faded to nothing.Spurlock is the first to admit that his binge was extreme. Even the most devoted consumers at the Golden Arches probably don't eat three full meals a day there, day in, day out (though fast food has become the main food source for an increasing number of citizens). Still, the symptoms he rapidly acquired and the biochemical changes that occurred serve as impressive evidence of the toxicity of the McDonald diet.Arguably the standard fare there also has an addictive effect, since the relief of discomforting symptoms (headache, dysphoria, depression) is brought about by the next McFix. I'm not enthused by our culture of victimization with its attendant lawsuits against big tobacco and other corporate giants for destructive personal habits that can by curbed by addicted individuals. But I think that the facts of Spurlock's experience provide as much justification for holding the fast food industry culpable and responsible for poisoning America as is the case for cigarette manufacturers.Spurlock nicely meshes segments on his own McBinge odyssey with useful information on weight, diet and health from talking heads like the former US Surgeon General, David Satcher. For anyone still in the dark about it, there is plenty here on the multiple health hazards of overeating and overweight. Spurlock has done a fine piece of public service here, packaging critically important health messages within an engrossing and often humorous personal story.By the way, it took 8 weeks for his liver and cholesterol test results to return to normal, and 14 months to take off all the weight he had put on. Whew! My rating: 8/10 (B+). (Seen on 04/01/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was anyone actually surprised to hear that McDonalds was unhealthy when this movie was released? Or more to the point did anyone radically change their diet after watching it? All this movie achieves is proving that if you do something incredibly stupid there will be consequences. For example eating fast food EVERY MEAL for 3 months causes you to gain weight (gasp) or that you start to loose the taste for it...if you eat ANYTHING every meal for a long period you WILL loose the taste for it.To be honest I do not believe that McDonalds has a case to answer for, suggestive selling is something that all businesses rely on?you don't have to up-size just because they say you'll save money.Here is another example: Subway's 'only 6 grams of fat' campaign?What you are told LESS FAT than McDonalds, what you are not told LESS PROTEIN &amp; MORE CARB'S, therefore just as unhealthy.In conclusion, this film should not be celebrated for selflessly showing exposing the lack of nutritional value in fast food or milking the 'heartless corporation' clich simply because it's a topic we've all aware of for many years &amp; the sheer fact that no one really goes to a fast food outlet looking for a healthy dinner?

		<fullReview>I wasn't someone who really needed to be convinced that eating fast food was bad for you, and yet Morgan Spurlock's film managed to convince me all over again. The shocking thing about this documentary is not that a diet of McDonald's turns out to be bad for you (wow, what a surprise!) or fattening (get out of town!) but that it actually acts like a poison to your system. Even the doctors in the film are amazed at the detrimental effects a fast food diet had on Spurlock over the course of a month. He had as much fast food in 30 days that nutritionists recommend having in 8 years. That's a cold wake up call to those who defend themselves by saying things like, "I only have it once a week or so, so I'm o.k." Do the math--once a week equals 52 times in a year; at that pace, you'll eat 8 years' worth of fast food in under two.People also claim that this film has too firm an agenda, Morgan Spurlock is too preachy, etc., etc. I honestly don't understand these comments. Since when are documentaries allowed to be only objective in tone? Don't these people know that some of the best documentaries in film history have had clear agendas and clear points of view. This criticism is leveled at Michael Moore too. But if the film maker isn't allowed to have a point of view, why would he be making the film in the first place? "Super Size Me" is almost a horror movie in the effect it has on your psyche and your stomach. How anyone can watch this and continue passively to fill their bodies day after day with garbage is beyond me.Grade: A-</fullReview>

As I watched this eye-opening film everything he talked about made perfect sense. And by the end of the movie I came to realize what the fast-food industry was all about, Marketing and Advertising! These companies don't care about the well-being of other people. There only interest is to make money. I really enjoyed how in-depth Morgan Spurlock takes the watcher into the dark world of fast food. But wait, there's more. He doesn't just dive into the world of fast-food. He also talks about what they are serving in the public school lunchrooms too. This film changed the way I'll eat forever. If you have not yet seen this film and you are a consumer of fast-food, than you need to swing by your local video rental store and give this film a look at. Thank you Morgan Spurlock!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the McPukes, and more...not all of it good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock has done something akin to what Quentin Tarantino did in Pulp Fiction: he made the act of biting into a hamburger look and sound absolutely disgusting. Literally, puke-inducing.We all know the story by now--Spurlock, tall, skinny, in exemplary health, decides to see what happens when he emulates in extremis the dietary habits of a lot of Americans by eating nothing but McDonalds products for a whole month. And of course, whenever possible, he SUPER SIZED his meals. Well, DUH. He gains about 20 lbs, his cholesterol and body chemistry go wacky, he gets moody, exhausted, and--horrors!--he can't even get it up for his annoying, supercilious vegan girlfriend.Actually, by the end of the movie, he didn't look all that fat to me; if Morgan Spurlock at day 30 of his McDiet is what's considered obesity by today's standards, we're in a lot of trouble.Super Size Me has some problems, but it's an immensely entertaining movie, if you can get around the washed-out camcorder-quality picture and sound, which is why I give it an 8. Spurlock comes up with a lot of eye-opening information and probably does it better than the more mean-spirited, arguably fact-challenged (but equally entertaining and probably justified) character bashing of Michael Moore. You do come away from the movie realizing just how insidious the McDonalds empire, and the manufactured food industry as a whole, really is. If you find yourself wanting to punch Ronald McDonald in the mouth after seeing this, you're probably not alone. He deserves it.In a way, I wish Spurlock had been more surgically focused on that aspect a'la Moore. Unfortunately a lot of the movie revolves around his mugging for the camera while stuffing his face--but I can't blame him for liking to turn the camera on himself, and watching his transformation is pretty startling and at times highly disturbing. I just can't get around the attention-seeking media stunt aspect of Spurlock's experiment.What bothers me a lot more is the movie's attitude toward overweight people in general. Spurlock, as I said a tall slender white guy, unrelentingly portrays fat people as something akin to carnival freaks; he seems to show not one bit of sympathy for them as people, or even to consider them as quite human...fat people are portrayed as faintly amusing objects of contempt. He almost negates his central thesis--that McDonalds makes billions in profits by getting people addicted to unhealthy food and the unhealthy lifestyles centered around its products--when he all but blames their customers for being so stupid to fall for it. And like so much of the media, Spurlock focuses tightly on obese people's physical appearances--fat bodies (especially women) as the epitome of grotesque, practically joshing us to shout "EEEWWWWWW!!!" in unison. Personally, his very skinny blonde girlfriend, she of the kelp quiche and organic salads, is more disgusting than any of the fat people in the movie. To his credit, he BRIEFLY disses the diet and fashion industries and espouses exercise and healthy eating instead. But one gets the sense that he's confused obesity with the people it afflicts, and that he'd like to whack them both from the face of the earth. It seems that underlying his ostensibly good intentions is some serious, perhaps unconscious, prejudice. I don't appreciate that.The blow-dried flack for the food industry's lobby at one point admits (to Spurlock's delight) that the industry is part of the problem. Unfortunaly, although he's produced a very entertaining and provocative documentary about a nefarious industry and the poor health they promote, so in part is Morgan Spurlock. But this isn't a political forum. It's about movies. And Super Size Me is, despite its few but serious flaws, a well-made one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extreme Take on an Extreme Diet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that I like Spurlock's style more than Michael Moore's because it is less accusatory, but I have enjoyed Moore's works as well.The issue I take with this experiment, is that even for an extreme, it's extreme. Not only does the filmmaker eat a solid diet of McDonald's food for a month, but he eats a lot of it. For breakfast, he would normally have a couple of sandwiches and a hash brown, and for the other meals he would order enough food to literally make himself sick on at least one occasion. It's also already been noted that in addition to consuming more fat, he decreases his daily exercise to a minimal amount. Using the same parameters, one could probably show negative affects of a fruit and vegetable diet.I really think this film was rather unfair to McDonalds, as I certainly don't see them as the villain in the obesity war. People who are inclined to overeat will find a way to do so, McDonalds or not. Should grocery stores remove all of the chips from their shelves because some folks can't eat just one (bag)? I will say this film does bring to light the major failings of American society, and that's the lack of self-control and self-responsibility. In addition to having the largest overweight population in the world, I'm guessing we also have the largest percentage of Prozac (et. al.) users. Eating fatty foods makes you feel good, so the two go hand in hand. Why are we all so damned depressed (not speaking for myself here)? Perhaps we just have too many choices. That's not McDonald's fault.Overall, I thought this was a little boring in parts, and didn't really prove a valid point. Had he simply made McDonalds PART of his diet and had the same results, that would have said something. But who would want to watch that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An astounding insight into the real dangers of fast food - No more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with writing about movies all the time is that you find out so much about it before it's even finished filming, so that when you go to see it there's often an anti climax or, if there is a surprise, no surprise at all. It can be quite frustrating not to see a movie afresh and your expectations be lifted or even shattered.The interesting thing about this movie is that it did the exact opposite, and it brought back this feeling. Within the first twenty minutes I was stunned at what was happening to this man and the facts and figures that were revealed.The opening of the movie bombards you with some astounding figures about the state of health of us all, and where the highest statistics of obesity are and how they've grown over the years. Well I say us all, but it is an American documentary.After that the film maker reveals his premise. He's going to eat McDonalds for a month and see what harm it will do him. Extreme, he agrees, and he totally acknowledges the rights of the individual to choice - they can easily walk past the fast food outlet - but then he has just as much ammunition for why you don't.The effects on the body and personality are amazing to watch, and quite frankly astounding. What really grabs you and wakes you up to the dangerous qualities of this diet are the Doctors involved in monitoring his health on a regular basis. They all begin on a quite relaxed and optimistic note, some body levels of fat and carbohydrate may rise but there shouldn't be a problem.Within weeks they've totally changed their opinion and the warning signs are beyond the dangerous levels. It actually gets to the point that the Doctor compares him to an alcoholic and warns him to stop before he does himself permanent damage, or even kills himself. Even they are astounded at the effects on his body.Morgan Spurlock is indeed a brave man, and his desire to show the perils of fast food, the mixed and blatantly wrong messages from both the Government and the industry itself and the general state of health of his country drive him to continue with the experiment.This is compelling watching and full of logically, well presented facts which cannot fail to persuade you what and who are at fault. The simple courtroom admissions of the fast food companies are shocking, and leave you wondering if the convenience is at all worth it.Without a doubt you have to watch this movie and understand what this food is doing to our bodies. Not only that, but to see what the new so called healthy options are, and are not, delivering to you.The only negative things I'd say about this movie are that it's quite clear that Spurlock is an extremely healthy man before going into this documentary, and this presents a far too good starting example of his fellow American. However, pretty soon, as he gets used to the amount of food, you realise it's actually a really good starting point, a baseline if you like.There's also a distinct lack of what the other options should be. A brief mention of a man who has been through the Subway diet doesn't make any comparisons or conclusions about that type of food. I think with so many people seeing this movie who can't decide for themselves not to go into a fast food establishment, it would have been good to hand feed them what is a better option, and why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Super Size Me" - Something very strange is going on here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a confession to make: I love (loathe) McDonald's food. I especially love the long lines, the noisy kids, and general rush of the fast-food environment.Food-wise at McDonald's, I love myself a sausage, egg &amp; cheese McMuffin, with two hash browns, and an orange juice. In fact, I loved it so much, that I can recall back during the summer of 1995, when I was 10 years-old, that every Monday and Wednesday I'd order this exact same meal for breakfast.Well, my shameless self-indulgence eventually caught up with me and when I was in the sixth grade three years later, I often faced the ridicule of a few select classmates, who called me fat names and such, despite the fact that I hadn't put on any real weight (in truth, at this time, I only weighed about 130 pounds, and that was normal for me). And I owe this normal weight to a quick metabolism (thank you, Dad).By the time I was 14, my doctor had diagnosed me with high blood pressure, most likely brought on from lack of exercise and eating too much fast-food (again, at this time I'm not at all overweight nor am I obese; I am still average size). So I start lifting weights and doing other fitness activities in an attempt to stay in shape, and I've been doing that ever since. I still eat fast-food about once or twice a week, but due to the fact that I never seem to have enough time to exercise anymore, I've had to cut a meal out of my diet. (Good-bye, lunch.)Evidently, America is not following the same pattern (or anything close to it), and filmmaker Morgan Spurlock made "Super Size Me" in 2004, in which he eats nothing but McDonald's food for 30 days straight in an attempt to get to the bottom of America's obesity epidemic. Even more frighteningly, obesity now sits close to the top of medicine's list of most preventable causes of death in America, almost ready to knock down smoking to the #2 spot.McDonald's track record of poor-quality foods has been well documented, and a lot of what we see in "Super Size Me" may not be new to most of us, as we are continually bombarded in the media on a daily basis by the number of heart attacks, diabetes, and other illnesses related to the mass consumption of their food (or any fast-food for matter).It's funny and saddening to see Spurlock get sick as a dog while consuming McDonald's food for the duration of this experiment, as he also makes a number of interesting points about the role the corporations play in America's food consumption. He's quick to note that most people are smart enough to know how to eat right, but also acknowledges that the restaurants themselves have an obligation to point out the nutritional value of their products. Why do you think so many fast-food restaurants now have nutrition charts (but does anybody actually bother to read them)? And McDonald's healthy choice menus are also exposed as being something of a sham, since according to Spurlock, their salads contain just as much fat and calories as a Big Mac. (This film also reaffirms my beliefs of just how unsafe their food truly is.)While "Super Size Me" may not be as bombastic or as confrontational as anything that Michael Moore has done in recent years, Spurlock's film is not really an indictment of McDonald's or any fast-food network, but is really more of a blazing and dense critique of American tastes (no pun intended) in food.Spurlock also explores the effect of obesity in children, as he points out how the companies often threaten the schools with withdrawal of funding if their products are not sold in the cafeterias. Ironically, the kids in the alternative education schools get the better end of the stick, as they many times get the real healthy foods such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and freshly cooked meals, not frozen stuff that comes in a box and can be opened with a box cutter. And he also discusses how Illinois has required physical fitness classes for grades K-12.As Spurlock hits the road across the country, he also shows us just how BIG America is becoming, and that the megalomaniacs at McDonald's are everywhere, with 83 locations on the island of Manhattan alone. Whoa. He also takes time out to discuss the case of the two girls who tried unsuccessfully to bring up a lawsuit against McDonald's for their weight problems, and parallels this story against his experiment.Morgan Spurlock has made a damning movie about American tastes, but you know how stubborn we Americans are, we don't like being told that there's something wrong with our country or with the people living in it. He made a movie that will hopefully open our eyes to the problem of our health in this country.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terrifying, and whether exaggerated or not, powerful viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS In the world today, weight as an issue is a major talking point. Like smoking, drinking and countless other problems, Obesity is everywhere. In this often scary documentary, Morgan Spurlock presents a one sided argument against fast food which, whether accurate or not, should do enough to scare a lot of people to do something about their diets.After two American girls announced they were suing McDonalds for their weighty size, Morgan Spurlock decided to see what would happen if he ate nothing but McDonalds for a month. Throwing up on the first day, things go from bad to worse as Spurlock's health reaches breaking point.As far as documentaries go, there are few which will worry the normal person as this one. Not as well made as Michael Moore's "Bowling For Columbine", Spurlock's extreme view of McDonalds is an eye opener which gives terrifying insight into an issue which we know is bad, but most of us never knew was THIS bad.Spurlock is a brilliant presenter and presents the documentary with ease. Putting across the full details of a subject which few of us knew everything about, he never patronises as much as demonstrates how his health collapses around him and his mood plummets.If anything, whilst Spurlock does a decent job of reciting his tale and putting forward the statistics about McDonalds, he does present a very one sided view. It's difficult to think of any information he could really show to demonstrate the other side of the argument, but there must be one."Super Size Me" is not a particularly good documentary. One sided and opinionated, it terrifies the audience into fearing for their health. Rather than criticising Spurlock for this though, the man deserves a medal. Whether his medium is flawed or not, Spurlock is trying to remind us of the problems the world has with obesity and how we must try to save ourselves. For that, the man deserves full praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy sacrifice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always felt that documentaries are best done when they think small; Hoop Dreams follows two individuals, Fog of War is one person's life, and Supersize Me is one man's search for truth. The problem with, by contrast, Michael Moore is that he tries to encompass entire geopolitical issues into a feature length film, and by necessity must abridge and simplify. By focusing instead on one person's experience with one restaurant for one month, Morgan Spurlock allows his film room to grow in unexpected directions. Take as an example the man he encounters who has eaten at least two Big Macs a day since his teens and boasts a cholesterol level in the low 100's (hint: avoid the fries). If Moore had presented a normal American who had benefited from Bush's policies, and there are many, perhaps his film would have benefited. Some have accused Spurlock of being shamelessly self-promoting exhibitionist like Moore, and to an extent this is true, but the difference lies in the approach; Supersize Me takes as removed a position to the fast food industry as could be expected, while Fahrenheit 911 makes no secret of its predisposed enmity to its subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super Size Me is another in a streak of original and important documentaries to come out in the last few years. From Bowling for Columbine to Control Room, documentaries have become a fresh alternative to the stale Hollywood flicks of late. Super Size Me follows director Morgan Spurlock, a funny and bright guy who has a vegan girlfriend, as he embarks on a thirty day McDonald's binge to see what it does to his body and his mind. Along the way, he opens our eyes to the fact that we have become the fattest country on Earth, exposing horrible school lunches, incredibly large portions, and how advertisers buy out the most TV time for their unhealthy goods. Spurlock, meanwhile, suffers extreme liver damage from his Mac Attack, gains weight, and even suffers a bout of depression. This movie definitely changed the way i look at the food i shovel into my body, and hopefully will have a lasting effects on others.---8/10 P.S.- If you have the DVD, their is a disgusting but fascinating feature called the Smoking Fry, in which Spurlock buts a variety of burgers and fries from Mickey D's and a neighborhood restaurant and watches them decompose over 10 weeks. The nastiest part: the McDonald'd fries do not mold at all. Yech.</fullReview>

No, not really.Being still of a somewhat young age, I'll do my best to spell out everything correctly and make it as smooth as possible to read. =) I greatly recommend this movie to all audiences; thirteen up to elderly for the coarse language. Though, despite the rough and gruesome parts, I took a great liking to this movie. I really enjoyed how Morgan went in-depth, without personally forcing a particular grudge onto McDonalds, about how obesity is affecting our country, as well as its health-related problems. It's never too late to look down and consider a healthy diet, and I liked how Morgan implied that into his movie. As I watched this in school, I let myself linger onto the Nutritionalist and other assorted doctors Morgan had hired. They brought up some pretty wicked facts about fast food that truly made me look over them. I never was a fast food freak, and never plan to be.Calories? I know what calories are. =D The energy of food that you consume into your body, which - if you don't burn - turns into fat, which gives you those rolls over time. ;xHahaha. Now to get back to the movie review. This is an amazing American movie. I was amazed on how well-thought through it was made to be, and how it was presented. I would show this to all audiences, especially the younger ones, so they can get a great idea of what all that fat food does to you. Maybe it would even force them to make a diet filled with yummy vegetables (I highly doubt it).Giving it a 10/10. Excellent movie. Recommending, as I mentioned plenty of times. Heh. =) I'm an easy grader.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Healthy Film about an Unhealthy Diet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Super Size Me is a fascinating film written and directed by Morgan Spurlock. His goal is to experiment on himself by eating nothing but McDonalds food for 3 meals a day for 30 days. He wants to show what eating fast food can do to your body and mind. Our nation has basically become a society of over-eaters. He wants to prove a point by doing this experiment.Morgan starts out visiting doctors to give himself a base to work off of. All his blood work is normal and he is in great shape and health. He consults doctors, nutritionists, etc to monitor his weight and cholesterol as he progresses along. He loves the food and appears to really be enjoying the experiment for the first few days. Morgan is very relaxed in front of the camera and is quite funny. This made the experiment easy on the audience as well as we have to watch him basically destroy his good health. He has the support of his annoying vegan girlfriend and knowing what she is thinking as she watches him eat everything she stands against is a treat.The film isn't just about his experiment. Morgan travels around the country making points and doing interviews with nutritionists, people, and school officials. He pokes fun at President Bush's baby "No Child Left Behind Act". The bill is designed to raise test scores, but it also takes money from other important classes such as arts and physical education. So now we'll have a bunch of fat readers opposed to a balanced school day with gym class to get students moving and exercising.I believe Mr. Spurlock gets his point across well. His experiment is an exaggeration but he isn't far off from many people's lifestyles. We live in a society of convenience and many of us don't eat well and let's face it, are fat. To many, this is just showing what we already should know, but to others, this film may open up some minds and change diets. (***1/2)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and if you didn't know that already then you aren't too intelligent. This is a documentary by Morgan Spurlock who basically does an experiment to see what eating McDonald's three times a day for 30 days can do to the body. He also brings up some law suits that fat people have filed against fast food companies saying their health problems and obesity are the fault of places like McDonald's. My opinion is those law suits are ridiculous because there is such a thing as will power and fatty foods can't be good for you and no one is making you eat hamburgers over apples.So, Spurlock goes to get his blood work done and a physical before beginning the experiment. Along the way, we are shown him eating a lot with splices of funny interviews thrown in. Although, it does appear he is overeating because he throws up some. He should have just been eating a big mac and fries, but sometimes it looks like he orders several sandwiches for one meal. We also meat a guy who is at a normal weight, but eats 3 Big Macs every day. Unbelievable!Over the 30 days, Spurlock gains weight and his liver tests and cholesterol increase. He feels fatigued and complains of chest pains. His doctors suggest he quit the diet, but he does finish the 30 days. He gained about 20 pounds in 30 days, but it took over a year for him to lose it.FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it. I found it entertaining and I wanted to know how many pounds someone would gain from eating fast food every day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most important point to remember is that I used to occasionally go into McDo's, BK, KFC, whatever, and then I saw this film. After seeing it, I will *never* go into any fast-food chain in the world, even if my life depended on eating something.It was the scenes with the McNuggets, showing just how they are made, that convinced me that this is bad food to eat. I don't want to eat something that's been made from "parts" of chickens pressed together like that, and I have no doubt that the other food is just as bad. On the UK DVD, there is an extra, "Smoking Fry", where they left several McDo sandwiches, a packet of McDo fries, and a hand-made burger and fries from a local restaurant (one that uses real meat and real potatoes), in glass jars for several weeks. The local fries gave up almost at once, and the burgers deteriorated over a longer period, but McDo's fries were essentially unchanged after ten weeks. No mould, no slime, nothing. I don't want to eat something that showed no sign of decay after ten weeks, and which, if they hadn't accidentally been thrown out by an intern, probably would still be there, looking just the same...Another thing I found deeply disturbing was the segment on American school lunches. Morgan Spurlock visited a number of schools, and had a conversation with the Food Services Director at a school cafeteria in Naperville Illinois, and she was obviously *totally* oblivious to what the kids were doing, and totally unconcerned when Morgan Spurlock pointed out that the kids were buying junk food (crisps, fries, chocolates, sugared lemonade drinks). She even said that most of them bring a bag lunch, but it was clear as the camera wandered around the room that what these kids were buying was what they were eating - no bag lunches for these kids... He then visited a school for disturbed teenagers in Wisconsin, where the food was all prepared fresh in the school. Good old-fashioned food, and it looked infinitely more appealing than the junk in the Naperville school.I was riveted to the screen from the word go. Morgan Spurlock is a very good presenter, and the mix of footage was excellently chosen. The repeated theme of Morgan ordering yet another McMeal was broken up excellently by interviews by all sorts - his doctors, the former Surgeon General, the most honest lawyer you'll ever see ("you mean besides the money?"), a couple who had collected *every* bit of McDo's merchandise ever produced (UK DVD extra), and so on.This film was a real eye-opener, and I'll not forget it...</fullReview>

There are plenty of people that understand that McDonalds is not "health food" and act accordingly... People in the United States are going to have to start taking some responsibility for their actions...If someone eats himself into obesity it is their fault... Nobody shoves Big Macs into your mouth but you... It is just as easy to eat a salad and get some exercise.. Let's face it, people eat at McDonalds because it tastes good..

Some comic effect give the movie a light air, even if the message it conveys is both important and interesting. It should be noted that, not surprisingly and not bad in any way (just keep it in mind), that the movie is biased somewhat. In addition it should be noted that Morgan does not only take a McDonalds-diet, he is testing a way of life, including exercise limits for instance. This is mentioned in the movie, but the overall focus is strongly on the diet part.It did felt a little odd watching the movie state, what I really knew, that fast food and soda is not very good for you, all the while drinking soda and eating candy. Nor will I change my lifestyle or eating habits either. But it was an entertaining way to be reminded that maybe one should think it over at least.I do wonder though, how do you manage 2 liters of soda to one meal???

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock does a great job producing and appearing in this film -it really is good - disturbing but very funny also. I watched it twice through and made my wife watch it(she doesn't normally like this kind of film but even she liked it). A merciless inward look at one aspect of American society - although we in Europe should not be too smug as the phenomenon is spreading (literally). It is an inspired idea and the final product is better and more believable than the other two docu-films of this genre that I have seen (both by Micheal Moore - Fahrenheit 911 and Bowling for Columbine). Spurlock is a more appealing character than Moore as he seems less politicised. He starts off by actually liking McD's and states that he doesn't agree with the law suits against them by people that got fat.There are some great characters. The huge French woman who seemed to be criticising the size of the drinks in the US. Even the doctors made me laugh. The guy who had eaten nearly 20,00 Big Macs was my personal favourite - especially when he said that someone had bet him $5 to eat a Whopper - he ate the Whopper and bought three Big Macs with the 5 bucks! His Beatles haircut and glasses were superb. Proof that fact is stranger (and funnier) than fiction. He wasn't really fat though which is a bit suspicious ! If I had a criticism, it would be that the operational scenes were a bit long, disgusting and gratuitous, but the film does set out to shock as well as to amuse and entertain and if you rent it you can always fast forward this bit.Really good stuff - I haven't been to a Mac Shack since seeing this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what people assume it to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To most individuals who have not taken the time to actually sit down and watch the film "Super Size Me," Morgan Spurlock's chronicle of his own self-destructive diet is simply the film about how McDonald's is responsible for American obesity. This is anything but true. Rather than blame McDonald's, Spurlock simply uses McDonald's, as the largest fast food chain the world, as a very visible example to make a larger (no pun intended) point about the American diet in general.Though this film hardly portrays McDonald's in a positive light, it also criticizes those who exercise no personal responsibility in the management of their own diets, as well as the overall attitude towards exercise and healthy diet within the United States. He depicts individuals exercising no discretion in their food intake, as well as the disregard shown to school lunch and physical education programs throughout the country. Meanwhile, Spurlock paints a picture of the role that corporate food producers play in all sectors of the food market in America. Most notably, Spurlock examines the lobbying power that junk food companies exercise in Washington as opposed to the power of their healthier counterparts, and portrays the iconic status that fast food restaurants have reached in the minds of American consumers.In the end, Spurlock raises many crucial questions about the connection between the general lack of concern about health that runs rampant in American culture. And, as a unmistakable corporate icon, the Golden Arches simply serve as a perfect vehicle to illustrate this point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very informative film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***No real spoilers ahead, as it is a documentary!***This was a great movie looking at the effects of fast food on a persons health.I know where it is coming from because I used to weigh 230 pounds (I am a barely 5'8" male) and lost 100 of them by cutting out bad fast food, as well as pasta, rice and other assorted heavy foods.After viewing this, my wife did not want to eat McDonalds again. and was amazed my the content of the McNuggets (a staple food while she was pregnant, in addition to the fries) and how they are made. One thing to do when you rent this is go to the bonus features and play the "smoking fry" feature, where various McDonalds items are put in glass jars and left for 10 weeks. The fries progress will amaze you!Overall, if you can handle a bit of grossness (completely necessary to get the point across)and medical footage, this is a great fun movie to see.I want to get the DVD after seeing it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I thought that this movie was absolutely disgusting, it was an accurate and powerful portrayal of what is happening as a result of people's obsessions and the fast food industry. For some reason, (although I cannot understand it), people enjoy greasy simulated meat and fake potatoes that are not suitable to be consumed by dogs, let alone humans. It was a bit, rather, very drastic to eat NOTHING but McDonald's for a month, but this experiment showed what people are doing to themselves by eating fast food more often than what is considered safe by REAL nutrition experts. This movie was far from the greatest movie I have ever seen, but it is definitely one of the most powerful movies of those from recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best documentary I have seen recently! It's very hard to watch though so buyer beware. If only Michael Moore was a quarter as talented then his movies might actually start to influence people. This one had far less propaganda than the garbage Mr. Moore spews out and was much more effective. It really made me stop and think about what I was destroying my organs with each time I get lazy and hit up the nearest fast food joint in town for a quick, easy, and relatively cheap meal. I became very nervous at the end because I thought the main character was either going to die or do irreversible damage to himself in only a month nonetheless. It pained me to see him get so fat and become so unhealthy that it made me realize I have to start making better decisions about my diet in the future starting now. I mean fast food does taste good and it's convenient but it honestly doesn't seem worth it in the end. It's going to be sad when my generation is all grown up, I have a feeling that we're going to turn out messed up because of this horrible society we live in.Final Meal:Movies: Rarely are documentaries worth seeing in the theaters.DVD Purchase: No, only because its important facts are going to be lodged in my brain for awhile!Rental: You'll learn something!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trans-fat is bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the reviews posted here. Most are well written, but there is one thing that is looked over. That is that the most kind of fat you receive when eating at Mac Donalds is TRANS-FAT. Not saturated fat! Trans fat is the really dangerous fat. Also the soft-drinks are real big health killers. Why is that so obvious and still, why we let ourselves be fooled by the cooperate powers? M???h... We are sheep!! We don't even dare to question that there are scientist who accept a check of millions of dollars to twist the outcome of some serious research.So to me, the biggest healthkiller of all are the consumers who never seem to question things for themselves. They really need to read it on the frontpage of the newspaper (and TV) before they are willing to accept something. Even then... And who is going to write about it. Even if I was one journalist of the hundred of thousands, who wanted to write about this and this kinda scam in all honesty, I would probably be fired instantly. "You are a journalist, not a scientist", would the editor say.. "And if the scientist claims this, and you say that, we have a problem mister..." Also, even as a newspaper or else you have to be careful at what you say, or you can be in trouble. You can be sewed if you keep writing about things publicly when a judge decides that you articles are unfounded while bad for the industry. For instance, some journalists are forbidden to write about microwaves. Here some details on trans-fat http://www.mercola.com/2003/jul/19/trans_fat.htm#Pieter</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only more movies actually had a point to them, like this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to know where to begin to describe this movie. I had seen the advertisements in the paper, and thought that it may be worth renting but not paying full price at the theatre. After all, everywhere you look, someone is trying to cash in on some reality show on television, and now it had seemed to have made its way to the big screen, with a no-name director/actor. Grab a camera, film some useless behavior, and sell it to the media. That is what this movie is all about...NOT!!!! I laughed, I processed a lot of info in that 100 minutes. I had a burning in my throat trying to digest his experiment on the effects of leaving food out for a few months to ripen...yuk. I was shocked to say the least, to learn that the size of a supersized-soda was a half of a gallon. I suppose that if the supersized meals on the screen were faked..I would have heard about it by now. I myself, have not set foot inside a McDonalds since around 1984, and was ignorant on what they now serve. When the first day of his goal of 30 had begun, the director/actor/writer, Morgan Spurlock, a New Yorker, was healthy, fit, and HOT! By the 21st day...he still looked hot..like he was about to have a coronary or stroke. No longer chipper and full of sarcastic humour, he now resembled himself 5 or 10 years down the road, gasping for breathe as he climbed the stairs to his apartment. After his experiment, Spurlock admitted that it did take him 8 months to get back to his former self and no doubt his girlfriend,Alex, played a big part in it. All good movies must have a heroine, and this one is no different. Spurlock may possess the imagination to have written this film, but his girlfriend, no doubt is blessed with the brains behind the man. She hadn't been half as surprised as the doctors were over Spurlock's failing health at just 21 days. She had cringed at the entire idea of his journey into careless glutonism and carnivores..after all, she is a vegan chef. How ironic that she can for see the future when the majority of the population of the U.S. cannot. The only irritating part of this movie is that I can't get the stupid theme song out of my head, and I find myself singing it throughout the day. Supersize, supersize,supersize me...don't waste your money on renting it..buy it and learn something. I can't wait for his next project. He is talented, sarcastic, able to grab your attention, and oh yeah...he is HOT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's style of documentary Reloaded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Super Size Me is not a movie actually. It's a documentary, and they rarely belong to big screen. But still, it is created and compiled smartly, so if audience just forgets about the "magic of cinema" and aims to understand the point, try to read between the lines, it will be a lot more successful.Movie takes a healthy man and makes him eat McDonalds for a month. Now this disturbed me first of all. OK, McDonalds is the leader of fast food, it was the one that was sued, it is the one that everybody knows about... But USA has quite a few fast food chains, is it ethical to blame only one restaurant? After all, the movie only brings some proof to what we already know. Come on. No one needs a nutrition table to understand that all these fast food stuff is dangerous. People are not stupid! OK, some are, but not the majority! Even people who post stupid things to IMDb forums (those we reply like machine gun but they never show up, they mostly swear anyone who likes that movie and then run away)On the other hand, I am a student in USA for a few months and I have no place to eat some healthy food. Fast food is everywhere! Somebody had to bring this up, and this is serious.But of course he is taking aim at one of the greatest, most beloved companies in the world, so the war was already lost. As I said, the Moore style was deep into it: real life, real names, real companies, there is a bad guy (Ronald McDonald), and in the end we do dislike it. Any fast food lover should watch the movie at least once for education, not entertainment. But here is a small real story I heard from a friend:"After watching the movie I was leaving cinema. Two black teenagers were behind me and as we left saloon one said "I'm hungry", and the other replied "There is a KFC over there" and they did go to KFC.."A-, for being realistic, but not objective.

Went to a McDonalds and ordered the double quarter pounder with cheese and the infamous super-size fries and 64 ounce soda. It all stayed down, despite the fact that he tossed it up with a case of the mcgurgles and mcgas. I only weigh 140 pounds at 5'9'', which is probably why i could take it. It was pretty sick food, costed a grand total of a little over 6 dollars for that wonderful wholesome meal. Its rare that i go out to fast food and even moreso that i go to a mcdonalds, having read the books Fast Food Nation and The Jungle a ways back. Oh yeah, and the cute girl who took my order at the drivethru didn't ask me to supersize it, but i still said it anyway. I wonder why the employees on the drive thru's are usually cute, and the ones working elsewhere are enough to make roseanne vomit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spurlock's stark warning that, yes, food can be as dangerous as tobacco.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, certainly is based on the common-sense assumption that fast food is bad for you, and yet is deeply polarizing. For this reason, but not only this reason, I rated Morgan Spurlock's "Super Size Me" a 10. Spurlock's style, as captured throughout, is not unlike that of alleged Guerilla Journalist Michael Moore, but with a kind of youthful penchant for the extreme in his approach to subject matter. Spurlock's undertaking of a "month long McDonald's binge" (as so characterized by his cardiologist)proves as a dangerous physical experiment, and thus proves strongly and thoroughly his point with visual and statistical evidence. (Something that Moore often does with less care) Most Interesting was Spurlock's apparent addiction to and dependency on the fat and calorie rich-food. This demonstrated clear similarities between unhealthy food and tobacco. (Thus adding weight, no pun intended, to the arguments of the obese girls whose parents sued McDonald's.) Moreover, his asides are equally as colorful as the "Farenheit 9/11" director.Notably, Spurlock attacked the Corporate "Big Food" lobby of which Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry is directly involved through his marriage to Teresa Heinz. Although Spurlock didn't explore this, the film reminded me of Kerry's remarkable similarity to Bush, and the necessity for supporting Ralph Nader.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael who? **** out of 4 and one of the best films of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a big fan of Mr. Mockumentary Michael Moore, but being a fat guy and the desire to lose weight (like most of America) I entered the theater with my large soda and popcorn on high anticipation at a subject that even Mr. Moore has not enlightened on (And looking at his waist size, it's easy to see why.Writer/director Morgan Spurlock is in perfect health. His girlfriend is a vegetarian so it's obvious he eats well. Noting the increased problem of obesity in this country he decided to prove the potential dangers of fast food. Until the 1970's the use of tobacco was finally taken with great assault. (I grew up as a Jehovah's Witness and in 1974 the Watchtower changed its mind on cigarette smoking and would ex-communicate a member if they were found doing so) Cigarettes and the likes have been around for a hundred years, but not taken seriously to the obvious risks it has on the human body.Spurlock (to the dislike of his girlfriend and mom) decides to eat nothing but McDonald's food for 30 days to prove the point. Before ordering at the drive through, he gets a complete physical from his doctor (Daryl Issacs) who is happy to say that his health is in tip top shape. On the first bite of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder Morgan finds that he likes it. But halfway through he becomes ill and hasn't even started on the french fries. By the time he's finished he has become so sick that he leans his head out the door window and throws up. (Now one might think its fake puke, but we've all seen what happens to a person when they smoke a cigarette for the first time).Two weeks into the binge, he now notices something that has never happened before.The level of energy is down and he now gets painful headaches that are "cured" after a meal at McDonalds. Coincidence? I don't think so.By the time Morgan is done polluting his body, he's gained 25 pounds, his cholesterol is high enough to choke a horse, and even his girlfriend complains that the joys of sex they have always enjoyed has died like Fido in the road.On the previews of Super Size Me it appears that the whole movie is about poor old McDonalds but to a nice surprise, it isn't. Morgan really gives us an eye opener when he visits the schools around the country and the cafeterias look more like an all you can eat buffet at Burger King. The "excuse" is since the schools are always broke the multi million dollar food and beverage companies sell the food cheap (although its obvious they are still making a huge profit) but with the agreement that vending machines can also be available to the students,Moreover, Super Size Me also shows that we as a society have become extremely lazy. There are patches available to loose weight so we don't have to exercise. And people who can walk with no problem drive around in electric carts to do their shopping.I am not objecting to the fact that a lot of people have a weight problem. Look who's talking. I object to the fact that I/we have the opportunity to live a healthy life and choose not to. Now dammit, Where is my Big Mac? (Sarcasm deliberately added)Writers note: The effects that Morgan has are real. When I became addicted to fast food the energy level dropped and was accompanied by heavy breathing, lack of sleep, and painful headaches. I finally got serious and after just one week of a balanced diet the above things have ceased. Coincidence? I don't think so.</fullReview>

I could have a large meal at McDonald's for less. I did enjoy the film, and as a smoker agreed with the guy who asked when will people start asking overweight people why they don't do something, rather than telling every smoker in sight why they should quit. It's amusing that Detroit, Men's Health magazine's so-called fattest city in America, had people in the audience clapping at the end when we got named #2 by Spurlock's sources. The other thing ironic about the audience, was of the 30-40 people there, none of us seemed overweight, or at least anybody Spurlock would've shown on camera.

		<shortDescription>Morgan Spurlock charts a fast-food course for his own demise...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Healthy documentarian in New York City, spurred on by a lawsuit against the fast-food chain McDonald's by two overweight teen girls, decides to go on a junk food eating binge--having breakfast, lunch and dinner at Mickey D's for 30 straight days--to prove not only how unhealthy the food is, but unhealthy our collective eating habits are. Morgan Spurlock targets not only McDonald's in his self-assigned task, but also the food suppliers for America's elementary and high schools, most of whom are drowning today's youth in sugar and high cholesterol. Two-thirds of the way through his experiment, Spurlock's own cholesterol has skyrocketed, his weight is up substantially, and his liver is on the brink of malfunctioning. "Super Size Me" is certainly an informative and thought-provoking documentary, paced in a breezy, lightly amusing style, yet one begins to wonder about Spurlock's main impetus and agenda behind this potentially life-damaging high-fat diet; frequently using TV commercials (without their soundtracks) and animation to underline his points, he intentionally (and crassly) becomes a purveyor of shock value (which is where the footage from a gastric bypass comes in). Spurlock himself is an easy-going presence, and he's the perfect Everyman to host this film, but what are his motives? Is really he really concerned about the health habits of our population? The many faceless shots of men and women wandering around town with big bottoms and flabby tummies are not shown to be benefiting from any of Spurlock's overall denunciations (they're just visual targets) and the segues to the medical personnel don't do much to spike the proceedings (the doctors seem as worried about Spurlock as Spurlock is about the rest of us). In the end, the film is a skin-deep examination of a worrisome issue. McDonald's Restaurants come off not as cause or effect, but as a middlemen: a high-fat supplier we welcome into our lives. Personally, I prefer Del Taco. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

That's right; and entire MONTH of nothing but McDonald's. Three square meals a day, all bought from a McDonald's fast food restaurant establishment. As Morgan indulges in what he describes as "every eight-year-old's dream", he researches the causes of obesity all over the country. He surveys "snack-ridden" school lunches, interviews health and nutrition experts, speaks with fast-food goers on the street, and much more while his health steadily declines. After watching this incredible film, you'll have laughed, perhaps gagged, and learned just how damaging frequent fast food eating can be to your health (a quick note: after watching this, I now only eat fast food about once a month).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not a surprise that fast food is high in calories. The surprise is the LOW QUALITY of the food. A McDonald's strawberry shake contains some 40 different chemicals. A McDonald's hamburger is made from the meat of over ONE THOUSAND COWS! Many of the ingredients in the food are artificial and people continue to patronize McDonald's. Unfortunately, Americans like cheap food and they don't want to pay the price for a quality lean hamburger or a shake made with real strawberries. The FDA really should outlaw some of the products in the McDonald's menu. However, the FDA is not outlawing diet soda although aspertame is a known carcinogen which can cause sugar cravings, headaches, and health problems. Morgan points out how McDonald's lures children and parents to the restaurant with free toys and giveaways. I feel truly lucky that when I was a child my Mom never let us eat much at McDonald's because she thought it was too expensive! We only ate out for special occasions or if we were on a road trip. This was the 1980's and at least the burgers were made from 1 cow's meat back then!People who say this movie is stupid didn't pay attention to the message. IF YOU CONTINUALLY EAT FAST FOOD, YOU MIGHT PAY LATER WITH OBESITY AND HEALTH PROBLEMS. Finally, be sure to watch the bonus section with the author of "Fast Food Nation".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2002, director Morgan Spurlock subjected himself to a diet based only in McDonald's fast food three times a day for thirty days and without working out. His objective was to prove why most of the Americans are so fat, with many cases of obesity. He began the shootings submitting himself to a complete check-up with three doctors, and along the weeks, he compared his weight and results of exams, coming through a scary conclusion.Only today I have watched this famous documentary, and I am really impressed with the courage and determination of Morgan Spurlock, being subjected to such experiment to prove how noxious fast foods are. This documentary is so important that McDonald's changed their menu worldwide, including some juices and salads. I found also amazing the sizes available in USA, since in Brazil, for example, the largest size of coke corresponds to the medium one showed in the film. The same happens with French fries. This documentary should be mandatory in schools. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Super Size Me, A Dieta do Palhao" ("Super Size Me, The Diet of the Clown")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What does it matter if people don't eat well in the United States? You have to die of something...might as well as be happy.Morgan Spurlock does not care about the obesity problem in America, and he doesn't care about any overweight person. He only cared about making a movie and performing a stupid, dangerous stunt to sell that movie.Any jackass will become sick if they eat the same anything every day, three times a day, for one month. That's not an experiment, that's something out of Fear Factor, so please, Mr. Spurlock, don't try to scare the audience with your bogus stunt.The reason why there is obesity in America is because we live sedentary lives. Most people used to be on their feet for 18 hours a day in a field, tending to crops. Ever read Laura Ingalls Wilder's "Farmer Boy?" Those people ate like pigs and didn't gain weight because they worked themselves to exhaustion everyday.People eat fast food because our economy has become so inflated that women no longer stay at home and cook meals every day. Women must work, either to support a single parent household, or to divide the cost of living with their husband.Oh, and that processed food? It sure seems to help all of those impoverished and malnourished people in the poverty-stricken nations the U.S. aids.So, Mr. Spurlock, please don't sit on your high horse and judge people for what they eat. Why not use your ninety minutes of film to call attention to those who can't eat and must live on the street with no home or support? Now, that's a much worthier cause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A morons adventure into the obvious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supersize Me is a documentary about the effects of highly fattening fast food three times a day over a period of a month. Guess what? It makes you fat. Unfortunately, Morgan Spurlock was not aware of this, as he had to test the effects of such an experiment and discover for himself what truly happened. Guess what? He gets fat.The underlies of his experiment say that he must eat three meals a day, all of it McDonald's, he can only eat at McDonald's and nothing else (even water), and he must have all items on the menu at least once. All of these ideas and methods are preposterous. At one point, Spurlock says he's eating an average of 5,000 - 6,000 calories a day. Eating that many calories of anything, even kale and spinach, isn't good for you without exercise. A later study suggested that as much as 85% of his sugar intake came from milkshakes and soda, both of which aren't something people consume multiple times a day. When's the last time you've met someone who ate three milkshakes a day? This, on top of an intentional lack of exercise, will no doubt result in becoming fat.The documentary is admittedly well made, especially with the shoe-string budget it has, and I do admire the research done into the non-Morgan elements, such as an investigation involving school cafeteria food and an obese child who believes eating Subway everyday will make her leaner because Jared told her so. These elements should've been the focus of the film, not Morgan being an idiot and potentially killing himself. On top of that, Morgan Spurlock is an obnoxious self-righteous douchebag, as more evident in his later work, and the film would be much better with a less irritating narrator presenting the story. The overall lesson is: don't be stupid, or else you might gain a bunch of weight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sends the Wrong Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supersize Me is essentially a movie about a man who eats way too much every day for a month and gets fat. I would like to point out that eating 3k+ calories of ANYTHING every meal will make you fat. Morgan Spurlock offers no control group and his arbitrary method of accepting the offer to "Supersize" whenever asked has no clear purpose other than to prove McDonalds doesn't really ask that often. I would suggest to anyone who has watched this to also watch "Fathead." It offers insight into Spurlock's methodology for the film as well as poking some major flaws in his so called logic. To summarize, this movie does a great job of creating hate towards one of many players in the fast food industry, but it fails to properly educate and provide any useful facts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly how it is and always has been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember how angry I was at McDonald's at their daily attempt to make our country unhealthy. I knew from the very start that what they call food wasn't really healthy at all. Clearly Mr. Spurlock shows the viewers that poor nutrition leads to inevitable heart problems and general decaying of our bodies. Sure it's also personal responsibility, but at some point we have to blame the fast food outlets that open them up every few blocks for pure profit. This film really brought out the truth about what crap they sell. Clearly during the filming and subsequent publicity, McDonald's started selling more healthy choices like salads; but I think it was too little and too late. Being cheap and readily available doesn't make something good for Americans. Lets' face it America; cigarettes are sold everywhere, millions of people smoke them (almost everyone in Europe smokes them), but That doesn't mean that cigarettes are healthy. For crying out loud, in 1st grade (50 years ago) our elementary school brought in two lungs from cadavers. One was healthy and the other was black and smaller. So just because cigarettes and fast food are sold everywhere, it doesn't mean that it's healthy. We need more education in the schools, we need to teach children how to grow foods in gardens and participate in the same in our neighborhoods. Also, check out this article as well: www.eatdrinkpolitics.com And type in McDonalds in the search box. Not only does McDonald's sell garbage food, but they don't support their own charity with their own clown's name on it. They make the public continue to support it. I know you thought that every time you order a big mac that McDonald's was giving money to support families with children dying of cancer, but they're not. What a great marketing tool. Sure McDonald's gives the Ronald McDonald House the land and building as a gift, but they should continue to financially support them forever. And by the way, I would assume that most of the McDonald's that have been in business over 30 years now owned the adult children of the original owners. That means that these adult children have inherited the businesses; no real estate or equipment debt. Everything's all paid for and highly profitable. I know of many of these adult children here in the Denver area that have in fact inherited "multiple" locations and are simply filthy rich from selling garbage food to families and hurting our country's health. And the $963 million dollars in advertising they spend on every year is sickening. McDonald's: take responsibility for your own charity with your name on it. Stop asking the public to do your job. You and your franchisees should be ashamed of yourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent documentary showing the negative health effects of fast-food</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that I knew I had to watch at some point.It showcases Morgan Spurlock, the same man who directed this movie, eating food from McDonald's and McDonald's only for 30 days. The consequences include extreme cravings for fast food, an inactive sex life, an increased risk of a heart attack, depression, increased blood pressure, getting sick frequently, and extreme and frequent lethargy, thus leading to an early death. The negative effects of eating fast- food are not only health-related, they also increase negative body image, and I am a male becoming more conscious about my appearance. Other effects are financial, social and psychological. It also showcases that McDonald's is a multi-billion dollar corporation with restaurants in a multitude of countries around the world, including my home country, Australia. Another fact is junk-food companies make far, far more money than health food companies. It is like the media makes a lot more money by negative attention than positive attention. I will admit there was a surgery scene which I often find really difficult watch, because they are really disgusting sights, but I did not have very much trouble watching that scene. Why? The Blue Danube by Strauss made it much easier to watch, since that song is used a lot for comedic purposes. Now that I think of it that way, I find surgery scenes easier to watch than seeing cockroaches, since they look absolutely revolting by their anatomy, and when I see them move, it grosses me out even more, to the point that at best, I lose my appetite for hours and at worst, it makes me want to vomit violently.If you want to watch an entertaining and amusing documentary about fast-food and its negative effects, then this is the movie.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting, illuminating documentary on the fast-food industry.Observing the obesity epidemic in the USA, a documentary film-maker, Morgan Spurlock, eats only MacDonalds meals, three times a day, for 30 days. His aim is to document the changes to his body. He enlists a host of medical experts to keep track of what is happening to himself. Between this he weaves a story of the fast-food industry, and MacDonalds in particular, the food we eat and human behaviour with regard to food.Quite eye-opening and the results are quite profound. If you do eat regularly at MacDonalds, this might change your mind...Also good in that it doesn't pull any punches or try to politically correctly tiptoe around issues. Fat people are called just that and shown up for their own behaviour.On the negative side it is a touch manipulative and, at times, unobjective. A minor compliant though, especially when you compare this with the bullsh*t Michael Moore parades as "documentaries". Moore's films have zero objectivity, contain almost as little facts and are entirely based on manipulation and his own opinions.The other slightly jarring thing is the thought that MacDonalds is entirely to blame for people being fat, and are hence suable for it. Surely fat people only have themselves to blame? Oh wait, it's the 21st century and you're now never responsible for your own actions...</fullReview>

As a documentary, this is simple stuff indeed: a guy eats only McDonald's food for an entire month, and suffers the health consequences of his challenge, but it's never dull, never slow, never boring. Instead, the director and star Morgan Spurlock hits you with a barrage of facts, figures, footage, and interviews, leaving you with a story that's disturbing and blackly funny.The story explores America's exploding obesity epidemic, as well as looking at what makes McDonald's food so darned tasty. There's an emphasis on medical facts and figures, which makes this always grounded rather than merely opinionated, and the journey-style narrative lends itself easily to a film format. Did it put me off eating takeaway food? Not particularly, as I try to only do so in moderation anyway. And as we see in SUPER SIZE ME, moderation is something all too lacking these days...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too biased against McDonald's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The key problem with this documentary is that it is too negative against just McDonald's and not the whole fast food industry. The thing is that Spurlock needs to realize that Burger King and Wendy's are not really any better for your health than McDonald's is. And so what if McDonald's has a clown? Burger King has their own king. Also he needs to remember that it is not just McDonald's giving out toys, Burger does that as well and in fact, Wendy's used to do that. It sounds hypocritical for him to OK fast food but slam McDonald's when no fast food place is really good for your health. The reason I would recommend watching this documentary is because of the interesting facts it gives throughout the movie. Otherwise, you can skip this movie because it is an unfair slam against one fast food chain. He is singling McDonald's out for being the death of a healthy American populating when other fast food places are nearly just as guilty of the same thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ultimate problem with Super size me is that it is too biased against McDonald's. The whole doc is supposed to be about how bad fast food is for us in general and yet all he ever talks about and criticizes is McDonald's. This has been pointed out before,but it is really obvious that eating like this for 30 days straight non-stop will make you overweight or obese because there are people who eat less than he does in this and end up being more fat than he becomes after eating for 30 days. The whole premise of this film is rather dumb. Morgan attacks McDonald's for baiting kids to eat there because of toys but he never slams burger king for also giving out free toys to kids. He doesn't even mention the fact that Wendy's used to give out toys to kids. If there is one thing good about this it is that it provides tons of interesting facts throughout. everything else in the documentary was pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is about a guy who ate fast food to show it is unhealthy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If this ever growing paradigm is going to shift, it's up to you," said Morgan Spurlock. We the people have the control over what happens to our body and to stop eating unhealthy foods. Fast food restaurants are very dangerous to the body when a lot is consumed. The purpose of the documentary Super Size Me is to inform how McDonalds can affect the lives of the consumers through a guy named Morgan Spurlock. It is about a guy who went under a thirty day experiment of eating McDonalds three times a day. He could not exercise or walk a lot because the average person would not do these things. Throughout this period he experienced many problems like getting sick, nausea, and high cholesterol. In the end he gained about forty pounds and minor heart problems. This is to show what can happen to those who eat McDonalds frequently. To help clearly portray this message, there are themes and strengths/weakness that are displayed throughout the film. Primarily, there were several themes that stuck out through this documentary. One in particular was obesity increasing in different groups of people. This is a very important theme because it helps the message get across. If a person eats fast food all the time he or she will continue to gain weight. This is more so targeted to those who do not exercise and lookout for their health. Even though Spurlock is eating a specific fast food, it is no different from Wendy's, Burger King, and other fast food restaurants. He just had to stick with one place the entire time. Obesity symbolizes the people and how it is affecting the human body. In this film people are upset because they gain weight from eating McDonalds. If a person knows that they can gain weight by continuously eating unhealthy foods, then those habits should definitely change. Another theme is age which symbolize children. They are starting out early with being exposed to not eating healthy. In this case the parents are to be blamed because they are the ones who have to provide food for their children. There is not anything wrong with eating fast foods, it is the way a person goes about it. An average person should not eat it every day or exceed their calorie limit. When it comes down to the children they should not consume as much so their bodies would not be trained to depend on fast foods all the time. One of the things that were pointed out in the film was McDonalds having a playground. This attracts kids to play and even have birthday parties. It is kind of hard to play at a food place and not eat there. It is clear to see the two themes play a huge role in humans. Furthermore, there are strengths and weakness that this documentary have. One strength is how Spurlock took on this challenge to undergo different things risks that could possibly happen to him. I like how the film included doctors to make sure everything would run smoothly. There was a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, general practitioner, and nutritionist. All of these people were needed because of the danger his body would be in consuming this food. One important weakness is not having statistics and having someone to compare him to. It is easy to say that if is someone eats fast food, then they will gain weight and have health problems. What about the people who work out, and consumes it occasionally throughout the week? This is something should have been discussed or mentioned. Also It would have being more effective if Spurlock was compared to someone who does not eat fast food as much to compare and contrast results. Some people may watch this film and continue to do the same thing. Others will actually change their lifestyle. The goal is to help the majority to see what could actually happen if they continue this process over the course of years. Moreover, even though there are weaknesses here and there in the documentary, it is overall a good film. It has many positive aspects pertaining to the purpose. The results support the theory of gaining weight when fast foods are consumed. An actual human is being put to the test in order to prove how serious this situation can get. Once Spurlock's thirty days were up his heart got affected. He was at risk of having a heart attack even if he was to lose weight. It took him five months to lose majority of the weight that he gained off and another nine months just to lose the last 4.5 pounds off. It is also very inspirational to be able to get a first-hand look on what can happen to someone eating unhealthy food every day. This should help people be thankful that some of the dangerous things has not happened to them. This could actually cause death and hopefully no one would continue something so detrimental just to lose their life. It is all about compromising. Exercising and cutting back are the two main factors in order to have healthy life. In conclusion, this film served its purpose on getting the message across about how fast foods are unhealthy. It is up to the person to take this video experience and do something about it. The facts have been stated which should show the viewers that this is a serious matter. The points were made clearly in order to tell the purpose. I would definitely recommend showing this documentary to different people of all ages and hope that they would see what could possibly happen in the present and future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time for a food fight and I'll be loving it! Super-Size Me was a pretty good documentary. Still, it's without controversy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Independent filmmaker, Morgan Spurlock is no Upton Sinclair. Directed and starring, himself. The film follows a 30-day period in which Morgan spent his time, eating only McDonald's fast food meals. The film documents this lifestyle's drastic effect on Spurlock's physical and psychological well-being, and explores the fast food industry's corporate influence, including how it encourages poor nutrition for its own profit. For a long time, for example, McDonalds claimed its fries were vegetarian, even as it continued to flavor them with beef tallow or how they defaulted on a promise to cut the trans-fats from its food. The company apologized, and paid a settlement. I'm not for or against McDonalds, nor a paid spokesmen for them, but in my opinion, this documentary gives nothing new. He's basically telling the audience something everyone already should know already: Fast food is bad for you if you eat it all the time. It felt very regurgitation of common knowledge. As an informative documentary, it fails to be, that good, due to a lot of misinformation and some outright lies in his studies. While, the movie makes it very clear that the rules of Morgan's experiment are: for 30 days, he can't eat or drink anything that isn't on a McDonald's menu. 2. He must eat three meals a day ? breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 3. He must consume everything on the menu at least once. 4. If a cashier asks Morgan if he wants to "super-size" his meal, he must agree. 5. He will attempt to walk about as much as (or rather, not substantially more than) a typical U.S citizen, based on a suggested figure of 5,000 steps per day. 6. He must consume everything on his plate. Still, some people has accused him of outright fraud with his McDonald results, claiming that Spurlock over did it, resulting in some shoddy diet research. One good example is the scene of Spurlock vomiting in the parking lot after his first Super-Sized meal. It probably has less to do with McDonalds being unhealthy, and more with Spurlock forcing himself to eat every single last bite of the meal long past when he was beginning to feel unwell. I really doubt, the average American is forcing themselves to over eat like that. Another is Morgan's normal diet. He admits that he practically never ate out before making the documentary, and that he normally barely even eats meat in his evening meals because his girlfriend is a vegan chef. It's inevitable that somebody who goes from this kind of diet to eating nothing, but McDonalds will have a much more extreme reaction than an average person who eats fast food in moderation. It sucks, that Morgan has refused to make his food logs public, possibly because even basic math indicates that he could not have followed his own rules and consumed 5,000 calories per day as he claimed. More scientific and less informal studies have found it impossible to replicate his results. It doesn't help that eating 5,000 calories per day of absolutely any sort of food, with limited exercise, is bad for you because eating excessive amounts of food while avoiding exercise is what causes all weight gain. All his rules for the experiment doesn't match with the results of normal fast-food eater, but an extreme case of overdoing it. A better research result came from the 2009's documentary film, Fat Head. I give the movie, some credit as Spurlock visits renowned Big Mac fanboy Don Gorske, who achieved notoriety for eating at least one Big Mac a day for well over a decade. In contrast to the film's message, it shows that the Gorske is actually in perfect health. It shows that the McDonald diet, can have different results on different people. Still, Morgan doesn't show too much, as he kinda self-censor an interviewer by having him cover his McDonald's salad from the camera. Despite a lot of poor sourcing informative, this was a funny and entertaining documentary. It remind me so much of a Michael Moore's style of documentary filmmaking, full of animation, pop culture references and great use of classy music. The different between them, is that Spurlock replaces Moore's smugness agenda with a self-deprecating approach. Super-Size Me is indeed more personal than Moore's political type movies. In fact, Super Size Me comes across as apolitical. Blaming both corporation, and those who pursue frivolous lawsuits against McDonald's, outing their lawyers' motives at being purely financial. Today, Spurlock might be more political as he wants tight government controls over how food companies market their products. But at the time, Spurlock's oeuvre far suggests that this was made as a publicity stunt than a political statement. It wasn't long after that that his TV show built on a similar premise came out. McDonald's was an easy, high-profile target, so he went after them to get his name out and rake in the money. Amidst all the controversy this film has generated, the film was generally well-received and was a fun watch. I think, if one choice to eat McDonalds, go for it, despite what this documentary says. There isn't anything wrong, with eating fast-food, as long as you don't overdo it. Too much of anything, can make you sick. If you choose not to eat McDonalds. It's alright, too. Ronald McDonald never pointed a gun to my head and forced me to eat his food. I think this movie did more good for McDonalds than bad, as they reform a lot of their own business practice and often more and more healthy choices. Soon after this documentary was released, McDonald's stopped offering the super-size option for their meals and introduced a 'Go Fit!' meal. They claim that these changes were unrelated to the documentary's popularization, but in my opinion, I think it did. Overall: It's a well-made documentary that worth taking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is an obesity epidemic in America. It is getting worst and spreading around the world. Morgan Spurlock conducts an experiment on himself. He would eat 3 meals a day in McDonald's and limit his exercise to more of a typical person. Various experts would monitor his health.Morgan Spurlock is doing one of the new ways of documentaries. He's not going for objectivity or neutrality. This isn't observational. This is full on participational criticism. There are a lot to fault in this movie. Other movies are more informational. This is almost a performance piece. It's definitely not very scientific. The 30 days become a bit repetitive. However, there is no denying the effectiveness of the premise and Morgan Spurlock's salesmanship. He makes this more compelling than it actually should. He sells every moment of eating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legacy of Michael-Moore-like "documentaries"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Michael Moore's "Bowling for Columbine" had become a major hit and after Moore collected an Oscar with another documentary, the market seemed to brim with similar projects. After all, documentaries like those don't take much to make: An idea, a presenter to convey the idea, a camera and, in case it's needed, the right twist towards the right direction in the editing room. Only, people forgot of major thing: Following the Michael Moore formula takes you from documenting (as in: showing what there is) into the realm of Gonzo-journalism, which contains a kernel of truth, bent into the direction intended by the producer.Next to the Michael Moore films, Spurlock's "Super Size Me" may well have been one of the most successful "Gonzo-Documentaries" that have flooded the market since. This wasn't a film for people who go to fast-food-joints every day, this was a film for people who don't frequently visit places like "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Wendy's" and a zillion others. I must admit: I'm not a big fan either. Sure, once a year, perhaps if I'm on the run or simply in the mood, I'll pay them a visit and order a BigMac with fries (if I recall it correctly, they call them "Quarter-Pounders" in the US). Reminds one of childhood, when I dragged my parents to "McDonald's" because I saw the ads in some comic-book. It's live eating Ramen-noodles in college: Let's call it nostalgia. But time moves on, tastes develop and today I do actually value food, flavor and diversity in what I eat, even if it will cost a buck more. So let's just say that I'm not a hater of fast-food, but that I'm just not a big fan.I must admit too: the movie was entertaining. Almost like watching an episode of "Jackass", where the whole point of watching the show is to see the crew do some incredible stupid stuff and ? aren't we all little sadist to a point? ? getting a little hurt. At first, Spurlock even had me conned. Seeing him degenerate from an average healthy guy to a physical wreck, who would doubt that the rumours and suspicions were true and "MacD"'s products would make people sick? Of course, there was no mention, that Spurlock was a Vegan and hence physically not well equipped to handle this kind of food.In my opinion, documentary should ask questions. Going out with an opinion and use the documentary to confirm this opinion, no matter what the cost, is no longer documentary-filming. It becomes propaganda and that's as true for "Super Size Me" as it is for any works of Michael Moore and similar film-makers. I'd give the film a 5/10 on the entertainment-scale, but the five points I don't give are because it's simply not an honest documentary-film.At the end of the day, the most valuable thing you can take from this film is the advice of a particularly hardcore McDonalds-fan: having spent the better part of his life eating exclusively at McDonalds, he was asked what the secret was to staying as lean and fit as he was. The answer was simple: avoid the fries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this documentary is very good. Even though it was made back in 2004 the problem is still here. which i think is interesting since the movie clearly proved that fast food is very unhealthy. The first time i saw this documentary it changed my view on fast food. I understood that fast food is not good food. If you a lot of fast food it is going to have a negative effect on your body and also on your mind. Just as we see in the movie Morgan Spurlock's mood changes through the experiment and he is also getting problems with his liver. He began to feel very sad and tired but when he got food from McDonalds he would feel happy again. As if he was addicted to fast food. I think many Americans feel addicted the same way that Morgan spurlock did. That is why they go to eat at all of the fast food restaurants. Some people might not be addicted but they might still eat fast food quite often. Instead of making their own food they go down with their kids to one of the many local fast food restaurants. It is quite cheap and very fast compared to "normal" food and the kids love it. Some cities in the USA are filled with fast food restaurants. There are 150000 fast food restaurants serving almost 50 million people daily alone in USA. That is a lot of food and a lot of money and a lot of people. The director of the documentary supersize me Morgan Spurlock also visited schools where they served unhealthy food. The cantina only made a small portion of all the dishes. The rest got from other places. The food that they got was not very healthy but the price for more healthy food would almost be the same. All of the kids would also drink soda to their food.The kids don't know how Jesus looks like but they easily remember the McDonalds logo. Even though supersize me was made by one guy i still think that its quite a trustworthy documentary. He gets checked by three different doctors and he is talking with that works at the places the visits and a guy that have eaten over a thousand big mac burgers from McDonalds.His name is Don Gorske and he simply loves Big Macs. In 2011 he reached 25000 total big macs since 1972. I think that this documentary is does its job well. It tells a lot about how unhealthy fast food and how the restaurants use their money on getting more customers with commercials and toys. I also like how the experiment shows how unhealthy fast food really is is if you eat it everyday. But in the end it gets a bit long and boring. My rating of the movie will be 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is genuinely interesting, watching Morgan Spurlock attempt to eat nothing but McDonalds. There's something quite perversely satisfying as we see him become repulsed by the eating the same foods all the time, but it fails to make a larger point.Obviously Spurlock's attempting to point out how unhealthy McDonalds is (quelle surprise), but he does so not from an objective stand-point but from one where he has already made his mind up as to how he wishes to portray the company and its product, Michael Moore-style. If it's not clear from his own reporting, then the imposition of rather daft rules demonstrates this perfectly (if they ask him if he wants a larger size he always has to say yes, he always has to eat three full meals a deal, and he must eat every item on the menu). But why is never really made clear. Is it because consumers too stupid to make decisions for themselves? Whatever the reasoning, the scientific method is clearly not for Spurlock.But even if he had conducted a truly scientific study, it still would've pointless. McDonlads, as far as I know, have never encouraged consumers to eat nothing but McDonalds - the very idea is ridiculous. No one is surprised Spurlock puts on weight and quickly becomes terribly unhealthy, and nor should they be.Rather, Super Size Me is simply an attempt to moralise. Spurlock gets on his soap box and essentially says 'McDonlads is evil and you shouldn't eat their stuff. Better yet, McDonlads should be banned, for the good of you all'.People who have always hated McDonlads congratulate him for it while glorying in their own smug condescension at the lack of taste of the proles, McDonalds go into panic mode - on the one hand conducting a PR campaign to argue they're not an evil corporation while with the other they introduce new, healthier ranges of food, and the average consumer proves wiser than the lot of them and carries on having a (proper) McDonalds every once in a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite being European and nowhere near as obese as some shown here, I have a horrible feeling that this hard-hitting documentary is designed exactly for people like me. I don't go to fast-food joints that often and never McDonalds because I've never trusted them and don't like their food - give me KFC any day! But like tobacco and alcohol, the dangers of saturated fat, excessive calorie intake and the media's current target of sugar have been talked about for years and the truth is that people don't like being told that they're fat, lazy and/or eating too much junk. The real strength of "Super Size Me" lays not just in presenting an extreme argument against such food and the industry but in how it forces you to look at your own life and reassess your lifestyle.Morgan Spurlock discusses the ever-expanding obesity crisis, focusing on the US in particular and the number one provider of fast food, McDonalds. He decides to ignore the pleas of his vegan girlfriend and indulge in a 30-day diet of eating nothing but McDonalds three times a day, monitoring the effect on his health throughout. During his ordeal, he interviews those involved in the food industry and various regulatory bodies in America who all seem in agreement that McDonalds presents a challenge to the waistlines of ordinary people in a number of ways from persuading children into their restaurants with that damn clown to filling their products with numerous additives to encourage an addiction to their Big Macs. But the effects of Spurlock's crazy experiment take a drastic toll on his mind and body, effects that not even his doctors could have predicted..."Super Size Me" somehow maintains an irreverent tone throughout discussing a serious issue, feeling almost like heavyweight documentary-maker Michael Moore's "Bowling For Columbine". This is no bad thing - humour and satire are powerful tools when presenting an argument and Spurlock's assertion that McDonald's are acting in a morally negligent manner is pretty much irrefutable. Granted, the Golden Arches don't get much in the way of counter-argument as they repeatedly decline Spurlock's attempts at securing an interview with anyone. But there are other issues besides the number of chicken McNuggets one consumes - exercise is quickly disappearing from schools in the US (and what is there simply isn't enough) while adults don't have the time to work off those killer calories. The other problem is choice - how likely are people to choose healthier options when the nutritional information they need is hidden, the advertising budget for fruit and veg is dwarfed by those like McDonald's and Hersey's and even the "healthy" options available are still loaded with sugar? It may feel one-sided and slightly derivative when the film uses cartoons to illustrate certain points (much like Moore does) but "Super Size Me" is essential viewing, if a little graphic at times. It shines a spotlight on an industry that works hard to keep its business obscured in shadow but also the responsibilities of those in Government supposed to protect consumers, swayed by lobbyists on behalf of the same manufacturers as well as the responsibilities of you, the viewer. At the end of the day, only you can decide what to eat and how often and take it from me, I shall be thinking long and hard next time I get the hankering for a Bacon Double Cheeseburger from Burger King. As Spurlock himself asks, who do you want to see go first - you or them? If a documentary was measured on the strength of how it affects you and informs your future decisions then "Super Size Me" is a certified success. Whether it will make me lose weight and eat healthier, I believe I'm too stuck in my ways but at least I'm thinking about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just read the review ,, it contains summary actually</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Super Size Me is a documentary film that was directed and starred by Morgan Spurlock about how fast food influences our body health if we consume fast food often. He did an 31days of fast food diet, "Mcdiet", on himself. Everything he ate is about McDonald. Big Macs, with only a layer of vegetable; sundae and cola, with full of sugar; fries as a food with a rich protein and carbohydrates. In the beginning of this movie, he has a body check with, a physicians, a nutritionist and a personal trainer, which come out with a really outstanding result. But after he started this diet, he starts to have depression, mood swings, and have a hard time to breath at night. At the end of the movie, he ended up to gain around twenty four and a half pounds, and increased in cholesterol number. In the later time, the movie also represented a list of data about the obesity in America. Which shows correlation between fast food and obesity. In the other hand, this movie was blaming the McDonalds and other fast food companies for putting too much money on advertising their food. Those little child they can't even recognize Jesus' face but they could always recognize Ronald McDonald. These advertisement are targeting both the children and the adults. It's just like educating people to eat fast food since they were young, and the worst thing is, they don't know anything about make you obese, having a fat liver or increasing your coronary heart disease chance,except McDonald will bring you to have a happy meal! And yes, while interviewing the pedestrians almost all of them like fast food. Like those guys continued to shouted to the screen that they love fast food and especially the big macs in McDonalds.However, about the experiment of Spurlock, and the symptoms that Spurlock experienced, and these data of obesity, many people said that it's just exaggerating the fact. But for me, the documentation is promoting a better diet rather than eating fast food all the time. This documentary film is worth it to watch for you to know how harmful can fast food destroy your body shape and body health in both short and long term. Watch out on what you eat, because "McDonalds will make you fat They serve Big Macs They serve Quarter-Pounders They will put pounds on you...."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is some truth to the term 'Fast Food Junkie'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this movie probably falls into the same category as the Michael Moore movies, though over time I have found the Morgan Spurlock is somewhat less pretentious and less offensive than Michael Moore. In fact after watching Moore's productions a few times I have come to realise that he is little more than another journalist that likes to manipulate the facts and to get into people's faces in a very aggressive manner. Having now watched this film a few times, I have found that Spurlock doesn't use the same tactics that Moore does, though I must admit that his experiment with sustaining oneself on a diet of McDonalds for a month is somewhat amusing.What I noticed this time that I watched this film is that there are aspects of the experiment that do throw the results off somewhat, and that is that it appears that Spurlock has gone from a very healthy eating regime to a McDonald's binge, and this no doubt is going to have an effect upon the results. Most of the people that regularly eat at McDonalds tend to have built up a tolerance to the unhealthy nature of the food meaning that the physical effects are going to take a lot longer to manifest than somebody going from a vegan diet to an incredibly high fat diet.That does not necessarily mean that Spurlock doesn't have a point, I think he does and I think he does have a very valid point. Now I am not necessarily outright opposed to the capitalist regime. Currently I am sitting at the Highpoint Hotel having just wondered around the Highpoint Shopping Centre in Maribynong in Melbourne. The shopping centre is lovely, as are the other shopping centres around Melbourne. Further, I generally do not have a problem with the franchising system, however what I do have a problem with is how corporate America is entirely focused on one goal, and one goal only, and that is making as much money as possible. To me it seems to be the finality of our post-modern society and the collapse of the Western Metanarrative, and that is that we have one goal, and that goal is purely the accumulation of wealth to the point that we end up rejecting everything else, which has resulted in a purely amoralistic society.Now, there is also the question of personal responsibility, and I am a big supporter of personal responsibility. However is there a point where personal responsibility comes to a end and corporate responsibility begins to take over. The modern corporation is a very powerful entity. In fact many of the corporations today are actually more powerful than many governments, and the problem with that is that the corporation has only one ethical guideline, and that is to make as much money for their shareholders as possible in as short a space of time as possible. This in turn has resulted in an advertising industry that constantly bombards us with propaganda that is very difficult to ignore (though I seem to be having some success in that I am now able to resist the desire to buy useless junk and to actually save money, even though I did end up going on a drinking binge last night, and am probably going to end up going on another drinking binge tonight after having passed a number of pubs on my way here and have developed the desire to go and have a drink at each of them).As Spurlock points out, the amount of money that these junk food corporations spend a year on pushing their product onto an unsuspecting public is mind boggling. While the corporations may push the idea of personal responsibility, my understanding is that it is also the desire of these corporations that we actually do eat at them on a daily, or even greater, basis. Now, I actually don't particularly like McDonald's food, which is the reason I generally do not eat there, and it is not as if my diet is all that crash hot. Okay, I don't actually have a high fat diet, but I find that fast food is actually not all that satisfying, and after eating an upsized Quarterpounder meal I do feel quite sick (I generally don't like Big Macs), and I have never seen a McDonald's add that says 'by the way, enjoy our food, but don't over indulge on them' (and the only reason the alcohol industry puts 'drink responsibly' tags at the end of their adds is because the government forces them too ? in fact I suspect that the alcohol industry would actually like us to binge drink on a nightly basis).As for this film, I believe that it is a pretty good, and enjoyable film, which does have a very relevant point, and I am not surprised that the fast food industry has problems with it because what Spurlock is doing is exposing an element of this industry that they wish to keep silent. Also, since we have actually managed to win a victory against the tobacco industry and tobacco advertising, and also are beginning to make inroads into the alcohol industry, I will not be surprised if we also begin to make inroads against the fast food industry as well. Mind you, the fact that transfat has now been banned in Australia, that the fast food industry (at least in Australia) is not showing caloric information ON THE MENUS, and that they are offering healthy choice menus suggests that Spurlock has also managed to score a significant victory as well (among other people).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Way of The Whopper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this documentary, producer Morgan Spurlock goes stomach first into exposing the fast food industry. In the opening of the film Spurlock mentions a court case in which McDonalds was being sued for indirectly harming two children through the sustained consumption of their food. The outcome stated that if one was to consume McDonalds every day for thirty days and came back with evidence, they would be able to sue. So Spurlock, brave as he is, decides to take on this challenge. Vowing to eat only McDonalds, breakfast lunch and dinner, and abiding by the code that he would always Supersize his food when given the option, Spurlock embarks on his 30 day binge, ignoring the complaints from his poor vegan girlfriend. Overall I think I'd give the film an 8 out of 10. It was very entertaining and informational just about all the way through. With good use of an upbeat oldtimey American themed score, smooth editing and plenty of detailed interviews, alongside the main plot device in which Spurlock endures his challenge, it kept me watching the whole time even with some intermittent "oohs" and "ahhs", and usually I tend to just fall asleep during documentaries. Early in the film, Spurlock assigns three doctors and a dietitian to monitor his health throughout the whole production. By the middle of the movie they all were begging him to stop, which I thought was pretty punctual, they said his liver was shutting down and his heart was at high risk for disease and he was left very depressed by around day 18. But such is the way of the of the fast food lifestyle, and Morgan would have to carry on.One thing I noticed that most other reviewers didn't notice was the editing in this film. Nobody brought up the cinema verite qualities that led the film to be so entertaining. The shaky camera and occasional point of view recording reminds us of how authentic and basic this whole production was, and the heavy use of jump cuts and montages directs the viewers attention to the fast paced get to-the-point kind of attitude that is the fast food lifestyle. The score was used to complement this vibe with the old honky tonk sounding songs with names like "Fat" and "Pusher Man" to kinda accentuate the whole stranglehold the industry has on people. Meanwhile Spurlock factually reviews the Frankenstein-ish ways McDonalds prepares their food and the weird and addictive ingredients they use. When Spurlock was done it was noted that he gained something like 25 pounds, ate a couple pounds of sugar, and put himself at high risk for kidney, liver, and heart disease, he was so afflicted by one month of fast food that it took him 14 months on a vegan detox diet to get himself back in a good balance. I think Spurlock thoroughly proved his point and in retrospect completely owned that McDonalds court case in terms of the requirements needed to actually sue the company. At the end of the movie he shares that McDonalds immediately dropped the supersize me option and added salads to their menu claiming it had nothing to do with this film. Effectively exposing the fast food epidemic, I give Spurlock a solid 8 out of 10, especially for his overwhelming success in becoming one with the Big Mac.-Namaste Spurlock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary blew my mind. It was so funny, and still interesting to watch. I loved it. The director of this movie takes 30 days to only eat McDonalds food and nothing else. It's surely amazing to watch this guy eat and how he feels after (though i can say, this makes you feel sick many times and you might want to close your eyes at some scenes if you easily get sick, like me. I throw up pretty easily.) The editing was great and when you watch it you can see the serious damage and the side effects of eating unhealthy fast food. I actually never felt hungry for fast food after this documentary, and i'm glad i watched this. I think this should be showed in every school, hospitals, yeah everywhere. Cause this documentary makes you not want to eat fast food anymore, or at least think twice about what you eat. I surely learned something and my health has improved drastically as i only eat fast food twice a year. It's really an amazing movie, and the ending credits cracked me up. This was such a great experience and really a good watch, it's worth the 1h 40 minutes. It was funny, interesting and you learn something really good. I recommend this movie to everyone. That's right, everyone. Might of been one of the best movies i've ever watched in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, Mediocre Experimental Design</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Super Size Me" is an earnest attempt on the part of Morgan Spurlock to increase awareness and educate the public on the harmful implications of eating fast food at frequent intervals. One of the more admirable qualities of his strategy was the fact that this challenge was undertaken at his own personal expense. While this appears to be an honest endeavor when taken at face value, I also found certain design elements of his 30-day experiment to be unrealistic and exaggerated at best. I will give Spurlock credit in regards to his approach in determining his health baseline. He did not seek to be evaluated from just one, but three doctors, a nutritionist, and a personal trainer. The confirmation from these multiple specialists positively impacted the reliability of the tests that detailed his initial health. His evaluation was also comprehensive and pointed to the notion that his health was, indeed, excellent overall. Spurlock's presumably "perfect" health had deteriorated exponentially over the course of his 30-day experiment. He gained over 20 lbs., experienced sexual dysfunction, and his triglyceride levels were elevated. The burning question that arose in me while considering his initial health paired with the outcome of his experiment is "Would most Americans experience similar outcomes?"Spurlock was a cultural anomaly to begin with, eating a clean diet and exercising often. Is it possible that the "typical" American would have responded in a less extreme manner to the experimental conditions than Spurlock? Similar to an alcoholic, for instance, humans have the ability to build a tolerance to substances that are bad for us. If Spurlock lived an exceptionally healthy lifestyle before, barely delving into fast food meals, it is possible that he shocked his system into reacting in such profoundly negative ways. It would have been excellent if the filmmaker had engaged in this experiment counter to a "typical" American who does not normally eat healthy or exercise. I also think that the radical nature of the experimental conditions- 3 McDonalds meals per day, always super sizing when asked, eating each item on the menu at least once- were as such that very few Americans could relate to the outcomes that Spurlock experienced. The experiment seemed to be designed in an effort to polarize his baseline health with the experimental outcome, and, in turn, sensationalize the impact of eating McDonalds. I found this aspect of the film to be quite manipulative. Most Americans eat fast food on a moderate basis, and this is okay, as long as individuals are able to otherwise maintain control over their diets. Overall, Spurlock did a decent job shocking the public into thinking more critically about their fast food consumption. This was perhaps the point. I did think that the film could have been more realistic and applicable to everyday Americans, but, then again, it might not have garnered so much attention from the public had he taken this approach. The primary lesson that one can take from this film is that ingesting any harmful substance, including food, in abnormally excessive amounts over a period of time will negatively affect one's health.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Size Me (or not)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a documentary that examines one of the major issues that faces our nation today, obesity. Obesity and the general unhealthiness of the population is a major problem that does not seem to be going away. This documentary, by Morgan Spurlock, takes a look at the fast-food industry and the effects this industry is having upon our society. The film begins with Morgan Spurlock who is a generally healthy guy. Mr. Spurlock decided to test how bad fast food really is for people. In the documentary Morgan Spurlock eats only fast food from McDonalds for a total of 30 days. There were four simple rules that Mr. Spurlock had to follow such as no options (he could only eat what was available over the counter which included water), no super-sizing unless offered (which happened quite often), no excuses (he had to eat every item on the menu at least once), and no giving up (he had to eat three square meals a day, breakfast, lunch and dinner). Along his journey of fast food he retained doctors to check his health status to keep assessing on how his overall health is progressing. Over the course of his study, he gains over 18 pounds; experiences an extreme increase in cholesterol; suffers sexual dysfunction, headaches, and nausea; almost goes into liver failure; and shows signs of addiction.The one part of the film that really bothered me was when they visit a public school to examine the school lunch program. Watching the students eat a lot of junk food and understanding how school lunches have contributed to the overall unhealthy lifestyle of our children was discouraging and depressing. As adults we must come to realize what these types of foods are doing to our children. We need to take charge of the choices and do the right thing for the children.Super Size Me is a film that covered its bases along with asking difficult questions about American's health. While the film was entertaining it was also an eye opener. I would not suggest this film for younger children due to certain language and other issues that are present in the film. You might think twice about eating fast food again if you see this film.</fullReview>

Just walk away from the Big Mac, if you look back and eat one once a month you won't turn into a pillar of salt.I hope McDonald's lost customers because of this movie.

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock's "Super Size Me" is one of the highest grossing documentaries of all time. In it, Spurlock goes on a 30-day all-McDonald's diet in order to gauge the effects, both physically and psychologically. He also examines the influence of the fast food industry in contributing to the ever-increasing problem of obesity among Americans.It ought to be obvious to anyone that eating nothing but fast food for a month can't be good for you but it's interesting to see just how it affects a formerly healthy person. Spurlock's progression drives the documentary and the end results are startling, even though they're not really reflective of reality.When not focusing on Spurlock's quest, "Super Size Me" astutely examines the impact of the fast food industry on the eating habits of Americans. Granted, it all comes down to personal responsibility but the pushers of fast food are undoubtedly partially responsible. After all, they make money on the impulses of their customers.I usually eat fast food once a week so I don't expect that this documentary will end up influencing my habits. Nevertheless, it's good that it had the impact of forcing fast food chains to be more health conscious. That's a benefit to anyone who eats fast food, whether compulsively or in moderation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spulock's documentary, Super Size Me, was incredibly moving. It details the rise of fast food in America and the rest of the world. It also describes the pervasiveness of the issue. Spurlock goes to great lengths to prove how we, as a culture, have been indoctrinated to eat cheap, unhealthy food. He even brings up the lawsuit of two girls in Bronx, NY who attempted to sue McDonald's for their obesity. Spurlock dismisses this complaint as folly ? McDonald's never forced them to eat their food.Spurlock, in an attempt to prove that McDonald's food is unhealthy, adopted a new diet ? 30 days of eating nothing but fast food. He stays in close contact with doctors to monitor any and all changes in his health. He gains weight and triglycerides at an alarming rate. Near the end of the diet, his health had declined so far that he was urged to stop immediately by his doctors.Super Size Me had a great impact on the fast food community. Shortly before the release of the film, McDonald's had removed their "Super-Size" option. They also reformed their menu just one day prior to the film's release. All of this, McDonald's said, had nothing whatsoever to do with the film. You be the judge ? watch the film and see if the harrowing facts of fast food aren't what motivated McDonald's to suddenly care for the health of the public.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Supersize Me tracks a health-conscious man named Morgan Spurlock as he embarks on a one-month diet of McDonald's food?and only McDonald's food. In the course of the documentary, the viewer sees a man in above- average condition digress as he gains weight, becomes more and more lethargic, and faces dangerous consequences on his liver. Spurlock's point is clear from the beginning: to show how McDonald's and other fast food corporations are contributing to, and even causing, obesity and its numerous related health issues in America. He sets several guidelines, such as trying everything on the menu at least once, only super sizing when asked, and keeping his walking and physical activity at a bare minimum. He follows this last rule by using a pedometer and the reported averages given to him by an expert regarding the average American's number of steps taken per day.Although Morgan shows some bias, he clearly has done his research and strongly appeals to pathos, ethos, and logos throughout the film. It is interesting to watch, with its bright colors, catchy music, and extensive use of charts, maps, and diagrams. The statistics about the prevalence of obesity and diabetes in the U.S. are astounding. The film pairs these facts with images and leaves the viewer feeling sad for these people and outraged that such a huge problem exists, when it could be corrected with just a healthy diet and regular exercise. I was aware of the growing problem obesity is, but these facts still really shocked me. This is something I noticed while watching the film?I "knew" the information already, and the results of Spurlock's experiment were, for the most part, predictable, but sitting and watching almost two hours of it made me realize how much I ignore the problem. Sure, we all know the dangers of fattening foods, but Spurlock stepped up and addressed the issue, and did something about it by letting the world in on his experiment. I appreciated the variety of experts and their opinions throughout the film. Morgan interviewed people on the street, included dialogue with McDonald's employees, filmed his visits with doctors and medical experts, and interviewed people involved in the court cases. The viewer was able to see different points of view and this developed a strong element of ethos for the film. Another contributing factor to this is the fact that Spurlock was ready to try it himself. If he had simply presented the cases and facts without involving himself directly, it would not have been as interesting nor as effective. From throwing up after his first super-sized meal to his doctor's serious concern about the worsening condition of his liver, Spurlock's willingness to test the effects of a McDonald's diet firsthand were commendable. Throughout the movie, the different sections are introduced using a melancholy image of Ronald McDonald and his cartoon friends. Spurlock looks at the ways McDonald's targets children, and the rising obesity and cases of diabetes in children today. From the Happy Meal toys to restaurant playgrounds to television commercials, McDonald's seems to target children more than any other age group. Looking at this aspect enforces Spurlock's message. Most would agree that adults have at least some degree of responsibility when it comes to their eating habits, but many children do not have much choice. We see these innocent kids being convinced that cholesterol-raising cheeseburgers and sugary sodas are components of a "good" meal. In one scene, Spurlock holds up cards for elementary school students to identify. They struggle to name common figures such as presidents and a representation of Jesus, but all correctly identify an image of Ronald McDonald without hesitation. He also takes an interesting look into our country's public school lunch system, revealing another place children are trapped into making poor food choices.For me, one of the most shocking scenes was when Spurlock and his camera crew went to the surgery of a man undergoing gastric bypass surgery. The man shared about his unhealthy diet, including insane amounts of soda. The surgery was captured on film. I think this scene really makes one think about the consequences of eating fast food, and an unhealthy diet in general. If things get so severely out of control, it is difficult to get back on track by exercising and diet change. The fact that people resort to surgeries that actually make their stomachs smaller is mind-boggling. It's enough to make me think twice before choosing fries over carrots.I found this film to be both informational and entertaining. It was fast-paced and kept my attention, while at the same time, involved my emotions, making me feel sympathy for people at times and outraged at the fast food corporations at other times. It's use of a wide variety of techniques, including interviews, charts, statistics, and personal stories added to its credibility and entertainment. I recommend this as a worthwhile film that, if nothing else, will provoke your thoughts and make you think about fast food and health in a new light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring Enough to Quit Fast Food!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Healthy Morgan Spurlock goes on an unusual diet of three McDonald meals a day for a month. In the beginning, we see him slowly consume and digest unhealthy meals. Spurlock was born and raised in West Virginia. He now lives in New York City with his girlfriend who is a healthy vegan and worried about him. Apart from a brief moment with her talking about their relationship, this documentary is worthy to be seen by a young audience especially in health and physical education classes or in science classes. In the out-takes, he places McDonald's French Fries in a jar and it lasts for months without change. You have to wonder what they put in the fries in the first place. After a week, he has sampled every meal. There are few meals that I can eat there. I grew up eating the fish fillet but I was disgusted by the melted cheese on the bottom. Until I became an adult, I began asking for a plain fish. The melted cheese in the fish fillet disgusted me and ruined the fish fillet. Anyway, I enjoyed the documentary and Morgan's challenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fast food is the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a lifelong vegetarian, I've always looked down on fast food. I've never even wanted to try it. Morgan Spurlock's documentary "Super Size Me" shows just what a fast food diet will do to a person. Spurlock spent an entire 30-day period eating McDonald's food for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and it altered his health. As Spurlock makes clear, this is not simply an issue of McDonald's; the problem is that Americans consume so much fast food. Our bulging waistlines are but one result. Spurlock lays the documentary out in the same way that Michael Moore does his, interspersing his own footage with cultural icons.I had read Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" and seen the movie based on it, and I'm now reading Schlosser's "Chew On This: Everything You Don't Want to Know About Fast Food". It talks about many of the same things, in particular what gets put into the McNuggets and such products. The point to be derived from Schlosser's books and from Spurlock's documentary is that our collective diet is ruining our health. Are we willing to make better eating choices?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, this movie depicts exactly the health consequences that would stem from having absolutely no self control and eating SEVERAL thousands of calories from a fast food joint THREE times a day for a MONTH. The messages that I took from this movie were to have at least a speck of discipline, self control, self esteem, common sense and another message was to be a good parent and explain to them that fast food is NOT meant to be eaten constantly, it's more of a treat. It's something that you ration out and don't overdue. A greasy burger and fries every now and then is fine, just like a beer or two, or a glass of wine every now and then, it's called treating yourself to something nice. Folks, fast food joints are not the bad guys, laziness is bad. I do think that most adults are smart enough to realize all of this.I am giving this movie 5 stars solely because, let's face it, it was all about criticizing fast food companies,but also, I didn't give it only 1 star just because of the aforementioned messages that you can get out of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's up for a Big Mac? The item of America and of its eating itself to death, here, given a frightening but oddly entertaining exploration.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me felt more-a damning of America's eating habits and over indulgence in fast-food than it did a demonisation of McDonalds. That's not to say McDonalds gets of entirely, it's just the 2004 documentary did not do enough to permanently turn me away from said chain, or indeed any fast food outlet, and I find myself able to frequent one every now and again if needs be. Rather, his film is a statement on, or an exploration of, just how partaking in such diets and eating habits can ruin a person's life just as much as it can put them at great risk linked to one's own health. A case for blaming those whom are the ones consuming mass quantities of the product, and not the product itself, ought not entirely fall on deaf ears; rather, the documentary will go on to further explore just what it is that gives McDonalds that mystery; that aura; that reputation, predominantly in locating just where some of its outlets actually are on top of what it is McDonalds appears to stand for or represent. In short, the documentary is a pretty terrifying exploration into the nutritional unknown; there can be few foods or stonewall diets in the world that would have this kind of an affect on a human, Super Size Me being all of a grotesque; wondrous; off the wall; distasteful; shocking and yet strangely alluring experiment undergone by a charismatic and ridiculously brave soul in Mr. Morgan Spurlock.Spurlock's film explodes into life with a fierce documenting of fast food and the situation regarding fast food in the United States today; an expositional placing down of the facts onto the proverbial table, the informing us on the severe lengths certain companies within the arena of fast food have gone so as to achieve restaurant proximity and a grip on a nation of fast-foodies. After dishing out the bare bones on the situation, the severity of the situation and the results of such severity in the situation; he calmly appears on screen and outlines exactly what it is he'll do in a manner that is not nonchalant, but confident, but with a hint of worry: all the meals he will eat from now on for the period of a month will be from the McDonalds menu, with the mandatory updating to Super Size if the clerk offers such an option. The documentary is the capturing of this experiment; amply supported by girlfriend Alexandra, who's often on the camera, as well as an array of doctors and nutritional experts he calls upon, Spurlock sets out in what we can only perceive as the goal amidst the madness, in the hope of proving McDonalds are to blame for the obesity problem America has.Before we set out on the road, an interview with a person whom tried to sue a tobacco company sees the film attempt to paint a portrait of McDonalds as a company more geared towards children and one that perhaps preys on them. Spurlock opts for content which will go a long way in having us side with him from the off; the proposing of a nation's child generation as those whom are victimised by a company whom offers food on top of other services such as: Happy Meals, play-zones and the ability to play out parties for children. The tactic is designed to play on the audience's emotions and mind, quickly forcing us into constructing an image of the company being rather evil minded in this sense. Shamelessly, Spurlock vomits there and then out of the window of his car the first time he goes for the Super Size option; the feeling that the road ahead will be long and tough coming to be prominent.The journey, of which Spurlock refers to as a "tour of duty", is of a warts-and-all ilk; the getting through all of the food, all of the time, a disgusting enough of a concept to handle on the one hand with the regular visits to clinics for check ups on his grossly, ever-deteriorating health complete with one-stop trip to the operation theatre so as to peek in at one man's surgery a gruelling watch all in itself. Later on, problems arise when it is revealed in a rather personal moment that he is wholly fed up of the menu after a meagre ten days; prompting the question as to how he'll put up with it from then on in. His calling of what he's doing as an aforementioned tour of duty suggests something nationalistic in his actions; as if he is braving the unknown in search of what's right for the American people; indeed, the people of the world ? it would be fair to say he serves the tour well.Spurlock goes where few would even dare to contemplate, and yet the disturbing truth of the matter is that it would appear most people aren't invariably too far away from where Spurlock was during that month in his diet. The film is much more than a mere Jackass stunt; here is an experiment in all its grotesque and grizzly glory, a genuine venturing off into the unknown so as to test a genuine thesis upon which the sorts of content naturally plays out. The piece is delicately inter-cut amidst professional opinion in the form of doctors and nutritionists, with street-set vox pops snippets that offer their own element of comic relief, with Spurlock's own plight as he munches his way through an outrageous amount of Big Macs and Quarter Pounders; each strand both fascinating and curiously humorous in its own right culminating in an accomplished documentary for the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast food may become regular food</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Super Size Me has been a movie I've went back to for years and years after it's release. I sit it as one of my favorite documentary films of all time. It's well placed and it's informative style makes it a film I consistently revisit. It's like a film you can't just appreciate once. Watching it more and more it's almost like the film has more to offer with every viewing. How many films could you say that about? This film is the one that took Morgan Spurlock's career to new heights. He wrote books, he got so much recognition for this daring act, he got his own show on FX called 30 Days, and he made another very less successful film called Where in the World is Osama Bin Laden? It all started with a 30 day binge on nothing but McDonalds food. I've ate McDonalds for a week straight. Where the hell are my deals with FX and book companies?Morgan Spurlock goes on something that is quite possibly done by various obese Americans; a 30 day McDonalds binge. Nothing but food sold by McDonalds can go past Spurlock's lips for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Thirty days, whats the risk? Nothing really, just obesity, heart attack, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, nausea, heart burns, headaches, stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, and a sick liver. Would you like to super size that, sir? As far as fast food goes, I eat it probably five to ten times a month. I'm a healthy 127 pounds (remember, I'm 14), and have been eating like this for approximately three years. I manage to have at least ten regular meals with my family composed of meat. a side dish, a salad, and milk/soda. My diet is the least of my concerns. I eat what I want, I frequently exercise, and I'm a-okay.My views on fast food are as followed; it's the lower quality food that packs less of what i should, but more flavor. McNuggets I don't think are even real meat. I eat them anyway. I've yet to experience any sickness from consuming them. They can't be that health for you, but not that harmful. Paranoia and fear are the only two things that come to our minds when they hear "fast food". They think, lick everything, it's "too good to be true". Fast food is probably not one hundred percent healthy, but not one hundred percent harmful.Super Size Me is a fantastic documentary with a damn good experiment. One of my first reviews was a film called Google Me about a man who "googled" his name and went to meet almost everyone with the same name as him. It was a very cool thing to do, just like what Spurlock did in this movie. Of course Spurlock's journey was way more risky and involved a lot more tiresome work. But what is worse - carpal tunnel or a heart attack? Directed by and Starring: Morgan Spurlock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, six years later I see this infamous reality movie of the last decade. I'm older than it's star and co-writer, so I've been around to notice the slow decline in the quality of American eating habits, as our serving size increased. Like many Americans, I grew up with McD's and other fast food restaurant chains. Most of the facts presented in the film were already known to me, with two exceptions. I didn't know the liver could be impacted in such a dramatic negative way by a high fat, cholesterol and sodium diet in just 30 days. Also, the fact physical education is no longer mandatory in public schools. This obviously created an additional factor, helping the USA achieve a pandemic of overweight citizens.Since the popularity of fast food began to take hold back in the 1960's, the diet industry in our fat country has grown to a $30+ billion a year industry. The power and influence of the fast food companies (including their familiarity), our daily portion sizes of food slowly increasing and the lack of exercise in public schools, have all become factors to make us a fat nation.The approach used in the documentary was a bit extreme. Instead of three McDonald meals per day for 30 days, one McD meal per day for 90 days would have showed the same effects, just more slowly, making things less dramatic and scary.McDonald's denied their dropping the super size option had nothing to do with the release of the film. I highly doubt that. They have made their nutrition information more readily available in their restaurants since this 2004 documentary was released. I looked at their complete nutrition information sheet a few years ago and it strongly speaks for itself, for how unhealthy their food really is. The question is how many people addicted to McD food and fast food in general, will pause to actually look at one of these nutritional information sheets? The things all bad habits have in common is, they tend to catch up with most people, given enough time. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supersize Me Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supersize Me sets out to address an interesting topic and definitely succeeds in disgusting the audience. Morgan, the protagonist, decides to only eat McDonalds fast food for 30 days. In order to start this experiment, he goes to multiple doctors to assess his current health. He is an extremely healthy young man, but this obviously changes throughout the movie with his new diet. His main focus is to prove that only eating fast food can indeed be harmful to the body. Overtime this does show, as he gains a lot of weight and his liver becomes extremely fatty. By the end of each day he is extremely tired and finds climbing the stairs even a challenge. Throughout the experiment he becomes more and more depressed and cannot perform as well sexually. His girlfriend feels disgusted with his new habit, posing an emotional challenge. While he does find pleasure in the food, he finds it hard to be happy when he is not eating. The only emotional trigger left for him is food ? it is an addiction. In the movie fast food is presented to us through many different opinions. There is one young girl who feels isolated in school because of her weight. She states that is not realistic for people to be so skinny, such as models and actors. But is it not just as unrealistic to have so many morbidly obese people? Both ends of the spectrum are extremely unhealthy; there is not one right or wrong. Nobody is asking anyone to become anorexic or bulimic, only to live a healthy lifestyle which a lot of the overweight people in the United States are not doing. It is not about what is right for everyone, but instead finding the balance for yourself. The young girl will have trouble fixing her problem without encouragement in every form, which seems hard to come by in a society so deeply rooted in fast food.Schools do nothing to help students create their own sense of body image. The movie presents a school to us where the children are only fed healthy foods. Students with behavioral problems attend the school and are only provided with this diet. After time, they have been seen to act better in class and perform better in general. It makes no sense that every school does not operate in this way. How can children learn to make the right food choices if all they are offered are things like pizza and fries? It is unfair to the children and their bodies. The movie investigated and found that healthy food costs just as much as unhealthy food for schools. If this is so, then I do not understand why any school would choose to negatively affect the health of their students. Not only this, but the schools also need to promote healthy role models. In an experiment, children were shown to recognize Ronald McDonald over political figures. That is an extremely sad thing to hear for our country. Our future leaders do not even know the leaders before them. Fast food is deteriorating to the body and the mental picture of body image. I found it fascinating and appalling at the same time that the doctors did not believe that Morgan's body was not going to be too damaged by the fast food. It demonstrates that fast food has literally poisoned the minds of most Americans. If our health officials do not even realize its effects, how can we blame any average American for not knowing them too? The whole thing is quite ridiculous. Our country needs to change our mindset as a whole, in order to make any change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unfiltered look at this Fast Food Nation that we are looking at</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Food Inc, it seemed inhumane to let someone eat McDonald's and only McDonald's for a month. The amount of mistreatment of animals and just overall processing of their meat is astounding. The chicken nuggets aren't actually nuggets of chicken, they are a paste that is made of all parts of the chicken ground up so it looks like pink play dough, it is then colored white, stamped into shapes, breaded, fried and then shipped to a McDonald's near you. The ground beef that comes from those plants isn't from one cow, but from up to 1000 different cows. The narrator and main character Morgan Spurlock ate nothing but McDonald's for 30 days for 3 meals a day. I thought some of the best points in this movie were how he would feel low if he didn't eat for a while and then feel better when he did eat. He noticeably gained weight, just by living an exaggerated version of the American Lifestyle. When he tried to reach anyone at McDonalds to talk, he could never get anyone on the phone. This movie points out how we as Americans live. We live in a society where we can buy a 72 ounce soda at 7/11 or a cheeseburger for a dollar. We never think of the ramifications of these actions, we just know that it tastes good and is cheap, which is all we really want. The biggest problem that i had with this movie is that he took it too far. He ate it for three meals a day for 30 days, it is clearly unhealthy, but for what we thought would happen, it wasn't that bad, his cholesterol went up and he gained a lot of weight, but he also didn't allow himself to work out which he used to do on a regular basis, so he lost muscle too. I just didn't feel that the results of his experiment weren't the same as what they were hyped to be. But he did get a great message across and did cause the food companies to change their ways, which in itself is an achievement. My favorite part from the movie was when he put the different burgers from McDonalds and the fries all in different jars, and then got a hamburger and fries from a restaurant and put them in jars too. Then watched as they decomposed. And in the end they all did in one way or another, except for the fries. As the Big Mac turned to mold, the fries still looked the exact same as they did the day they were bought. He then raised the question, is it healthy to put something that cant be broken down by nature in our bodies? I thought no, it isn't, if mold can't grow here, then what is going to happen when if i eat it? This is the world we live in. Where we eat what is available for a cheap price, and because of that, we eat things that are terrible for us. Its all because we live in a Fast Food Nation, we just all need to realize that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Documentary states the obvious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rather crude documentary with rudimentary camera work and audio effects, this film nevertheless won several awards including for best direction at the Sundance Festival and a Documentary Screenplay Award from the Writers Guild of America with an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary to boot. The obvious reason is that the subject and conclusion of the movie finds relevance and resonance with a lot of people concerned about health and looks.Morgan Spurlock, writer, director and main "actor" in the documentary who seems like a health buff whose girlfriend is a vegetarian chef, undertakes to eat nothing but McDonald's fast foods for one month. He puts himself under the care of a physician, a nutritionist and various other medical specialists to record his state of health before the experiment and to monitor the "progress" or rather the deterioration of his health in the duration of his experiment. Not surprisingly, his internist, Dr. Daryl Isaacs, several times in the course of the month-long "adventure" strongly advised him to go off the McDo diet as his cholesterol levels shot up to unhealthy parameters as well as the occurrence of deleterious changes to his pulse, respiration and overall resistance under medically controlled stress tests. He also complained of strange tingling sensations in unmentionable parts of his nether region. As for me being an older person whose sensations in the same parts are waning, I would be hard put to say whether that would be an unwelcome development.As a candidate to become an emergency medical technician (basic), I found the disclosures in the film and the results of Spurlock's experiment alarming. I live in a working class neighborhood where parents (some couples, quite a number - single parents) probably do not have much time to shop fresh food and cook them. I surmise this from my observation that I often see pizza and other fast food deliveries coming and going at all times of the day. I once had a lady neighbor who would go out between 5:00 and 6:00 in the morning and come back with boxes of fast foods, coffee and cola drinks for herself and her children. Then in the evening, a pizza or fried chicken delivery person would come ringing at her door. Gazooks! I wondered, how could they stand eating those stuff everyday? As an immigrant to the US only recently turned citizen, I find the partiality of my now fellow Americans towards fried foods worrisome and certainly in conflict with my taste. While I do sometimes enjoy fried chicken, hamburger and chips I would not even contemplate eating fried foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was having an excess of such in my first few months here and for a change I actively searched for a seafood restaurant (in Tampa, Florida). To my disappointment and frankly some disgust, I found that the menu consisted of deep fried battered fish, shellfish, calamari and scallops. While I would eat some fish fried, I would prefer tasting some of the sea in my seafood especially when it comes to scallops, crabs, oysters and clams and that calls for steaming, blanching or putting them into light soups.The film does not draw definite conclusions, perhaps to avoid lawsuits, but does avert to disturbing correlations between ill-health and fast foods. McDonald's representatives refused to be interviewed by Spurlock. Nevertheless, after its release, McDonald's came out with allegedly healthy items in its menu including salads (alas still loaded with calorie rich cheeses and dressings) and Mexican style corn wraps.I wonder if there is a correlation between the fact that I often see the blue and white ambulances of my destination rescue station on call in my neighborhood and the fact that many of my neighbors practically subsist on fast foods for their staple diet?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of then unknown filmmaker Morgan Spurlock's odyssey to uncover the effects of a solid fast-food diet,via an entire month of eating nothing but McDonald's,is pretty well documented by now. The darling(in tandem with Michael Moore's scathing and somewhat over-blown Iraq War/anti-Bush administration documentary epic Fahrenheit 9/11)of a number of film festivals,it would be the talk of anyone who had ANY interest in health,food education or simple curiosity about what it really WOULD be like to indulge in the world's most easily identifiable and popular fast food for that long.A smart,well-thought endurance test for anyone who's had some digestive problems(of which I count myself among),this is a cheerfully broad swipe at not just the fast food industry(with small swipes at Baskin Robbins and the Soda companies)but at Supermarket retailers,the corporate strategies behind them,the educational initiatives(or usually the lack thereof),the disparity of food marketing,profits and advertising and--last but not least--social attitudes toward eating. Plenty of editing and graphic,a fair injection of "man on the street" interviews and,of course,Spurlock's own observations,reactions to the diet and pitfalls(which are a bit painful to endure at a point,to be honest)which are matched by the skepticism,horror and disbelief at his experiment shared by his girlfriend(a Vegan chef,no less!),a series of doctors and health consultants and even his mother. Truly a packed show that is largely satisfying.A tad preachy,it still has a delightfully lighter touch than many of Moore's movies(particularly Fahrenheit)and while the social/health-wise impact the show maybe aiming for is somewhat negligible in result(aside from "not making" McDonald's eliminate the Super Size option on their menus not long after this show's theatrical run),it is still a largely entertaining and eye-opening tour de force. Extras on the DVD are somewhat "off the reservation",choosing to deal more in general food/health quandaries(for example:the location of breakfast cereals and candy placement in your average supermarket)than necessarily any direct relation to the fast food questions,but still definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In terms of entertainment it is mildly entertaining, however it is not accurate. The main character loses muscle and gains fat because he increased his caloric intake dramatically and stops working out. He had a healthy lifestyle prior to his McDonald's binge and by stopping what he previously did to stay healthy, his health degraded severely. I am not claiming McDonald's food wasn't the cause but in reality, binge eating any unhealthy foods for 30 days combined with a lack of exercise will cause your health to degrade.Finally, McDonald's can not be the sole blame of obesity for those two overweight girls instead it can be blamed on their apparent lack of exercise combined with unhealthy eating habits that they either chose or that their parents imposed upon them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock definitely carries this entire documentary. His demeanor and presence makes what would normally be a rather dull experiment into a funny and somewhat tragic look at fast food and how it affects us all. The theory is simple, eat nothing but McDonalds for 30 days, 3 square meals, have at least one of everything on the menu, and if they ask to him to super-size it when he orders, he has to. Spurlock quickly finds out how caloric-dense McDonalds food is, and how its designed to be addictive with massive amounts of caffeine, corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, and salt. Its a shocker that 3 meals equals over 5000 calories a day, double what the average healthy person needs. The results of course are predictable at least to me. What's funny is the response of his dietitian and doctors monitoring him, who didn't realize how damaging fast food was to the body. The tragic part was the health center that monitored him during that short month went bankrupt! No money in healthy lifestyles, but plenty in fast food. Spurlock only touches on some big topics like school lunches and the psychology of programming kids to know fast food places through the use of cartoon characters, so he stays on topic of the 30 day experiment which is a good thing. Obesity is such a huge complex issue that you can't really address every aspect in a single documentary. This documentary may not keep you from eating McDonalds forever, but it will make you think twice before eating fast food on a regular basis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supersize Me: 0% Fat, 0% Sugar, 100% Pure Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Morgan Spurlock is a genius. We all complain that fast food companies are in it for the money and that it's their fault for making us fat. But on the other hand we complain that we're the ones at fault because we're the ones getting the Big Mac when we could just get a salad (even though it has just as much fat) or simply just not eating at a gross, fat-frolicking, sugar-slinging, fast food restaurant. So the big question here is: who's at fault here? Both are, and Morgan Spurlock makes us wake up and smell the calories by putting his life on the line in order to reveal that our lives, our streets, and even our schools have all been supersized. He takes us on a behind-the-scenes look at what's in McDonald's food, what's in our schools' food, how they are all prepared, and a whole bunch of different harmful things that fast food can do to one's body, served up with a side order of shocking statistics. And if it takes thirty days in order to save America from becoming McAmerica, then our country must be way over the McLimit. It's the sad and awful truth. So I say thank you Morgan Spurlock for making a difference and just for making one of the few entertaining documentaries out there. I think it deserved more than just a Oscar nomination. 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super Size Me is a funny, frightening and salutary film. Director Morgan Spurlock subjects himself to a month-long diet of McDonald's burgers in super-sized portions to demonstrate their health risks.It's a crudely effective stunt documentary, which makes its points simply but entertainingly: as a result of his experiment, Spurlock gains 25lbs, experiences liver and cholesterol problems, and gets struck off one corporation's Christmas card list. The reason for Spurlock's investigation was the increasing spread of obesity throughout U.S. society, which the Surgeon General has declared "epidemic".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining propaganda, nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is an entertaining and engaging film, it's not a very honest documentary. I was hoping to see more of an "Average Joe" who simply wanted to try an all-McDonald's diet as an unbiased experiment. Rather, we get Morgan Spurlock, who is a vegan, anti-corporate crusader with a strong agenda against McDonald's in particular.It's hard to take anything we see very seriously when we realize Spurlock's slant on things. Rather than simply being a film with a message about living and eating healthy, or even just an intriguing experiment, this becomes more of an anti-McDonald's propaganda piece with Spurlock taking jabs at the Golden Arches whenever possible. He clearly does everything in his power (through crafty editing and eating ridiculous portions to the point of vomiting) to achieve his desired result of portraying McDonald's food as unhealthy, addictive and even potentially deadly.The intention of the film is to unveil fast food giants as evil corporations, hellbent on destroying the health of our nation for a quick buck. However, by being so unrealistic and exaggerated, I finished the film with the feeling that fast food didn't get a fair chance to tell their side of the story. Spurlock seems more like a bully, obsessed with cramming his agenda down our throats at all costs.In keeping with bullying, this film wants to chalk obesity up to simple laziness and lack of willpower. While that is the cause in many cases, most understand there are certainly other medical and hereditary reasons for obesity. To a certain extent, I got the feeling that Spurlock was pointing at fat people and laughing, rather than showing any legitimate concern.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whether You Hate or Love Fast Food, This is the Movie for You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie, I was looking forward to seeing it. Unfortunately, it was only in limited theatrical release, so I never got to see an up-close perspective of the movie, which would have probably been better on the big screen. After I saw this for the first time, I knew I had to own it. Spurlock is the perfect choice for the experiment. He is to fast food what Mr. Rogers is to children's education. If somebody else had tried this experiment, it wouldn't have been the same. And you never know, they might not have been as lucky (or lucky at all) health-wise. The scenes concerning school nutrition are just as interesting. Maybe Spurlock would have better off eating from a variety of fast food restaurants, instead of just McDonald's. But that might have not been as effective.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It made me oddly hungry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supersize me is essentially about how obesity is becoming a nation wide epedemic. and a lot of people are pointing the finger at McDonalds and other fast food restaurants for there unhealthy garbage food which has proved to provide to the problem.Now as a poor student I need fast food to survive. I suck at cooking and I live by myself. McDonalds is cheap and filling, and to be honest I'm fairly healthy for my age. Even though this is kind of a swaying subject from where I'm gonna head with this review, I just wanted to add that I don't think I could live without fastfood. Just because of my overall negligence to cook. But anyways Super size me is definitely an eye opening film for anyone who has ever eaten at the resteraunt. For me as a Canadian I was shocked at the massive size of the supersized drinks and fries. And I was shocked by the fact that Physed isn't a mandatory class. I had Physed almost every school day from grade 1-12. I was also shocked to hear about the food at the youth detention school was actual... Food. And that most American schools were serving rather unhealthy substitutes. This movie definitely provides some good points to argue why Fast Food and the more commercialized food products are looking out more for the dollar then for the health of the country. Really pathetic.The only thing i have against this film is that it really made Americans look incredibly stupid with the whole "If you know it's bad for you, why eat it?" thing. I would have liked to see some statistics from other countries to compare, kind of like the French lady who was interviewed. But in short, this is a recommended Documentary for everyone... 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting film on the state of nutrition in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock's film is based on an experiment that uses himself as a guinea pig in which he ingests nothing but food and beverages sold by McDonald's for 30 days to see the results. Spurlock is a healthy man in his early 30's who - prior to this film - has eaten a healthy diet, maintained a healthy weight, and gotten plenty of exercise on a regular basis. He is embarking on this experiment because apparently McDonald's has made the claim that you could eat their food daily as part of a healthy diet. Spurlock's rules are he can eat nothing but McDonald's food for 30 days, he must eat three meals a day, and if asked if he wants to supersize something he must always say yes. On top of this, he simultaneously cuts back on his exercise to be something corresponding to what the average American gets. Also, though not part of his official rules, he never orders a salad or bottled water. He always goes right for the greasiest food offered. It should be obvious to anyone that this is not what McDonald's meant in their press release as Spurlock goes on a month long fast food binge. At least part of the results were not that startling to me. If you are over thirty and you do this to yourself, even for just a month, you should expect to gain a lot of weight and feel awful - which he does. He gains about ten percent of his original body weight over the month. What did surprise me was that the diet did so much damage to his internal organs so quickly. Spurlock's blood pressure shot up, he began to show signs of liver damage, and all of his blood tests frightened his doctor so much that he told him to go to the emergency room if he should begin to experience shooting pains in the middle of the night.Actually, Spurlock's experiment doesn't take up probably more than half the film. A large part of the documentary is spent talking about the state of nutrition in America, focusing particularly on the food served in the public schools. He visits several typical public schools in which kids can order anything they want at the cafeteria, have ready access to candy and soda via vending machines in the halls, and have greatly reduced physical education classes due to budget constraints and, although not mentioned, quite probably the greater emphasis on teaching to the standardized tests that students have to take in most states that takes up a great deal of school time. For contrast, Spurlock visits a school in Wisconsin for troubled kids in which organic food is served and notes that the behavior problems in these children is vastly reduced, most likely the result of this diet. This part of the film really made me think. I'm almost fifty, and when I was a child in public school we had to eat a balanced diet if we ordered one from the cafeteria, had limited access to desserts, and had no vending machines. There were no soft drinks served at lunch - only milk, iced tea, and water. Finally, we had daily P.E. classes in which we all had a period of mandatory calisthenics. I also remember that obese children were a rarity, and now if you look around they seem to be everywhere. Spurlock doesn't limit himself to examining the health habits of children, though. He also points out how the portion sizes in restaurants have grown tremendously and so have the waistlines of adults. Spurlock does come across one very interesting human oddity of an exception that proves the rule. This fellow has been eating an average of three Big Macs a day for years, is obviously in at least his late 30's or maybe even 40's, and is as thin as a rail. I'd love to find out if this behavior ever catches up with him.Basically, Spurlock's experiment on himself is used as a kind of Frankenstein horror tale to hold your interest while he talks about the crisis brewing in America from a combination of bad eating habits and greatly reduced physical activity. He doesn't seem to have any answers, though. People have to work longer hours to pay the bills, giving little time for exercise and home-cooked meals, and public education budgets have gotten tighter. The high price of housing has meant people with families live further from the center of cities in order to find affordable homes in safe neighborhoods and thus spend more time in traffic and less time walking. Since Spurlock himself is living the life of a single guy in New York City with no family pressures and can walk to the office every day, he would probably have a difficult job seeing that for many people just recognizing this problem isn't enough to solve it. However, it is a start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How this movie became so popular will always be a mystery to me. I could go on and on about why this"experiment" is stupid, but I can't imagine I would be saying anything that 1,000 other people before me have not already said. Perhaps some good came out of this film as maybe it pointed out that fast food is not healthy to someone somewhere on the planet who did not already know that? Maybe it persuaded several people to choose Subway over McDonald's? But for me and what is probably 99.99% of the population, this was not new information, just some guy looking for fame through a "do-gooder's" experiment. Sure, it's good to know that fast food is bad for you, but seeing this movie is like seeing a movie about why 2 + 2 = 4. It's a fact everyone knows.For a serious documentary about food, see "Food Inc." instead.For a not so serious look at practically the same common sense lesson, watch The Whitest Kids U Know sketch, "Super Size Me, with Whisky".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Appetitizing, Anti-Fast Food Documentary That Isn't Entirely Objective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentary films often qualify as freeze-dried exercises in persuasion that masquerades as extended news stories. Freshman filmmaker Morgan Spurlock struck a chord with his 2004 documentary "Super Size Me" about the health hazards of fast food. No, Spurlock was not the first to sound the alarm about fast food. Eric Schlosser's non-fiction book "Fast Food Nation," published in 2001, was the first to investigate the fast food industry. The "Atlantic Monthly" magazine correspondent chronicled the insidious growth of the fast food industry in America. Ultimately, not only did Schlosser argue that America boasts the highest obesity rate of any industrial nation, but he also attributes this obesity to fast food. Mind you, nobody has proved beyond a doubt that fast food paves the way to obesity. Nevertheless, Schlosser writes, "it seems wherever America's fast food chains go, waistlines inevitably start expanding." Indeed, Spurlock seems to have perused Schlosser's book. He spouts similar information and covers the changes in American society that Schlosser document. Once upon a time the mother of the household cooked all the meals in her kitchen that a family ate until fast food began to exert an impact on middle-class America life. Thereafter,families began to dine out. Ironically, Spurlock's documentary about McDonalds surpasses the surprisingly lightweight film adaptation that eventually appeared about "Fast Food Nation." Although the film "Fast Food Nation" contains the basic ideas espoused in the book, the film lacks the personable compelling quality of "Super Size Me." Recently, in his film "Fat Head" (2009), comedian Tom Naughton challenged Spurlock's thesis that fast food is bad food. Naughton's film serves as a rebuttal to Spurlock's "Super Size Me." Whereas Spurlock gained almost twenty-five pounds on a month-long McDonald's diet, Naughton lost 12 pounds on a similar McDonald's diet.The best and the worst about "Super Size Me" can be traced back to writer, producer, and director Morgan Spurlock. Spurlock graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in film from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 1993. Before he wrote, produced and directed "Super Size Me," Spurlock penned plays and his play "The Phoenix" won awards at both the New York International Fringe Festival in 1999 and the Route 66 American Playwriting Competition in 2000. He maintains interest throughout his 100 minute documentary chiefly by exploiting himself as a guinea pig for his indictment of fast food in general as well as McDonalds specifically. Spurlock is an affable, often amusing fellow who fearlessly hurls himself into this project and he makes sure that you feel sympathetic toward him. He makes himself seem believable because everything that takes place happens to him. When Spurlock is not addressing the audience, he performs the equivalent of "60 Minutes" interviews that he places as a counterpoint to his own story. Most of the people that Spurlock interviewed have something to do with obesity and medicine so the interviews are pertinent and the authorities interviewed are intelligent. Interspersed throughout Spurlock's story and the interviews are clever graphics. Spurlock serves all this information up with obvious humor. "Super Size Me" is not dead serious. Nevertheless, Spurlock generates some drama about his condition with his girlfriend and his medical authorities, all of whom are concerned that he is doing irreparable harm to his body. Consequently, McDonald's amounts to a villain, but McDonald's executives had nothing to do with the making of "Super Size Me." "Super Size Me" chronicles a 30-day time period (from February to March 2003) when Spurlock ate nothing but McDonald's food. During that period, we watch the effects the dining on McDonald's has on Spurlock's physical and psychological health, while he investigates the fast food industry's corporate influence, primarily how McDonald's and others promote poor nutrition for its own profit. Spurlock ate at McDonald's restaurants three times per day and tried every item on the chain's menu in nine days. Whenever he was given the option to "super-size" a meal, Spurlock agreed to have his order "super-sized." Consequently, he treated himself to the equivalent of 9.26 Big Macs) a day. Eventually, the 32-year-old Spurlock added 24? lbs., a 13% body mass increase, a cholesterol level of 230, and suffered mood swings, sexual dysfunction, and liver damage. Spurlock spent fourteen months losing the weight gained from his experiment."Super Size Me" garnered an Academy Award nomination for best documentary, but it did not win in that category. Nevertheless, the success of "Super Size Me" is that it compelled McDonald's to abandon their campaign to persuade customers to buy more food as a part of their diet, but it also paved the way for Spurlock to produce more documentaries. Spurlock's later documentaries have neither been as successful as "Super Size Me" nor have they been as provocative. Interestingly, when "Super Size Me" came out as a DVD, Spurlock added a brief epilogue about McDonald's decision to drop the Super Size option six weeks after the premiere of the film. Since then McDonalds has created a menu that includes supposedly healthier items on its menu, such as salads, and a new adult happy meal. Unfortunately, these salads pack even more calories than the hamburgers, if the customer adds liberal amounts of cheese and dressing. Naturally, McDonald's claimed that "Super Size Me" did not influence the fast food titan to make these menu alterations."Super Size Me" is amusing, insightful, but not entirely objective documentary.</fullReview>

I really would not recommend you doing any of the things that Morgan does in the film because of the risk of heart failure and Diabetes.I personally think that what Morgan does in the film is simply fantastic.If he pukes up the food he ate or has a really bad stomach ache, he is actually willing to keep going.If only Michael Moore did something like this.Overall thought:This is a very well done documentary that has many things to offer: Entertainment, facts on different kinds of diseases and how to avoid them, and the bravery and courage that Morgan went through to make this movie.Well done.I'd have to give 'Super Size Me' two quarter pounders up.(The quarter pounders represent thumbs in case you don't know.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eat It To Death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock tries to find the answer to why the Mcdonalds' corporate, food-like substance has such a stranglehold on our Neanderthal tastebuds, in his diabolically insightful SUPER SIZE ME, a documentary of an experiment on his own innards - to eat nothing but McDonalds' food for thirty days to note its effect on him, physically and psychologically.Spurlock sets Rules for himself. Besides the Zeroth Law of exclusively McDonalds for 30 days, he: #1. will only Super Size when asked. #2. can only eat food from McDonalds, water included. #3. has to eat everything on the menu at least once. #4. must eat three meals a day. But SUPER SIZE ME is not simply a clinical annotating of one man's personable and engaging take on the putrefaction of his innards. It is as informative as it is entertaining. It is as funny as it is indicting. Not only does Spurlock bring in nutritionists, doctors and other professionals to scientifically monitor his health before, during and after his experiment, he also delves into every aspect of junk food in American society. From mega-corporations psychologically entrapping kids from a young age with their clowns, playgrounds and Happy Meals, to the physical addiction brought about by additives and flavorings, to exploring school menus and phys-ed programs. Spurlock eats only of the McDonalds poisons, but all fast food chains and junk food companies are targeted in his research and observations. As expected, the most advertised foods are the most consumed foods. And advertising budgets for the junk and candy industries overwhelm the health food industry budget like a fat chick on a cupcake. He interviews everyone up and down the fast food spectrum, from corporate monkeys who get entrapped in their own duplicity, to lawyers involved in food industry lawsuits, to people on the street, some of whom wouldn't know a treadmill if they fell off one. He even uncovers that no layperson knows what a "calorie" is - amazing, considering we all see it on the sides of food packaging and use it to measure how much of that food we shouldn't eat. Spurlock gets clarification from Marion Nestle PhD MPH (Chair of Nutrition and Food Studies NYC): "A calorie is the measure of the energy content of food... one calorie is the amount of energy that's needed to raise the temperature of a liter of water by one degree centigrade."On Day 2 - he pukes. A third of the way through a Super Sized lunch, Spurlock realizes just how insane the quantity of food is - but for the sake of the experiment, he must force it down. and it comes back up. Unintentionally funny, but proves a grim point: Spurlock is a reasonably healthy guy - his girlfriend Alexandra is a vegetarian cook - and just one day of forcing this radioactive garbage down his throat caused his body to reject it; now think of the large part of the population who routinely ingest this glop, and the words of Kelly Brownell PhD (Eating and Weight Disorders), don't seem far-fetched: "We live in a toxic food environment... that almost guarantees we become sick." Phil Lawler, a phys-ed teacher in Illinois: "We've never had health care in this country. We've only had sick care." (Truth that the pharmaceutical companies in America will never admit to; truth that keeps governments in Big Pharm's pocket 'til death do they part - our death).Luckily, Spurlock likes the food - as we all do, for its chemical induction of our buds - but its effect on his health becomes so adverse that his MD, Daryl Isaacs, advises him off the McDiet for fear of actual death. They never admitted that SUPER SIZE ME influenced or affected their business model, but it is no secret that congruent with this film's release, McDonalds Corp introduced many "health" foods to its menu - salads and various hippie dishes - targeting greenies and vegetarians and worried parents. The sea change didn't just overwhelm McDonalds - the whole fast food industry overhauled its aspect towards "health" and "nutrition." --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

They really need people like you who apparently believe nutrition is a myth, the people who gave this movie a 1/10 apparently think that all you need is exercise and the food that you eat is irrelevant.Every good bodybuilder factors in nutrition and doesn't just exercise well stuffing trash in their mouth because they would get no results either way, they wouldn't get fat or built. They would most certainly get sick from all the hard work it takes to process the trash they are consuming though...One thing that detractors have said often is: "Any jackass will become sick if they eat the same anything every day, three times a day, for one month." People in Africa live off of 90% brown rice right now and before a thousand years ago countless people lived off of mostly bread with a small amount of vegetables...The reason you cannot live on McDonalds is it poisonous trash that causes cancer, obesity, and heart disease. Besides that to make this form of processed foods you have lose almost 10 times the calories you had originally in the process. Not to mention the electricity and other things wasted in making what is essentially a poison. All for the profit of McDonalds at the expense of common people.All he is doing is representing the facts and quite simply McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, Pizza Hut are all devastating to an individuals health and I can speak from past experience. It is fortunate that many people have came out of this movie recognizing that they will never eat fast food again and even McDonalds and others responded by adding more healthy options. This is all good.What we need is exactly what he suggests in the beginning for minutes, for people to have meals cooked at their homes like he had when he was young. Fast food is devastating to these peoples health and you cannot trust corporate tyrannies to take good care of you. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Size Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2004, a man named Morgan Spurlock decided to explore the fast food industry's corporate influence on our society's health, fitness, and overall physical well being by conducting an experiment. He came to the decision that he would limit himself to only eating food from McDonald's for thirty days. His inspiration came from a court case where two teenage girls attempted to sue the fast food industry for making them obese. The judges ruled that they did not have enough evidence to prove that the fast food company was to blame, so they lost. Spurlock was motivated to prove that these companies were in face to blame for much of the world's obesity, so project "Supersize Me" began. Spurlock focused on a few specific concepts when tackling this project. He did an excellent job at pointing out the obvious arguments of nutrition, but went further into looking more in depth at the court cases to see if it were even logical to sue them for their obesity. Then he looked at the fast food industry's affects on this world through their advertising, focusing in mostly on children. Finally he researched the addictiveness of fast food, and how it truly can be as harmful as drugs.For more of my review, go to:http://www.appstate.edu/~grimmettct/fys/film_review/film_review.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Well Rounded Documentary With Unbiased Presentation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was Going through a lot of the negative reviews on this film, and ALL of the ones i read were keen to focus on maybe only 1 or 2 ideological flaws with the way it was presented and ignore everything else. In truth, going on a sudden McDonald's binge after eating mostly healthy low fat vegetarian style food, physiologically does not prove much. He clearly had a strong anti fast food message that he wanted to get across, and he realized that it needed to have a certain WOW factor, in order to get any public appeal, for without his little experiment, it would have pretty much been nothing more than an educational film that you might show at a weight watchers convention. If this was able to shock and wow a few airheads into running in fear from McDonald's, who cant think, analyse facts, or educate themselves, then hats off to him. The film contained a lot of very good information, and to all of those who hated it, he provided reliable and concise statistics, unlike propagandists like Michael Moore. It doesn't matter if you think a documentary about poverty is more relevant, or that you think it's obvious that fast food is unhealthy, or that you think it is the parents fault, not McDonald's, or that people should exercise their own free will, or that processed foods help aid impoverished kids. Everyone knows why processed food exists; because it's cheap to make and easy to prepare and the film merely asks the questions, why do we feed ourselves with cheap food and pay good money for people to prepare food within seconds rather than cook a proper meal especially at most schools as shown in the film.What the film does, is explain in depth how corporations like McDonald's function and shows quite convincingly how they are able to root themselves in the minds of people far more successfully than even religion. The film as a whole is an examination of American society and it is not overly biased, as shown by the scene of the 2 fit young black men who say they love McDonald's and that they're fit cause they exercise.This film does not blame McDonald's exclusively, and does a very good job at looking at the entire spectrum of the issue, though it brings serious light on the practices of Macdonalds and all corporations which is a necessary thing. If you criticize this film over just one single direction it pursues, you have no point whatsoever. Anyone who did not like this film simply had no interest in the subject, and therefore has no business commenting on it. Frankly though it is a good film and successful in what it set out to do, I don't consider it to be particularly worth seeing a second time, which is why it's a good documentary but nothing ground breaking, though it is DEFINITELY not inane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Size Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J.G. Moss Freshman Seminar 12-2-08 "Super Size Me""Super Size Me" is a documentary film produced, edited, directed, and staring Morgan Spurlock. The documentary focuses on the impact the fast food industry is making in the health of Americans, the main target in the film, McDonalds. The film starts with an introduction to Mr. Spurlock and a brief description of his lifestyle and then dives in to his plan to eat nothing but McDonalds for thirty days and see its effect on the human body. Shortly afterwards, the viewer is filled with more information on this giant food chain than ever thought imaginable. Then the film captivates the viewer and takes them along for the ride as Morgan nearly kills himself in this bizarre experiment.The documentary immediately captures the audience with its use of bright colors and interesting plot. Morgan Spurlock narrates the entire movie, going against the traditional documentary style of monotones and thus a theatrical qualude. The controversial aspect of the film is also a major component in grasping the attention of the viewer. Calling out one of the largest international corporations in the world as being a justified killer is not something seen in the movies every day.The audio is one part of this film which I particularly found very effective. There were a few songs that were recognizable from the top of the charts, but the majority of the film was inlaid with very strange but catchy music that pertained to the subject. I had never before heard a song focusing on the eating habits of Americans or the weight gain attributed to eating McDonalds and other fast foods. Having no information on the origin of some of these soundtracks, I wouldn't be surprised to discover many of the songs in the films were created specifically for this documentary.The primary style of filming used in the documentary are interview and traditional third party perspective showing some of the elements of the filming in the final edit. The interviewing portions of the film are intended to be either informative or to show the somewhat harsh reality of the world we live in through some unexpected reactions and statements made. Shooting in a third party perspective allowed the viewer to get a sense that the film was real rather than some fabrication intended to persuade the masses. Towards the end of the film Morgan begins to have serious health issues and the decision of whether or not to continue filming is included in the final production so as to add to this level of reality.Overall the film was very entertaining while at the same time extremely informative. I had heard a great deal of positive criticism prior to my viewing of the documentary, and I must admit that the film far exceeded my already high expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Size Me is a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentary Review I had heard a lot about the documentary film Super Size Me, but I was not prepared for what I saw when I actually sat down to watch this film. I had no idea what impact eating McDonalds for 30 days would have on the Producer/Director/Star Morgan Spurlock.This documentary is focused on the unhealthy and addictive characteristics of the McDonalds fast food restaurant, and any other fast food restaurant in general. Morgan Spurlock is the individual who decided to put his body through 30 days of eating nothing but McDonalds' food for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. Within the first day or two of his experiment, he already threw up his Super Size cheeseburger, fries, and soda. I forgot to mention the fact that whenever the employee asks if he would like to Super Size the meal, he had to say "yes." Spurlock had a team of doctors monitoring his body throughout the experiment; before he started, the doctors took blood samples and did complete body examinations. Spurlock was above average for his age in physical fitness, and he had no health concerns whatsoever. However, throughout his new diet, his liver gradually started to turn to fat, and he was at a serious health risk. All of his doctors advised Spurlock to quit his McDonald's diet, but he prevailed; he even became addicted to the greasy, fatty food, which made it even harder to stop eating it. It took Spurlock 14 months to lose the 25 pounds he gained during this experiment, but he proved his point in saying that fast food is definitely not healthy food.Spurlock was a very creative director because he took a lot of different elements and molded them together to create a great documentary. I loved how the movie starts out with a listing of statistics that are accompanied by witty cartoon drawings. It adds something different to the film rather than just showing Spurlock eating the McDonalds' meals. I also loved how he filmed people on the street, asking them how often they eat fast food and what they thought a calorie is. However, I did think that the types of people Spurlock interviewed added an element of bias. Most of the people Spurlock interviewed about fast food and how often they eat it were overweight people. He might have done it on purpose so he could further underline his point of how eating fast food causes bad health, but he should have interviewed a more different variety of people.I also liked the way he shot the film. It was shot in a way that the viewer could feel like they were right there with him; they showed the doctors talking from Spurlock's point-of-view, and then we see Spurlock from the doctor's point-of-view. When Spurlock is in his car ordering McDonalds, the viewer feels as if they are right there in the passenger's seat. He also used a great camera angle on the 28th day of eating McDonalds; he angled the camera to where it was focused on the food as he walked up the stairs of his apartment building. He was commenting on how it was so hard to walk up the stairs, and the fact that the camera was focused on the McDonalds meal during this slyly hints that McDonalds is the cause.The other great thing that Spurlock did was to include interviews with experts and other people who understand the fact that America is going through a health crisis. He talked with the former Surgeon General, the heir to the Baskin Robbins Company, lawyers suing fast food corporations, and many others. These interviews were great because the viewer got to see other facts and opinions from other people who have spent their whole lives studying this topic. I personally enjoyed hearing from the son of one of the founders of Baskin Robbins; he saw his father and uncle have serious health issues due to the fact that they ate ice cream so much. He also suffered from the effects of eating too much unhealthy food, so he could talk about what he felt, which further underlined Spurlock's main point. Another great element added to this film was the use of music. If you listened to the words in the songs chosen, they seemed to go along great with whatever image was being shown on the screen. This adds fun and more entertainment to the documentary.This film does not relate to his other film; it is of an entirely different topic. His other film in entitled Where in the World is Osama Bin Laden, and he received mostly negative reviews from it. This documentary dealt with terrorism, and he viewed it from both sides, which is most likely the reason why is got such negative reviews. He also has a television show called 30 Days; in this show, Spurlock switches lives with someone for 30 days. The 30 days theme is also apparent in Super Size Me, which is probably where he got his inspiration from to do the television show.Spurlock did a great job with this documentary, and he really got his point across to America, and the many fast food restaurants we are so well known for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Legimate Reasons Why I Don't Eat Out Often</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>believe it or not, I was one of the growing numbers of kids who became fat as a child of the 1990's. Besides a diet high in processed and fattening foods and a sedentary lifestyle, my love affair with fast food and dining out contributed to my obesity. Since losing nearly 45 pounds through joining a health club and eating a relatively low-carb diet for over a year, I currently eat out less often, let alone eat out mostly on vacation.Morgan Spurlock's shocking yet informative documentary, SUPER SIZE ME, further impelled me to eat more meals at home. The presenter himself traded his girlfriend's vegan dining for food and items merchandised through the largest fast food chain in the world, McDonald's, for 30 straight days. As a result, he gained 25 pounds, had NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, as a result of the excess refined carbs from that outrageous diet regimen), and was impotent, just to name but three consequent health problems he obtained afterward.Besides Spurlock's dietary trek, the documentary focuses on how McDonald's marketing schemes affect children (They couldn't recognize Jesus Christ when the host runs through a cognition picture test.), how some government sanctions of today contributed to childhood obesity (for example, the No Child Left Behind Act), and how obesity affects the body. (The consequences are listed in a nutshell through illustrations covering a McDonald's.) But the most compelling part for me is when an overweight teenage girl laments about her self-esteem, for she would never live up to the photos of thin (often bare-bellied) women and young adults, whose photo clippings conceal her as she complains about her appearance.Although there is some profanity and some sacrilegious themes involved, this is a documentary worth whether you're a parent of an obese child, a children's health advocate like me, or a PE coach. There is also a Educationally Enhanced DVD edition if you want a cleaner version of the film. This is best viewed with a portioned amount of air-popped popcorn or crudits with hummus on hand or even better - while exercising on a bike or treadmill.This deserves a decent 9/10 stars, just for the PG-13ness of the film's nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super Size Me looks objective to me,but not just this is the only reason why I wanted to write about it.Morgan Spurlock was personally the object of the danger.And he investigated how,and why fast food is dangerous in bigger dose.Just a fact:Morgan mostly talking about the facts with the consultation of health care specialists,lawyers,and with some,important company first liner persons.Morgan risking he's own health,and life,just to prove how dangerous is fast food.I think I'am objective,when I saying this like a fact,cause IMDb-user-ratings is still higher than 6.0.about this film Most of people agree with me,when I saying what Morgen did,as an experiment,that was very dangerous.But this problem is not just a problem of the United States,but most of fast food portions sell-ed in the United States.At the end Morgan wanted to say(with the party at the fast food bar)it's not a death sentence when you eat sometimes at fast food bars,but please think it about it what happened with Morgan,while he was an object of this experiment.Note:your health is not just yours,if you have family,or friends.And your health is depends,how you live(and eat) your life.9/10-absolute worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One word describes this movie: WOW!Super Size Me is by far one of the best and most helpful documentaries of all time. Morgan Spurlock was very brave to try something that no human on the planet had thought of before, eating nothing but McDonald's for breakfast, lunch and dinner for an entire month!Although, the challenge seemed easy at first, but it began getting ugly on just the second day. Morgan couldn't keep down his first super size meal, and unexpectedly and dramatically vomited it and everything else in his stomach up on the pavement of a McDonalds parking lot. On the next day he begins getting to get funny sensations in parts of his body and developed stomach pains. After a week his chest began to bother him. A week after that, his heart began to give him trouble. When the super size test is finally over with, Morgan finds out he would have died if he continued eating McDonalds in this pattern. His liver was nearly wiped out. Who would have that a simple burger, fries a and 40 ounce Coca-Cola could be so harmful for your health!This film has changed the way we look at fast food and movies. Although it is a film of a serious tone, there are a couple of laugh out loud scenes. There are some scenes that viewers may disgusting and intense which are questionable for children to view. However, kids need to see this film with their families and at school, because it can encourage them to make healthy food choices when looked at properly! So don't be afraid to rent or purchase it! Trust me, even thought the faint hearted will have a tough time viewing this, they can benefit from it too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but biased view of American eating habits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spurlock definitely drives the point across that the fast food industry - well, the American food industry in general - is pure crap.However, I would have loved to have seen some insight from respected scientists such as Betty Martini and Mary Enig. However, Martini's and Enig's pro-saturated fats and anti-soy stances would have been contrary to Spurlock's message of "fat is bad" and Spurlock's vegan lifestyle, so naturally their views would not have been welcome in this film unless they were to have been lumped in with Big Food. (It should be noted that there are a multitude of documented research that suggests that soy may actually cause cancer.) I also noticed in the film Margo Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest was also in the film. I respect CSPI in some ways for the information that they put out, however from my research I have discovered that CSPI also engages in some disinformation - especially their "The Truth About Trans" article from the March 1988 Nutrition Action newsletter - which really disappoints me, and some other CSPI stances disappoint me. CSPI prides itself in being nicknamed the "food police," but that doesn't stop CSPI from receiving biotech funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to pimp for Monsanto's genetically-modified foods and Monsanto's rBGH growth hormone in cow milk - both of which are by the way fully endorsed by Big Food's front group, the Center for Consumer Freedom. CCF's website is full of "anti-organic" and "pro-GMO" propaganda.I respect Spurlock for putting out an entertaining film. However, I do wish that he had put out a more thorough message which would have exposed all of the "dirty players in the game." But I guess I have to be satisfied with the information that he put out, and I am satisfied with what he put out. I just hope that sometime in the future he expands on "Super Size Me" with more thorough research, investigation, and information.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie in my health class and I was honestly sick to see Morgan eat Three MCdonalds in one day...And then he threw up on the second day. Later that day I didn't order MCdonalds anymore and spend more time outside.But let's agree....30 days of eating nothing but Mcdonalds is almost mentally impossible! Most Americans would stop at day 3 or at most 11. But Morgan spend A MONTH eating Fat, Suger, and nothing else! This film is certainly on the gross level and shows a fair side of things. And Morgan spurlock is excellent in showing how things are going in the Fast food industry.You may say that MCdonalds is being leaned on too much...but when you go out to get Fast food, what food comes to your mind first? I thought so.The Film is great for kids like me and is worth watching. But if your a fat guy or ' Obese' then I suggest you watch this film with caution...it really is gross.Agree with me or not with this, You can certainly say that Morgan spurlock did a brave thing.5/5</fullReview>

People fighting with their weight, poverty (fast food is tasty and cheap), eating problems (why do you need food to console you)and destroyed health, not to mention pollution like "fatists", need a healthy, not too strict diet and some light exercise.

		<shortDescription>A bold experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Practically everyone knows that fast food is unhealthy. But often we are unable to put it into scope for a big picture. Super Size Me is a documentary about fast food, namely the McDonalds franchise. The director, Morgan Spurlock, dedicates himself to discover the truth about a fast food diet by carrying out an experiment. He vows to only eat things off the McDonalds menu for a month. He sure has guts.Spurlock also travels throughout the country to carry out interviews about food, lifestyles, and business. There are loads of horrific details that I never bothered to think about before. It is sad to see the trash that most school cafeterias around the United States feed students (even I could relate to some of this at my University). Occasionally, some optimistic counter movements are revealed. For the previous case, an Appleton, Wisconsin school is shown serving healthy food based on a different program. But overall, it comes down to the question: why do we do this to ourselves?Numerous facts are thrown around, most of them simply astounding. While there is plenty of interesting material about the general fast food industry, I think the most fascinating results came from Spurlock's personal experiment. The change in his body is more than significant. How he was able to get through it beats me (although Don Gorske, record holder of most Big Macs eaten, still tops it).The experiment was not complete, as there are some unrealistic factors. But it gave a clear result that made me feel a little sick. Sadly, there are some people who have a lifestyle comparable to this. Not everyone can be blamed for their physical state, but the vast majority of people should know better.The fact that fast food was unhealthy is by no means a surprise, but the documentary was able to put things into perspective. It succeeds both on an individual and national scale. As much as it left me disgusted, I enjoyed watching it and learned a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I expected this to be some nasty, disgusting movie that would prevent me from eating Mcdonalds ever ever again. Well I was half right but even though it was nasty and disgusting, it was weirdly entertaining. I was afraid that it was gross me out too much but it really didn't besides a few of the surgeries and stuff. Yeah I didn't eat Mcdonalds for about 4 weeks after this...or eat pretty much any fast food in general. Anyways, good little documentary, definitely serves its purpose and changed many people's view on fast food. Plus like I said it's actually pretty entertaining along the way, so I recommend Super Size Me, even though the idea of eating Mcdonalds for every meal of the day for a month is a little outrageous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today in the whole world you can enter in McDonald's restaurant and order some junk food that you'll eat in 5 minutes and then you'll go on with your work. In todays society only thing that matters is money and people are chasing it. I'm not talking here about this movie or about America, I'm talking about the facts.So Morgan Spurlock decided to answer on question why are Americans fat. It is very obvious why but Americans clearly needed this movie to open their eyes. They needed movie because that's the only way they'll watch something. When they are in their sofa and drinking Coke.This movie is about Americans and McDonald's but actually it's a tribute to all people who are living this kind of life. Do you think that in Europe there aren't any McDonald's? Boy, you're wrong, there are so many of them that this way of eating is presented as the easiest. McDonald's is like a plague to a modern man. And not only McDonald. I was surprised when I heard so many names of this stores in America - like Burger King and all those others. I personally don't eat this junk food and I was in McDonald's eating for maybe three times in my life. How many Americans can say that? Do they even count?I don't blame those people for going on those places because todays way of living is fast and you have to adopt, but what I don't understand is why people are going there when they aren't on work? And also these people take their children there and then when they are all fat, they say that this is natural. What is natural in not taking care of yourself? It is time for all people around the world to open their eyes because tomorrow it could be too late and that is the purpose of this movie. Morgan Spurlock is brilliant and this movie should be watched by every man who feeds himself in unhealthy way. Here in Croatia there is still normal to have a lunch in real restaurant then in McDonald's. Will McDonald's take a lead? No, if you decide not to go there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie makes someone want to run away from fast food forever or run to the nearest McDonalds and eat every Big Mac that they have. Morgan Spurlock eats at McDonalds everyday for every meal for 30 days. We watch him gain weight, go through depression, mess up his liver and vomit up his fries. Even his girlfriend cannot stand it and begs him to stop but he keeps going to prove his point. He puts himself through this type of extreme eating just like a lot of American people do every day. I like the part where all the doctors beg him to stop eating McDonalds and in the next scene he is eating a quarter pounder. The fish sandwich scene was pretty gross as well.

		<fullReview>"McDonald's, McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and a Pizza Hut!" These are the lyrics kids are learning now, and they believe these are good restaurants to eat. This is one of the interesting facts that Morgan Spurlock presents in his documentary. The movie Super Size Me, produced and directed by Spurlock, is an award-winning documentary, including an Oscar nomination that shows viewers, by direct example, how fast-food affects the body. The documentary was inspired by a lawsuit against McDonald's, stating that two girls became overweight, according to medical standards, for eating at McDonald's. The lawsuit got dismissed because they could not prove to the judges that McDonald's made them overweight. So Morgan Spurlock decided to prove people the effect that eating at McDonald's, specifically, can have. He commits himself to a McDiet, eating only McDonald's for an entire month. Eating three square meals a day, trying everything on the menu at least once, and always super sizing if offered were the basic rules of the McDiet.Spurlock not only directed and produced, but also is its main character. He tries out this unprecedented experiment which keeps the audience more interested in how it is going to end. The film communicates convincingly well to the audience by showing real-life scenarios, like Spurlock's following the McDiet and visiting doctors to measure the changes his body makes during those thirty days. He also graphically emphasizes the negative effects of fast-food on the body and mind by throwing up, showing depression when not eating and then becoming energetic when consuming McDonald's. Spurlock also visits different cities, including Houston, where there is the most overweight people in America, to see personally the differences in the menus and the super sizing offers that are made to him at McDonald's. The style on the documentary is very effective, keeping the audience paying attention to effects on health that makes them realize how much money is spent on fast-food, and all the money spent on advertisements for unhealthful food against what is spent for the healthy ones. The average distance that a person walks in America is calculated, to make the documentary more convincing and showing realistic statistics.Something that can make people believe that we should not pay attention to this documentary is the question that Spurlock asks himself: Who eats at McDonald's three times a day every day? However, Spurlock explains that a high number of Americans eat at fast-food restaurants two or even three times a day, usually five days a week.The end of the experiment is very impacting by the numbers that the doctors he visits show, including the weight he gained, the rise in his cholesterol, and the damage done to internal organs of his body. The results do not seem manipulated because of the control of the doctors because they provide an objective view of the damage, which allows Spurlock to show the reality of the food America is consuming. Super Size Me allows American consumers of fast-food to realize the effects of the meals Americans choose to eat. Morgan Spurlock brings us 96 minutes of a truth that we have to face and be conscientious about changing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since Kurt and Courtney (1998) have I enjoyed a documentary so much.Everybody who likes junk food should see this. Heck, the whole world should see it anyway? It came from a disarmingly simple idea (and one that I wish I'd thought of): Morgan Spurlock had heard often that junk food was bad for you. Okay, why not put that premise to the test, and eat only Macdonalds food for a whole month. Thirty days. Seven hundred and twenty hours, or forty-three thousand two hundred minutes...Can you imagine that doing that? Not me ? I gave up eating at all ? yes, all ? fast food outlets in April 1977. And, I knew that if I started eating that poo food again, I'd be sick in a day and probably near death or dead already in a month. So, I take my hat off the Morgan Spurlock for going beyond the call of duty to prove, once and for all, that the type of fast food that most people eat will, in many cases, result in premature death.Look, on only the second day into his food fest, Morgan finished his Super Sized meal and then promptly vomits out the window of his car. Ohhhhh, YUCK! And all in glorious Technicolor or whatever they call it these days. In twelve days, Morgan adds seventeen pounds to his weight ? and his nutritionist, who's monitoring his downfall, begs him to stop drinking all that soda, for Pete's sake. By day 18, his health is definitely in grave decline and his GP also begs him to stop ? STOP ? this punishment to his body. On day 21, Morgan wakes at 2 a.m., unable to breath and with heart palpitations and further blood tests show serious deterioration in his liver, with a cholesterol count off the scale, almost. Hey, this Morgan guy is beginning to look like he should be awarded a Medal of Honour? By day 30, Morgan's put on nearly 25 pounds, and has eaten the same amount of junk food that the average person eats in EIGHT years! No wonder the poor guy felt sick...And, so will you, when you see it. Because you're gonna see it, right? And, after you do, you'll vow never to set foot inside one of those slaughterhouses again, will you? The film does a good job is showing how the food industry lobbies government to push fast food onto the kiddies; and, of course, the media comes for a lot of flak also, and rightly so. Even more interesting for me is that I know this version I saw had been seriously cut by the TV station I caught it on. Why? Well, in the DVD I saw two years ago, there was month long test of MacDonalds fries (which proved that they have zero nutritional value) in the film; and Morgan also met the most obese staff in USA at a particular MacDonalds (in San Diego, I think, but don't quote me). Neither of those events were in this TV version which just goes to show again how much influence advertisers have over the media.Having said all that, this is a fun film, despite the occasional coarse language (which you probably don't want your kiddies to hear) and graphic medical procedures (which the kiddies might find funny anyway). But, overall, it's a stark indictment of the power of business and government working together to promote ill-health and reap obscene profits...and with no end in sight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2002, Michael Moore directed the Oscar-winning Bowling a Columbine, an exhilarating and at the same time terrifying reflection on America's relationship with firearms. Two years later, Morgan Spurlock came up with Super Size Me, which analyzes another US "problem": fast food. What makes the two movies so different is the angle from which the directors approached the topics: while Moore relied on interviews, archive footage and his own irony to convey a powerful message, Spurlock decided to try something new.Having read of a lawsuit filed against McDonald's, which got accused of causing two teenage girls'obesity, Spurlock ignored the protests of his vegan girlfriend and thought it might be a good idea to personally verify if fast food is unhealthy. After some meticulous health controls and other preparations, he unveiled his plan: for thirty days he would eat only at McDonald's. Since some people have all their meals there, why shouldn't he? All he would have to do was follow three rules:1. He could only pick the Super Size option if asked to;2. He could only eat and drink McDonald's products, including the water;3. He had to eat every single item on the menu at least once.The film chronicles Spurlock's painstaking journey as he travels through the USA and keeps eating hamburgers and French fries (most of the time in the car, so that people won't complain about his crew filming him). As the days pass, his "diet" starts to affect him seriously, causing doctors and friends to worry. Regardless of their concerns, he decides to continue until the end.Knowing two hours of just him getting fat would have been boring, Spurlock wisely inter-cuts the various stages of his physical decay with context-giving interviews, in which experts give their opinions on why fast food is so popular and how it keeps seducing people despite the fact that its negative effects are publicly known. These inter-cuts are insightful, but they also show Spurlock's main flaw: unlike the more experienced Moore, he doesn't know how to use his material to entertain and simultaneously shock the audience. Some bits are very funny, some are quite upsetting, but there isn't one scene that will make you laugh and wince in the same moment. Spurlock also seriously challenges the viewer's patience (and stomach) by showing some pretty graphic surgery footage involving a man so obese an operation was the only way to save his life. That part would work in a Cronenberg movie, whereas its presence in this film is less justifiable.Nonetheless, Super Size Me is a good, thought-provoking film. It lacks the emotional power of similarly themed documentaries, but the director's "masochistic" film-making style makes it worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really fun to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a man named Morgan Spurlock who decides to eat nothing but Mcdonald's for 30 days to see how much it will effect his health. He has three doctors monitor his health the whole time. He is 6'2 weighs 185 pounds and has 11 percent body fat which is really good shape if you ask me. During the thirty days he talks with a guy from Texas who has eaten 185 big macs however he is a pretty skinny guy. Spurlock also visits several different high schools to show all of the junk food that is served and shows that the people mostly get food packaged and don't cook most of it themselves. Other info is that he gained 27 pounds altogether and shows that only seven items on the Mcdonald's have no sugar. If you like documentaries than you should go rent this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original, interesting, enjoyable - Super Size Me is a great doc!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to eat nothing but McDonalds for a whole month? It may sound like a fun prospect, but in this documentary, it becomes something truly scary that may even put you off fast food completely. Over the course of 30 days, we follow one ordinary man - Morgan Spurlock - as he eats nothing but McDonalds, and the results are quite scary to behold. We follow him through his journey as he deteriorates and travels across the country - Super Size Me is two hours that has a lot to tell. But this isn't all about just food - if it was, it just wouldn't be taken seriously. So Spurlock sets out across the US to investigate the problems of fast food and lack of exercise, and reveals some shocking truths along the way. What is good about Super Size Me is that it used several cases to point out everything that is wrong with the world of fast food and lack of exercise - schools, city streets, expert opinions - rather than blaming a single tree for everything that's wrong with the wood. And after seeing this doc, I had a lot to think about. I still eat McDonalds to this day, but Super Size Me has helped me understand a lot more about what this food really is, and how much it can affect you. Spurlock did this experiment so you don't have to - even if facts and figures don't float your boat, this still makes for a riveting watch that will teach you more about one of modern society's biggest flaws - health. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This fast-food mentality is applying to every aspect of our lives. Pay your bills fast, no more queues, pick up a language in just a month, eat this noodle in just 2 minutes, everything is fast, fast and faster. That's what's happening to our food. It's no longer food, it's a chunk of chemically processed non-fatal meat passed off as food in our fast food. So many kids DO NOT know this. People think that as long as you don't eat it everyday, that's fine. They're missing the point. As long as there is a demand, there will be supply. You have no idea what the food does to our body so I suggest getting the DVD, which was what I did, and watch the extras packed in the DVD so that you can see more of what was done and more experiments and interview with the author of "Fast Food Nation". I hope that more people will take this movie seriously and not dismiss it as an extreme case of eating a man eating macdonalds dangerously. I bought the DVD for my younger siblings and they have started expressing disgust in fast food and started adopted a healthier diet. If only educators started airing this to their students.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something that all Fast Food Eaters should watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fast Food is one of the biggest/richest industries in the food chain. McDonalds can be found across the globe and hungry customers order their burgers everyday, week, month and year. But the fact is fast food isn't the best way to eat.In early 2000's there's an estimate of an ever growing population of fat people in America than any leading country. Health experts and nutritionists are taking action in putting some sense into this issue.Morgan Spurlock, a filmmaker, has learned that McDonald's is being sued for making people obese. So he decides to do a film experiment on what would happen if you eat McDonalds for an entire month. In other words anything he eats has to come from McDonalds. From Breakfast, Lunch, to Dinner.In the film we see Morgan travels to a McDonalds from state to state. Eating their brand food, and doing research on the after effects on eating the stuff by keeping a record on his weight, blood sugar, cholesterol, etc. This experiment is unhealthy and risky, but Morgan is willing to prove on the false and true matter on McDonald's fast food.In the movie, you'll also see interviews with many fast food spokesmen, experts, nutritionists, doctors, teachers, people on the states, employees, students, and even people who do like fast food. It has plenty of detail on why Fast Food isn't too healthy to have. And it can change the way you think about you're own eating habits.All in all, it's a must see documentary in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm coming at this movie at a different angle than most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people have trashed this movie as an attempt to ruin the McDonald's fast-food chain. I can't get inside Morgan Spurlock's head, so I really can't say exactly what he was trying to accomplish. I guess I saw this movie more as a wake-up call for myself than anything else. I don't eat poorly but I also haven't always eaten well, and I've recently seen friends and family die (at a young age, too) because of diseases related to not eating well. So after I saw "Super Size Me" I think I've figured out that I need to make a conscious effort to eat better. I didn't come out of this movie thinking that I should blame McDonald's; if I eat too much McDonald's, that's my own fault. As for the movie itself, it had the feel of being a little scripted -- I just have a tough time believing he actually lost weight one week without going off his all-McDonald's diet at some point, something must have happened there behind the scenes. But I think this movie was a good wake-up call. It's generally entertaining throughout, not dreadfully boring like most documentaries. So as long as you're willing to look at the mirror and evaluate your own eating habits, and not use "Super Size Me" as a crutch to blame McDonald's for all of the health problems in your life, this is a good take. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since congress passed the "Cheeseburger Bill" which states that you cannot sue McDonald's (or any other fast-food establishment) for making you fat, here's my take: If "Super Size Me" caused McDonald's business to suffer in any way, shape or form, no way can they sue Morgan Spurlock for making this movie. No where in this film does he ever say, "Don't eat McDonald's food". What DOES he say? "I ate McDonald's food for 30 days &amp; this is what happened to me." "You be the judge". 'Nuff said. What is your view on this documentary? If you want to eat this food, do so, but you cannot place blame on any one person or thing. If we do away with fast foods entirely, (which won't happen). people will still get obese &amp; unhealthy by going to the supermarket! I think this problem got it's roots in 1954 when McDonald's started out. Back in those days, nutrition was relatively unheard of. Since then, EVERY single neighborhood in North America has at least one McDonald's. Now we as a people are much more health conscious that ever before. Now we have a prob because we just love burgers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frying You to Death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentarian Morgan Spurlock decides to live on nothing but McDonald's food for a 30-day period. Doctors tell him beforehand to expect minor changes like a little weight gain and a slightly higher cholesterol count. Specialists are convinced that the human body can adjust quickly to the inevitable dietary changes that Spurlock plans to take. They are sorely mistaken though as Spurlock becomes a physical wreck within 20 days who changes dramatically as his entire system goes into shock with liver failure being a very real possibility. Outstanding feature that goes headstrong against the fast food industry to prove a point that cannot be ignored or denied. Definitely comical, but also thought-provoking masterpiece becomes a dramatic conspiracy theory-styled thriller as the clock advances. Spurlock shows a dominant U.S. power-player at its very worst. Fast food bigwigs become the antagonists quickly as they seem more content with fattening their pockets by fattening everyday consumers---health and physical fitness of the masses be damned. One of the better executed and realized documentary features of the past few years. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock should be commended for coming up with a unique way of getting an important point across - YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT. The second day on this "diet," he vomited after eating one of the meals. His body was in revolt, but he stuck with it. His point? If you eat a diet high in fats and sugar, you will have headaches, high cholesterol, extra weight, high blood pressure, etc. He gained 24 lbs in 30 days. Then it took him 9 months to lose 20 of those lbs.One of the shocking things he presented in the film was how much SUGAR is in fast food. Only 5 things on McDonalds' menu do NOT have sugar. In 30 days, he ate the equivalent of nearly 30 lbs of sugar, something like that. Sugar is addictive to many people. He admitted himself that after the first 3 days, he got addicted to the fats and sugar and looked forward to eating there the next meal.I liked the interview with John Robbins, heir to the Baskins-Robbins ice cream fortune. He turned it down decades ago after watching his father get sick and his uncle die of heart-related problems at early ages (also Ben of Ben &amp; Jerry's had quadruple bypass surgery). If you want to learn about healthful eating (heavy on vegetarian movement), read Robbins' book Diet For A New America.It was sickening to watch the advertising that McD's aims at young children to "lure" them in: playgrounds, birthday parties, Ronald McD mascot, and of course, Happy Meals. He showed an average group of first graders some photos of famous people. A few children identified Geo. Washington. None could identify the Jesus photo. All of them knew Ronald McDonald. That was a powerful scene all by itself. The camera crews also visited several schools around the country to show what your children eat when you're not around. Some do a better job than others of offering healthy eating choices.I highly recommend anyone watch this movie. It was sickening but I couldn't stop watching it either. I personally will never visit another McDonalds. I can no longer give my money to a company that is more interested in profits than health.</fullReview>

I love fast food and used to love McDonalds before I saw this, now I stay away from it at any cost. Yeah, now I'm over to Wendy's which is FAR more healthier with their 'BIGGIE' Size (which actually preceded the 'super' size by the way).

		<shortDescription>Entertaining if a bit flatulent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A funny documentary about the dangers of fast-food and the obesity for which it could be to blame.This isn't the specifically anti-McDonalds documentary you might have been expecting. Instead, Spurlock wants to make a film about people's culturally ingrained dependence on (corporately exploited) fast food. He talks about obesity and its contributing factors (diet, lifestyle). Then, sensibly he homes in on one of these and using the stunt of eating nothing but McDonald's for a month sets himself up as the posteriori guinea pig to investigate other peoples' assumptions.Rather like Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine, things get a bit detached though. The diet and the documentary proper fail to complement one another, i.e. his McDonalds consumption doesn't really confront the points he's trying to make. To this end he uses a sort of chapter system with evil-clown cartoon idents to introduce areas of discussion with which the diet has some relevance. Really, one needs more input from the people like those said to have inspired the documentary (i.e. those suing the company for their ill-health) and, of course, to speak to more - to some! - people from McDonalds (a section of the film where he calls someone more than a dozen times doesn't have any grip).HOWEVER... it would be wrong to dismiss the honesty, good humour and earnest intent of Spurlock's stunt. It all makes for good natured, informative viewing, although the (misappropriating lobbyist's) idea that it will bring companies to book or change viewers' diets is wishful thinking. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A telling denouncement of "big food"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, one can almost feel sorry for the fast food companies: hamburgers are not innately uniquely fattening, the current boom in obesity is due to excessive consumption of all foods and inadequate exercise, and faddish preoccupations with micro-nutrients are, in my opinion, of marginal concern to public health. And for all that people f?te the Mediterranean diet, there are plenty of fat people in southern Europe. On the other hand, the fast food companies fill their products with additives and fattening extras (such that even a McDonalds salad is high in calories); they push massive portions onto their customers (offering much more food for not much more money - with, for example, obscene super-sized drinks that I, for one, am unable to finish), and advertise relentlessly, thus changing the public perception of what food should be. In this entertaining film, the slightly irritating Morgan Supurlock takes the trend in modern eating habits to its logical conclusion, and eats nothing but McDonalds for a month. Terrifyingly, he gains over a stone and a half in weight in this relatively tiny period. Against this personal story, he challenges the huge amounts of money spent pushing fat and sugar laden foods on the consumer, although the delicate link between social class, diet and body image is not addressed (Michael Moore, for example, might have made more of how a health-conscious executive class makes millions by ruining the diet of the poor). Personally, I still think beef is good for you, in moderate quantities. But the film makes one question the gastro-political consensus in favour of big food. And following its cult success, how greatly must McDonalds regret passing on Spurlock's numerous invitations to put their side of the story.</fullReview>

Though I do think Spurlock exaggerated a bit near the first, he did have some very strong points. Some of the scenes were pretty disturbing, more-so than any horror movie you can find. Though hilarious in parts, he certainly knows how to get his point across through comedy. The animated sequences were especially effective. I don't agree with the scene where he showed the bypass surgery though...seemed like it was there simply for the shock value. Overall though, this was a great documentary, and I'm truly surprised that it didn't have a bigger effect on the fast food industry.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd been curious about this film since I 1st heard about it when it entered cinema's. Initially it didn't interest me and I didn't want to go and see it. I was curious but I wasn't going to pay cinema prices to watch it.I had the same kind of feelings when it became available on DVD and video, but finally I got my chance to see it when it was shown on UK TV this week on channel 4.This film follows Morgan Spurlock (No, I don't know who he is either) and his special diet. His diet or plan to eat 3 meals a day at McDonalds for 30 days.He starts out by having medical exams, blood tests and so on to check his health, fitness and many other things. Morgan has made a promise, he will only ever super-size a meal if he is asked by a salesperson (something that happened 9 times in his 30 days.Shortly after eating his 1st super-size meal on day 3 Morgan was violently sick. Not something I really needed to see, but we were shown his vomit for a good long time to make sure if we didn't realize what had happened from him putting his head out the car window and making very loud vomit noises.The film shows how easy it is for Morgan to buy food at McDonalds and how quickly he becomes not only addicted to them but also made sick, lethargic and gains weight.Near the end of this film Morgan is given a very sharp shock of how badly his liver is being effected by the food he is eating.This film should shock everyone who watches it and give a very clear message about how fast food can't damage your health.Directly due to this film the Supersize portion was removed by McDonalds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RAISING THE awareness OF THE POST MODERN unconscious CONSUMER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The docufilm,Supersize Me exposes what global capitalism is about, which is in this film epitomised by the unconscious consumer. To further explain, Supersize Me illustrates that the consumer has an unconscious awareness of what is occurring, being disinclined to question how their food is produced, and for what ultimate purpose, and for whose primary benefit. In this context, we see this as an extrapolation of Marx idea that the proletariat is alienated from the means of production. Whereas Marx assumed there would be a natural arousal of conscience, some of his revisionists suggest this can only be achieved by educated intellectuals raising the proletariat's awareness of their condition. Here, the film's director endeavours to achieve this task by exposing the affects upon our health fast food has. And by so doing, he manages to highlight what is in many peoples' opinion consumers who are leading worthless, poor quality lives. The poor quality of lives is illustrated in the film by the cheap toxic matter we consumers are willing to consume at the expense of our health for the fast food restaurateur's profit.The fast food restaurant chain's food, which came under scrutiny by the director abolished its 'super sized' portions during the post film period. By doing this, and by emphasising, and focusing on the super sized portions of food in the film, permitted the fast food chain to abolish this choice from its menu. By doing this, the consumer was potentially being misled into thinking it was only the super sized portions of food which were unhealthy, rather than the food they consume in general.Our inclination to eat fast food, over healthy food, it seemed that, according to the director of the film, was caused by the emancipation of women, no longer willing to be subordinate, and enslaved in the kitchen, like his mother was, and partner is! Meanwhile, during the post film period, it has been reported in the media that there is a decline in fast food consumption. When applied this could constitute the end of global style capitalism at least in its current unchecked state.For exposing us to our ignorance, in a commercial format that is accessible to consumers, then this documentary style film deserves recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless but Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was travelling through America just as this movie came out on DVD and the improbably named Morgan Spurlock was touting his wares all over the place. On the promotional material French-fries (or, to give them their correct name, "chips") were crammed into his smug, opportunistic handlebar-moustache-surrounded gob, and all indications were that this was merely another leftie having a pop at the big corporations in a bid to make a name for himself.A month eating nothing but McDonalds? Pah. Gimmicky nonsense, I thought.Over a year later I actually sat down and watched the thing, and I'm big enough to admit I was only partly right. It IS gimmicky nonsense, but there is an undeniable charm to Super-Size Me that I never gave it credit for.First the nonsense: It is supposedly a damning indictment of American fast food and the grotesque effect it is having on an increasingly obese and inert population. OK, it won some awards, but it strikes me that movie academies are now handing out Golden Globes and Oscar nominations for stating the obvious.Of course eating nothing but burgers and fries and fillet-O-fish is going to leave you bloated, pallid and unhealthy. Do the same thing at Claridges ? a month's worth of gorging on foie gras, Beef Wellington, cr?me brule and all the trimmings - and you're going to feel pretty soporific and have a distinctly Stilton-y taste in your mouth.Spend a month drinking nothing but Jack Daniel's and you're likely to wind up dead. But no-one's going to win any awards for dragging round a film crew while they swig relentlessly from a brown paper bag, belch loudly and aim wayward punches at passers-by (otherwise Judy Finnegan would have a stack of statuettes to balance out the empties).Actually sitting down and watching Super-Size Me has not caused me to change my opinion on the futility of Spurlock's experiment, but it is at least an entertaining ride. There are splendidly jovial pokes at twitchy authority figures and ingeniously selected vox pops with crazed Big Mac addicts and porky consumers.Most importantly for the success of the documentary, Spurlock himself is disarmingly engaging. He employs an unashamedly Michael Moore approach but does not have the same swagger or self-importance. And though his findings do lead to negative conclusions, he does not overtly condemn McDonalds, just urges caution and moderation.The physical evidence is pretty compelling ? Spurlock put on two stone and his GP labelled him a medical phenomenon ? his liver was on the kind of fast-track to oblivion usually reserved for career alcoholics and his cholesterol and body mass index sky-rocketed.Predictably he spends a fair amount of time forecasting doom and gloom for a nation of inactive children addicted to fast food, but for an advocate of healthy school dinners he comes across as considerably less punchable than our own Jamie Oliver.A hint to his motivation for this film could probably be found in Spurlock's fearsome girlfriend, who just happens to be a Vegan chef. At one juncture she quizzes him over his affection for meat and suggests that ham is as addictive as heroin. Maybe stuffing his chops with chicken McNuggets and double quarter-pounders was just a cunning way of avoiding her lentil pie.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, Morgan Spurlock has this experiment, we all heard it, I won't go into it. The film takes along with him on his journey for 30 days on nothing but McDonalds for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, he doesn't exercise. "So what" is what I say. He became unhealthy, fatter, and had a general lousy feeling. Surprise? I'll answer everyone with a resounding "NO." That's the major fault of the film. We already know this. Second, why are we watching a hospitalized obese man on the operating table go thru stomach surgery? Why are we listening to his girlfriend talk openly about their sex and his penis? And why are we getting close ups of his vomit on the parking lot of McDonalds? Hey Spurlock, we get the idea, are you trying to get this an "R" rating, or just force the extremities on us. Lay off. Another minor fault is that Spurlock never lets us into his mind about his mental condition. What's going on in your head? We know how you feel, but tell us what your thinking,huh. Despite these major letdowns, I'll very mildly recommend this doc simply because he raises issues about kids and children and how they are being rather exploited thru marketing and unhealthy foods in school- and why children are being served what they are. This is what the film should have focused on- children, NOT adults. This was the best issue the film raised, and possibly what the film should have been about.Lastly, I'll admit, Spurlock has a sort of engaging personality filled with subtle humor that gets addictive. I found myself enjoying the film almost based on this. He may as well have been talking about paint thinner for 2 hours as far as I'm concerned. 6/10 solely for the children issues and Spurlock himself.</fullReview>

The movie certainly gets the point across as Morgan Spurlock decides to uncover the health hazards of eating fast food frequently and goes on a thirty day McDonalds only diet. He can only order things off of the McDonalds menu and if he is asked to supersize he must. The movie is horrifying as you watch this pretty healthy guy turn into a very sick and unhealthy person. He also touches on the effects of advertising to children. In a very interesting part he shows children pictures of various people from George Washington to Ronald McDonald and all of the children recognized Ronald McDOnald. He also stopped a family in Washington D.C. and asked them to recite the pledge of allegiance witch oddly enough they struggled through but when asked if they could recite the big mac "chant" they got through it. In another part they showed a guy who they called the big mac guy who ate a two or three big macs a day but was considerably healthy. It was certainly a good movie. Not the best. Definitely worth seeing. 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie, it's excellent. It teaches a good lesson about nutrition and diet. It's very well made, and directed. It is also very educational. I give it 10 out of 10 stars.Morgan Spurlock, slowly killed himself in this film by eating all three meals everyday at McDonald's for a whole month. He ate everything on the menu, including, the Delux Breakfast Platter, Big Breakfast Platter, Hot Cakes and Sausage Platter, Hot Cakes Only Platter, Cinnamon Roll, Parfait, Mcgriddles, Hash Browns, Breakfast Sandwiches, etc. He also had Chicken Nuggets, French Fries, Cheeseburger, Hamburger, etc. Not only was he gaining weight but he was also damaging his liver and heart. I'm surprised that when he met Jared of Subway he didn't take some advice and switch back to a healthier diet.In the end he did a a lot of damage to himself, his liver looked like an alcoholic's, he gained weight and had other health problems. I hope he took his girlfriend advice afterwards. Great Movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just Interesting But Also Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew what to expect from Super Size Me. A load of thrilling trivia that goes against the Mcdonalds corporation and what it is doing to our human bodies but what I also found is a lot of things I already knew about what Mcdonalds food can do to our bodies.Morgan takes us on his journey of proving a point and getting fat but what do we honestly learn from his experiment? That after eating three square meals a day that can only be from Mcdonalds can slow down your life and make you feel a little worse for wear. I don't know anyone who eats three square Mcdonalds meals a day and those who cant be a lot so what makes Super Size Me so special? For me its seeing how his life is taking a U turn health wise and what its doing to others on the way. As interesting as Super size Me is found it more entertaining than anything and though Morgan Schurlock is very straight forward on getting his point across, will it stop people eating Mxdonalds food, probably not, if anything it made me go out and buy one because the film made me crave it so if you lose your appetite then just flick this documentary on and you should be off to see Ronald in no time.Morgan approaches this documentary in the very same way Michael Moore made Bolwing for Columibine and that was by using entertaining and fun music together with clips that intrigue us with stunning facts.All in all a great documentary but I don't think it will change anyone's mind on Mcdonalds if thats what Morgan Schurlock set out to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How about 'Subway Trio' please!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So there might be a reason to believe that McDonalds'is bad for you but only when you consume huge quantities. I would like for anyone willing to take on the challenge to do the same thing Morgan Spurlock did and apply it to Subway. I would really, and I do mean REALLY! Like to see how much better Subway's food is compared to McDonalds'. I am sure like most people you have seen the commercials where that numb nut stipulates that he lost something like 200pounds by going on a all-subway diet. But I seriously doubt that he ate anything but the lettuce and crumbs... Anyhow they say its healthy, someone put it to the test! Eat 30 days of Subway sandwiches that you WOULD actually eat and not those "healthy" choices no one takes.Let's see the results and than I will allow people to bash McD's as much as they want.--- In the summer of 1999 I went to McDonald's at least 4 times a week at night usually around 2 and 3am for a trio and gained no weight AT ALL! I was around 145pounds back then and now a days I average 160pounds while still getting my dose of BigMac's once a week (next to school).---I am not saying that I approve McDonald's as a healthy choice, I just don't like the fact that Morgan Spurlock attacks this restaurant without blaming the rest equally. I live in Canada and we don't have nearly as much fatty fast food restaurants as some in the US, but "Damnnn!" you guys need to change some things. I ate "Popeyes" and something at "Arby's" and 'oh my god' I though my stomach was going to blow up! That was the worst fried crap I had ever eaten in my life and I saw some people eating bucket loads of "chicken", if we can call it that!Give me some feedback people!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Australia we call Mcdonalds Macas. First of all let me say that i was totally against this movie, not because I'm a Macas fan (which I'm not), i was against this because i thought it was going to be a very biased documentary, the fact that he was gonna be eating 3 Maca meals for 30 days just really put me off, i was thinking offcourse if you eat that for that amount of time your gonna get fat &amp; the fact that he wasn't gonna be doing any exercise at all for that period of time. This documentary was actually based of facts &amp; very informative, The reason he went on the eating Macas 3 meals a day for 30 days was so he could be the average American, &amp; the reason he done no exercise was because of the fact i think he said about 70% of Americans don't get any exercise done. Do not judge this documentary before watching it, its actually a lot more interesting than you would imagine. I actually wrote a negative post about this movie before watching it, because i thought he only done this to become famous. Overall a top notch documentary that never gets boring. I give this a 9 / 10. A mind is a terrible thing to taste - Ministry</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected this to be about and hour and a half of "I hate McDonald's, so everyone should hate McDonald's". But I was, happily, wrong. Morgan Spurlock did a good job of showing that the fast food industry is not to blame for our nation's obesity problem (at least not entirely, or even predominately). We are to blame for the decisions we make, including but not limited to the type and amount of food we eat (and the amount of exercise we do, or do not, get). He also draws out the facts about how we can do better with our diets and general eating habits. I was mostly surprised that I was not bored to tears during this movie, as Mr. Spurlock actually manages to infuse some humor to the movie (everyone in the theater with me laughed and gasped at all the right moments). I saw this movie while in L.A. Too bad most of the rest of the country will have to hunt down a theater willing to show up the nation's powerful industries (that don't want you to see this movie) and play the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spurlock's zany self-dare, to spend an entire month eating nothing but McDonald's food, is a wild ride into a place where the United States fears to tread: the realm of personal accountability and consequence. Spurlock effectively sacrifices his own good health for the enlightenment of the masses, but the masses are reluctant to receive the message.There is indeed something diabolical about the notion that Country Time Lemonade or Gatorade are viable "healthier" alternatives to Cokes and Mountain Dews -- especially when found in a school lunchroom! Sugar is sugar is sugar, and Spurlock averaged a consumption of a pound of the stuff a day during his month-long experiment.We know better, perhaps, but taking action is for the "other guy". Not only does Spurlock highlight the effect of fast food on the American waistline, but its pervasiveness throughout American society. Our demand to "have it our way" in a matter of minutes may save us time, but what does it cost us in the end? Immediate gratification is a harsh master and once in its clutches, it is very difficult to break free. We see this reflected in the marketing of everything from burgers and fries to self-propelled vacuums to bleach-infused towelettes to the latest in disposable razors. And it is especially prevalent in the advertisement, distribution and promotion of weight-loss aids, programs and devices: Slim-Fast, 6-Second Abs, 20 Minutes a Day, 3 Days a Week. It is stunning to see how many people fall prey to these come ons of easy weight loss, but all the more amazing when compared to the reality of Spurlock's own experience: it took him nearly a year to lose all of the nearly 30 pounds he gained IN ONE MONTH!! "Super Size Me" begins as it ends, highlighting the lawsuit brought against McDonald's by two obese teenagers. In the end, the lawsuit is dismissed as frivolous and thrown out of court. No doubt, some lawyer will try another approach to the same issue (love the scene where the girls' attorney, when asked for the motivation for his case, sputters and stammers, finally saying "You mean besides huge financial gain?" before falling into a puzzled silence), seeking the success of the tobacco company suits. But Spurlock has built a case for personal accountability that cannot be ignored. However, providing information is not enough, in and of itself. As demonstrated with his visits to school lunchrooms, that education MUST be coupled with appropriate opportunity to make the best choices. It is not enough to tell children to make smart food choices then provide them with little but pizza, fries, burgers, chips and other junk at lunchtime. Like smoking, we all know that eating junk food will give us junk bodies, but we still persist in the behavior. In time, perhaps the only thing that will motivate us to change will be the same motivation that has brought big tobacco to its knees: money. When it starts costing the taxpayers too much to keep providing bypasses to fatties on the federal dime, then we will see change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No word of a lie, this movie made me hungry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this film, Morgan Sperloch has done more good for the general public's health than all the government health bulletins have in the last ten years. Why? Because it's interesting, funny, memorable, and demonstrates its points.Also, as a happy 7-Eleven employee, it made me wonder to what degree am I part of the problem, and not the solution. Boy, I sure hope our sandwiches and salads don't have all that fat, sugar and sodium in them! One of Morgan's points for sure is right: we did drop our small size coffee, and introduce a humongous one, "The Big Brew," a few years ago. One "Big Brew" cup holds half a pot of coffee. Hmm, so that's where all the road rage comes from!There's only three things I would change about this film.One: edit the vomiting scene - please. Don't make us puke along with you.Two: drop the other totally unnecessary scene where he's sitting at a table eating a burger...and nothing else happens. Waste of time.Three: broaden the focus to include other fast food joints as well. Hey, I enjoy beating up McDonalds too, but they're not the only culprit.Great film, easy to recommend. A toast to Morgan Sperloch; this carrot stick's for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it wasn't for Bowling for Columbine this kind of "film essay" (as I like to think of them) wouldn't be showing in theaters. Spurlock's appearances on Letterman and shows here in Australia focused on his three-meals-a-day for thirty days straight diet but Super Size Me is about a lot more than Spurlock's dietary experiment. He does prove though that a person cannot live indefinitely on fast food (McDonalds at least) alone . If you were trapped with no food source but a McDonalds and salads weren't on the menu your days would be numbered. Regarding fast food consumption, the rest of the western world is only one step behind the USA. If the issue was never addressed it would only be a matter of time before giant cokes and fries were on the menu, and soft-drink and junk-food became school lunch staples. America is known for having a sweet tooth, but America at present is a glimpse into the future for the rest of the countries with high fast-food outlet saturation. The place where fast food originated is now having to deal with the end result of it's overwhelming success. Large servings (witness Spurlock's first attempt to eat an entire super-sized meal), high calories, and toddler-up marketing may make for a successful business model, but at what price? Obesity is now an issue of the times and Spurlock is among the first to bring awareness of the situation to the masses.</fullReview>

I give Morgan credit for doing this documentary pinpointing one of the problems of obesity in US, and subjecting himself to eating McDonald's for 30 days. Everyone is at risk eating this food and making the Health Care industry rich by eating the food. As Americans we do not exercise enough to maintain a healthy life style. When watching the film, you wonder what went wrong with the American dream, today compare ten or twenty years. It something to think about in many years to come.

		<fullReview>Super Size MeStarring: Morgan SpurlockRated: NRGenre: DocumentaryStar Rating: ****1/2 out of 5This is an interesting documentary movie. This documentary is about a guy named Morgan Spurlock where he makes himself a test subject about fast food industry. So then Morgan does a test for food. What are the rules? Morgan can't eat or drink anything that isn't on the McDonald's menu for 30 days! While Morgan was doing this film he also provides the look of food culture in America. Plus Spurlock goes around the USA interviewing a host of experts on fast food. Spurlock's grueling drive-through diet spirals him into a physical and emotional metamorphosis that will make you think twice about picking up another Big Mac. Morgan Spurlock also visited many places on his test. He was in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington DC, Houston, Milwaukee, Dallas, Columbus and some other places. Plus after this movie was made McDonalds made adult happy meals and took away the super sizes.BOTTOM LINE: "MCDONALDS, I'M LOVIN' IT!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here in Australia this Documentary is doing very well,I already knew America had a huge obesity problem and the stereotypical vision of America is fat people eating out of colourful and brightly branded packages.The last time I was there,I saw blue maple syrup and frozen 'sausage and pancake on a stick' for sale in the grocery store I was a bit horrified!This documentary was very entertaining and not preachy at all,the guy is very very likable.In Australia we are really following suit with America on the fast food front,but I was shocked by the American school children in the cafeterias[sp?] eating that disgusting food,I've never seen anything like that here,I felt truly sorry for them.Also the size of some of the portions at mcdonalds and that big gulp thing was very disgusting,I don't know how any human being takes it in.More disturbing were the department store toys of miniature mcdonalds that made the drive through sound.I was surprised too see mcdonalds has a 'delivery service' over there[heaven forbid you'd have to walk anywhere! or strain yourself driving a car!].The amount of advertising and packaging on all the food that was constantly shown through the documentary gave me a headache,i don't know how Americans live with that constant assault on there senses without getting a headache??.I don't eat fast food very often but watching the process of how those chicken nuggets were made put me off mcdonalds for life.When the narrator gets very ill later on ,It reminded me of a friend who had a 'sausage mcmuffin' every Sunday and use to get heartburn straight after he ate it and how he thought nothing of it.The American government must have bypassed the moral boundary that says 'the health of the people in our country is much more important the economic health of our country'.I hope we do not follow this path.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DON'T MISS this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film! Morgan Spurlock is this brilliantly average guy who's message is conveyed all the more powerfully for his very averageness. This is a guy I'd date -- and have, in one form or another; he could be your brother or best friend or best friend's brother. He undertakes the interesting experiment of discovering how a month-long McDonald's diet will affect his constitution. His findings, under the administration of a small team of doctors, nutritionists, and health professionals, are astounding; stopping just short of terrifying, really. The very direct and clearly unquestionable effects of his consumption are quick and quite without relent for the duration of the diet -- compared at more points than one in the film, by surprised health care professionals on all levels, to the effects of long-term alcoholism.A really disturbing sub-text of the film is the impact this 'instant gratification' societal psyche we've engendered is affecting our children: even in their schools, who we so often blindly trust to 'teach the children well', the junk food culture abounds. The 'lunchlady' fare of Salisbury steak, reconstituted mashed potatoes, and fruit cocktail that we so frequently suffered as children ourselves has not been subsidized, but replaced in many schools by fries, pizza, chips and what's offered as a 'healthy alternative' to Cokes (by specific example in this film), Country Time Lemonade and Gatorade. The film also explores, in brief, the impact of this diet on our children's performance in school. Particularly as a mother, I found this exploration disturbing, if not entirely unsurprising.Overall, the film is just amazing. It imparts a very important and enlightening message while managing to completely avoid preachiness. Witty, bright, and very easily identifiable; this film shows us, with indubitable and progressive evidence, what we do to ourselves in the short- and long-term, in continually surrendering our bodies AND OUR CHILDREN to the marketing ploys of processed foods...fast food, in particular. This is a DON'T MISS film for one and all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original, Entertaining Gonzo Journalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Super Size Me" is a very entertaining gonzo journalism documentary.Inserting himself very personally in the tradition of Michael Moore and Hunter Thompson, Morgan Spurlock still manages to cover plenty of carefully researched, objective, serious material while keeping the extensive statistical information visually interesting with charming graphics, including clever animation. I especially liked his original surveys of nutritionists and comparisons of different age groups' familiarity with various U.S. icons vs. McDonald's advertising.While his attempts to get an official response from McDonald's recalls "Roger and Me" for Moore's efforts to get an interview with the head of General Motors, the audience gets really involved in the suspense of the condition of his health over his carefully documented 30 days of eating McDonald's meals, so it was a relief to see him looking thin and healthy on "The Daily Show" this week. The DVD should be packaged with a copy of "Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal" by Eric Schlosser, which provides a wider perspective on the same issue and only occasionally covers some of the same points. Spurlock is original in taking on the PC-issues around obesity and drawing many parallels with the tobacco industry and smokers -- do fat people bring this on themselves or are they helpless victims of relentless marketing?</fullReview>

After moving from the city and to suburban Florida my activity has regressed. In watching this poor man sacrificing himself to prove a point I realized something.

The rest of the World is also following in an alarming pace. The food industry has something to do with this, but is not more responsible than, say, the car industry.Unfortunately the documentary's message is overshadowed by Spurlock's shameless self promotion and lots of half-truths which diminish the seriousness of the issues.

		<shortDescription>Documentary? No, more like Science Fiction (or Fiction-Science)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be fair, I will say that like a Michael Moore propaganda film, I was not planning on wasting my time with this blatant cry for help. However, from an exterior point, I will point out the facts, both those given, and those conveniently neglected to "prove his point". First, let's look at the qualifications. Documentary? Semi. More of a Mockumentary in the spirit of This Is Spinal Tap. Honest? Only when it supported his claims. Let's examine the premise - He's going to spend 30 days only eating food served at McDonalds. Additionally, he must sample at least each item on the menu. Neither premise is feasible in the real world, as both the opportunity for three feedings at this establishment is not practical, and the menu selection stipulation is unrealistic (who does that, other than someone on a challenge?). Next, we'll examine the "scientific nature" of this "study". Is the premise sound? Not really. Is the study neutral or biased? Extremely biased. How was the study conducted? An alleged group of "doctors" and "nutritionists", and a token "vegan girlfriend" which more sounds like the cast list of a so-called "reality show" than a scientific experiment. Further, focus was on one man's binge eating, rather than on any aspect of his life outside of eating. The Results? Representative? No - only one subject used. Quantifiable? No, only one subject used. Repeatable? Questionable, most likely repeat results would depend on the agenda of the next study. Lacking in this movie to give credibility were the following pieces of information. What was this gentleman's diet, exercise level, and health prior to this binge? What was his activity level and exercise regiment during the "study"? Likewise, what were they after his 30 day binge? These details were neglected. Was that because they would not support his result, or because they were never considered? Without them, his claims lack a scientific base. Why was there only one subject? If this was a true scientific and reproducible experiment, then more specimens to prove their findings would help their cause. Why was he intentionally choosing the most unhealthy habits for eating, and portraying them as normal? While I won't say that everyone "eats well" especially at fast food establishments, the exaggeration here is clearly to support an agenda, not to be representative. A similar study performed by actual doctors and nutritionists, could be performed with different results were binging eliminated, and a balance was established, both in diet and exercise. It would also be curious as to how such a "study" would compare when including other fast food establishments. I won't discourage people from seeing this film, but rather encourage them to view it with an open mind. Realize that this is but ONE possible outcome. Remember many facts have been withheld from this film. Remember that "super sizing" is merely a choice that the establishment offers, it is not an obligation. The joy of life in America - you have the choice of where to eat, and once there, what to eat. Mr Spurlock chose to eat at McDonalds for a month. He chose what he would binge on during that time. Is he surprised at the results? Ultimately it's his fault, not McDonalds. He chose poorly. Why should someone else be held to blame for his actions? Keep an open mind. Question what doesn't make sense. Look at the "facts" those there, and those neglected, then make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really makes you think...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film can really make one think about the choices they make when it comes to the food they eat. Is it really worth risking your health to eat succulent meat and a combination of sweets and sugars for a 10 second rush? Now, although Spurlock's experiment was absurd and unrealistic, it merely showed the long term affects of how frequent unhealthy eating (2-3 fast food meals per week) and little exercise can alter a person's health so drastically (yet gradually) over a given period of time. Spurlock's clever and daring experiment cleared the heads of certain mindless moviegoers and started to spur new thoughts about their health and how it is being trampled by fast food frenzy. Some others might say how this is absurd and unrealistic and out-of-the-ordinary, but if you were to say that to people who have been eating fast food 4 times a week for nearly 5 years it wouldn't be so ridiculous or out-of-the-ordinary. The simple truth is this: Just as smoking had built up in the early 20th century and became popular, it had been slammed beginning in the 80's for its extreme health risks and deadly toxins. Smokers all around the nation have been heckled and shunned from public buildings at the risk of disturbing and harming others around them because of the damage that smoking can cause and its long term effects. Fast food (unhealthy foods, fattening foods, etc.) is another epidemic example across the nation that is very similar to smoking. Fast food creates health risks and increases probability of heart failure, or liver failure. Luckily for this new fat epidemic is that the effects of these foods are VISIBLE, unlike smoking. Now, as Americans, that we see what unhealthy food (fast food, more specifically) can do to people, we can assess this problem more rapidly and efficiently, hopefully reducing obesity, diabetic, and overweight percentages throughout the country (just as the percentage of smokers has gone down). I will predict that in about 100 years, fast food will be as looked down upon as smoking has been in the recent years. Morgan Spurlock's documentary was a prime example of the problem with obesity in America. The film entranced its viewers into a new realm of truth, vulgarity, and insight through a thirty day experiment along with professional consultation and advisory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>News flash: Young healthy man diets on nothing but McDonald for a month and gains weight. In his attempt to eat everything on the menu for this target period he also develops liver problems, feels depressed and begins to smell like the cow he's consuming. He also takes the bait when asked if he would like his meal super sized. Who can resist?Morgan Spurlock, director and guinea pig ? and I do mean pig - has a vibrant delivery and witty style without the annoying Michael Moore-trademark dogged pursuit of his prey. You look forward to his next visit to any of a number of McDonalds across the country and the graphic inclusion of the top twenty fattest cities in America. Interspersed with his McMeals are consultations with his lithe dietitian, mesomorphic GP and his grim cardiologist. Their genuine concern over what he's doing to himself is touching.Looking around the theater, I saw none of the persons of size, to whom this documentary may be directed. And few were munching buttered popcorn. He was clearly preaching to the choir.Spurlock is clearly exaggerating to make a point but isn't that the way we reach the audience?You or your loved one may be spending too much time in the fast food meal line. Spurlock feels that any time at all is hazardous to your health. The warning should be clear to all willing to heed it: When this fast foodery says it can do it all for you, believe they can if you let them. They can take you from cradle to grave faster than you may want.Bon Appetit!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock does more than poke fun at McDonalds. He makes you laugh, and cringe and re-evaluate your own life. Expect to be amused and worried for our future as a country. If more movies were made like this one, then our world might actually change for the better. The facts are straightforward and fun, the interviews enlightening, and Morgan's sense of humor shines through to make it all hilarious. Spurlock's big stunt, eating nothing but McDonalds for 30 days provides the perfect catchy backdrop for a film that is more than just a spoof. I walked in expecting to be amused, and I was, but I was also entertained on a narrative level. There is a story here about America, a story that I think everyone needs to hear, and one that is told is a funny and truthful light. A great documentary, and a great movie experience. Skip the popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting documentary about the epidemic of obesity in America and what role fast food restaurants play - interesting film that is likely to "preach to the choir"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw "Super Size Me" in the theatre. This documentary film is Morgan Spurlock's quest to show how obese people in the United States are becoming, and how, next to smoking and catching up quickly, it is the second most preventable cause of mortality in the country. In particular, he points a strong finger at fast food companies, especially McDonald's, which he shows lures young people into eating unhealthy food and which doesn't typically offer information on nutritional profiles of their food.Under medical supervision, Spurlock undertakes a month of eating nothing but McDonald's food and saying "yes" whenever offered to "supersize" his meal (I had not heard this term before, but it means buying a larger portion). Pronounced initially as very healthy, he suffers significantly as the experiment proceeds, and he experiences signs of food addiction with energy as he eats followed by often depression and low energy.I think he could have made his point without sticking to the diet for a whole month. As a vegan, I had difficulty watching the scenes of his eating. It was interesting that his girlfriend, Alexandra Jamieson, is a vegan chef - and clearly the month with her boyfriend's becoming "Burger Boy" as some of the medical staff called him was difficult on her.I find it difficult to understand how some people regularly eat at fast food restaurants (Spurlock claims that fast food restaurants call "Heavy Users" those customers who eat at their establishments weekly, and "Very Heavy Users" who patronize them daily!!) or drink sugar-laden carbonated beverages regularly, especially when (I hope!) the unhealthiness is clear. So seeing such behavior in the documentary was sad to me, and colored my view of the film. I wish that he had given some background on the fascinating mislabel case, where activists sued McDonald's in the United Kingdom ( I also would have enjoyed a more substantive addressing of the role of personal responsibility in making food choices.I did like the fact that he had interviews in the film with people like former (1998-2002) US Surgeon General David Satcher, Neal Barnard of Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, physicians, and nutritionists, and other professionals who weighed in heavily against eating at fast food restaurants in combatting this obesity epidemic. I also was pleased that he showed the poor job society has done in promoting healthy eating by describing how poor diets are promoted by school lunch programs, even those with federal food subsidies, and how trivial amount of funding goes to promote fruit and vegetables as compared to massive advertising for caloric "junk food". He gave a great example of a Wisconsin school for "at risk" teens, and how they largely turned behavioral problems around by serving good lunches with significant whole-food ingredients, by partnering with a company called Natural Ovens Bakery.The film was cut in a fashion to mirror a feeding frenzy at "fast food", and rhythm was maintained by return to a style of music (perhaps the same song) and a "Day xx" caption at various points when he would cut from exploring some aspect of fast food or obesity and return to a day in his food routine.His use of weaving these elements in to the film formed an effective and interesting story.I'm afraid that this film is likely to appeal to those who are already concerned about public health issues of poor diet and that those who frequent fast food establishments are not likely to be in the audience. And even if unhealthy eaters do watch, the light tone of the film can leave them with a few laughs and perhaps not a gentle push to evaluate their own food choices. Be that as it may, it was a rather unique and interesting film to see.--Dilip Barman, June 7, 2004</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ever thought a diet consisting solely of fast food would be fun? Watch this &amp; you'll reconsider.Watch as Morgan Spurlock who starts out as a very healthy man quickly goes into decline very quickly over the length of the 30 day diet.It really is quite scary how fat &amp; lazy Americans have become over the past 20 years, even more scary as my own country is sadly chasing the US to win gold in the "fat olympics".Maybe "Super Size Me" could have further explored issues about Americans overall attitude to health, not just food.One scene that stood out for me was the founder of Subway meeting an overweight 14 year old girl, the girl claiming that he was an inspiration but then came out with the excuse "I can't afford two sandwiches a day" to maintain her fat riddled diet. That excuse is total crap, the money that these lazy people spend on fast food could quite easily be spent on fresh food &amp; vegetables, where - shock horror - you actually have to get off your fat lazy backsides &amp; cook a healthy meal yourself!Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating, funny and frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS)A film about a man going on a month long Mickey D's binge could very easily have turned into a monotonous, tedious affair. But not "Super Size Me." Morgan Spurlock's documentary turns out to be at times hilarious, occasionally moving and often frightening.This film should be compulsory viewing in every school in this nation. From its opening - the credits roll to the rocking sounds of "Fat Bottomed Girls" - the film remains well-paced and funny. What's terrifying is how much damage Spurlock does to his body on this ill-advised diet and the realization his three doctors come to that they never thought this much damage could be done by eating fast food. It's akin to damage caused by binge drinking, one observes.Spurlock's cholesterol skyrockets, his blood pressure jumps, he gains 17 lbs. in just the first 12 days, his sex life suffers (his vegan chef girlfriend talks of his lowered sexual appetite in a funny scene) and his liver faces toxic shock. By the end, he's gained almost 25 lbs. and then another shocker - that it took Spurlock nine months to lose all the weight he gained in just 30 days!Here's a man who clearly is harming himself to prove a point to Americans. The moment where his physicians advise him to stop this ridiculous diet with one week still left and the phone call with his girlfriend that follows drive home the danger of this whole enterprise.Spurlock makes it clear that personal responsibility plays a huge role in one's diet. But he also makes a persuasive case about how attractive fast-food restaurants make their food for children. And that's the really frightening part about "Super Size Me" - a nation of children who can identify a picture of Ronald McDonald easier than, say, Jesus Christ.And then we get to see how much junk food is served in our schools and that's there really no need for it, especially when we see one Wisconsin school for "troublesome" students that gets good results - and it just happens to serve its students healthy food.The scene with Subway spokesman Jared Fogle is very telling. When a young girl, trying to lose weight, observes that she can't afford to eat at Subway every day, you realize that it never dawns on the girl or her parents that she doesn't have to eat at Subway to be healthy, she should be eating healthily at home. But a Subway diet is what Jared's touting, after all.Although Spurlock admits it's unlikely anyone would turn to McDonald's for three squares per day, it's obvious there are many people who visit fast-food places several times a week, if not daily.The film provides enough caution to stop any sane person from eating fast food. Some of the nutritionists' observations throughout the film are particularly telling. The downside to all this is that obese people - and it's evident obesity is a national epidemic that's not being tackled properly, thanks in part to powerful lobbyists - then resort to drastic measures to lose weight. A flaw in Spurlock's film is when he shows a gastric bypass procedure (and you get to see it up close to the sounds of "The Blue Danube"), he fails to discuss the dangers involved with such surgery. And there are many.That McDonald's put an end to its super size offerings and the VP of the GMA lost his job - he acknowledges "we're part of the problem" - because of this film might be coincidental. Then again, maybe this film was the reason. "Super Size Me" entertains, informs and educates, all in a mostly humorous manner. The question is, will those who really need to see this film actually see it? I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wake-up call</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An independent film-maker in New York City eats at McDonald's three times a day every day for a month, just to see what happens to him. At the outset of this experiment, he is given a medical exam--and found to be in excellent health (at least physically, although his vegan girlfriend seems to question his mental state). This movie is not exactly scientific; it relies upon a "sample of one", the personal experience of an individual. But it's entertaining and insightful just the same. And a controlled scientific experiment, using thousands of test subjects doing the same thing, would probably yield similar results.In addition to his personal experience, he researches the fast food industry and its effects on society. As other reviewers point out, Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation (Perennial, 2002) explores this subject in much more detail. Fast food and physical inactivity are directly linked to the growing problem of obesity.This is a cautionary tale for our times, a wake-up call. In the final analysis, your health depends on you--NOT Washington, Wall Street, Madison Avenue or Hollywood. If you don't believe me, just ask any vegan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film of epic proportions indeed. SUPER SIZE ME should be seen by everyone in America. Anyone whose ever driven thru the Golden Arches, needs to see this documentary about Morgan Spurlock, a New York City guy who eats McDonalds for a whole month. We're talking 3 meals a day at MickeyD's breakfast, lunch and dinner. He is assisted along the way by a team of doctors, nutritionists, fitness instructors and his ever-faithful vegan girlfriend. With their help, we see Morgan progress from a normal healthy male to a greasy food-aholic with multiple health problems. The film drives home the point that our Fast Food lifestyle needs to be rethought about what harm we are doing to our bodies by ingesting this highly-processed, nutrient-less food. I have been so shocked and in pain from laughter like SUPER SIZE ME has accomplished. I urge everyone to see this film. And this advice is coming from a fast food junkie, so I know what I'm talking about and I plan on doing something about it. See the film, but beware because of the anti-corporation theme to the film, you'll only find the movie in art-house theaters and not AMC and Cinemark. See it and continue the fast food REVOLUTION!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smart, satirical documentary not to be missed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SUPER SIZE ME is the story of a man (Morgan Spurlock) who decides to undergo an experiment in the name of science: For one month (30 days), he will eat nothing but McDonald's for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If it's not sold over a McDonald's counter, he can't eat it. He must eat every item on the menu at least once... and see the results. We all know, to some extent, what the results will be, but they are shocking nonetheless. Meanwhile, as we watch Morgan undergo his experiment, we are shown a satirical and incredibly smart commentary on just how obese America is becoming and the possible reasons why.SUPER SIZE ME can easily be compared to another famous and popular documentary, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. Both deal with subject matters that should come as common sense to the majority of the population. School shootings and guns in America, bad. Eating lots and lots of fast food, bad. But both are able to open your eyes as to just how bad.The movie is so clever and discreet in the way it shows the definite link between America's obese population and the growing fast food industry... but, at the same time, it is not the fast food industry's fault alone. Morgan was a very healthy man before he began his experiment--and though the food had a great impact on him, he could have stopped the experiment if he wanted to, and he was advised to by his doctors. He chose to continue, showing that it's the individual's personal choice to eat at McDonald's (and other fast food restaurants), and just sit back and watch the results without doing anything about them. See what I mean? Very smart.SUPER SIZE ME is designed to make you think harder and look closer at what you think you already know. I think it succeeds. I even got into a debate with my brother on the way home about the lawsuits made against McDonald's and other fast food companies, and how right and legitimate they really are. I still think they're preposterous, but maybe not as much so as I once thought.SUPER SIZE ME is funny and pathetic, clever and sad. This film is one that successfully tip-toes around preaching, but instead shows you and educates you on just how harmful fast food is and can be, but that it's your decision to turn your life around. McDonald's can't do it for you. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie, it is amusing at times. But it does not give you a complete picture of the gravity of the fast food phenomenon, beside the health related side effects that mass consumption of fast food can bring.If the topic is of interest to you, the book "Fast Food Nation" will give you a much broader picture of the incredible and disastrous consequences that fast food chains have on our modern society. The book not only covers the health related issues, the marketing targeting children, the system of franchise, but also all the socio-economic problems that are related to the economics of mass consumption, such as agricultural homogeneity, lack of regulatory controls, lack of sanitation, issue related to employment precarity etc... It especially focuses on the dangers that children face regarding this industry.If anything, this movie will bring more people to think about what they eat and will make parents more conscious about how they put their children at risk by taking them every week at Mc Donalds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good documentary from Morgan Spurlock, as he goes on a self-imposed 30-day McDonald's-only diet, teaching America about its abhorrent eating habits and almost killing himself in the process. There are some very funny moments throughout, as Spurlock educates us about the hold the fast food industry gains on us in early childhood, that turns frightening toward the end as health problems begin mounting as the diet reaches Week 3. Spurlock is a very likable guy who doesn't come across nearly as obnoxious as Michael Moore, but I still wish he would have dug a little deeper into individual personal responsibility as far as diet goes. There were many excuses being thrown about by overweight individuals as to why they can't diet, exercise, etc. Overall, however, very entertaining. I went on a 5 day all Popeye's diet one week in college, and I can attest to the havoc it wreaks on you.</fullReview>

The graphics are very modern and hip, the humor is realistic but finely honed, and the research and interviewing outside the main subject (the director's 30-day McDiet) are really outstanding.The segments on the corporatization and downgrading of school lunch programs in America are especially well-done. While I walked into this movie simply hoping for an entertaining confirmation of what I already knew about fast food and processed food, I learned a lot about sliding nutrition and exercise standards for school children, the way corporate money keeps a headlock on the officials responsible for public health and safety, and medical ignorance on the consequences of such a diet.As for those who doubt what they are shown, I can only say, you can lead a horse to water...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The people who are saying this is a crock are missing the point. According to the book FAST FOOD NATION entire countries that have historically not had obesity problems (ex. Japan) began to have problems once fast food chains arrived. What Morgan Spurlock is showing is this is not remotely healthy food! Yes, nobody in their right mind would eat at McDonald's for every meal. But what is amazing is that his health declines SO RAPIDLY when he does. Like smoking or drinking this food is an addiction and a vice to something harmful. And yet its makers do not acknowledge this, nor do they do anything to advise people that may not have the education or resources to realize it. Our teens consider french fries vegetables, and our kids scream for McDonalds when you pass one. SUPERSIZE ME is a great testimony to how McDonald's sucks us in, turns people into "heavy users", and promotes a very unhealthy lifestyle. Morgan Spurlock gained the weight in one month, and it took a YEAR to take it off! Our bodies are not designed for this type of food. Open your eyes. This film is a wake-up call! Like BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE which took on the gun culture, this movie shows one of our biggest enemies within. Our general disdain for healthy food. And why? Because as kids we were taught to CRAVE these things.</fullReview>

But he's an entertaining guy and has Michael Moore's approach to his subject matter- toe tapping music, quirky characters and well informed musings. The part I cant stop thinking about is the discovery of one Don Gorsky (I think it's Don), who consumes something like 2 big macs a day every day and he's thin as a rail. He haunts my dreams.Cant wait to see if this guy has any more documentary ideas or if he's merely a flash in a greasy pan.Recommended to anyone who wants to eat less fast food or at least feel guilty about how overweight they are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Documentaries, no matter how engaging the theme, tend to run to fat ? almost any I have seen can be pruned a bit or the number of threads followed reduced. Exuberant authors of the genre (both non-fiction book and film writers) want to chase every issue in each and every parallel universe adjacent to the main theme. In Super Size Me we see a minimum of this problem (pursuing all issues) and a fairly focused topic with a minimal number of interruptions regarding related issues. We have a winner.The set-up to the premise that eating only fast food for thirty days might be unhealthy is both witty and informative. We see the author (Morgan Spurlock, 34 years old and relatively fit) subjected to a battery of medical tests to establish some baseline data and then watch him slowly decompose over the next month as he shovels in hamburgers and the like. I kept wondering how this would turn out, and there, as can be found in all good writing, is the hook.There is great usage of facts and interviews with knowledgeable people peppered throughout the narrative. We possibly could have done with a little less viewing of Spurlock eating; quicker glimpses of him horsing down food would have sufficed. But the overall effect, that of showing the types of food he was ingesting was probably served well enough in these vignettes.There are enough funny moments and the pace is overall darned good. This is a thought-provoking look at fast food restaurants ? something all Americans are at least familiar with if they are not regular diners at same. And there is a sensitive moment when Jared of Subway fame chats with an overweight girl and shares his own experience ? that he felt so different in his old body.Several times I was spurred to ponder my own eating and exercise regimens. I have recommended the film to a group of dietitians and nutrition experts, and I do the same for all. This movie is sure to invite discussion among many, and isn't that the point? A sure-fire Academy Award (Documentary) nominee, unlike most fast food restaurants, Super Size Me delivers.</fullReview>

However, what amazed me most about this experiment was (--POSSIBLE SPOILERS--) the dramatic change to his personality. Before starting, he was a smart, quick, funny guy who enjoyed life. Watching his transformation into a dull, lethargic, impotent idiot whose mood swings were aligned with his trips to McD's, was a harrowing experience. I wanted to shout at him to stop killing himself! It was truly a real life "Leaving Las Vegas", an analogy one of his doctors also noted.I have friends who eat fast food every day, and they get about the same amount of exercise Morgan did, so his experiment is valid and worthwhile.

		<shortDescription>Supersize Me is a 'Big Mac attack'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another shot-on-video winner at Sundance makes a big splash in commercial theaters. Is Morgan Spurlock's fast food expos "Supersize Me" really just a "Blair Sandwich Project"? Not quite. Unlike "Blair Witch," no one disappears in this movie. In fact, everyone gets noticeably bigger.I just left the Esquire Theatre in Clifton (Cincinnati) feeling sick to my stomach. I haven't walked out of a show this queasy since my last special effects double-feature at the Imax. Can't rightly say whether it was the graphic rectal exam and vomiting footage, or motion sickness induced by jarring hand-held videography. Calling this movie 'socially relevant' would be an understatement. That aside, "Supersize Me" is a must-see for advertisers, advertising professionals and TV commercial enthusiasts. Regardless of the shady motives of McDonald's and other crap-food corporations, Morgan Spurlock makes what may be the world's most compelling case for the power of television advertising.Animated sequences spell out the relationship between advertising investments and consumer buying/eating habits in a way that would seem too pedantic if Spurlock hadn't given due screen time to the impact of the supersize phenomenon on America's children.A few videotaped interviews did the trick for me. A family unsuccessfully tries to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, but when asked to list the ingredients in a Big Mac, one of the adults rattles off the "two all beef patties" mantra like a pro. In another interview, young kids hesitantly identify President George Washington's picture, and consistently draw blanks with a picture of Jesus Christ. Not surprisingly, every kid recognizes a drawing of Ronald McDonald with ease.The thesis of "Supersize Me" boils down to a soulless megacorporation whose marketing approach deliberately makes consumers addicted to unhealthy foods in unhealthy serving sizes - in much the same way tobacco companies earned trillions of dollars while effectively killing and disabling millions of Americans.The responsibility debate rages on, and I'll refrain from trying to settle it here (as if I could). "Supersize Me" deserves the attention it's getting, because whether we blame obese consumers or "fat food" companies like McDonald's, the number of American kids suffering from obesity has risen sharply in recent years.See it while it's still in theaters. Fast food chains reportedly spend $3 billion per year on advertising (bonus points for the reader who can tell me how much of that is for TV commercials), so don't expect "Supersize Me" to air as a "movie of the week" on any major television network in the foreseeable future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart and fun, never a let-down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the thing about Supersize Me: It reminds me of a mockumentary. The two hour film about a man's over indulgence in McDonalds for a month not only made me feel horrible about eating everything in my diet besides skim milk and cereal, it also made me re-think of ever eating McDonalds again, which, I guess is kind of the point. Though some of the food still looked good ("I had to go to Chinatown to get a burger that looks like the picture"), the whole idea of eating everything he had disgusted me after one meal. All seriousness aside, it's fun to watch this guy struggle through the rigors of gaining all of the weight. He makes it watchable in that fun/disgusting way that not very many people could pull off. With surprising stats (The McGriddle has the most calories on the diet, only four foods -two beverages - don't have sugar in the food), gross out tactics (watch him puke up food 40 minutes after eating it), and a worried girlfriend, it made me feel a little bit better that I wasn't eating anything like the people around me, and a little bit smarter. Remember now, Everyone already knows the harm fast food can do. It just takes a film like this for everyone to remember exactly how bad it gets, in anything over large quantities.I wonder what kind of follow up Mr. Spurlock has in mind</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film can change your life! It did mine. The film dares to point out the possibility that we are eating ourselves into ill health as well as tiredness/depression. All the while, we care succumbing to advertising showing &amp; telling us how much "fun" we will have if we eat these foods. Linking fun with food - good way to hook people. Not to mention the addictive qualities of many of the foods themselves. It was extremely fascinating (&amp; quite horrifying) to watch what he went through. The film is quite timely with the recent changes being made in the school systems regarding food. Maybe this film will help. One of the best lines was a when a school cafeteria worker held up her "box cutter" and said we don't need a spoon in this kitchen, just one of these. Hmm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was an excellent examination of the Obesity Epidemic in this country.That is what this movie is about. As Spurlock states more than once in the film, the big revelation isn't that eating McDonald's three meals a day for a month isn't good for him. The revelation is that 60% of U.S. adults are obese, the health costs for treating diabetes has doubled in five years, and 5-year-olds don't recognize Jesus, but they ALL know Ronald McDonald. This epidemic of obesity and diabetes is outrageous, and clearly we DON'T understand the ramifications of our pervasively bad diets, or this recent (in the last twenty years) problem wouldn't have come about.The cumulative argument of Spurlock's film is that our country is killing itself with bad eating and exercise habits, and if simply knowing that fast food is bad were enough, then we wouldn't all be a bunch of Fatties, now would we?Spurlock's film serves us a vital slap in the face. Many say that we know fast food is bad, and could choose not to eat it if we wanted. Spurlock himself espouses this confidence in free will early in the film.However, he builds a convincing case that the marketing machine that keeps us fat is far more powerful and insidious than any of us realizes. As the film explains, a child will be hit with 10,000 Ads a year for junk food, candy and soda - a powerful din that will be hard to outgrow as an "informed" adult.What is a parent's chances of cutting through this morass of advertizing? The film pointedly contrasts the billions of marketing dollars available to McDonald's and other junk food companies, with the fact that the Fitness Center he attends at the beginning of his experiment goes out of business before the month is up.His gimmick of eating McDonald's is a simple way to compress all the facets of the complex emotional relationship this country has developed with McDonald's and other junk food.The food tastes good, but he's often hungry soon after eating. McDonald's advertizes so heavily to children, that those same children grow in adulthood with a powerful association between McDonald's and the pure joy of childhood. The cocktail of fat, salt, sugar and caffeine that comprises a McDonald's meal is a potent formula to develop addiction in developing brains. The processes by which McDonald's creates products such as McNuggets are too horrific to show, so Spurlock resorts to clever (and amusing) animation to reveal how a creature can be machine processed into an engineered sustenance module.The fact that someone would post a review here saying that Spurlock is lying, and all the medical facts were made up by his doctor, is the most powerful evidence I can find that McDonald's marketing machine is working.That a rational adult would have test numbers 30 foot high on the silver screen in front of them, and STILL refuse to believe that this "food" is truly killing our country is a shocking reminder of how willfully blind we've grown to our own sorry state.Spurlock's movie, at different times hilarious and scary, is a powerful voice for self-examination and change. I hope its influence builds beyond McDonald's cancellation of the Super Size option.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Super Size Me" is a fun movie to watch that's quite entertaining, and at least for me, moved quickly and had quite a few laughs. I was amazed at how much sugar was contained in McDonald's food, and how much sugar Spurlock ended up eating in a month! I've noticed a lot of love-it-or-hate-it commentary on this film. I think that that's a good thing. A lot of the haters of this movie claim that Spurlock makes unscientific claims, and tilts his diet to get the intended effect, towards massive weight gain and bad cholesterol numbers. I did a bit of googling of Spurlock's name, turns out he's been involved in directing a lot of smaller projects, so he came to this film as a practiced hand, knowing how to set up each scene, yet giving it an almost "home documentary" feel. I thought it worked. Cheap, sugary, quick food is making American fat, and the best thing about this film is the way it points out the chubbifying of America, and the role that Spurlock suspects fast food is playing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most disgusting movie of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most disgusting movie of the year is 'Super Size Me' because overindulging in fast food is inherently disgusting, and watching Morgan Spurlock do just that for 96 minutes is equally so. Spurlock spent a month eating McDonald's for three squares a day with unsurprising results.More than proving the danger to the liver and sex life, eating this much fast food shows once again that overdoing anything is usually detrimental to some part of a life. Spurlock had 3 physicians check him before he began, during the ordeal, and at the end (Do you get an idea of how dull the documentary can be at times?). Yet it has moments of humor, as when Spurlock cries out his pain in super-sized expletives.What good is it to endanger your liver and your lover? The corporation discontinued the super-sized menus after the release of the documentary; this is a good thing. What is not good, however, is that Spurlock is the center of all activity, and he is not sufficiently charismatic to carry it off. Spurlock seems almost quixotic as he faces the criticism of the doctors, who believe he may be irreparably damaging his liver, and his supportive girlfriend, who suffers from the impairment of his sexual appetite. Yet, when McDonald's announces discontinuance of its super- sizing promotion, his quest becomes a victory. The documentary also briefly touches on the argument about personal responsibility versus corporate guilt. Moreover, in his voice-over for the credits, Spurlock answers the most obvious criticism that his eating Mickey D' for every meal is egregious and compromising to objective analysis by remarking there are people who eat fast food regularly, some daily as he did. After a few photos of overweight Americans, his documentary suddenly is heroic, albeit still disgusting to watch. Because Spurlock's production company is called 'The Con,' and he could have gained 20 pounds overeating anything, I suspect he may have more in mind than helping his fellow Americans. As Brecht said, 'Grub first, then ethics.' Actually Spurlock has the ego but not the charm of Michael Moore ('Bowling for Columbine'), the showmanship but not the depth of Earl Morris ('Fog of War'). I would much rather have Moore on the screen even if he looks like someone who eats fast food more than once a month.This review is downsized in honor of all those Americans whose weight will fall and health rise because of 'Super Size Me.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great documentary that educates without preaching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine eating only McDonalds food, three times a day for a full month. That is the premise of the new documentary written, directed and starring Morgan Spurlock. His intention? To monitor his health throughout the duration of the experiment to determine if eating massive amounts of junk food is really bad for the human condition.Sure it sounds suicidal, but when you stop to think about how many times you eat fast food throughout the week, maybe Morgan was not stretching the envelope too far here. In fact, he orates in a voiceover that 1 in every 4 people in America eat at a fast food offering every day, and as obesity continues to be a continuing problem with Americans (it will overtake smoking as the leading cause of health related problems), this film could not be more timely.Morgan first consults with three physicians and one nutritionist who takes readings, notes and blood tests from what can be considered ground zero. Then as the experiment goes into gear, regular check ups with the same doctors will track the progress.There is but three self imposed rules which he must abide. One, he could only eat was available over the counter. Two, he can only super size when asked and three, he had to eat everything on the menu at least once.Day one is portrayed as an eight year olds fantasy. Eating at McDonalds three times a day? Heaven. But by day three, things start to take a different turn. Morgan starts feeling ill while eating his quarter pounder super sized combo and ends up heaving outside his car 22 minutes after his meal began. This was the first of many moans I heard in the audience and I swear it was the last time I heard anyone reaching into their popcorn bag or sipping on their nearly completed large beverage.We then watch as Morgan goes through the 30-day ordeal and as his energy, sex life, emotions and physical strength are just as obvious as the 20 pounds he has packed on around his mid-section.Super Size Me premiered at the Sundance Film Festival where it was met with as much fanfare and soon with as much word of mouth as any documentary since Bowling For Columbine. Where as Bowling surrounded people and a situation that hopefully none of us ever have to deal with, Super Size Me hits home as we all indulge from time to time in snack foods or worry about how many notches we are not using in our belts. Morgan keeps the pace by if not entertaining us with his dry wit (he looks at a chicken McNugget and wonders what part of the chicken it might have come from), then we are aghast at the sight of someone getting his tummy-tucked or children able to identify a picture of Ronald McDonald over a picture of Jesus or the President of the United States.With both animated segments and humorous anecdotes (McGurrlges and McStomach Aches) intertwined with the reality that he put his health in extreme jeopardy to the point where doctors were telling him to forgo the project or risk permanent damage, Super Size Me delivers on almost every note. The trips to schools or to various cities and his observations while there are both poignant and respective. And his interviews with children or the cafeteria administrators at public schools were revealing without being exploitive. Unlike his most obvious comparative figure Michael Moore, Morgan was able to convey a thought without preaching. He does this in such a way as to not condemn McDonalds, but simply use their name and products to outline the obesity epidemic that has gripped the Western World.The film does seem to be about 10 minutes longer than it should be, but I would concede that I have always felt that documentaries should never be as long as your average comedy/adventure. However, if this be my only complaint, then I can learn to live with it.Super Size Me surprised me (say that five times) in its draw factor at the local theatre. A mid-afternoon showing on its third day of release brought out a packed house that laughed when they should have laughed and winced when they should have winced. And any director that can do that is ok in my books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There actually is a point to this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When first hearing about the film Super Size Me, most people are just told the movie is about some New Yorker stuffing his face with McDonald's three times a day. What is often ignored is why he is doing this.Early in the film he mentions the court cases brought by the overweight teenagers and how they were shot down by the judge because they could not prove that eating fast food would be seriously harmful, which is where Morgan Spurlock comes in.He sets the guidelines for his McBinge and proceeds to eat Mickey D's three times a day for an entire month, showing how harmful it can be to the human body.The film is not as well filmed and edited like other documentaries, but its simplicity does a lot for it because all the viewer really needs is to see the story unfold.While many out there either defend the fast food industry or bash Spurlock for what he does, the evidence is pretty strong and shows what a diet of fast food can do, which is what he states is the reason for his experiment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast Food Nation...What a Revelation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock's documentary "Super Size Me" has a pretty simple premise: Spurlock himself will eat nothing but McDonald's for 30 days and see what happens. Going into the film, I had two thoughts: One, how can he spread this simple premise into a full 100 minute film? And two, I'm pretty sure I know the ending: he will get fat. DUH! Gee, what a revolutionary idea. And we're all supposed to applaud Mr. Spurlock for risking his health to teach us that eating only McDonald's will make you gain weight? I don't think so.That being said, the film did raise some good points. Mr. Spurlock fills up the hour and forty minutes with some great interviewing footage of everyone from cafeteria lunchladies to the former Surgeon General of the United States. He interviews people on the street to demonstrate America's general lack of knowledge about diet and health. He interviews kids who make poor choices at their lunchline in school to demonstrate that our children are learning poor eating habits early on (and who's to blame?). He interviews dieticians and doctors. He even interviews the lawyer in charge of prosecuting McDonald's on behalf of two overweight teenage girls who blame their obesity on the fast-food powerhouse. He tries, unsuccessfully, to interview someone from McDonald's. Overall, this footage was the best part of the film. Obesity is a growing problem in America that is in dire need of attention, and for that, I do applaud Mr. Spurlock.THAT being said, I think Mr. Spurlock confuses "documentary film-making" with "exhibitionism". AKA, I do not need to see him receiving a rectal exam, puking in the parking lot, eating up close, etc, to get the point of the film. Some people may be into this sort of thing, but it's just not my bag. It got pretty old just watching him eat and complain. This is not to say the entire subplot of his McDonald's binge was useless. It is interesting and quite frightening to see the acute change in his vital signs that occurred in a mere 30 days, and numbers do not lie. Ironically, his film reminded me of fellow documentarian Michael Moore, who might benefit from watching such a movie.Overall, I was not too impressed by the film - the editing, the cinematography, or the content - but I do think it's worth watching. I think it would have benefited from a different approach, but we'll forgive Mr. Spurlock since this was his first self-created work. But hey, what do I know? It seems the fast food companies have made an obvious effort to include healthier food on the menu, and perhaps this film is partly to thank. With all that being said, eat healthier, exercise, and enjoy the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the movie was fairly ridiculous. Obviously very few people eat McDonald's three times a day. I understand that there are a lot of people who eat a lot of unhealthy foods like McDonald's for many of their meals, but he did not show much of that part of the story. The movie was more of a direct attack on McDonald's which is worthy of little praise. Finally, there was very little mention of personal responsibility. Spurlock shows several times that people understand that McDonalds's is bad for them, but they do not change their eating habits. He seems to imply that McDonald's is addictive, but argument holds very little water in my opinion. The people eating these foods are responsible for their conditions, and McDonald's is not the one to hold responsible. That was my main issue with the film.</fullReview>

It reveals some shocking facts, and that's where I see the end of this film's value. The rest of it is just haunting for a sensation. The main charge of the document is to show what's the 30-day aggressive 'McDonald's only' diet like, and how it can impact the health of the guy who tried it. In my opinion, it didn't prove anything, because anybody sane obviously has to know, such diet (even with limited movement) has absolutely nothing to do with healthy, or just an OK lifestyle. And nobody eats McDonald's only... The movie speaks about things that are wrong, and hopes for a change in society, or at least encourages people in the interest of more healthy food. But as a film, I can't rate it too high. I would have, if it was much shorter, kept factual, and could use less of a little lame jokes.</fullReview>

The average American doesn't eat there that often, and most, myself included will at least eat one or two meals a day that are relatively healthy. It is my belief that it's not what you eat, but how you choose to get rid of it. Your metabolism plays an important role in burning that fat and calories you ingest through your eating habits. If your metabolism is high, then you don't have to worry as much about what you eat, although having said that, we should all strive to eat healthy, and minimize the amounts. It's our own personal responsibility to watch what we put into our bodies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, 'Super size me' is not my idea of a documentary. For some odd reason, I find documentaries, which the documentarian gets personally involved, is, well biased. Michael Moore gets away with it because, while he does have a personal agenda, and yes, his films are entertaining, he essentially lets the subjects speak for themselves. In the case of Super size Me, we have an individual, Morgan Spurlock, who makes a bet with himself that he will eat nothing but McDonald's food for a whole month and will record his progress through film. I'm sure you've read about the results of his experiment, so I won't go into detail about them here. But along the way, he visits various individuals across the country that tells him McDonald's related stories. Some are interesting, we meet the Subway guy, who ate nothing but Subway and lost weight, and we also meet a man who curiously eats nothing but Big Macs but hardly gains a pound. Why is this? We don't know, Spurlock doesn't really focus on this, which is a shame somewhat, because with every say 5 negative stories about Mickey D's, we get one somewhat curiously positive story about them. So Spurlock IS on a biased reporting binge. I mean, come on, going from complete vegetarianism to eating nothing but meat IS going to do something to you. It's called a SHOCK to your system. And nothing more. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was a really insightful film, but you gotta sometimes dig deeper when they're digging deep..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food and sensible eating seems to be the topic of the day, with Jamie Oliver kicking at the door of number 10 to force the PM to notice that many of the current school dinners are literally destroying pupil's health. It's about time, we cheer, as the one thing that can unite the generations is a memory of school dinners that was far from appetising. Combine this with our quirky American cousins turning their litigious eyes to the fast food firms who they blame for making them fat, and you have a media feeding frenzy. Super Size Me is the journey of an American citizen, but this one isn't like the stereotypes, he has a girlfriend that is a vegan chef which, and as anyone guy that has ever dated a vegetarian will know this has a huge impact on your own diet. Spurlock is fit, healthy, attractive, and charismatic and appears intelligent, though his participation in this film may challenge that. With all the serious and intellectual media coverage the issue of healthy eating gets, Spurlock's approach is some what refreshing, if not ill-advised. To silence the McDonalds PR machine who claim their food will not make people fat, he decides to eat from their gourmet menu three times a day for one month, and reduce his exercise to the level of the average American. What begins as a fun and light hearted look at a guy gorging himself on Big Macs becomes a horrifying freak show of a man quickly and systematically destroying his body, causing weight gain of 20 pounds, mood swings, damage to his liver, and an increase in cholesterol. He feels fatigued and complains of chest pains, and perhaps most distressing of all is that his girlfriend starts to complain about his declining sexual ability!Spurlock's personal charm and amiability enhance the films appeal and carry us through the experiment, causing us to care for this brave, but inherently stupid yank. We feel for him as he undergoes the assault of burgers and fries, and when his girlfriend and doctors strongly advise he call off the whole thing, we yearn for him to pay heed. The one saving grace we have is the belief that his girlfriend will whip him back into shape, a feat that takes her a whole year to accomplish. It is easy to distance ourselves from these "silly Americans", after all, at times they seem as though they are another species entirely. But the resounding message that permeates this movie isn't a rant of the evil of the golden arches, but a reminder that the choice is ours, and we should choose to exercise and try no to eat more that one fast food meal a week. It is clear that Spurlock loves his food, and even after his near death experience it is likely he munches on the occasional quarter pounder. There is a fairly broad range of views present in this film, dietitians, nutritionists, lawyers and fast food fanatics. One overweight 14 yr old girl comments that a conference speaker at a Subway convention advised that eating two Subway meals a day instead of McDonald's will help her to lose weight. The girl's response is one of confusion as she can't afford two Subways a day, so how will she ever lose weight? On the other side of the argument there is the American that has eaten over 9, 000 Big Macs and remains very slim; though perhaps this is only an external illusion of health. However the real villains of this piece are the GIGANTIC sodas and evil fries, which should be avoided at all costs. What does all that soda do to their teeth? The acid must be having a party, no wonder the teeth whitening craze began in the USA!What does this film leave us with? Well, for what it is worth McDonalds stopped the super size option, but of course they claim, like our Labour government, that it had nothing to do with media pressure. Other than that we have a few laughs along with Spurlock, a highlight being the self aware comedic comparison of ham with heroin. We share his shock at McDonalds aggressive child orientated marketing campaign, the contents of a chicken McNugget, and the revelation that the definition of what a calorie is eludes us. As a gonzo documentary about fast food it is superb viewing, but like most films of this type it is only worth watching once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good and surely scary documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SUPER SIZE ME is low budget, but that is a lot what makes it so close to us, it's a sort of MTV Jackass feeling all over it. Capturing a very everyday theme, the movie is about McDonald's basically but in the same time all of the other fast food stories going on, simply making people bigger and gaining weight.Featuring the star who starts of a entertaining and interesting project as he sets off on a breakfast-lunch-dinner everyday meal for 30 days, despite knowing that he will gain weight the illness he captures is far more disturbing. Starting off being under perfect condition it all seems pretty light for our man, but as soon as he starts packing the burgers and fries down we understand that this guy is surely taking this serious that's right.Never reaching great heights, the movie is always in very nice shape of it's structures with a entertaining topic and truly great story telling and editing. I surely do recommend it, SUPER SIZE ME is a terrific documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the absurdity of the notion that 'sane' person would want to eat McD's for one month as their sole source of food, this film is filled with some powerful illustrations through the effective use of factoids of the fast food industry. Although I was an 2-3 times per month fast food eater, I can honestly say that I can no longer 'stomach' the idea of eating a Big Mac knowing that the meat, the bun and even some of the vegetables are expensive,man-made, chemical and hormone filled creations. The interviews with some food experts are a must as well. I think you owe it to yourself to know what goes into your body.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>False Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets see, where to begin? Let's start with all you blaming fast food for being fat, and calling them evil. It's your choice to eat there. If you are offered "super size" whats stopping you from saying "no thanks"??? Who's holding a gun to your head saying eat it? Don't go saying anything about the advertising either, there are plenty of advertisements that we see but don't act on them. Also, if you eat the same thing over an over, no matter what it is, your body will get thrown off. If you drink just MILK for a month, you will get too much of what it has, and nothing from other food sources, lets say WATER. Furthrmore, if you gorge yourself with the food trying to make a point, you are making a fake one. So, blame the fast foods places, or blame the advertising. Praise this man for making this false movie, pointing the blame of our obesity at them, and not us, where it should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, even if manipulative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very (emphasis on very) entertaining piece of anti-giant corporation propaganda. Director Morgan Spurlock admits in this documentary the vast majority of people are aware of the fact fast food is not good for you, or anyone. Yet he subjects himself to an unscientific study of the short-term effects of an all-fast-food diet, to promote his own agenda which, in my opinion, panders more to an avoidance of claiming responsibility for one's own actions and pushing the blame onto the big money. The real question to be asked (one which will never be answered) is whether big money is really an evil entity. While McDonalds, and all fast food restaurants, do offer food which is high in fat, cholesterol, salt and other ingredients which can and will be detrimental to a person's health, they also provide jobs (not the best, of course) for certain people who would not be able to obtain a job anywhere else. They also (probably for tax write-offs) donate millions of dollars to various charities and, in the case of McDonald's, founded Camp Ronald McDonald.One of the aspects of the McDonald's corporation Spurlock attacks is advertising. Replete with examples and statistics, the film presents a hefty argument which says the average child sees approximately 10,000 adverts per year, and, you guessed it: many of these are selling toys sold with fast food products. Okay, so the fast-food corporations do pander to children as much as alcohol and Yoplait ads pander to college students and trend-following young mothers (respectively). The children may not be directly responsible for being easily sold on advertisements; they are not quite old enough to understand marketing ploys. However, the parents ARE responsible for the proper feeding and nutrition of their children and should, therefore, exercise some discretion and control instead of caving to a whining kid's tantrums. However, as much as everybody complains about no-one taking responsibility for their own actions, there is still nothing apparently being done about frivolous lawsuits blaming people who should, by all means, have no claims of responsibility for some drunk college student taking a plunge out a window. Off the subject (yet still related) recent legislation has members of the democratic party in government overruling new laws directed at sporting events. In essence, what was proposed was that participants of a sport would not have the provisions to sue if they were injured while playing the game. These non-accountable injuries would have been limited to those incurred while playing the game to the letter of the law. Personally, that makes perfect sense. There are risks to playing sports, especially when there is a lot of roughhousing involved (such as wrestling, football, golf). But to some. the ability to sue a school district or league thereby draining funds from personal levels (families who hire attorneys, time spent away from a job, etc.) and governmental (school districts, time spent in court, etc.) is a right. Now this may seem hypocritical, but it is a right, and it is a right which should not be taken away. But it still comes down to one thing: people should take responsibility for their own actions and in the case of children, someone needs to claim responsibility for them.Back to the scientific nature of Spurlock's adventure. His experiment was lacking in a control group. The purpose of a control group is to help validate his (or any scientific) claims that the high-fat, high-carb, high-sugar diet would be as harmful to everyone as it was to him. Of course, it probably would be although there is a man in the documentary who eats multiple Big Macs a day and still maintains a healthy-looking physique and an admirable cholesterol level of approximately 140. He also does not follow correct procedure when reporting to have blood drawn to be used in blood tests. In order to get clean results from bloodwork, doctors advise a fasting period anywhere from 12 hours and up before the draw to ensure unbiased results. While the film does not specify if Spurlock actually followed correct procedure, it also does not say whether he did. Therefore, I am of the opinion he did not. More likely, he stuffed his face with some grease-laden concoction hours, or possibly minutes, before reporting to the doctor's exam.I am not denying or attempting to soften the effects a fast food diet would have on someone, but there are other factors at work in his 'experiment.' First of all, Spurlock is a New Yorker and does not own a car. By his own admission he would, before indulging in McDonald's, walk mile after mile per day. At the onset of his diet, he equipped himself with a pedometer to limit his walking to one mile a day or less. What else? He doubled his daily caloric intake, sometimes topping 5,000 calories per day. By reducing exercise to a bare minimum and upping the amount of calories consumed two-fold, virtually anyone would undergo the same physical changes for the worse.By and large, the food he consumed was and still is, obviously, less-than-healthy. However, consuming to Spurlock's excessive level and minimizing physical activity, the effects are obvious and no-one needs a documentary to tell them that.He succeeded in presenting McDonald's as an evil, faceless corporate giant, especially by the cleverly -edited sequence near the end of the picture where he is attempting to contact a McDonald's corporate representative to schedule an interview...an interview which, surprise!, never happens. The audience, however, is left in the dark as to why this interview never occurs. On a side note, there are many vague instances in this movie. Vague because the audience doesn't have the same points of reference Spurlock does. For example, when he is visiting with the doctors about the results of his bloodwork, the cutting and editing is presented in such a way that what he is doing seems incredibly dangerous, as though he has a death wish. Then, when the doctor is discussing the results, he only seems to talk about cholesterol and make references that Spurlock has the liver of a very sick man. Furthermore, unless viewers are educated or doctors themselves, making sense of the numbers is quite a task, a task Spurlock takes no time defining.As a whole, the film was very entertaining. There was enough humor and plenty of pop references to keep any hip and cool college student satisfied. There was drama and suspense (Will he go through with it? Will he survive?) Spurlock even managed to paint himself as a likable character who, for the duration of the film, doesn't seem like such a spin doctor or manipulator. Will I ever eat fast food again? Of course. Sometimes it just sounds good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I still love fast food!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have loved fast food since about 1968, when McDonald's introduced their Big Mac (for 25 cents!) and my mother took me and my brother there to sample this new hamburger: "two all-beef patties, special sauce ... etc." I love the fact that you can buy a meal which is cheap, fast, tasty -- and you don't have to pay a tip! -- even though nutrition was never part of the equation. Obviously, these reasons are attractive to many other Americans, and increasingly, customers throughout the world. I even considered creating a coffee-table book on the origins of individual fast food restaurants. I have endured criticism from friends for my fast food ways. So of course I rented Super Size Me. I have already cut back on my fast food consumption in the interest of reducing my fat and calorie intake, and Super Size Me definitely inspired me to eat even less. Morgan Spurlock's relaxed yet funny personality is a nice contrast to Michael Moore. Of course eating at McDonald's three times a day is going to affect your health! However, I wasn't prepared for the extent that Spurlock's mental as well as physical health was affected. I would have been more interested in seeing how much one McDonald's meal per day would affect someone's health, because this is a more realistic level of consumption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Want Me, and Lots of It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's like "Roger and Me", but about fast food. A guy eats only McDonald's for 30 days, and we go along for the ride. He starts out at optimal health, and by the end he's gained 20 pounds and has a list of ailments. Each of the three doctors he has monitoring this experiment is surprised by the drastic deterioration of his health. Junk food is bad for you; even worse for you than people think. This much is clear.What's unclear is why Morgan Spurlock is doing this to himself. Perhaps a more salient question is: Why is Mr. Spurlock filming himself doing this? And we have our answer. Mr. Spurlock has to film himself doing something, and fast food is the vehicle.He is Mr. Perfect. His health is perfect, as verified (on camera) by the various health experts he consults before Mickey-D-Day. He has a cute girlfriend, who is a vegan chef. Oh, but Mr. Spurlock isn't a vegan; no no, that would be too weird for Mr. Perfect. He's not even a vegetarian. Just a good old, red-blooded American carnivore.He doesn't drink ("not now"), doesn't smoke ("I used to, but I stopped"), and doesn't do drugs ("not for a long time"). From this we can infer a party-hearty youth, now tempered by maturity, a la Henry V. He has an active sex life, just in case we missed the girlfriend earlier, or thought maybe they were just friends or something. So, good: not gay, or at least not flaming, and no serious erectile dysfunction. This last one's important, though, because, just in case we missed it the first two times, the girlfriend underscores it later for us in the movie.In other words, he's Mr. Perfect. This movie also gives us plenty of caught-on-tape evidence that he's funny, smart, and cool. "Super Size Me" as a title is actually quite revealing here: "I Want Me, and Lots of It" is a fair description of the movie's content.There are a couple of scenes that are discordant, like when he shows mugshots of Jesus and Ronald McDonald to the kids, and has people try to say the Pledge of Allegiance and then the Big Mac song. I can see that he puts that stuff in for demographics; he had to appeal to the heartland. Your random NYC resident, for example, probably isn't going to blanch and grow faint at the thought that "Your average kindergartener knows Ronald McDonald's face, but not Jesus'." If someone told me that, and it was a perfect universe, I'd say, "Well, it's progress from when I was young; now, when we get so the kids don't recognize either of 'em, then we'll have something."So, anyhow, he's obviously giving some thought to the audience. But this extends to his depictions of actual events. Mr. Spurlock is so self-conscious that even clearly spontaneous events seem almost scripted. He keeps on darting glances at the camera, as if to check on my reaction. "Am I still Mr. Perfect?" his eyes ask me.Of course, he has to be perfect, or this movie wouldn't work. "Ahhh, that dumb kid was headed for liver failure anyhow; he smoked weed and was fat to start with!" So he, no doubt, cleaned up his act and whipped himself into shape before filming. Now there's a story for you! Mr. Pot-Head Schlub has 30 days to become Mr. Perfect, to prepare for a 30-day junk food binge. If this part were in the movie, I'd be writing a more positive review.In my particularly uncharitable moments, I imagine that he sees himself as Gandhi, starving himself to stop a civil war, or Jesus, being crucified to absolve us of our sins. To save the world from poison, he poisons himself. And here's our tie-in to "Life of David Gale", which I now see has been on my mind because it glorifies the same kind of martyrdom, and exhibits the same symptoms of phoniness.And yet, the truth is the truth, even when poured from such a flawed vessel as Mr. Spurlock. Fast food is a terrible industry, and people need to know that. Furthermore, this movie has apparently forced McDonald's to discontinue the Super Size program. So we have a movie actually doing some good in the world, and this I applaud. I applaud Mr. Spurlock for his work, and for his stand against the fast food industry.Still, as a movie, as a work of art, I have to say I strongly dislike this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Honest than Moore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best documentary I've seen this year. It beats out Fahrenheit 9/11, just for having been more honest and pursuing a less hateful path.The points that this documentary makes are that:A: Most fast food is bad enough to pickle your liver and kill you by heart attack, much like the effects of a raging alcoholic.B: Fast food doesn't have to be this bad for you. (This is where it becomes suspiciously similar to becoming a Subway commercial)C: It's as much YOUR responsibility as it is the fast food industry's.These are all noble, balanced conclusions. This film rises beyond total leftist propaganda and provides more solution than inspires pointless hatred of "the man".I feel more educated because of this film. On a shallow mischievous note, I found it hilarious that the fattest state in the USA is Mississippi. It figures the more conservative states are the ones who can't control their eating or exercise habits. How indicative.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I've always eaten healthy food, and I may have a fast food meal as little as twice a month. I don't drink soda But this personal stance doesn't cut it. Smoking would still be rampant if it wasn't for the fact that it slowly became socially unacceptable. But as the film notes, telling someone to stop eating crap is actually mildly rude. We hear the rednecks muttering about personal freedom, tolerance of difference etc. But the film makes the necessary point - a fast food diet is as similar to cigarette addiction as you can reasonably draw.The film wallows briefly in the obvious before getting down to business. We know that Mr Spurlocks health will not improve with his McDiet. But why were his doctors surprised? What control does the food industry have over schools? To what extent do McDonalds target kids in exactly the same way as we now know cigarettes do?I can't argue that the film has cinematic virtues. It doesn't (hence no votes). However, seeing this with an audience is probably beneficial. And it will make you realize who exactly is being a Clown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Okay to eat French Fries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided that it was prudent to have my Big Mac, Medium Fries, no drink, before catching this movie. Nevertheless upon entering the cinema I was feeling slightly nauseous. However that was due to mixing the aforementioned meal, with a grande hot chocolate from Starbucks. When is anyone going to make a documentary about them by the way. Perhaps called EATING IN OR OUT, or maybe perhaps EXPLOITING THIRD WORLD WORKERS AND FIRST WORLD CONSUMERS. Anyway I am drifting, the subject of this 'Michael Moorish' style documentary is the obesity epidemic sweeping America caused mainly by the junk food industry. Thus our hero and documentary maker, 'Morgan Spurlock' starts out as a super fit health food fanatic. However he decides to swap all that, by living off nothing but the products of McDonalds menu for a complete month. Meanwhile four top medical and nutritional specialists monitor his body to see the effect that three junk food meals a day will have on his general health. The three golden rules of this experiment are: (1) He can only eat/drink what is on the McDonalds menu. (2) He has to have every item on the menu at least once during the month. (3) If the person serving asks him whether he wants to super size his meal (go large in UK parlance), he has to go along with it.Now I have to go state my general position here, namely criticising McDonalds is to me like saying bad things about Christmas. However 'Spurlock' is in effect using McDonalds merely as an example to criticise the whole US fast food, fizzy drink, saturated fat, billion dollar industry. He also acknowledges that no one is going to eat three McDonalds a day (that is not to say however that people aren't using it once a day). However for McDonalds or fast junk food, read chocolate, alcohol, smoking, prescription drugs etc. etc. Thus these things are made to be addictive, so that we keep buying them, the economy keeps on turning, health care professionals are kept in employment, and the world goes round. So yes we should all eat better, but not everyone has the time, money or access to prepare/eat healthy food three times a day. Besides these things taste so darned good.That said this is a highly entertaining documentary, and every bit as good as if it had been made by 'Michael Moore' and not 'Morgan Spurlock'. In fact giving that 'Moore' is a couple of pounds overweight anyway, 'Spurlock' is much better suited to such a quest. Needless to say that by the end of the month, 'Spurlock' is 25 pounds heavier, and the numbers on his medical charts are flipping off the scale. All this much to the chagrin of his vegetarian fascist girlfriend, whose remarks about his deteriorating sexual performance are just so classy.Anyway one of my two favourite moments are when after been given his first hit of a super size meal from a McDonalds drive in, twenty two minutes later 'Spurlock' has to puke it all up out of the car window. The second is following an explanation by a psychologist that McDonalds creates a pleasurable imprint on children from a very young age, 'Spurlock states that when he has a kid, every time he drives past McDonalds he is going to punch it in the face.Yet this documentary is not just about entertainment, it is informative too. For instance there is actually no sugar in McDonalds French Fries, but their Salad has as much sugar as a Big Mac. That is why you see, I always have fries with my Big Mac, and never go near the Salads.Mike filmfan99uk</fullReview>

To be certain the film is amusing and enjoyable, but its not really revealing. One would have to be living under a rock not to see that eating nothing but fast food is going to cause a weight gain and other problems. Granted the film isn't just him eating fast food the film does look into the problem of obesity in America, but the revelations aren't anything new, even if they are presented amusingly. Admittedly part of my problem is Spurlock himself who I find to be an amusing guy but at the same time I feel that the film was never meant to inform anyone about anything other than to make Spurlock a household name.Ultimately its an okay film, but its really little more than someone pointing out the obvious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad but true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very straightforward, in your face documentary about the effects that fast food (focused mainly on McDonald's) has on people. Independent filmmaker Morgan Spurlock uses himself as a guinea pig to test what effects eating nothing but McDonald's for a month would have on a person. He has to eat only what is sold at McDonald's, including water. If McDonald's doesn't sell it, he can't eat it. He has to eat three square meals a day. At first, he can't even hold the food down.The results are rather appalling. He gains 25 lbs. in just one month. His liver functions start dwindling, he has no sex drive, he is always bloated, and he literally gets addicted to the stuff! But this is just part of the documentary. Throughout the whole movie there are interviews with people off the street for various things, interviews with important people in the food industry, a couple of schools are visited to see how much (or little) physical education children get, plus much more. The whole movie is filled with interesting facts from beginning to end. Even the question "where does consumer responsibility end and corporate responsibility begin" is discussed, along with the psychology involved in advertising fast food to children. Enough said about this movie, go see it for an educational and enlightening experience. And if you are overweight, hell, it might even be inspirational for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you already hate the big food chain, you'll see eye to eye with this guy. If you have an open mind, you'll see that his results are because of a shock to his system. Fast food may be called extreme, but going from one extreme to another will shock anyones system. Just look at his regular diet, and ask yourself if he is a good candidate for this. While I feel strongly about the above, I think this film is educational, and the point it makes may be valid. I just feel that the 'control', or normal circumstances that this mans digestive system copes with are too different from the test diet, and far too different from the 'norm'. The result is an inflated result. The story really is, not about a guy who suddenly starts eating fast food every day, but about a guy who goes from one of the healthiest diets in the world- immediately to a full time fast-food diet. The human body gets conditioned to a pattern of foods, and for most people, these results would be totally unrealistic. I do not LOVE the big chain. Seeing past the biased approach, though, it is interesting to see what excess may do, (keeping in mind how the results are beyond reason), and the inner workings of the moneymaking restaurant.</fullReview>

The problem with documentaries like these, and also the ones created by Michael Moore, is that you yourself can't control what is suggested. It ought to make it easy for their enemies to attack the films, but the fact that the enemies don't use that tactic extremely much, makes you believe the filmmakers are right. Anyhow, is McDonald's bad for you? This films says yes and even says that it threatens your life. It would have been sharper, if it contained more attack against capitalism itself, when just towards McDonald's. The film ought to ask in whose interest Americans grow fatter and lose their health because of bad diet. The system is not attacked harsh enough.Anyway the movie is certainly effective, but not in the way Michael Moore's films are.</fullReview>

The obvious stuff -- the stomach-turning food, the bariatric surgery, the acres of avoirdupois, this we expect.But sadly, we also get an overindulgence of leftist dictum, with the tired standard narrative: you have no personal responsibility, because you're 'addicted'; someone else is to blame for your choices(so you have no choices); you're being used by evil money-grubbing 'corporations', who whore themselves to the 'stockholders'; only brave product-liability lawyers can save us...Basically it's "The Insider", retold as a bargain documentary.So it's revolting on two levels, putting it beyond the pale.

And i don't think its very wise thing to show this film in school neither(witch alertly they've been doing in Canada), not because of the swearing, because there is another side to this problem and by showing kids this flick they will easily think that this is the honest truth. I work in a drug rehab clinic in Iceland, and when Morgan spur lock came to a talk show in Iceland and promote his movie he came to the clinic where i work and was talking about drugs, apparently he was a previous drug addict. After the seminar i meet and was talking to him about the movie and its affect on McDonald's workers and all the jobs that honest working people will loose if McDonalds where to go out of business, and i assumed there will be well over 200.000 jobs lost, thats the entire population of Iceland for god's sake, all the farmers,managers and just workers at McDonalds.

		<fullReview>Lets see what would happen if i ate fast food for every single meal and every chance i got....daaaaaaaaaaaa.The average person who is awake understands that eating fast food ever meal and then for feeding yourself it to make money is unhealthy.This movie was about making money and not about any great hidden fact or secret knowledge.And it worked since people were dumb enough to spend money to watch someone pig out on junk food.The truth of the matter here is he played one over on people.Hell i could eat salad for a whole month and guess what i would get sick. Its called a unbalanced diet and you get the same result..sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is about the stupidest display of idiocy I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am the same age as Morgan and I ate 3-4 meals a day eating at McDonalds for way over a year. I did not gain weight, my cholesterol never went up and i was just as healthy. That idiot was gorging himself on everything bad and was also eating two breakfast sandwiches and was also seen with two drinks and more than one serving of food. I feel that this movie is extremely tilted to showing the bad side of McDonalds. Get a life! If he wants to focus on obesity, then they need to direct the camera towards parents. If parents would make the kids get off the couch, shut off the video games, and go play outside, that would go a long way to combating this problem. Parents make the choices of what their child eats and how much. If they cave in and buy junk food all the time then it is their fault, not fast food. Excercise Excercise Excercise. If kids excercise and parents cooked balanced meals once in awhile, then America would not be in the tight spot it is in now. I really fault people like Morgan who focus all of the blame on an easy target. It is really easy to find an easy out instead of blaming the parents who are ultimately responsible for how kids eat.People who follow this fool on the path to easy lawsuits and easy cop-outs are just as idiodic as him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would not really recommend this movie. I cannot speak for others, but I can see how some might be fascinated by the insight. There are some good statistics and information about health, but I must ask:1) Does anyone go to McDonalds thinking a filet-o-fish or quarter pounder is actually healthy?and 2) Does anyone actually eat 3 meals a day at McDonalds everyday?Spurlock's experiment is a pointless waste of time, and all he got out of it was a near-death experiment, a movie, some popularity, and money. I want to ask Spurlock if feels better about himself. There's still McDonald's on every street corner, the world is still obese, people are dying left and right of heart disease, and nobody is any smarter about McDonalds than they were before.I mean, if you stopped eating McDonalds because of this film, then maybe he did reach out to some people in a positive manner, but the real question is, if you did stop eating at McDonalds, are you over-weight, obese, do you indulge elsewhere? One rule of thumb many live by is it's okay to indulge... in MODERATION. That doesn't mean you go buy a 1 pound bag of M&amp;M's and eat them all in one weekend. It means a handful of M&amp;M's in one week isn't so bad. Maybe you can have that one bowl of ice cream a month. Fact is, the majority of Americans over-indulge. Food used to be a source of energy, but now it is something people love, because many people are addicted to carbs and sugar. Until people can control their cravings, they're going to continue to over-indulge. Most know what they should be eating, and how much, but that doesn't stop someone from eating a bag of oreo cookies on 2 days.It's about the choices people make.I am not trying to speak for everyone, but there's reasons why the kids of America are obese and some are dying before their parents. And whatever Spurlock aimed to do with his film, I would have to say he didn't accomplish it. Nobody in their right mind should be eating 3 "squares" a day at any fast-food restaurant. Food should be for fuel, not mass consumption.I give the film a 3 because there is effort here. There is insight about what's healthy, what's not, and beneficial statistical information. However, the main point to the film is that people are putting their health in jeopardy by eating at McDonalds. I would liked to have seen Spurlock use a realistic sample pool and determine some averages of how often people actually eat at McDonalds (or other fast food restaurants), and then get some factual scientific data based on that sample pool. I mean, if the average family indulges in fast food once a week, then how long will it take for their health to deteriorate, taking other lifestyle factors into consideration. These are points where this film really misses the boat, and why it's really unrealistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made me want to get a McDonalds!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This would have made for a reasonably decent TV documentary, but just how it made it into the cinemas is beyond me. I guess it's because anything to do with McDonalds sells, and ironically, although this film criticises the multinational fast food joint, at the same time it owes its success to it.Most of the arguments against Super Size Me have been covered in other reviews, but what irritated me is the way this guy's 'crusade' is presented as some kind of life-threatening mission. All he does is eat McDonalds for a month while also getting next to no exercise. Anybody can do that! I can't stand the Jackass movies, but at least there is some sense of admiration for what those fools do, but as for this pointless mission? Me, and just about anybody else for that matter, could quite easily go a month eating only at McDonalds (perhaps not forcing food down to the extent that we are sick, which is just plain stupid). Other than working out very expensive, I'd hardly call it an achievement worthy of being documented in an Oscar nominated movie! So, what happens? He puts on a bit of weight and feels a bit queasy now and again, and even when this is exaggerated for the cameras and the doctors tell him his sugar levels are a bit high, you're hardly on the edge of your seat wondering if he's going to make it through his incredible ordeal. It's not as if his skin turned green or his limbs started falling off.I don't have a particularly healthy diet, spend my working life in sat at a computer, smoke a pack and half of cigarettes a day, and go out and get drunk on beer and whisky at least three times a week. He probably feels like I do every day of my life, and I can tell you it really ain't that bad. I don't exactly pass medical check-ups with flying colours, but I'm not exactly fighting for my life and still manage to play football with fellow veterans once a week and perform well enough both at that and in the sack with the lady.So, what's his message? Eating lots of food and not doing exercise isn't the best way to go about things? No, it isn't. We all knew that, and his adventure tells us nothing new in that respect, but the movie does punctuate the tedium of scene after scene of watching him eat McDonalds with other nuggets of information. Most of these we've all seen the likes of many times before, and although the none-too-subtle message is that fast food is bad for us, all this movie did was leave me with a bit of a craving to go straight to McDonalds and pig out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and somewhat entertaining documentary-like film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While some parts are a little repetitive and some of the content may be a little gross to some. That said though, it is an interesting and I think somewhat entertaining documentary-like film. It is because of Super Size Me actually that I have been very careful about my figure. I might have a MacDonald's occasionally, but only if I am doing a concert and it is the only place where I can get food from. Morgan Spurlock does convey the film's message(that although it is easy to eat unhealthily, it can be a major problem for your health in later life) in an entertaining way, and he has a somewhat likable personality as well as have a refreshing relaxed directorial style. The film is nice to look at too, simple of course but effective in terms of the use of camera work, and the soundtrack is quite cool. Overall, not perfect, but interesting and entertaining for what it is. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super Size Me is the hugely successful documentary that follows Morgan Spurlock, a healthy 32 year-old filmmaker, as he goes on a month long diet consisting of nothing but food from McDonald's. If McDonald's doesn't sell it, he's not eating it. He's also set a goal of limiting his exercise to 5,000 steps per day. According to the movie this is the average amount walked by most Americans. The results: a 24.5 pound weight gain, increased cholesterol, liver damage, and, if you believe Spurlock and his girlfriend, depression and a decreased sex drive. If you believe the results the film presents, it's quite eye-opening.After having watched Super Size Me for the first time, my initial reaction is that while it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend an hour and a half, the logic and methodology are so flawed that it's difficult for me to take it too seriously. To begin with, who eats at McDonald's three meals a day? And why go for the Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese for your first meal? And do you really need to add a shake to every order? I'm not defending McDonald's at all ? their food is some of the most unhealthy junk you can find. But if you're going to go into an experiment and eat like Spurlock does, the results are predictable. The most shocking thing to me about the outcome is how shocked his doctors appear. Spurlock set out to prove something and did everything in his power to make sure he got the outcome he desired. Otherwise his movie and efforts would have been a failure. In the end, I don't care what diet you're on or where you get your food, if you consume an average of 5,000 calories a day and limit your exercise, you're going to gain weight and do damage to your body. Is that really surprising? As for Spurlock's claims of depression and a reduced sex drive, they're just that ? claims. There's no empirical data to support these claims. They sound good, but can't be scientifically documented. Again, I'm no supporter of McDonald's, but if you're going to bash the company, you're going to need a little more "evidence' than this.Even though I have problems with Super Size Me, it has made me re-think some of my own food choices ? and not just for myself, but for my child as well. We still eat at McDonald's, but try to make smarter choices. So I suppose that on some level I have to admit that the movie worked on me. I guess a rating of 5/10 would be about right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... he started throwing up in about 20-30 minutes of the movie...Look, this movie is best described as a warning towards excess.The major problem isn't so much as eating McDonalds. It isn't so much smoking cigarettes. Its all about a simple word... excess...Of course if you eat this kind of food 3 times a day while drinking a near liter of soda is going to make your ass fat.What is interesting to note is that his girlfriend is a vegan chef. Which probably means that he probably ate a more often then not a vegetarian meal. Of course that is pure here say, however his "vomiting scene" is a sure sign that he was having a radical change in diet.It is also interesting to note that not only did he change his eating habits, but he also made a fundamental change in his lifestyle by driving to work as opposed to his initial walking to work.After a while, this film became nothing more the a pseudo-scientific experiment to sensationalize going against "corporate America".And while I personally hate eating at McDonalds, as well as the other places, I will admit to a bit of periodic indulgence.But another thing to note is that his eating habits still did not reflect anything that would resemble a good thing. No one forced him to super-size (yes only when they asked...) and no one forced him to get a coke every single meal.This movie at best was a caricature of the truth, a warning against excess, and against making poor choices.And naturally what movie of this nature would be complete without showing the poor teenage girls who aren't thin, who aren't skinny or resembling anything remotely to svelte. Yes, it is a shame that they are over weight, but again they can do things about it.I myself was over weight when I was a child, and through parts of high school, and you know what I did? I busted my ass and went to the gym, I watched what I ate.Now I don't do that and while I still have the muscular bulk, I no longer have the chiseled physic of my youth, not for lack of time, but instead for lack of motivation.People can have all the time in the world if they choose too, however it is the lack of motivation and time allotment that prevents them from improving themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Spurlock is everything Michael Moore pretends to be as a documentarian. I recently caught his documentary Super Size Me at a budget theater &amp; hope the DVD will have many features. For those who don't know SSM is the best political documentary this year- far better than MM's lamentable Fahrenheit 9/11.Both films have baddies- W. Bush &amp; McDonald's, both have their filmmakers as stars- MM &amp; MS, but MS has a few things going for him that MM doesn't- 1) a penchant for being honest, 2) a message that affects all his viewers, &amp; 3) a sense of self-deprecation. He demonstrates this by deciding to guinea pig his health in testing whether or not McDonald's fast food is really bad for you. He vows to eat nothing but McDonald's for 1 month straight.He starts off with a routine physical exam- which shows him to be in above average physical shape for a man I'd reckon is in his early 30s. His month-long odyssey will take him across the country, &amp; to the brink of serious health issues. This is all documented by a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, internist, nutritionist/dietician, &amp; physical trainer- not to mention his vegan chef girlfriend, Alexandra Jamieson, whose almost self-parodically the typical bored white girl with no better cause to be for?. All in all Super Size Me is a terrific film that entertains &amp; enlightens. Can someone eat healthily at a McDonald's? Not really- but the point has gotten to the point that that's not really the point. The point is this can kill you as slowly &amp; surely as cigarettes, alcohol, &amp; drug abuse. Here's hoping that MS becomes as big a name as MM, so that he will be able to tackle a varied subject palette. While MM is all windy style over substance MS shows that substance has its adherents too- you just have to remember to pass the gas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the concept: show how bad your life gets when you start eating McDonald's every day for all three meals. But his technical approach to it became very tedious very quickly and I kept taking the "side" of McDonald's over him and his experiment. I have no anti-corporate malice against McDonald's, I just think their food is over-priced crap-ola. But I felt like I was being preached to and sold on an idea that I think people intuitively already pretty much agree with: fast food is convenient and a pretty bad food choice. Despite this dislike of their food, however, I found myself craving McDonald's the more he said how good it tasted. There is a vomit segment that I had trouble watching...The most interesting part was the middle section on school cafeteria foods. The most obnoxious segment was him arguing with his vegan girlfriend who attributes his sexual sluggishness to his new diet rather than her pedantic lecturing and her unsexy appearance.As a film, I think Supersize me is anti-McDonald's/fast food/corporate propaganda and not very enlightening or entertaining. I don't see why people were so amazed by this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>that there is no compulsory physical education in the majority of the US?? When I was in school, we had physical education twice a week, totalling 4 hours, playing football, rugby and cricket, not to mention swimming.What do people expect when exercise isn't encouraged? I like my fast food (although not McDonalds), but come on guys - sort out the exercise!!! For all it's problems, at least kids here have to do games every week.However, I do think this is becoming a western problem, and whatever you think about this film, at least it tries to redress the balance - as someone said, these companies have been using propaganda for years to promote their products, and maybe, in the same way as Michael Moore does, it might be time to fight fire with fire.People say these films don't present the facts in a fair manner - well, when was the last time a fast food advert presented the facts in a fair manner?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got the DVD of this as an Xmas present. I'd avoided this in the movie theaters, but out of politeness thought I should watch it.I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would, although the movie does have it's problems, starting with the very basic one that this seems like a painful restatement of the obvious. Do American eat too much fast food? Sure. But I doubt even the heaviest consumers think it's good for you. I do think this might be a good movie to show teenagers, who might actually not understand the realities behind the fast food industry.Spurlock is an engaging presence. He manages to entertainingly dramatize what could have been a lot of boring information. I think the stunt's silly,but I have to hand it to Spurlock -- it definitely took guts. As the amazed reactions of his doctors show, later in the movie.The stunt is also important in film terms, as it neatly avoids the one big trap these kind of movies tend to have: a sense of elitism, moral condemnation, a tut-tutting at the masses who behave badly and the like. There is some of that here -- mostly embodied by Spurlock's truly annoying girlfriend -- but Spurlock, for the most part, avoids that. After all, he's on the same diet, right? He's part of them; he's not really talking down to them.I did think Spurlock glided over some elements in his argument that would've been worth pursuing -- especially the notion from the lawyer that they were suing McDonald's mainly for the cash. I also think the movie is terribly TV bound: it feels like a particularly good PBS documentary, not a movie. I'm glad I didn't see it on the big screen.The DVD has some good bonus features: SUPER SIZE ME in fact is a good example of a movie you should rent, not see in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely hot guy eats McDonald's 24/7...MY LOVE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at a store I was shopping at on Thanksgiving and I thought I would rent this, as I am a big fan of McDonald's and I was eagerly interested in what would happen if a guy (Morgan Spurlock) went on the McDonald's diet for a month. I have to admit myself I got on a McDonald's binge when the Monopoly game plays. I weighed myself around two months ago weighing 221, and I recently weighed myself last week and I weighed 224. I don't describe myself as fat or chubby because I got people who still want to have sex with me so I'm good.30 days, 90 visits to McDonald's, Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner, not even I could do that though I love McDonald's. A lot of people in this movie stated they go to McDonald's once or twice a week. After the Monopoly game, I solemnly eat at McDonald's now because I'm still sick of it lol.Morgan Spurlock, the typical young, attractive, gots a girlfriend, and is a skeleton decides to eat nothing but McDonald's for 30 days. Everything he eats MUST be on the menu or be sold at McDonald's, and he must Supersize if the cashier asks him. He is doing fine until the third day where he vomits up his Quarter Pounder w/ Cheese meal. He is SO weak! I wouldn't throw up on McDonald's after the THIRD Day please.I did learn some good facts about obesity, such as all the junk kids eat in school (ten times worse than the school I went to, where we didn't have pop or candy or fast food places in our school). I work at Wal-Mart Supercenter as a Cashier/Customer Service Desk Associate, and let me just say I am glad that there isn't a McDonald's in our store, because I know I would gain more weight than usual since we have access to it without even leaving the store. I am amazed his girlfriend in the movie didn't dump him or anything. She seemed very supportive considering that she's a Vegetarian. That would suck having a Vegetarian for a mate. About the 20 somethingith day the doctors told him to cut down on coke because he was mainly drinking sugar water. Not until around the end of the movie we never knew that Morgan was drinking shakes rather than Coke or water. No wonder he's gained so much weight. Coming in at 185 lbs., he gained 24 pounds at the end of the movie, and the epilogue states that it took him about six months to work it off. Doesn't this guy ever work out or exercise or anything? And what I wanted to know is what he did for a living and WHY was he in Los Angeles and Texas, to make the movie more interesting rather than just being in New York the entire time?Overall, I would have to say that I enjoyed the movie, it had Nudity (well a doctor was sticking his finger up Morgan's asshole...for some reason....and I thought it was gonna turn into a gay porno! Drat! My wish didn't come true lol), the "thong" scene (He would look better in briefs), Swearing, and gross scenes like any traditional movie would have. Him Vomitting wanted to make me vomit, thank god I wasn't eating anything at the time (I got a strong stomach I'm just being strange). But if you ask me this isn't a film you would go to the theater to see, seeing as if it were something that would be shown on The Discovery Health Channel or something. It's worth a rental and out of 5 stars since this has an MPAA rating and all I give it 2.5. But if you rent the DVD edition you get to see this deleted scene where this old couple has collected over $30,000.00 in McDonald's Memerobilia. Very nice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this movie put me to sleep. It was a snooze fest. This guy wasn't telling me anything that I didn't already know: fast food is bad for you, especially in large quantities. Duh!! And playing in traffic is dangerous. He was eating McDonald's for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, it goes without saying that 1.) you're going to gain weight, especially when you eat the super size. 2.) anything that makes you gain weight that rapidly is bad for you 3.) you are going to get sick of it.Granted, it may be true that a large part of the population of this country is unaware that fast food is bad for them, otherwise how can you explain the rampant obesity problem. But I believe more people just don't care as opposed to don't know. We've known for years that fruits and vegetables are good whereas foods high in fat and cholesterol are bad. By this point, those who are health conscious and those who are not have already chosen their paths. For those who aren't, it may just take a coronary to get them to wake up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Super Size Me" is the type of movie that's better to catch in 15-second snippets on news programs than actually view at full length. It conducts a worthwhile experiment, if one with a dunderheadedly obvious conclusion, but conducts it in such an obnoxious manner than it's better to skip straight to the conclusion. One is surprised to see such a film done at all, but it is not done well.The central problem: Spurlock is unlikable, and he finds himself an limitlessly fascinating subject. Endlessly he hams for the camera, and he's all too happy to chronicle every smirk, chortle, twitch, and McJoke. *Especially* the McJokes - if a "McCoronary" or "McComa" is funny once, it's funny *every* time, darn it. I'd had it with him fifteen minutes in. The movie's like watching someone's home movies for ninety minutes - those of someone who constantly elbows you in the ribs, prodding "c'mon, c'mon, ain't this GREAT?", and insists on narrating every banality."Super Size Me" would not seem to need padding, yet it repeats itself endlessly. There's about ten minutes of doctors praising Spurlock for his perfect health, trim figure, basement-level cholesterol, and on and on, until we suspect the doc has gone beyond notation into braggadocio. The supersize portions at McDonald's are astounding, yes, but the movie takes way too much time to note this for each item, particularly when loudly driven home by Spurlock's faux, stagey marvel.Spurlock has a frat-boy sensibility. Grotesque caricatures serve as interstitials. The camera will focus pseudo-casually on the pin-ups in Spurlock's apartment to sneak some breasts into the picture. He swears like a 12-year-old - just to demonstrate he can. When he pukes, we have box seats. He chats as happily about his genital problems as any nightmare customer in line at the pharmacy.The in-depth, context-lending coverage of the obesity health issue is just a series of talking heads; the sleaziest 12-minute "Dateline" spot has more depth. There is a horror to Spurlock eating himself to near-death; this is as vivid and grotesquely memorable an illustration of a statistical reality as ever committed to film or memory. Spurlock's commitment to his cause cannot be impugned. "Super Size Me", though, relies on an emotional appeal, and as such, it's a particularly tiring one - a 90-minute "No, you fool! Don't go into the basement alone!" horror-movie moment, the indie version of those fundamentalist haunted houses that feature mock-ups of abortions and the puncture-filled torments of the Karo-decked damned - venture not here, children, lest ye share this gruesome fate! The film's self-fascination and irritating affectations are as memorable as the experiment it chronicles. Wake me when the book comes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually think documentaries are boring, but this one is different. First of all, you have to love the premise. Second of all, you have to admire Morgan Spurlock for his ambition. How many other people would have the guts to take that on? Obesity is a problem in this country that I think is being taken way too lightly. I'm not going to discriminate against someone because they're overweight, but they obviously have a serious issue that they need to take care of right away, whether they realize it or not. I also liked how he focused on childhood obesity. That is probably the most disturbing aspect of obesity, and shame on the parents for letting their children get that way. A little more than a week ago, I was in Ruby Tuesday with my father and I saw an already overweight girl, about eight or nine years old, eating a humongous ice cream all by herself AND a milkshake. I felt like taking her mom by the shoulders and saying, "You are slowly killing your daughter!" Which is true. Hopefully, this documentary is a wake-up call for many a person. Also, I share the view that McDonald's is a greedy enterprise that doesn't care how fat you get as long as you keep bringing in the dollars. I would be surprised if any company such as Burger King or Wendy's didn't share the same view. Now, I do enjoy the occasional fast food, but I'm not obese and the bulk of McDonald's money. The salads don't really help because they taste horrible (at least, according to my mother). My point is, not only is this documentary subtly powerful, it also doesn't lull you to sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted that this movie is better as entertainment than as a thought provoking insightful documentary but that doesn't mean it's an unpleasant watch of course.At first I thought that the entire concept of the documentary maker eating at McDonalds 3 times per day for 30 days straight to proof that fast food is bad for your health, was quite ridicules. Everybody already know that it wasn't the most healthiest thing in the world to eat. What was he ever trying to proof? That's why I never was too keen on watching this documentary but still I decided after a year to give it a chance anyway. Glad I did. I can now understand the documentary maker's point and overall I was entertained by the documentary.This documentary perfectly shows that fast food and health problems are very directly related and can work addictive as well. In a way cigarettes are just like fast food. Of course there is nothing wrong with eating some fast food about once or twice  week. As long as you get enough movement or do some sports you'll be just fine, just like those 2 black kids said in the documentary. I actually know a person who eats at McDonalds about 2 or 3 times per week. He practices a few sports and he is in perfect health and shape. So the real problem is not really the fast food itself, it's the mainly the people's own fault for getting fat and unhealthy.Still the fast food companies also do little to prevent this. They put an amazing number of calories in their products and advertise aggressively, especially towards young children. That's why Morgan Spurlock picked mainly McDonalds for his documentary. It might seem unfair of him to only mainly focus on McDonalds but he does this because this is the company that has by far the biggest market out of all fast food companies in the world but more importantly it's also the fast food company that advertises the most aggressively on both on TV and on the streets. They try to appeal to young children and with toys and playgrounds they try to give the children a fun, warm, happy feeling whenever they are at McDonalds, so that they will always associate McDonalds with fun, warm, happy feelings.That fact that Morgan Spurlock ate at McDonalds 3 times per day for an entire month might seem a bit extreme. No person in the world does this, at least not 3 times per day. But that wasn't Morgan Spurlock's point. He wanted to show in a very direct way what junk food can do to your health, body and mind.The documentary does provide some good points and some insightful information but it isn't really anything groundbreaking or thought provoking all. I just see this documentary as educational-entertainment, with the emphasis on entertainment. For Europeans and people from other continents, this documentary doesn't really apply. Halve of the McDonalds products shown in this documentary aren't even sold here and we also don't have this crazy super size menu's and overall, fast food related health problems and fatness aren't really a big problem here. But that doesn't mean that they don't can have any fun in watching this documentary.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film about one of the world's most disgusting food....McDonalds!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Spurlock is a brave man. Who would ever dare to eat nothing but Mcdonalds food for two months straight? Well actually, a lot of people do. If its not with every meal, it may be every other meal or every other day. With over one billion people served all over the world, you can only imagine what kind of diets people have especially here where there's almost as many McDonalds locations as there are trees. And ever look at the obesity rate in this country? I've heard people criticize this film because they think its a cheap way to attack one fast food out of many many others. That is a pretty idiotic attack if you think about it. One crook does not get off the hook just because there are so many others of them out there. Other critics also put down this film because they feel that the message is as simpleminded as saying "Eating McDonalds from time to time is bad for you." There is some validity to this argument but the reason I think it does not measure against the overall thesis of the film is because McDonalds never tries to say that they ever bad for you. Their only message is to advertise and say that McDonalds is good for you. The president of McDonalds will go so far as to defend that drinking a coca cola is part of a healthy diet because....it has water in it. That's how screwed up this corporation is. And why should this surprise anyone? Well it should'nt but has it stopped billions of people from eating it? A logo that boasts of serving over a billion people...? Is that not a little shall we say..insecure? Mathew Spurlock has made a very insightful, funny and entertaining and well informed documentary. His vision is very clear and if he wanted to, he could have taken many different directions with the premise. Healthy food is not the only problem with McDonalds. Keep your eyes out for the new film "McLibel" about a couple that had their freedom of speech threatened by Mcdonalds and after years of trials and undercover spies, the case was finally over. Yes, McDonalds is the mafia of the fast food industry. Also check out the book: "fast food nation".Thank you Mathew Spurlock for educating America and helping to put an end to the next worst thing from the tobacco companies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not to be mean, but a little advice to the girls who sued: Try exercising instead of suing someone for your own supidity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One day, Morgan Spurlock came up with a crazy ass idea for a documentary that hadn't been done before: The two prime aspects of the movie was a leading fast food chain, and him, the director, eating from that fast food chain for 30 days straight. It's a good idea, it hadn't been done before. The movie basically tracks Spurlock's progress with his McDonalds diet, while at the same time, forms some opinions on the subject that's brought up: Is it your fault if you let yourself get fat? It's interesting to see this dude stuff himself full of nothing but McDonalds for 30 days and gaining something like 25 pounds while interviewing people who have different opinions on the subject.The movie brings to attention two fat girls who sued McDonalds for, get this?.it's comin'?..making them fat. Now, I heard about this when it occurred, and I thought it was the biggest load of bull**** I've ever heard. These two girls stuffed themselves with McDonalds food, and decided, "Hey, we got fat because we didn't exercise and we don't have any personal responsibility, lets sue McDonalds!" This is ridiculous. Spurlock never really says whether or not he agrees with these two morons, but I get he feeling that he kind of does. The two girl's case were thrown out, because they were unable to prove that McDonalds is what got them fat (it obviously did). Spurlock, in the end, says that he was able to prove that he got fat from McDonalds, so it sounds like he's agreeing with those two girls. But these two girls knew that practically everything on the McDonalds menu was unhealthy for them, and if they're so stupid as to eat nonstop without taking notice of their obvious weight gain, they don't deserve one damn penny. Spurlock argues that what he did was practically proof that McDonalds does make people fat, but who didn't know that? Spurlock can't argue that it was McDonalds fault that those two girls got fat, because they ate McDonalds knowing that it was unhealthy, and knowing that they were gradually gaining weight. You don't just go into McDonalds, eat a burger, and then gain over a hundred pounds. They went there on a consistent basis, ate food, gradually gained weight, and then when they got too fat, they finally stopped, and then decided to sue McDonalds. This is stupid. Even if they did manage to prove that McDonalds was the reason for their obesity, who didn't already know that? The point is that these two morons went into McDonalds a bunch of times, PAID for food, and ate it until they ballooned to over 200 pounds, without doing any kind of significant physical activity to keep the weight down. So, so far, I don't agree with Mr. Spurlock in his belief that these two girls should have won their suit because they were too stupid to realize that their belly was starting to hang over the edge of their pants.But, with that aside, Spurlock has created a McDonalds only diet, meaning that everything he eats has to come from McDonalds and nowhere else. During these 30 days, he gains an ass load of weight, he destroys his liver, he destroys his sex life, and so on. Spurlock stuffs himself full of McDonalds food. In the first day of his diet, he eats like a few double hamburgers or something, supersize fries, supersize soda, some water, and I think that's it. Before finishing his second or third burger, he pukes it all back up because he ate more than he could handle. Sometime in the movie, he visits a school where they serve the kids chips, soda, fresh pizza, and all kinds of other cool stuff (the food at my schools were never that bad-ass). First off: Who the hell decided to be giving kids all of this unhealthy crap in school while basically cutting down on physical education? These foods are all good and cool, but little kids never take the time to consider exercising, so why the hell are schools selling Ruffles and French Fries? These foods are great, but if you're gonna eat it, and not exercise, and then complain because your weight sky rockets, don't even bother putting that stuff in your mouth.The movie is interesting, but it tells us nothing new. Who the hell didn't know that McDonalds and all other fast food is unhealthy for you, especially if you don't exercise? I love fast food. Fast food is some of the most bad-ass food there is. I eat it, but I make sure to exercise so my weight doesn't spin out of control. It's all about your own responsibility. If you take the time to go to a fast food place, order the entire menu, pay for it, sit down and eat the entire thing, and not notice your obvious weight gain, then you're an idiot. Those two girls are idiots. Instead of wasting time filing a lawsuit, they could have done something else: Yes, you guessed it, bruh, exercise. But nope. These two girls were too lazy, and they figured a fat, senseless lawsuit would work better. Luckily, the judge was smart enough to toss the case out. The minute you order from McDonalds or any other fast food place should completely negate any incentive for a lawsuit. Luckily, it's illegal to sue someone else for your own stupidity.The movie's interesting and entertaining, but I don't agree with Spurlock that it's the fast food place's fault that people get fat. The blame should be placed right on the head of whoever is eating their food. What's next, an obese teen will sue Safeway because they got fat from one of the Safeway brand hams?Score: 7Another thing: The Super Size option was cool. Now I have to get a large fries because of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McBowling for Mcolumbine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another self featured documentary where the maker is the star of the film. He goes around, and the cameraman documents everything he does. And yes, this movie is made in "Bowling for Columbine" style, which is a mixture of humor, factoids and statistics, and some animation with a little bit of scary images. I like these types of documentaries.As a vegetarian, I think Spurlock's movie is a blessing, which can only make good to our world. McDonalds is a huge corporation and is corrupting our life in many ways, which most are not mentioned in this film. The film focuses on McDonlads' affect on people, and Spurlock blames McDonalds and the sibling fast food companies for fattening America and ruin the public health. This is known to most people, however, most of them try to close their eyes and pretend it is not true. This movie will help those people change their behavior.The movie is well edited, and is organized to the understanding of the average man.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A long lecture about things most sensible people already know?McDonald's brand imprinting begins at a very early age, working at an insensate level; the food is real bad for you; most Americans don't know a damn about nutrition; obesity is overtaking smoking as the leading cause of preventable death?redeemed by a ludicrous stunt (eating only McDonald's for 30 straight days, Super-Sizing whenever asked) to disprove a silly legal precedent (it cannot be proved that McDonald's is directly culpable in contributing to obesity). Increasingly, this becomes less about Spurlock's altruistic goal to change America's self-destructivity than a Jackass spectacle wherein someone gets messed up real good for our pleasure.Ask yourself: What is his purpose? What does he hope to change? Other than a few cursory phone calls to a McDonald's spokesperson to present himself as casualty to corporate seediness, it seems not much. After 22 days, his cholesterol has nearly doubled, he has gained 20 pounds, and doctors are advising him to dump the diet?has he not proved his point? Apparently not, because he keeps on truckin', proving his initial thesis isn't nearly as important as grabbing the spotlight in his own production. It wasn't surprising to read that one of Spurlock's favorite docs. is Bowling for Columbine (which, let it be said, more than survives Moore's worst impulses). While he seems to possess Moore's flair for self-publicity, he lacks the instinct for sniffing out injustice, his subject's weaknesses, and the dogged fidelity to a cause that make Moore such a hated figure and effective provocateur. Better luck next time, dude.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally if Ebert and Roeper give a movie two thumbs up, I will think about renting it. If the movie also has a stamp of approval by Sundance or Cannes, I'll will more than likely rent it. Now add reputable media source comments such as "I'm Lovin' it" and "Funny and outrageous", I'm sold. After watching this movie, methinks I have lost about 2 I.Q. points. This Spurlock guy is quite boring and not very likable. The idea that McDonald's is the culprit to people becoming fat is terribly unconvincing in the first place. So attempting to emulate a lame "Jackass" stunt based on those ridiculous grounds makes this guy look really dumb. The only times I felt any type of emotion was when Spurlock barfed and when his girlfriend talked about their sex life. Both were really gross. The rest of the film was just fill-dirt. I'm left pondering how such a film got positive reviews from so many reputable people. Perhaps the success of Michael Moore's films has automatically made all controversial documentaries great films by default. I dunno, but this film is NOT "Funny and outrageous", and overall blows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid Size Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie (as I could tell from the title) is unbearably stupid. First off, the documentor (if there is such a word) decides to eat nothing but 3 square meals of McDonald's (and nothing but) for 30 days straight. He proved that a healthy, rather unattractive man can gain 20 pounds during this time. The other items like the poor sex drive and depressed moods he went through were nothing but a result of knowing that he had to eat that McShlit all day for however many more days. Christ, I'd be depressed too, so when he explains some of the "horrifying" side effects that should alert us Americans, I don't really care because no one in their right mind would eat that much sh*t without getting the results that he did. The guy also only got minimal exercise and anyone that knows anything, knows that exercise is a bigger factor in weight maintenance than is a diet. This is a scientific fact (look it up if you don't believe me), this is why some of the people he interviews who eat tons of fast food don't gain weight. To make this documentary more realistic and to make his Mickey D bashing credible, he should have eaten a diet that an overweight person his size eats. Along with following their exercise plan (no matter how minimal). OK, so besides that like I said, no one eats 3 meals of McDonald's a day with no exercise (of any kind) for 30 days - not even fat a**es do this. They just have a pituitary problem.</fullReview>

Anyone who eats nothing but junk deserves to be a fat loser and die young. Spurlock didn't seem to address the issue of personal responsibility very much (maybe he did, but I fell asleep during part of it) I'm afraid that this documentary and ones like it will lead to the over taxation of fast food. I myself enjoy McDonalds, but very SELDOM, I also exercise. Unlike Spurlock. My main problem is that Spurlock did not use a good scientific method. He tested on himself, with no control. In reality we all have different predispositions to getting fat, lowering or raising cholesterol etc. Did he test on multiple subjects? No. Eating at McDonalds too much is bad for you . . .wow . . .what a news flash. ANYTHING in excess is dangerous. (Did you know you can die from drinking too much water?)

		<shortDescription>Stupefy Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this pseudo-documentary, filmmaker Morgan Spurlock wants to prove that McDonald's restaurants (and all other fast food restaurants for that matter) are evil corporations endangering America by serving up a defective product. To prove his questionable assertion, he ignored common sense and ate nothing but McDonald's food three times a day for one month, making an effort to overeat, even to the point of throwing up. Ignoring the obvious, that eating too much of anything and basing your diet on a limited array of foods will be bad for your health, he staged a scientifically unsound experiment designed to reach a foregone conclusion. In effect, he tried to reveal truth by being shamelessly dishonest.It is appropriate that Spurlock takes aim at the fast food industry with his first crusading (and condescending) documentary, because he has produced a film that is the fast food equivalent of a documentary. Lockstepping in line with the success of films by hacks like Michael Moore, the ambitious Spurlock -- unsatisfied with the boring talking-head style lecturing that makes up most of his film -- resorts to junk food journalism by staging the aforementioned cheesy publicity stunt. And, as is the wont of modern journalism, he has made the film more about him than about his topic.Despite his obvious bias against the restaurant chain, Spurlock seems to have no qualms about emulating the very things about McDonalds that he calms to find so insidious. Admittedly, he has a relevant message he wants to serve up, but he has a problem: the repetitive cant served up by the talking heads of Doctor This and Professor That, while perfectly healthy, is also about as tasty and appetizing as boiled spinach and puree 'd lima beans. So, like Mickey D, Spurlock wants to offer a more trendy, more consumer-friendly menu, in this case, anti-corporation paranoia with a side order of grandstanding egomania, washed down with a 64 oz. cup of self-righteousness. To this end, he resorts to a high pressure ad campaign (his all-I-can-eat publicity stunt), toy surprises (cartoons, cutesy graphics and chirpy pop songs) and even a spokesclown (Mr. Spurlock himself), all to convince us to swallow his dubious and honesty-deficient propaganda.From a business point of view, McDonald's is a great American success story. The chain satisfies its millions of customers with a menu that most people think tastes pretty good, that is efficiently prepared, generously portioned and relatively inexpensive, all in an atmosphere that makes a mundane event enjoyable. Its food is not and never has been intended to be a primary food source or the mainstay of a healthy diet. Spurlock and his chosen experts attack the McD's product line for not being something it was never intended or pretended to be. One could rightly expect Spurlock to hit himself over the head with a Black &amp; Decker hammer to prove their inadequacy as fly swatters or to drive a Chevrolet off a cliff to point out how ineffective they are as airplanes.I have little doubt that most if not all of the research data in SUPER SIZE ME is factual. But being truthful is not necessarily the same thing as being honest. It is not the accusations made by Spurlock's droning array of talking heads that are dishonest, but his ultimate conclusion. Logic dictates that if a person overeats, barring genetic quirks, the responsibility for being overweight goes to the overeater. But not in our "nation of victims" society. The fast food industry is the villain for -- gasp! -- selling products that consumers want and enjoy. The fiends! Even as his reckless behavior illustrates the dangers of not taking responsibility for one's actions, Spurlock continues to place the blame on McDonalds. Why? Because he realizes that nothing is as unappetizing to an audience than a finger-wagging sermon; so he coats his McMessage with an "It's not your fault" honey glaze. McDonald's is making you fat, he suggests, and an individual's act of mouth-stuffing over-indulgence is totally irrelevant. This makes his Unhappy Meal a bit easier to sell and to swallow.Also, Spurlock gets to play David to the fast food Goliath. By casting himself as a martyr, nobly sacrificing his health and possibly his life for the good of the hamburger eating public, Spurlock gets to massage his ego and absolve others of responsibility. He is crucifying (or Frenchifrying) himself for the betterment of mankind, or so he would have us believe. But if a few weeks of bad eating and the gaining of 20 pounds is actually endangering his life, then Spurlock has no right to claim he started out in perfect health. Indeed, too many moments in Spurlock's McMelodrama seem staged and performed; his angst-ridden, soul-searching stares as he contemplates his impending fast food doom and his belly aching about his belly aches seem as fishily pre-processed as a filet-o-fish special.I suppose that Spurlock had to resort to some sort of grandstanding, because otherwise he doesn't offer much to sink one's teeth into. Little of what he has to say seems freshly cooked and much of it has been setting under the heat lamp for quite a long time, leftovers from the myriad news reports and TV specials that have come before. He thinks his personal Big Mac attack provides hardy food for thought, but to steal a competitor's famed line: "Where's the beef?"</fullReview>

And at the end of the film he wrapped it all up perfectly when he said that "no one really eats three meals a day at McDonalds". So what was the point? If all you ate were donuts, or cake, or TV dinners, and you stopped all your physical exercise, you'd get messed up to.The real problem here is not the excessive consumption of McDonalds, or any fast food for that matter, but rather the incredible lack of exercise most people get in their lives today.

		<fullReview>I think it is humorous (and ironic) that Morgan Spurlock borrowed his "documentary" film style from Micheal Moore. Perhaps seeing the rotund Moore was his inspiration for "Super Size Me." Spurlock is only slightly more down-to-earth than the condescending Moore. Spurlock seems nice to the obese and overweight people and the Big Mac eating guy while Moore makes more fun of his documentary subjects, especially those working class fools in "Roger and Me." I admit I find these documentaries entertaining. But it's hard to take seriously a New York hipster and his vegan girlfriend (who we all must aspire to be someday in a world without junk food!) living in their precious city apartment with an arty poster of a naked woman. And it's hard to take serious his doctor yelling at him for his diet when the doc could stand to lose a few pounds--and also the nutrition expert guy could also take some of his own advice. And what about Spurlock's theatrics: the panting, the chest pains, and the vomiting? Like our puritanical society, we do things to extremes. Spurlock was no exception. He went from vegan to fast food addict in zero seconds. What in the Hell did he expect? Most of us can handle a big mac every so often without falling ill.It is my deepest wish that bad foods will not become the next cigarettes in our society. Let us make our own decisions.

		<fullReview>That eating every day at McDonald's (or any other fast food restaurant) is unhealthy goes without saying. That doing so can have very bad consequences for our health in the long run is equally obvious. And I don't object to having these facts pointed out. And yet... for a supposed documentary, "Supersize This" was remarkably implausible. I found myself doubting the truth of almost everything I saw.I don't doubt for a second that Spurlock gained weight during his experiment. But I don't buy for a second that eating at McDonald's made him vomit. Nor do I buy the idea that he'd suffer from impotence or develop a life-threatening liver condition after just a few weeks. In short, I think Spurlock and his doctors are liars.That's not to say their overall points aren't valid. Again, eating junk food on a regular basis DOES have bad long-term consequences. But a month is not the long term! It certainly isn't long enough for any serious health effects to show themselves. And that, I think, is why Spurlock felt the need to exaggerate and distort the truth. Mind you, I think Spurlock is a decent person, and I'm sure he is lying with the best and most noble of intentions, just as many anti-smoking crusaders lie about the effects of smoking second-hand smoke. They're so sure that they're right, and they're so sure of the righteousness of their cause, they can't see how ANY tactic could be wrong.If Spurlock were here with me, I suspect he'd tell me, confidentially, "Okay, okay, so I exaggerated a bit. So I staged the vomit scene. So I got the doctor to overstate the damage to my liver. I admit, I'm a little bit of a fraud. But where's the harm? If I manage to scare some people into eating less junk, that's a GOOD thing, isn't it?"Well, no. Lying isn't a good thing, even if the desired end result is a noble one. THat's why, even though Spurlock is a likable, charming and even funny guy, I can't recommend this movie. At all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The art of the documentary is really going downhill. In the 70s and 80s people perfected a way of making documentaries without any narrative, just letting the sequence of images tell the story. Koyaanisqatsi, Atomic Caf, Gimme Shelter are examples of this; they are all works of art. Making and understanding such a doc requires a greater amount of effort, but it yields a more satisfying experience.Nowadays filmmakers have reverted to the primitive form of beating us over the head with their message, telling us at every turn what we should think. Supersize Me falls exactly into this category, we are given no chance to think for ourselves. The message is a good one, no quarrel there, but ultimately the film resembles the fast food it criticizes - superficially appealing but unedifying. There has been a whole slew of docs like this - Bowling for Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11, The Corporation - and I have been unwilling to take issue because I agree with the messages they contain. But I don't want this unimaginative and conventional style to become the norm! I ask documentary-makers to study Godfrey Reggio and the Maysles brothers, so they can learn how to purvey their message with elegance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super Size Me (2004) Review: Let me make this clear. This is a bad movie. Sure, a lot of people are overweight, but McDonald's is not the Root of all evil. There are many ways to destroy your body. McDonald's is good stuff to me. I eat all kinds of fat and calories, but I do something about it. I Exercise. That is what the problem here is that people do not have the motivation or will to get up off their ass and work out.If you have a let's say construction as a job, then eating McDonald's will not kill ya for you work off the fat and calories that you currently ate by working and exercise! If you do not, then take daily strolls, go to a health club, or another problem can be the cause.....alcohol.This movie is clearly trying to crucify McDonald's and get the attention of all the veggie-heads out there and say they are the cause of obesity in America. Wrong. Anyone will also know that if they are aware of a weight problem should blame themselves not McDonald's or this can lead to easy lawsuits. It's McDonald's, not freaking Weight Watchers! Having McDonald's once in a while is not bad and taste good too.Bad parenting, drugs, and alcohol can lead to this. Over-eating is just one of the problems. If you are gaining, then get some exercise and go to Subway if the problem does not stop. Leave McDonald's alone. They are not the problem.The Last Word: A wake up call? No. A sad attempt at slander to McDonald's. Exercise is the solution. Exercise!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The number of entertainment films masquerading as documentaries has increased exponentially in recent years, spurred, I'm sure, by the somewhat curious success of Michael Moore. Gone are the days when filmmakers and their associates would dig through musty stacks of records or film archives to assemble a comprehensive tome on a given subject. Now, it appears, all one needs is a camera and a bullhorn.Which is sad, because the stated premise of this film is intriguing; if a person were to eat nothing but food available from a fast food chain, what would be the effect on that person's health? We may find the answer to that question someday, but you won't find it in this movie. No, what you'll find is a man who sets out to defame an industry and willfully risks his own health to do so. In the interest of "science", Mr. Spurlock starts eating everything on the McDonald's menu, choosing not on the basis of his appetite but in an attempt to eat everything on the menu. Always "supersize"ing his order whenever the choice was offered, finishing everything he ordered regardless of his appetite while simultaneously halting his routine exercise regimen, he gained weight and lost muscle tone! Amazing! And entertaining, in a "Fear Factor" sort of way. But a documentary? Only if you consider it as such in the context of documenting his attempt to defame McDonald's. Sadly, I'm sure that this won't be the last we'll hear from Mr. Spurlock. In these days of television shows like "Trading Spouses" and "My Big Fat Obnoxious Fianc" his work just may be what the public wants. But, to me, it was 96 minutes of my life that I'll never get back...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course if anyone were to eat McDonald's and only McDonald's for every single meal every day for a month you would gain a ton of weight. No one goes to McDonald's for a meal because they're looking to watch their cholestoral. McDonald's should be somewhere you go to eat once a week to treat yourself or just because you're looking for a quick meal through a drive thru. You can eat healthy with all your organic and/or vegetable whatever food at home the rest of the week. But if someone had a diet where they always ate exactly what they're supposed to every single meal and never ever cheated you'd live a very boring life. You're not eating just to eat something to keep you alive you eat stuff that tastes good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So who's to blame again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2004 documentary "Super Size Me" takes on one of the most universally recognized icons of the modern world: the fast-food giant, McDonalds. The 100-minute film follows director, actor and lab rat, Morgan Spurlock as he follows a regimen of nothing but McDonalds fare for breakfast, lunch and dinner, every day for 30 days. During this time he is closely monitored by three doctors, a dietician, a physical therapist, his girlfriend, and (of course) a full compliment of cameras.The changes that occurred in Morgan's body and psyche were quite dramatic. At the beginning of the experiment, his health was attested to be above-average by his three doctors. At the end of his month-long McDiet, Morgan had gained twenty-four and a half pounds. His cholesterol shot up 65 points and his body fat percentage went from eleven to eighteen percent. His doctors told him he had nearly doubled his risk of coronary heart disease, and had made himself twice as likely to have heart failure. In addition to the damage done to his body, Morgan said, "I felt depressed and exhausted most of the time, my mood swung on a dime and my sex life was non-existent. I craved this food more and more when I ate it, and got massive headaches when I didn't." (Spurlock) The journey ends with a memorable rant where the fast food industry is portrayed as a powerful machine that is continually moving forward. It will always act in its own interests, heedless of the cost to the general population. "I guess the real question is," Spurlock asks after showing a photo of a cemetery, "who do you want to see go first? You? Or them?" "Super Size Me" does an excellent job of showing how fast food is a (ahem) large problem in America, and that the dangers of eating fast food are (pardon the pun) grave. However, the film failed to so much as mention the root cause of this problem, or provide a viable solution.Is the solution to sue the super-companies who own the fast food restaurants for making their customers fat? Is it to institute a "fat tax" to make it less affordable for big fat Joe to stuff his big fat face with big fat Mac? Or is the solution to spread mud in the face of the fast food industry until the public is no longer appetized by what they see? There are those who believe that these are real solutions to our nation's obesity woes.However, as the film itself states, companies are going to sell what the public demands. In a capitalistic world, what people want is what they get. Turns out America wants fast food, and lots of it, and amazingly enough, there are people out there who are willing to sell it to them. What's more, there are other people who will try to fix their bloated bodies when they break down, and still other people who will sell them over-sized coffins when they die (that would be me).However, has anybody asked why people want fast food? Could it possibly be because nobody is cooking at home any more? The problem is not that there is too much fast food out there, or that it is too available, too inexpensive, too advertised, or even too fattening. The problem is that there is no real food inside the home, because there is nobody there to cook it.While it is nice to wax eloquent on the evils of big business, the only way that change is going to amount to anything is if it begins at the individual level. When individual men and women make wise choices, they lead healthy lives and build healthy families. When healthy families provide their children with three healthy meals a day, they will raise a generation who will want to do the same. When generations of people are getting their meals at home every day, in a healthy, enjoyable environment, McDonalds will go out of business.</fullReview>

And plenty of sheeple to follow him, and his misguided information.

		<shortDescription>Stumbling over the very foundation stones of film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with the bad points. Super Size Me was made on a semi-amateur basis. But even only a semi-professional documentary cannot commit the grave mistakes of basic film making rules. Good footage has 4 characteristics: the images must be sharp, properly exposed, stable and cropped. Footage out of focus is unacceptable even for home made family videos, let alone a documentary to be distributed. The unsteady images can be justified, and at some points unavoidable, but it usually just gives the spectator a headache. Also lighting - even in a documentary - should be taken care of. Many images were overexposed. The crop defines what is important, and it is presented in a balanced layout. This was many times completely missing. Film editing programs are now easy at hand and have lots of lovely built-in gadgets, that are fun to play with, but give the film a very cheap appearance. The overload of these gadgets makes Super Size Me really messy. For the content, the idea is interesting. But in the end, I knew no more of the subject than what is general knowledge. The only thing that shocked me, was that someone can mistake Jesus for George Bush, no matter how young they are. The actual outcome is shallow. I was left with the image that no adult knows what a calorie is, which I hope is not the real case. The storyline is hard to follow, because Morgan Spurlock has dragged in so many different subjects: the obesity of the nation, the effect of advertising, McDonald's food, general knowledge of Americans, the lawsuit against McDonald's, eating habits of schools... Each topic vast enough to make a documentary in itself. I myself found some of the scenes disgusting and very much out of point. I cannot see why a documentary on McDo's food should tell about fat surgery, which again is a topic in itself. Puking scenes brings to mind a teenage party with excessive drinking and its results. To the good points. It was funny. At times. Morgan Spurlock has a positive air around him. I hope also the film has some impact on the food industry, and especially school nutrition. All in all, a long home made film worth seeing once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this "documentary" is a self-serving load of ap-cray. Most of what makes it awful has been said here but I just wanted to pile on with the observation that there is nothing, even a super-sized drum of Coke, that disgusts me more than a vegan looking down his/her nose. Did you catch the girlfriend writhe in agony when considering the prospect of sitting next to the "documentarian" while he ate his fast food? Many of us who eat meat have had encounters with this kind of person who feels it necessary to register some kind of physical repulsion at the sight of your entree. And on the eve of the great sacrifice the "documentarian" is served a vegan meal which was accompanied by the very predictable swooning vegans also feel the need to do when presenting their dishes - " Oh and here is some wonderful and fresh organic endive salad, and some really yummy soy bean rugola with wheat grass tapinade." These people just can't help themselves - they know better than you, you are just uneducated and if you only knew what was healthy then you too would know what tastes good. Of course we are shoveling fast food down at an alarming rate, the reasons for that could make for a good documentary - what this thing is is a sort of elitist meat-hating snobfest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sad that we seem to need this kind of 'documentaries' to be taught to eat moderately and varied. Even if you overeat on only fruits or only vegetables, you will suffer the unhealthy consequences.In Holland there was a same kind of documentary, as a antagonist against this 'Super size me', and our own lab rat ate at Mac Donalds' for 30 days. He only differed in his approach by eating moderately and varied (as far as that is possible at the Mac D's). The result: he lost 6,4 kilos, decreased his waist by 5 centimeters, and was in a better physical state than before his 'diet'.The goal was to prove that 'Super size me' makes no sense, you can overeat and become unhealthy on any kind of food. Just as you can stay healthy when you variate and moderate on Mac D's. You should see both documentaries (learn Dutch first) to learn the real lesson; moderate and variate, as far as you did not know that..KeesJan van der Elst</fullReview>

And anyone who goes to see it knows that the guy's gonna pickle his liver and be asked to stop by his doctors. Why doesn't he stop? Cause he's about to cash in. He knows that a lot of people are going to watch this movie. Most of them already know that fast food is bad. Or they're obese and they think this movie is going to be some kind of inspiration. Heck, there were at least 15 fatsos in the theater with me that had large popcorn with butter. And aside from the high price they're paying at the concession stand, they're paying to see his movie. I wonder how many of them bolted for the arches as soon as the movie let out. I know i wanted to. This guy was probably secretly funded by Mc-ee-Deees just so that people would crave the food afterwards. I mean the dude just wasn't as funny as he wanted to be, wasn't as good a documentarian as he wanted to be, but i guess it doesn't matter cause he's about to be as rich as he'd always dreamed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That eating every day at McDonald's (or any other fast food restaurant) is unhealthy goes without saying. That doing so can have very bad consequences for our health in the long run is equally obvious. And I don't object to having these facts pointed out. And yet... for a supposed documentary, "Supersize Me" was remarkably implausible. I found myself doubting the truth of almost everything I saw.I don't doubt for a second that Spurlock gained weight during his experiment. But I don't buy for a second that eating at McDonald's made him vomit. Nor do I buy the idea that he'd suffer from impotence or develop a life-threatening liver condition after just a few weeks. In short, I think Spurlock and his doctors are liars.That's not to say their overall points aren't valid. Again, eating junk food on a regular basis DOES have bad long-term consequences. But a month is not the long term! It certainly isn't long enough for any serious health effects to show themselves. And that, I think, is why Spurlock felt the need to exaggerate and distort the truth.Mind you, I think Spurlock is a decent person, and I'm sure he is lying with the best and most noble of intentions, just as many anti-smoking crusaders lie about the effects of smoking second-hand smoke. They're so sure that they're right, and they're so sure of the righteousness of their cause, they can't see how ANY tactic could be wrong.If Spurlock were here with me, I suspect he'd tell me, confidentailly, "Okay, okay, so I exaggerated a bit. So I staged the vomit scene. So I got the doctor to overstate the damage to my liver. I admit, I'm a little bit of a fraud. But where's the harm? If I manage to scare some people into eating less junk, that's a GOOD thing, isn't it?"Well, no. Lying isn't a good thing, even if the desired end result is a noble one. That's why, even though Spurlock is a likeable, charming and even funny guy, I can't recommend this movie. At all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore shouldn't feel too bad if "Super Size Me" wins the Oscar for best documentary, since it's basically a Michael Moore film anyway. Morgan Spurlock has a breezy, likable screen presence, and he keeps his film entertaining and well-paced, but in terms of tone, style and technique he's nothing more than MM 2. And even Moore, for all his excesses, has a thread of genuine righteous indignation that runs through his work ? there's always an angry populism at the root of his attacks. Spurlock, on the other hand, seems to have undertaken this project more for sh*ts and giggles than anything else, although he certainly bashes McDonald's enough, which always goes over well with the kinds of people who watch documentaries. But that brings us to another problem ? is any of this all that shocking? The film's content effectively boils down one simple statement: fast food is bad for you. That's hardly a verdict that's going to make headlines, although as I said, the movie's watchable enough, and I suppose it will make people feel better about themselves as they laugh at the corporate behemoth and its stupid customers and pat themselves on their own fat backs. But the film is ultimately not much of an achievement ?a pretty small fry in the larger cinematic picture. 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The assumption behind this documentary is that consumers do not know what is good for them. McDonalds has succeeded in brainwashing millions through its advertising. Obesity is therefore the responsibility of McDonalds and other fast food providers.Given this starting assumption, Spurlock then takes us on a dramatic 30 days ride in which he consumes nothing but McDonalds. We watch as his health falls precipitously and as he skilfully re-directs our disgust away from his own stupidity at attempting this diet and towards the corporation.My primary objection to the film is its premise. That's an important objection. Its easy to simply blame faceless corporations for our ills, but responsibility ultimately lies with the consumer in my view. Other than that, the film isn't bad. Spurlock comes across as a decent guy. Some opposing points of view survive editing, which is more than I can say for Michael Moore (Spurlock is less entertaining than Moore, though). And watching Spurlock's health deteriorate is both frightening and interesting.Occasionally interesting and at times fun, but in the end a cheap shot at an easy target.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Somewhat Pointless Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one - least of all me - is going to disagree with what Morgan Spurlock discovered as a result of this documentary. I will, however, wonder why he bothered. Let's see. He discovered that if you eat nothing but McDonald's food for a month - breakfast, lunch and dinner for 30 days - you'll get sick. That's hardly earth-shaking news. He discovered that there are a lot of obese Americans. Walk through any shopping mall in the United States and you can see that. He discovered that the fast food industry tries to get us hooked on their food. For those earth-shaking discoveries I needed a documentary? Basically, that's why I didn't care for this. It failed to do the thing that a documentary should do: it didn't teach me anything. That left me wondering what Spurlock was really hoping to accomplish. He seemed sincere. He really seemed to want to know what would happen if he proceeded with this insane experiment. In fairness, the doctors he consulted seemed to suggest that they didn't think the all McDonald's diet would have such an impact on his health - which (I'm sorry) makes me question their medical credentials! But to me this was like running an experiment to see if water will evaporate when the temperature reaches the boiling point of water! But - as obvious as this was - Spurlock persists in the experimental diet even after all of his doctors tell him to stop. If I'm questioning the doctors' credentials at this point, I'm questioning Spurlock's sanity as well.He seemed to be trying to put together a Michael Moore-type of quasi-documentary, but in all honesty he's nowhere near as good. Moore - while he makes lousy documentaries (because what's he really makes is propaganda) - at least manages to put out stuff that's both interesting and entertaining. I found this dull because the message was so obvious, and the experiment so absolutely over the top ridiculous. Will very many people give up fast food because of this? Not likely. The fast food addicts will say "well - duh - you're not supposed to eat it three times a day for a month," and they'll continue merrily eating it 5 times a week. As the movie closes, Spurlock seems to be taking credit for a decision by McDonald's to stop "super-sizing" because it happened a few weeks after the movie. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt on that. We'll say the movie forced McDonald's hand. This is still a pretty silly documentary!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just let me say I'm not a fan of Micheal Moore and his relentless pursuit of sitting ducks in one-note diatribes mounted with the sophistication of an emotionally stunted 12-year-old supercharged on additives. Fortunately for the "Super Size Me" crew, though, it means their only major competition is a fame-hungry hysteric who looks like he INVENTED "Super Size", so Morgan Spurlock walks away looking like a philosophy professor.This isn't award-winning or life-changing cinema, it's an entertaining and mildly informative anti-corporate stunt. It avoids the worst aspects of Moore's catch-all strategy of taking a film crew to someone's office or home and shouting them until the audience starts to sympathies with the Devil. Spurlock's notional target is McDonalds, but when he fails to arrange an interview with any senior executives he preserves his dignity by choosing not to pursue them to their beds with a loudhailer.The film is notionally a reaction to a court case in which two obese American teenagers tried to sue McDonalds for making them fat. The film attacks McDonalds's claims about the healthiness of its food with a subtlety only usually seen in Adam Sandler movies. The obvious pitch and tag-line is Spurlock's 30-day McDonalds diet, a childish stunt that is actually an effective smoke-screen for most of the more serious underlying issues he raises.There are a couple of real triumphs in the film. The lawyer for the two obese teens is literally unable to think of a better motive for the case than the potential cash compensation. An American food industry marketing spokesman slips up and admits "we are part of the problem", and by the time the film was released was out of a job. We're told that most American schools use "lowest bidder" catering giants to provide horrifically unhealthy meals for children, or serve slop that arrives in cartons for the school kitchen staff to nuke and serve. We see how school meals cooked on site using unprocessed ingredients can actually improve the behaviour of "troubled" children. We also discover that most of the American population who are not rocket (or food) scientists have no idea what a calorie is.There are some nightmarishly wrong-headed moments, like the extended sequence showing how a potentially terminal diabetic the size of a small house, who used to drink 2 gallons of "soda" a day, has most of his stomach surgically removed. An inarticulate bag of lard is embarrassed on a global scale by her pointless recriminations against the sinister character peddling something called the "Subway Diet", an apparent promise to make you thin if you eat at one of McDonalds fast food franchise rivals. And there is always the McDonalds diet itself, a New York slacker's idea of subversive intellectual terrorism which doesn't so much form a thread from which to hang the other stories as dominate everything pretty much to their exclusion.I mean, what is the water cooler moment for this movie? The school meal technician whose favourite cooking tool is the blade she uses to slice open boxes of pre-cooked stodge? Or the REALLY COOL part where the guy just, like, hurls his Super Size double quarter pounder into the parking lot?On the whole it was fun, and showed the give and take of global scale corporations. McDonalds won their day in court, a judge decided they officially didn't make the girls fat, so they dropped "Super Size" from their menu. The film-makers get a pat on the back from their liberal peers, a great distribution deal, and a watered-down anti-globalisation message into the marketplace. Occasional fast food customers lose the chance of getting a better-than-snack-size portion for a couple of pennies, and no-one even pauses to wonder would McDonalds have really dropped "Super Size" if it wasn't just a loss-leader with a microscopic impact on their bottom line?</fullReview>

I eat there no more than once or twice a week.He didn't even mention that many fast food dishes contain healthy ingredients as well (like tomatoes).I even read an article that stated eating pizza is not as bad for you as originally thought because of it's nutritional value (i.e. calcium, fiber, Vitamin C &amp; D). So this movie is over-hyped. I've eaten at fast food joints for over two decades and am still alive and well. Never had a stroke because I exercise when possible and take vitamins.I also don't care for the message "Super Size Me" sends about obese people. That all women should strive to look like a super model and that if you're obese, you're a loser. I don't think so. There is too much pressure in society to be like this and it often results in mental illness. Enough is enough.The only effect this movie had on me is an increase in appetite. Those Big Macs he chomped on looked tasty, didn't they? and the cold milkshakes...I'm there!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathetic, Imbecilic, Retarded American Claptrap! This movie proves NOTHING except what everyone already knew!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the Average American Citizen doesn't have over 450 dollars to feed just themself for a month. A "Supersized" meal cost at least $5. Three meals a day would make it 15. Multiply that times 30 and you have at least 450, which is the minimum spent on this guy's food for a month, if you don't count expensive New York prices. You might remember the part when he paid almost $14 for ONE meal.And that's without "In between meal" snacks.Second, the Average American Citizen doesn't subsist on Fast Food.Third, the only reason there's a McDonald's all over the place is because people in general want to eat and go and McDonald's wouldn't make any business whatsoever if they weren't LIKED. If we want to talk about them sprouting up all over the place, why don't we consider the SLIM JIM or Jerky Stick at any convenience store, which is located for CONVENIENCE. McDonald's gets business because it's CONVENIENT.Fourth, this guy FORCED HIMSELF to take the SUPER SIZE meal when it was OFFERED, NOT FORCED. Just like everyone else was OFFERED and not FORCED.Fifth, he forced himself to swallow every bite and drink sip at that point of the day instead of stopping when he was FULL. Otherwise, there'd be a new job position called "Vomit Mopper" at every restaurant you could name.Sixth, no one has ever gone to a fast food for Nutritious Food; they're Snacks to tide you over, because everybody knows that making your own food from the grocery store is LESS EXPENSIVE.Seventh, how can you possibly say you're physically addicted to a Specific Fast Food restaurant's Specific Food when you don't even try to eat anything else? If you're not going to have a sandwich or anything else (from home or elsewhere), it's a pathetic conclusion.There are many more things I can point out that prove this movie is nothing more than Pathetic, Imbecilic, American Claptrap, but I don't have all night, nor do I have enough space to put it on this page.By the way, the reason I mention the word American in this review is because although there are reviews from all over the world, only an American would be stupid enough to think something was "Discovered" in this movie and had no common sense to question anything from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I have never been a fast food fan. But I left the theater thinking I just paid to watch a sermon. I guess if I had been a fast food eater, I would have been moved a bit more. Instead, I had the feeling I had just watched a propaganda film and I would be interviewed afterwards to see if I came to the proper conclusions. If not, it's back in the theater for another showing. It's rather like 9/11. You are being told what to think and paying for the privilege. Except 9/11 could be funny if you hated Bush. I would have enjoyed this a lot more on A&amp;E rather than a movie theater. Actually, I would enjoy it a lot more in my kids' school cafeteria but they would find it boring. It was a documentary rather like a professional wrestling match is a sport. OK, I hate McDonald's. Do I have to see it again?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One has to have lived in a cave for years to not realize that eating McDonald's, or any fast food, with great frequency is not going to be healthy. So it is surprising to me that so many seemingly intelligent reviewers can give this film such high marks.Near the end of the film, Spurlock states something like, "it's a business, no matter what they tell you." Of course it is. McDonald's, like all restaurants, wants you to eat there often and order a lot. It is up to each person to make responsible eating choices. Just as it is up to each person to be responsible with their money in this day of credit cards, rebates and interest-free financing.I've surely eaten my share of fast food, especially in my college years. I realized I could have made healthier choices and I'm a few pounds too heavy because of it (though I doubt it ever made me irritable or affected my sex drive). I blame only myself if my eating habits cause me health problems.The film seems to take pleasure in McDonald's refusal to respond to Spurlock's calls. What do they have to gain from participating in a project that is obviously biased against them? I imagine the smug Spurlock will soon find something else to produce another documentary about. And there are surely enough people looking to blame big business, or anyone else, to make it a success.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fancy fat, sugar and salt being bad for you! What a revelation.I love McDonalds. I CHOOSE to go there. Many of the commenters state that no one force feeds you fast food, but thats the opposite of what the poster for this film suggests, showing this complete idiot having his mouth stuffed full of fries.What really annoys me is the inference that fast food chains have tried to hoodwink customers into buying their products. Anyone that falls for a marketing campaign is an idiot.Its you lot that have been hoodwinked - into going to see this ridiculous, boring and pointless 'film'. The idiot that made it is laughing at you and getting fatter still on your cash.My favourite items on McDonalds menu are quarter pounders with cheese, large fries and coke. I loved the chicken Mcnuggets until they reduced the salt. All very tasty - but not a good idea to live on it as with any food. If you lived purely on lettuce or tomatoes you'd be pretty ill. If only there was something we had in our heads that stopped you eating whatever someone else suggested you should!How can you live with yourselves? Morons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BUBBA MEETS MCDONALD'S</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an awful movie, which is very frustrating considering the good reviews it got. The main things wrong with it are, briefly, it is stupid, and more to the point, dishonest. No one disagrees that fast food is not exactly the healthiest food in the world, but the maker of this movie is not content to present that. He does a preposterous experiment in which he eats nothing but McDonald's food for 30 days, and has all these presumably intelligent health experts take tests to see what is happening to his health. Except that is not what is done. He stuffs the food in beyond his appetite, beyond even his stomach's capacity. At one point he vomits it up, because he has continued to eat more than he can tolerate. He gains something like 20+ lbs in 30 days. His liver enzymes, uric acid, cholesterol go bonkers. Guess what? If you ate fig newtons, Indian food, Chinese food, French Food, Thai food, organic food, yogurt, Cheerios, granola, if you ate the healthiest foods in the world to that excess, to the point of gaining all that weight, your body would go equally bonkers. The movie is dishonest because I can't believe that point wasn't made to him by one of his three doctors. Clearly he deliberately edited it out. And if none of them did mention it what can I say? He should have gotten more competent people to evaluate his experiment.This may all seem picky but on the contrary it is crucial!!!! Because without those abnormal lab tests the movie would reduce to don't eat too much fatty foods. It isn't good for you. But no one. Repeat no one would eat any food to the point this guy did. It is like going to a party in the 4th grade, stuffing yourself with candy and cake and ice cream, with the obvious result that you feel and are sick (since our bodies cannot not take that kind of overload) and then proceed to do that meal after meal for thirty daysIs this going to be standard fare for documentaries now that they are in? Will you, in order to be a sensation at Sundance, have to resort to black and white, Hollywood, dramatizations of reality. Anything else is boring? Are vegan's going to be advising us on healthy living. Well, until the entertainment people are bored with it, say good-bye to a genre that has historically had a lot of integrity.The movie was mildly interesting, but mostly disgusting as a story about the bubba in us guys, the beer swigging pig in most men that would love to throw caution and discipline to the wind, tell their vegan girlfriend to forget it, (in his case even give up on sex) and all the rest of it, in order to absolutely let go and gorge ourselves. I guess that feels like being free. He seemed so good at it that I predict he will be there within the next 10 or 15 years. This is a movie about him. The style, the relaxed standards are not a comment on America but the self satisfied, I am just a regular stupid guy, ain't I funny mentality that passes for being a bubba guy.Once again, the movie was irritating in its inaccuracies, but the real shocker is that this movie got great ratings from most of the critics that Tomato uses for its ratings. Maybe some of these critics also should use their brain a little more instead of their gut.(By the way I don't own stock in McDonald's and although I truly love Egg Mcmuffins, and consider their french fries perfection, I eat them only as a special treat, because of health concerns. I'm simply offended by the glib corporate stabs. I think modern corporations suck but the problem here isn't them. It is us. Our pleasure driven, don't say no, give them cake, put them in day care culture accounts for our gluttony, not McDonald's)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film proves nothing besides the fact that some people has no shame in their effort to make money and get known.If you take literally ANY normal hot meal, even at the most posh restaurants, eat it three times a day in large quantity and sit on your ..., then you get fat. Any imbecile can figure that out. Why does this idiotic film get any public attention then? Because we love to see the big guys get beaten to a pulp. If a person or company gets big enough they attract persons like Michae Moore and Morgan Spurlock like dung attracts flies. They get their moment of fame by doing psykological terrorism. And the mindless masses eat it up just like all tabloid media draws on the lowest instincts of people: malicius glee, envy.It's in fashion for americans to soil their own nest and the rest of the world that hates USA intensely for being strong and successful leaps in squeeling. This is the downside and price of free speech and let's keep it that way. But it also gives me the freedom to name those people for what they are, vile!</fullReview>

This movie should be best seen as an attempt by the uneducated and quick-to-judge element of the political left to appropriate some of Fox News's fear-mongering and rhetorical shortcuts for its own. This one-sided expose will not convince anyone who does not already dislike McDonalds to dislike it, and has an uncanny side-effect of making one really want a hamburger.</fullReview>

Not sure how this qualifies as entertainment.This country has hit an all time low when people can't even take personal responsibility for the food they put in their mouth. Instead of eating healthy and exercising, let's wring our hands, complain about being victims, and file lawsuits against McDonalds. Our founding fathers must be rolling over in their graves.In summary, read the plot in paragraph one, and instead of watching 2 hours of a political activist trolling for class action lawyers, take a nice walk or bike ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While a well meaning documentary, I am not a fan of anyone who makes themselves a destructive guinea pig to prove a well documented point.Maybe....it's because I watched this film knowing that if anyone eats three to five meals a day at a fast food restaurant for a month is just asking for it. And maybe...its because I was aware that the fast food restaurants were already in the process for 5 years PRIOR to this film to market salads and fruit as alternatives to fries and burgers. McDonalds, Wendys and Burger King had already market tested in key markets in the United States such as salads, fruit dishes, etc. to the public before unveiling it as permanent menu items.Or maybe...its because I know its all about the real sin....profit. From the fast food dealers and the filmmaker as well.But enough about my view on the logic, this film is meant to justify a view that maybe human beings are packing on the pounds because of fast food. Sure, could be. It could also be several other factors contributing as well. But to put your health in jeopardy to prove your point, well...kudos for you...and your outright stupidity. This was a film about CHOICES. It was the filmmaker CHOICE to subject himself through this. His choice to show "me" how bad fast food is?!?!?! How stupid he thinks the public at large is. And then be credited for something that has been 'in the works' for years at fast food franchises across the country. That is a 'Reaganesque' conception. And we as a people need to get out of that mode of thought and get back to common sense.I feel it would be much similar, as if I, who has never smoked a day in my life, deciding to smoke four packs of cigarettes a day for 30 days to see if I would get lung cancer -- or any other host of ailments. Just to prove to folks that smoking kills. Or how 'bout I live next to chain smokers for 30 days and develop respiratory ailments just to prove what one should already know.Would I get Cancer? Would my blood pressure rise? Birth Control Failure? Gain a series Respiratory infections? You bet. I don't think I'd have to do a documentary to let folks know that. They know. But WHY do they continue after the facts? Now, that's the basis of a documentary. This wasn't. And what will that do? Have the tobacco industry tax cigarettes so that no one will smoke any more? Destroy the ability for free will and free choice of a human being's choices? Talk about how the medical industry is getting rich off of smokers and non smokers subjected to second hand smoke? Come on, common sense here. Thomas Paine is rolling over in his grave...again.Don't get me wrong....the idea behind this film is important, and yes, I'll admit many folks DON'T know and will eat this every day. But maybe what needs to happen is that instead of subjecting oneself through such personal health debauchery, one should go to schools and fight harder for American History and Political Science classes for all 12 years of schooling -- and NO ONE graduates until they "get it".Maybe then if that history and Poli-Sci was drilled year after year in the American educational system, there would be no need for this and one can understand why waistlines expanded and contracted....even before "fast food" franchises and direct and indirect marketing tactics targeted to every age.Now that's an idea for a documentary.</fullReview>

Throughout the course of this film you get to watch Morgan whine,puke,whine some more and get very sick(or so he says). Spurlock clearly has a liberal agenda. He is anti-corporation and feels the media is run by evil capitalists(like McDonalds) who are out to brainwash our youth.He clearly supports the law suits against McDonalds for making people obese(since the release of this film a law was passed that people can longer sue fast food joints for their self inflicted problems). This idiot even equates the old days of tobacco advertising to to the fast food ads of today. In the end the film was really much ado about nothing. The only thing it may have accomplished is that McD's have stopped there Super Size deals. Big whoop! People are still eating fast food in droves and putting money in the greedy capitalist pigs pockets. Left leaning Spurlock gets his point across in the very first 5 minutes of the film.

		<fullReview>Doing anything to excess is bad for you and it is great that this film makes a parody of the American diet. The problem is that people should be able to have the freedom to choose what they eat and when. They should then be held accountable for your own actions. It is ridiculous to come out after the fact and blame the evil corporations. Smart people can do something in moderation or accept the consequences. We are raising up a very weak generation that will not take responsibility for its actions. One day because of this they will outlaw the Hamburger completely and replace it with tofu so no one else can get hurt. The problem with this is that responsible people can eat a super-sized meal and not have any ill effects because they are balancing it with exercise or at least an active lifestyle. No one tells anyone what to eat and in what quantity. If someone does anything consistently they need to take the responsibility for it and get a little will power. Unfortunately, as long as there are unscrupulous trial lawyers I don't think that will happen. As I noted above, this is a great parody of the American diet, however eating with the gluttonous intention to destroy your body to make a point could be taking it a bit far. Being this single minded and obsessive about anything can be dangerous for both your health and your thought process and therefore your objectivity.</fullReview>

Spurlock directs, writes, stars in and carries out the most interesting documentary experiment I have ever seen. America is the fattest nation in the world and with the biggest stuff, and fast food is really popular. People have claimed fast food, especially McDonald's is not good for you, so Spurlock carries out an experiment to see what happens if he eats nothing but McDonald's for a month. Rules: He can only 'Super Size' the meal if asked, he can only eat and drink what McDonald's sells (water included), he must have every food at least once, and he must have the three meals, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Also in the black comedy documentary he gets people's and experts opinions about fast food and the industry and problems. Will Morgan survive the experiment, will his liver be okay, and will his girlfriend let him carry on? It was number 19 on The 50 Greatest Documentaries. Very good!</fullReview>

We are told that the only reason people are fat in this country is that we eat at Mcdonalds and have crappy school lunches.What the film maker fails to mention or even understand is that we have choices in this country. We are free and we are capitalist. No one at Mcdonalds makes anyone walk through the front door and order anything. No one at our public schools force kids to buy the fatty lunches there either. It seems we are blaming the wrong people for poor parenting skills.Mcdonalds and other fast food restaurants serve legal products and advertise aggressively. Big whoop! If you don't like a business in this country, don't patronize it. Why crucify Mcdonalds for being uniquely American. It is helpful to remember that Mcdonalds did not start as some huge, evil, rich empire in the 1950's. They were, first, a small family hamburger stand and they made good, the American way.So if you take the non-veiled message of the movie at face value- You, Mr and Mrs America, are brain dead idiots buying and eating things you don't even like and don't understand, at the whimsy of a giant evil company hell bent on killing it's best customers.Pure idiocy, once again, from the liberal left.I bet this guy would love to have drinks (organic water- LOL) with Michael Moore....</fullReview>
