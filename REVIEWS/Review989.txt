		<shortDescription>Better than Bourne!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not speaking frivolously when I say that overall, although produced with a fraction of the budget, this is a much better film than the fourth Bourne.Specifically: * great opener -- film opens with a dramatic situation that immediately grabs the viewers' attention. You have "connection" from the getgo.* great script --- many layers and twists. Clever dialog. (At one point the bad guys gloat about how they are manipulating "the hashtags" -- thereby dissing an entire generation. Another line of dialog refers to the use of "action and reaction" to achieve their end -- which is a very sophisticated dig at how politics are managed today.) * Director writer Watkins know to keep things interesting, you are never bored.* Elba is nothing short of awesome. Other reviewers are saying he could be a major international action figure. Agree! Solid entertainment, does not take the viewer for granted, and the clever story keeps you hooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprised this isn't at least in the 7's on here. Elba is excellent, no cheesy crap Bond esque love interests. Just a proper thriller with some great twists and decent action sequences. Some comical moments in a non Marvel universe cheesy way. Nothing incredibly new with the plot, but it does keep you interested for the duration. The end hints at a sequel, which could be interesting.If you like a good action / thriller - this is the best I've seen in a long while. Not quite as good as the old Bournes, but certainly better than recent Bonds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm torn between a 6 and 7 for this film. This has everything a good thriller should have, but nothing notably unique about the film or the way it's done past the protagonists and some of the cinematography.The film is a spiral into chaos and the characters are very likable, forming an unlikely friendship between a thief and a CIA agent. Idris Elba and Richard Madden show off some great acting that really drives the film, with the dialogue between the two easily being my favourite part of the film. The directing is great, too, with a riveting chase sequence that looks and feels exciting and some lovely cinematography in France.The premise isn't anything amazing, but throwing a sly, witty pocket thief into the mix of what would be an ordinary every-year thriller is what drives the film and makes it anything worth noting. If you're going to see this film for any reason, it should be for the two leads. Bastille Day is nothing unique, but it's definitely a good film if you're in the mood for a thriller (however I'd recommend Eye in the Sky over this). This is a film for people that are into thrillers and fun character interaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trigger Warning(s): Bomb In Public Place | Hanging BodyCharacters Worth NotingSean Briar (Idris Elba) | Michael Mason (Richard Madden)Main Storyline With the CIA having active surveillance in France, naturally when an American citizen is accused of being a terrorist they try to nab him before the French. Thing is, this would be American terrorist is simply a very adept pickpocket named Michael who stole from the wrong person. Thus leading him to be the fall guy for a group which, at first, seems to be about fueling anti-immigrant sentiment. Though Agent Briar's investigation reveals it isn't something as interesting as that.{Commentary}The idea of people manipulating anti-immigrant sentiment, especially in a country like France where the immigration of Muslims is a hot button issue, I found to be quite interesting and provocative. For whether the goal would be anti-immigrant legislation, a war, be it foreign or civil, or just plain chaos, being that natives were the catalyst it seemed like one hell of a plot. Well, sadly my optimism was dashed quickly and swiftly as we learned everything was simply about creating an opportunity to steal money. My disappointments didn't end there, though. Like many others, part of the reason for seeing this film, besides Elba being a decent action hero, was to see what Richard Madden was like outside of Game of Thrones. Unfortunately, be it my own mental type casting, or Madden just not charismatic to break out from the role yet, what you get is an adept pickpocket who seems without much in the way of personality. However, I won't fully blame Madden for honestly, from Elba to Madden, damn near every character is shallow and forgettable.Which isn't to say we aren't told things about them. The problem is, everything we are told is but a quick snippet told by a 3rd party. A method of story telling which strips whatever nuance the character could give their own life, and with no one really seems to want to open up and be vulnerable toward one another, for after all there are bombings and riots on the streets, it turns the film into a generic action movie. For, to me anyway, the only time it felt like people were excited and into what was happening, was when bullets and fists were flying.Review Summary HighlightsThe action of the movie definitely helped push the idea Elba could handle becoming James Bond if both parties would pursue such an idea.Low PointsThe characters are thinly written and the movie is more about the action than anything else. There are multiple roads avoided which could make motives more complex, the characters more complex, and definitely more vibrant, but it seems the easy way is often chosen. Thus leaving us with a borderline mindless action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting concept with the thief and stealing the wrong bag.But would've been a lot better, if it was all french. The movie is entertaining if you take it for what it is. But it has too much American footprints all over it,when it come's to action. Even though the choreography is excellent executed There's too much gun waving in public.This worx great in movies that take place in America,but not so much in Paris.Different culture different rules.Also an American CIA agent going around Paris, acting like a bull in a china shop,this is also something that worx better in movies that take place in USA.Even though he is one in a million the French aren't incompetent ,and it would have to much of backlash on the agency But the movies isn't all bad.Though there are a few scenes that just make go, Really? Are they really gone do that,it's just get to stupid.All in all I feel the idea of the story could've been executed better. What ruins it most of it,is the whole CIA/America saving the day routine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre at best. Worth a watch just do not pay to much for the opportunity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actor who played the thief and the lady who was the bomb holder are unfamiliar to me. Idris Elba? Man what a waste of his time and energy. I like this guy and he is much to good an actor for this mediocrity. This movie was easily predictable after a while and really the only surprises were what the thief was doing to prove how good a thief he actually was. The cops in the movie? BORING, after you find out the head cop is the instigator of all the bad things happening in the flick. That is it no more surprises. Attacking Bastille? Come on, I did basic training at Ft Knox where there used to be at least a Division of Tanks. Two squads of regular police and a squad of SWAT cops?!!! For all those protesters? Guarding billions in gold and electronic money that the bad guys stole with a thumb drive?!! Nope, not buying it. It's worth watching but I'm really disappointed in Mr Elba for making this flick. Whoever talked him into it should be shot. Don't waste your money on this one, wait till it comes out on DVD or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst the movie concept is dated and extremely ironic, this is an enjoyable thriller. There is much media speculation regarding Idris Elba becoming the next Bond, possibly this was a pseudo-showcase of his potential? It is hard to see why he would otherwsie have taken on this project?Idris is a talented and charismatic actor. However, why become Bond? There must be a plethora of scripts for him to undertake similar characterisations to greater effect?The Bond movie franchise is something of a dinosaur, I would urge Idris Elba to create something different - he is a huge, trans-Atlantic star that does not require the Bond franchise to propel him. The Bond movies err toward big budget action, sacrificing a really well-crafted story. I would encourage Idris to ditch the action hero and look toward something more sentient like a Le Carre movie, with greater depth and longevity. Also, would like to see those novels remain within the time they were written - as they make so much more sense. Bond would be so much better if it had remained in the early 60s era...Idris dealing with a 60s world could also, potentially, involve some political statement?Bastille Day has a couple of plot twists, appears to have been budget-conscious and for the most part is predictable. It harks toward thrillers of the past. Nevertheless, it is enjoyable, but ultimately - forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is quite good. I just randomly picked it up to watch and it was a good watch. Not a single boring moment. Very good paced. Actors were good and believable. I loved the mixture of English and French. I loved the scenes of Paris as it is my favorite city and I just returned from there last week.I am not familiar with the mail role and that Afro American actor, but he was really good. Next James Bond?! hahaha I was trying and trying to remember where this 'thief' is familiar from and then I read here: Games of Thrones! Of course ... He was great too and especially coz this is the first ever film with him that I watched.Of course, French are the ones who are bad here and tried to solve their problems with Muslim population in a very terrible way. And of course, it is Americans who will save the day. I wonder how would they react if anyone makes a movie about French ( or any other nation) saving Black lives in America and doing that undercover exposing deliberate acts of terrorist by the CIA ( like on 9/11 ). Ah, yes, I forgot ... there are no problems in America. All in all, for what it is, it is a great thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the 6 rating is not deserved, better than other action movies with higher ratings.I was on my seat for most of the film. There wasn't too many boring parts as the movie was fast paced. It was interesting to see Madden who is from Game of Thrones, he looked familiar but I didn't realise it was him until after the filmThe acting was good by Idris, no typical annoying clichés like: -&gt; doing this for a relative -&gt; 30 trained people shooting, but no one can hit a target. -&gt; love interest to tap into a different demographic.I think could have been a 10, if the movie had a less predictable ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Mason, a pick-pocket living in Paris, steals a bag from a distressed woman. Not realising the bag contains a bomb, he tosses it in a bin on a busy street. It explodes, killing four people. CCTV footage reveals Masons face and the French police tag him as a terrorist threat. The explosion was set up by a group of the French Interior Ministry as a decoy so they can make a half billion dollar digital transfer from a bank, which would be closed on the titular day. CIA agent Sean Briar, discovers the real story behind Masons "terrorist attack", and the two collaborate to bring the corrupt members of the Ministry down......Another year, another action movie that seems out of time, because this is nothing more than a nuts and bolts film that features a gruff, grizzled, burnt out C.I.A agent, and a wisecracking criminal sidekick who is asking to be punched several times.Elba is wasted on this material, and although he puts in a worthy performance,the cliché riddled script takes out any urgency that the film may or may not have.The truth is, the film doesn't have any urgency, this film is a relic of the late nineties/early noughties, and should have starred Jason Statham and Lochlan Monroe, and even then, the only redeeming factor would have been the fight choreography.It plods along at a snails pace, the humour consists of nothing more than Mason antagonising Briar, which results in either Briar hitting him, or giving him a long hard stare.If you've seen any action film from any decade, you've seen the majority of this film.So part from seeing Elba audition for Bond, there's nothing to see here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather average action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as action movies go, this one is rather average. Even for an Euroflick it's only average, unfortunately. Considering the cast, I would have expected a bit more.Let's see what we have: The story is slightly far fetched, and considering the day and age, a bit 'frumpy'. A SWAT team orchestrates a false-flag bomb plot to distract the city of Paris in order to steal some money. The entire setup goes awry when a pickpocket steals the bomb. Briar, a disgruntled and somewhat grumpy CIA operative (with the obligatory heart of gold) saves the day by uncovering the plot that reaches up to the Minister of Interior. Unfortunately the movie looses itself in some inexplicable plot holes. First of all, the amount of money the SWAT team(under the protection of the MoI) wants to grab amounts only to 500 mil ?. Really? The European Central Bank alone pumped 1140 billions!!! into the system. So at least they could have transferred some billions of that cyber-money. 500 mil are just peanuts these days, considering the involvement of such high-ups.Then there is the good CIA, that has secret interrogation rooms in Paris, and which threatens the pickpocket with a non-marked flight that would bring him to some black site. They also withhold information from the French law enforcement and, like they do, crack the case on foreign soil w/o any consequences. Good grief, we know the CIA is almighty and does what it wants, but there is no need to play it down and pretend that it's okay what they do, as long they 'get their guy'. And there is the thing with the Minister himself. Who on God's green earth does his dirty work himself, when he's the -ing Minister? But this is a plot element used by quite a few writers.As far as thriller this does not add up. For an action flick it's tolerable.Let's check the technical side, which has a bit more to offer. The stunts are rather okay, some parts a really well done. Kudos to Mr. Elba (and his stuntman)! Filming is for the most part good, directing goes okay. One sour grape is the overuse of that horrid shaky camera in some pursuit scenes - I really hate those. There is such a thing as steady cam and image stabilisation, right? Editing could be a bit more refined, as well as the sound mixing. I presume the director's short resume might be a factor. Lighting and sets go totally okay. There are only a few scenes that look a bit 'cheap'. 2nd unit maybe? Acting is somewhat fair. I never really expect much from action flicks, so... All in all an almost decent action flick. Unfortunately they tried too hard to copy American action movies. Considering that Eurocinema, (especially the French and British movies) has their own style and flair. A bit more Euro-charm would have served the movie well. Not the best movie of the year, but not the worst either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We'll always have Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to forget that, during the making of this action film shot in Paris, the French capital was the scene of a brutal terrorist attack. Instead you have to go with the flow - and, boy, does it flow with constant flights and fights and a frenetically-cut chase sequence on rooftops that could have come straight out of a Bourne movie. British director James Watkins has given us a thoroughly entertaining romp that never lets up and looks great. The plotting is utterly implausible but the hard-as-diamond core is the former CIA agent Briar played wonderfully by Britain's Idris Elba in a role that could be seen as an audition to be the next James Bond. Not at all sure about his 'singing' over the credits though ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the constant debate about Elba running for the next Bond, I can't help but think this film is an application for Brit spy stardom. It's fast paced and the action is good though a little shaky and too rushed in parts. A lot happens in the 90mins Elba does a good stubborn, angry CIA agent that goes renegade, turning Game of Thrones' Rob Stark Aka Richard Madden into his pickpocketing bitch, I mean asset and develops a 48hr Murphy/Nolte relationship. Elba's massive presence is made known hitting hard whilst Madden portrays the meek, accidental terrorist. José Garcia's character French intelligence Victor, looked like he had be stylised by Tony Stark and isn't it ironic he was hypnotised robbing a French bank in Now You See Me? And Sherlock Holmes/Flight star Kelly Reilly just didn't do enough. She shows here talent in her previous films but seemed like a half-hearted performance. It's a shame the script wasn't as clever as the plot which was, for some parts, unpredictable; even though far fetched. The plot twists from a terrorist crisis into an elaborate bank heist. It's loaded with unbelievable, clichéd heroics, a French Revolution; hence the film's title and some unnecessary violence that doesn't make sense. Bent cop seeking redemption in the form of millions of dollars (not euros oddly enough) because of losing fellow comrades in action, yet, he'll happily hang one of his own men. It's spirals rapidly out of control as does Elba's character. There's some clever touches to the action and it's a good effort, I was entertained but nothing ground breaking.

		<shortDescription>Imposing and Exciting Idris Elba</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Idris Elba has been in big Marvel films like "Thor" and "Avengers: Age of Ultron", but I don't really know how he looked like without the Heimdall costume. He had a performance last year in the film "Beasts of No Nation" which triggered controversy when he was not nominated for an Oscar, but this was not shown locally. Just this year, he had been in two films, "Zootopia" and "The Jungle Book." However in both films, we only hear his deep imposing voice. With this film "Bastille Day," we finally see Idris Elba as a modern day action hero, not far from the news that he is being touted to be the next James Bond. Michael Mason is a skillful American thief in Paris. One day, he steals a bag from a distraught girl on the street named Zoe. After getting her cell phone and seeing nothing else of apparent value in the bag, he throws it into a garbage dump. The unexpected happens, killing four people and triggering mass paranoia and discontent in the city of Lights. CIA operative Sean Briar goes over and beyond his assignment to get to Mason and secure him before the French Police do, uncovering an insidiously complex plot which will come to pass on Bastille Day. Idris Elba is as imposing and impressive as his voice was. When asked why he ran away, Mason quipped, "Don't you see how you look like?" Elba's Briar was big, macho, tough and scary, anyone would have tried to run if he comes to get him. As an agent, Briar was an independent-minded and reckless rouge to the chagrin of his CIA bosses, but to the delight of the audience. If this was a preview of how he would be as James Bond, it makes us all eager to see how Elba will transform the iconic role as his own.Richard Madden is more known to many as the ill-fated Robb Stark on HBO's "Game of Thrones". After he bid the TV series goodbye via a bloody Red Wedding, he went on to be Prince Charming in the live action version of "Cinderella." Physically, Madden looked like a scared boy when placed side by side with the intimidating Idris Elba, which made him just right for the role of the unfortunate Mason, a guy who just so happened to steal the wrong bag. I liked the chemistry that was built between the two characters.I was floored by the action sequences of this film, so raw with bone- crunching realism. I liked that the chase and fight scenes were not too obviously choreographed. That chase scene on the rooftops would have been flawless parkour stunts in another film. But here it was shaky and so uncertain that it created so much tension, so much better. The execution of the many twists and turns of the story was very effectively done, such that we never would have seen the climax miles away. I would not mind a sequel as the ending seemed to suggest. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bastille Day is a "by the numbers" espionage thriller. That's not to say this is a poor film. What it does, it does well. There's a good cast including the talented Idris Elba in the role of a CIA operative. Great Parisian sets, locations and lots of predictable but still enjoyable, action sequences.Where it falls down somewhat is in the storytelling and character development, department. The storyline is a bit "thin", stretching credulity to its limit whilst not doing anything that, in one form or other, has not been done before. Equally, its s shame the character development was not better. Actors like Elba and the cast are not really given the opportunity to really "show off" their craft, with rather flat, action caricatures being the order of business instead.Putting these considerations aside, there's still more to like here than not. This film punches one ticket that all good films in this genre should, its has loads of mostly exciting action, that keep the film rolling along. Seven out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a decent film, fun enough for a (short) evening's watch. The great cast is very let down however, (especially the under-used Kelly Reilly), by rough and heavy-handed editing. Any depth, connection, or richness just got pulled out of the edited story. We really could have used about 20-25 more minutes to this thing, instead of the action-only version we got presented with. It seems it started out as a good concept, with some good planned twists (all of which are pretty 'Eh' when they actually happen), so it left me feeling a little disappointed, all in all. The 'buddy' feeling in the film just never developed as it obviously was supposed to, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing this film, especially as it had one of my favourite actors, Idris Elba and the director was James Watkins of Eden Lake fame. The film is set in Paris on the eve of Bastille Day and the plot for the film, while not being novel, was good with several twists and involved a covert CIA team trying to catch a supposed terrorist bomber, who happened to be American. However, why have 3 three main members of the CIA team played by British actors and why have the supposed American terrorist also played by a British actor. I know Hollywood is dull of non-Americans playing American roles, but the poor accents made it hard to take the film seriously. It would have been far better if it had been the British security service and a British supposed terrorist. I suspect the American theme was done with a view to the American cinema market. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to watch, but don't expect anything special.</fullReview>

He commits to the action hero role with a screen presence that carries the film, even as the script goes down every clichéd path B-grade action movie. The Paris we see is not the City of Lights but a place where the lead actor drives his way through gritty Parisienne outskirts, avoiding bad guys, all the way drawing the viewer's eye away from the secondary actors who never get a chance to flesh out their characters.

		<fullReview>The movie was scheduled in France around 14 of July 2016, and was removed from the schedule when the terrorist attack took place in Nice, to avoid hurting feelings. This gave probably an unexpected boost to the interest in the movie. For me, Idriss Elba was one of the two reasons I (reluctantly) watch this piece of movie, the second being a very good trailer, way above the actual movie. And I had regrets after the first 10mns and even remorse after the next 20mns. Everything, from plot to acting is rubbish, the most laughable part being the conspiracy. Actions scenes are decent, though, but quite far from the first Bourne movie. I have the feeling that the targeted audience was, in fact, French: some decent actors, with a decent acting, in a realistic Paris. But it could be me being French...</fullReview>

When the bomb explodes Mason becomes Paris's most wanted and is hunted by Briar. There is a great chemistry between the two leads and although the story is a little predictable it bubbles along nicely with some good action scenes and stunts.The movie is nothing special, but throw in the wit of Mason and you have a descent movie with a few laughs for good measure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A low budget actioner. It's nicely paced so keeps your attention throughout with pockets of gunplay and fight scenes. The action style isn't anything different but it gets the job done. Some cheesy lines from a typical Euro action script. It isn't anything you haven't seen before but if your fine with that then you'll be satisfied. It ain't no Taken, Transporter or London Has Fallen (all being set in Europe and with that similar feel.) And sadly Idris Elba isn't a Liam Neeson, Jason Statham or Gerard Butler in action-man terms, he'd easily lose a fight between any of them. Yes he is tall and imposing but delivers quite an empty performance, it doesn't seem like he had to make much effort and unfortunately it shows. Maybe the money men behind this production wanted this kind of performance from Mr. Elba but being cool takes a lot more effort than this. If it was a Luc Besson production i think we would have had different results in regards to the action. Its an entertaining one-watch. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing about action movies is you have to get the direction right...any story..acting..set pieces..stunts and narrative are all wasted if the direction is weak...and in my opinion this is a very weak movie.Great idea in general but loses itself early on and never recovers..Idris Alba the next James Bond?? ...what nonsense that is..he is so wooden here you could stick a few handles on him and use him as a dresser.Plot is crammed full of bad ideas and circumstances and the camera work is as basic as you can get..in one particular scene in the rear of a moving van it is laughable.Probably worth a visit if you have a cinema pass but probably best to keep your money and wait till next release day.</fullReview>

In the end I'm giving it a 9 based on some of the negative reviews that I'm seeing.Simply put, I really enjoyed this movie.It's a good solid action thriller and probably up there for my favourite movie of the year so far ( OK maybe I've not seen that many movies so far but compared to the new Bourne I feel this blew it away. ) The acting seemed solid as did the story.I'd love a sequel though I'm not sure it'd live up to this.All in all if you like action movies / brain candy I'd highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of poor ratings I simply took a chance at watching this Idris Elba movie. Surprise! Surprise! Then I realised why the movie got low ratings. No Werewolves. No Zombies. No sex. No Blood and gore. No bogus action where the hero is absolutely untouched by 3 - 4 guys shooting at him from 20 - 25 feet with assault rifles. Believe me I could do better. These are the typical requirements of the American viewers. Absolutely and totally plausible and believable. Richard Madden also turned out to be familiar face for me. I really wonder if the others here who rated it low really understood what was going on! May be they left their brains home before entering the cinema house. Matt Damon sucks big time compared to Idris Elba. Overall a very watchable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent B-movie action film marred by lazy screenplay and incessant camera motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bastille Day" is a passable action film, if one does not take the plot too seriously. It is hampered by a weak script chock full of half-baked tropes, contrivances and derivative scenes. With recent talk of casting Idris Elba as James Bond, the temptation is to compare the film to recent films in that franchise and some scenes are evocative of scenes from recent Daniel Craig 007 films. A rooftop chase seems to borrow from similar scenes in "Skyfall" and "Spectre." But where "Skyfall" had dirt bikes racing across rooftops and crashing into a bazaar, BD offers only a foot race without the collapsing buildings shown in "Spectre." While the scene is fairly decent in its own right, it pales in comparison to the big- budget extensively choreographed 007 scenes. As an action star, Elba holds his own fairly well and compares favorably with recent efforts by Liam Neeson in the Taken films, "Non-Stop," "Run All Night" and "A Walk Among the Tombstones" and with John Travolta, particularly in "From Paris with Love." He projects confidence, but not the savoir faire or sangfroid of prior actors in the role of Bond. In several respects, the screenplay seems lazy or contrived. A large bomb is stuffed inside a small teddy bear. There is no practical reason to put the bomb in a teddy bear, but it facilitates a plot development. A meeting that goes smoothly is held in a crowded restaurant, but when the same two people meet again and things go horribly wrong, they meet on an isolated rooftop. The villain plans to split the take from a massive heist equally among fourteen redshirts, or at least the ones who survive, which seems rather magnanimous and egalitarian. The villains have access to phenomenal data resources (which is given a half-baked explanation) and complete and unrestricted access to a large financial institution and its computer system. The McGuffin can be transferred to a thumb drive in twenty seconds and used with impunity to transfer huge amounts of cash. The acting is good throughout. Production values are adequate, although marred by a lot of distracting jiggly-cam shots. Fight choreography is decent with innovative moves involving riot shields. The three female characters with lines are underutilized and two groups of black characters seem thrown in only to provide ethnic diversity. Other than the central bromance, there is no romantic angle. There isn't enough background to Elba's Briar to make the character three-dimensional and what little background is given may not be entirely accurate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, this film looks like an Europacorp crap factory production. I would have thought of Pierre Morel or Louis Leterrier as directors. Yes it pretty looks like a TAKEN or other trash from Besson's crap factory, all those action flicks with American actors and taking place in Paris. But let's be fair, that remains a B movie blown up to a grade A one. I loved the rogue cops scheme, it had the potential to be a great film from this, only from this. But the rest of it is forgettable, the acting and directing are awful. AWFUL. The escape sequence from the police truck is pretty close to a sequence, also an escape from a police truck, in HANNIBAL series. And the heist looks like the one in DIE HARD 3..it could have been better, and I even think that Besson's Europacorp could have been better. A better garbage product. But it remains a corny and appreciable time waster.</fullReview>

Not realizing the toy contains a timed bomb, he tosses it aside on a busy street. A few seconds later it explodes, killing four people. CCTV footage reveals Masons face and the French police tag him as a terrorist threat. The explosion, although botched, was set up by a select group of the French Interior Ministry as a decoy so they can make a half billion dollar digital transfer from a bank, (closed on French National Day) -hence the title Bastille Day. In a separate CIA investigation the unruly agent Sean Briar, discovers the real story behind Masons "terrorist attack". The two men, on different sides of the law, collaborate to bring the corrupt members of the Ministry down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not surprisingly solid cool thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hadn't heard anything about this movie before watching it. Was skeptical of it being low quality b-movie action rubbish but ventured into the flick due to Elba. Glad I did, it's not without it's flaws, but honestly in Hollywoods' super slick constant cgi blockbuster vomitfest, who doesn't miss a few flaws like the crackle from a vinyl record. My only complaint with the whole movie as an American is, why didn't they let the actors use their cool British accents? I mean the accents weren't awful but c'mon. Too bad they didn't re-write it as MI6 instead of CIA etc. It's not entirely unpredictable, but it's good and worthy of a sequel. Maybe Elba can start the next film in a coma and wake up with a British accent for unexplained medical reasons. Thoroughly enjoyable, with a Layer Cake kind of feel in tone and production to it IMO. If you like smarter then average spy/action flicks this may be up your alley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie some months ago in a Lebanese cinema, and I found that it's a great movie. Differently from most of the reviews say, this movie satisfied me to a high level. It contained action, real life problems, lessons for audience to learn, a good light kind of comedy and some more good stuff for you to discover. I gave this movie a 10 (excellent) not because it's really excellent or better than "The Dark Knight" but because it is really underrated from the reviewers and it deserves much more better rates. I wish I could tell you the whole story but I don't like to be the spoiler haha, go ahead and watch this movie to discover how good and exciting it is! And well mentioning the watching part, it might be hard for you to do it if you were in some parts of Europe like France and I don't know specifically which countries and also of course in Lebanon, because it has been pulled out from France after the last truck massacre (Nice). In addition to that they didn't yet make the wide release, and it can't be normally found over the internet. Please if you have the movie file, or a link, private message me :) Good luck watching this great thriller!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bastille Day suffices as a decent thriller with capable actors, but the sleight of hand can't carry its more complex and demanding subplots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's an opinion that Idris Elba would make a good James Bond, and although this is different in context, Bastille Day might just be the closest thing. It's a thriller based on espionage set on beautiful city of Paris, offering a few layers of subplots which unfortunately not equal in effectiveness. It does succeeds in a simpler scale where the actors are given more spotlight either it's from action or occasional comedy.Story mainly follows Michael (Richard Madden), a pickpocket who unluckily stumbles upon a package of bomb meant for terrorist attack. He's then chased by various parties for a crime much worse than he actually committed. Among them is Briar (Idris Elba) who eventually uncovers something amiss which leads him into a much bigger conspiracy.The main duo has more chemistry than expected. Michael is a skilled pickpocket, although he's younger and seemingly more gullible when faced with more extreme threat. Briar takes the mantle of senior officer with shady track record who has a tendency of going rogue based on his instinct alone. One of the correct things the movie does right is showcasing them in their fields, not in all out brawl.It also gives a few comedic moments that surprisingly presentable, the addition of Charlotte Le Bon as Zoe, the unintentional accomplice, rounds up the ragtag crew. At latter end, this eclectic party is a good choice for protagonist perspective. However, it often delivers the plot in rather complicated route, shifting between one set piece to another without smooth transition.There are moments where the characters run or drive around in the city sporadically. If it's to push the plot, then the scene could've been incorporated with better flow. The movie soon treads on terrorism subplot, but it clearly doesn't have the large production to pull off such city wide mayhem. Aside from a few gorgeous use of choreography, the movie mainly plays out in typical apartments or hideouts.The better parts come from small scale fights and chases. These are better choreographed, it presents more tactical approach, especially in subtle motions that the visual cleverly tell. The action could have less cuts, but it's produced with focus as audience could follow the motion easily.Ambitious in its deception, the espionage / buddy cop gig works better in modest scope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above average action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited for this film because I really like idris Elba and in the end this film is alright. The premise of the film sees a cia agent and a master pick pocket have to team up to try and stop a terrorist plot in Paris. Idris elba plays the main protagonist and he is really good in the film, he is grizzly and tough but he also has a sense of humour to him. I do believe this was a pretty good james bond audition tape for him. Richard madden plays the pick pocket and I really liked him too, his chemistry with elba is really good and there funny banter works. His smaller physique also allowed for the contrast to work. However, everybody else in the film was a waste, especially the villains who had absolutely no character or personality to them and were there just to be bad guys. The story has some nice social commentary to it which I had very little idea about and some of the twists were interesting. But you have seen it all before I promise you, seen an action movie then the plot of this film comes across as paper thin. The script has some fun witty banter in it between characters but it lacks in it's dramatic impact. It also is very cliché just like its plot. The style is a mixed bag, for every great shootout or chase scene there's a shaky cam close quarters fight. I liked some of the action in this film but some of it just came across as flat. Overall I think this is a decent movie that if you like action films you should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Skilled pickpocket Michael steals a bag containing a bomb, which lands him in a it of a pickle, mainly at the hands of disobedient CIA agent Briar. As anti-terrorist concerns mount on the eve of Paris' Bastille Day celebrations, there is a race against time to head off the bad stuff waiting in the wings.This is a decent, if unexceptional, action thriller. The plot is quite good fun, with some enjoyable twists (which aren't that difficult to spot ahead of time) and some good action sequences. Idris Elba demonstrates what he is good at (as opposed to his disappointing voice work in Zootopia and The Jungle Book) and Richard Madden does well as the pickpocket with a decent character arc. Both play Americans in a film which puts a strong American presence in Paris despite there being no Americans in the cast as far as I can see. They have good chemistry, which works well for the benefit of the film.This is an undemanding way of spending 90 minutes, but not much beyond that.</fullReview>

I've seen a bit of Mr. Elba in Prometheus, but now I've seen everything very well, he really fills the screen. It is good that in a real world of increasingly crazy people, artists like James Watkins (Director) and Andrew Baldwin (Writer) creates, not with too much money, a new action movie, a very good thriller, with a lot of adrenaline. Very good actors, cool music, nervous montage, captivating image(especially the chase up on the roofs). We see Paris too, for free, which is not bad either. Now, nothing left to do than to wait for the sequel, I hope to be even more explosive. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director James Watkins is a foray into the action genre with Bastille Day. His past work has been primarily in horror, with acclaimed hits Eden Lake and Woman in Black.Set in Paris a con man, Michael (Richard Madden), steals a bag belonging to Zoe (Charlotte Le Bon) which unknowingly to him contains a bomb. When the device detonates in the city centre CIA agent Sean Briar (Idris Elba) is put in charge of tracking Michael down.Idris Elba and Richard Madden play off against each other very well, Elba as the super serious Briar and Madden as the immature conman have great chemistry together. Elba is blessed with a natural charisma that makes him easy to watch even when armed with the most underwritten of characters. Whilst Richard Madden holds his own as an entertaining pickpocket, with a few humorous moments. Neither of the pair completely master the American accents, but we're also not in Dick Van Dyke territory so it doesn't become too off putting. The action is suitably slick and steadily directed, though there are a lot of rapid cuts which threaten to break the cohesion of the action. The camera does remain steady though allowing most of the fight scenes to remain coherent. The style seems evocative of the Bourne Ultimatum and Taken, without ever excelling beyond either of these modern action favourites. The pickpocketing scenes are presented stylishly and are entertaining, especially compared to something like Focus from last year that made Will Smith's thief seem somehow super-powered. However despite being superior in these circumstances Bastille Day constantly seems to be an imitation of other popular features released in the past few years without ever developing into something more unique. Setting the movie in Paris against the backdrop of the current tensions following the terrorist attacks is a weird choice for a film that seemingly doesn't want to delve into such a highly divisive issue. The conflicted atmosphere of the cities multicultural classes is extorted by the films plot, but is never explored beyond the simplistic. Kelly Reilly is wasted as one of Briar's co-workers; in a part that could have been portrayed by a box with the words "unimportant character" written on it. To have such a talented performer like Kelly Reilly in such a pointless role is mind boggling. Whilst Anatol Yusef (of Boardwalk Empire fame) is Briar's superior, the one who likes to do things by the book and hates Briar for being such a loose cannon. Yusef is little more than a cliché obstacle whose main service to the narrative is to recite expositional backstory on other characters.As a whole Bastille Day is little more than a run of the mill actioner, with nods to Taken, Focus and even Die Hard it struggles to find its own path. Elba and Madden do a fine job together, but there isn't much too either of their characters worth thinking about. If you're a fan of action then this may be something worth checking out, but be aware that there isn't anything revolutionary about this Bastille Day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good no-nonsense thriller - better than Bond any day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did I like his film?.. because it's a no-nonsense action movie, good characters, well-acted with a sensible plot and script. It doesn't waste its or my time with silly globe-trotting locations, implausible Aston Martins, costume changes, larger than life villains or impossibly glamorous love-interests.You get what you pay for and, without all the pretentious crap, you actually get more of what you are paying for.A number of reviewers have lamented the lack of budget but if that means we get a tense claustrophobic thriller based in one city instead of Bond tearing up one city before impossibly evading all law enforcement to arrive immediately in another city with an entirely new wardrobe and armoury to tear that one up too then hooray for small budgets. Think of every way the last three Bond films have annoyed you with their ludicrous locations, grandiloquent set pieces, irritating in-jokes, preposterous gadgets, pompous (and insultingly inconsistent) self-references, contrived plots and ego-centric main character without whom it would seem a lot more people would stay alive. Well this film doesn't; it just gets on with plot and character and action keeping everything tight and exciting.Idris Elba is excellent if a little terrifying using his sheer size and presence to great effect. Richard Madden also plays well against his Rob Stark type as a weak and frightened character, not the instant hero you get in so many movies. Other characters are good too including the wonderful Thierry Godard from Spiral.Yes the budget is lower than a blockbuster Bond film and the film is the better for it. It's much more in the style of the early Bourne or Taken movies. The rooftop chase is far more realistic than any Bond film with people slipping and sliding about dangerously, knocking over chimney pots and generally looking rather scared rather than as though this is something they have trained for for months. I'm quite sure real CIA agents actually spend most of their time in unglamourous locations, in unglamourous cars and this film is the more realistic for showing it that way.If you want to see a good tight realistic (so far as it goes obviously) thriller go and see this film and give it the support it deserves. If you like pretty shiny things and shots of holiday destinations and don't care about why a secret agent tasked with the one job of keeping the head of the secret service alive would fail to do just that by playing Home Alone in Scotland instead of just placing one call for backup, then go see a Bond film instead.Elba would be wasted in a Bond film but he was excellent in this well made thriller that is better than a Bond film any day of the week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Idris Elba plays "reckless and irresponsible" American CIA operative Sean Briar who is one step ahead of the French police in getting to the bottom of a fatal terrorist bombing in Paris. The apparent bomber is n'er do well pickpocket Michael Mason (Richard Madden, "Game of Thrones", "Cinderella") who gets more than he bargains for when he snatches the wrong bag from bomb-mule Zoe (Charlotte Le Bon, "The Hundred Foot Journey"). Teaming up as an unlikely duo, the two chase around (mostly drab) Paris locations to uncover the plot, pursued by well-connected 'terrorists', led by Rafi Bertrand (Thierry Godard), who actually have a much greedier ulterior motive.There is really very little going for this film. The film is an uneasy mish-mash of the plots from Die Hard and (perm-any-one-of-five) recent Liam Neeson movies, laced with elements of Bourne. It all never quite gels into a satisfactory whole.Not wishing to be controversial, but given Idris Elba's undoubted star quality he should only really need to play to his potential to get a well-deserved Oscar nomination this year. Unfortunately, this is not the film that delivers him the material to show that, and he spends most of the film saying little (in a strangely Hackney-fied US accent) and looking broodingly 'reckless and irresponsible'. Richard Madden fares little better, trying to wield some well-worn buddy-cop comedy lines that are neither convincing nor particularly funny. Rafi Bertrand (Thierry Godard) ends up looking like an uglier version of Ricky Gervais (I expect a retweet of this review from #rickygervais for that!) which is a bit difficult to get past to take his character seriously.Giving a much better performance is the very attractive Charlotte Le Bon, who is by far the best thing in the film.Clearly not the film-makers fault, but the movie (with a delayed release for obvious reasons) is a little too close to real-life comfort given the Paris bombings of November 2015: I suspect that as a result the bombing scene was probably edited down somewhat from its original cut in the interests of taste, which is no bad thing as it is an effective sequence for both the visuals and the sound mixing. The uneasy 'West vs Islam' undertone throughout the film's story makes for queasy and unsettling viewing though.Where the film clunks to the floor is in the paint-by-numbers storyline and dialogue. The fact that the film stoops to an exploitative opening shot of a naked accomplice (a barely - no pun intended - credited Stéphane Caillard) is a sign of what's to come. Some of the scenes (particularly one with CIA boss Karen Dacre (Kelly Reilly, "Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows")) are utterly predictable and others (like a sniper attempt to shoot Mason) so jaw-droopingly inept as to quash any sense of tension. The finale, featuring a Bastille Day storming of the fascist banking citadel single-handedly by Zoe, like some modern day Marianne, is pretty ludicrous.The special effects budget is funded by the same banker as "London has Fallen" (i.e. inadequately) with some scenes such as the (otherwise exciting) rooftop chase lacking the authenticity of a Bond or a Bourne, and the use of what I thought was an obviously model helicopter at one point.Direction is by James Watkins, a Brit who did the passably chilling "Woman in Black". I feel vaguely guilty for rating it the way I do as the whole film smells of people trying really hard with the money they had available. Perhaps with a bigger budget it could have been better.According to the film "the hashtags will push it over". In that case, #bastilleday #avoid.</fullReview>
