		<shortDescription>Kubrick's first classic, and still one of the greatest crime thrillers ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Killing' has been overshadowed by Stanley Kubrick's subsequent better known and better made movie masterpieces. Films like 'Dr. Strangelove', '2001' and 'A Clockwork Orange' are much more flamboyant and intellectually exciting than this early hard boiled crime thriller, but for my money it is still one of his most entertaining movies, and in its own modest way just as brilliant as his more talked about films. 'The Killing' is still one of the greatest crime thrillers ever made, and one which influenced many film makers working in this genre, not the least of which Quentin Tarantino, who obviously worships this picture, and used its innovative structure as major inspiration for 'Pulp Fiction'. Kubrick wrote 'The Killing's script as well as directing, but made the smart move of asking "the Dime Store Dostoevski" Jim Thompson, author of pulp classics like 'The Killer Inside Me' and 'The Getaway' to supply the fresh and memorable dialogue. Sterling Hayden, who later achieved screen immmortality as General Jack D. Ripper in 'Dr Strangelove', is perfect as ambitious small time crook Johnny Clay. He is surrounded by an almost flawless supporting cast. I qualified that because I wasn't totally convinced by Coleen Gray who plays Johnny's girlfriend. However she only really has one scene, and the rest of the cast more than makes up for her. Especially memorable are the mis-matched husband and wife played by Elisha Cook, Jr ('The House On Haunted Hill') and the sultry Marie Windsor (noir classic 'Narrow Margin'). Their scenes together are simply terrific. Also noteworthy are the two scenes featuring legendary crazy Timothy Carey ('The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie'). Carey was one of the most extraordinary performers to set foot in front of a movie character, and is unforgettable. Kubrick obviously thought highly of him as he subsequently cast him in his anti-war classic 'Paths Of Glory', a move which antagonised the movie's star Kirk Douglas. Even if 'The Killing' didn't feature such a strong performance from Sterling Hayden it would be worth watching just to catch Cook, Windsor and Carey. On top of that you have some other great actors such as Vince Edwards, an innovative script, hip dialogue and some brilliant directorial touches. This exciting heist movie can't be recommended highly enough, it's a real treat for film buffs. A brilliant film that still packs a punch after almost fifty years, something I doubt you will be saying about many movies currently showing in today's theatres. 'The Killing' is a super cool suspense movie and not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my five favorite Kubrick films - gets better every time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the age of 27, Stanley Kubrick's third film, The Killing, took Lionel White's hard-boiled, non-linear story of one man (Johnny Clay, with quick-talking, straightforward ease by Sterling Hayden) and his crew planning and tasking a race-track robbery. It's almost fifty years old, but by this time Kubrick intently defined his style, and somehow the film seems to have themes and characters that are identifiable (and recognizable) with any period. The supporting characters are as sharply drawn (and psychologically involving) if not more so than Johnny Clay. Driving us into this world of schemers shouldn't be dense, and as Kubrick passes by any pretense - and keeps the compositions and material entertaining and absorbing - and it allows a viewer a lot of promise on repeat viewings.While the story elements are similar to the sort of Kubrick-movie psychology (mostly dealing with men who are head deep in a rather existential crisis of what's against society), what's unique is how the craft is intuitive. On a low budget, and even with a cast that's very good if not excellent, everything is always assured in the style and turns grinding in the plot. I could watch this movie another two times (after three in the past two years or so) and still see shots so detailed yet with the tone that of the most inspired film-noirs. It's questionable as to where Kubrick got influence for some of the compositions, with usage of shadows and the dark (and light shades too), but whether or not it was some famous expressionist or from the 40's film-noirs, the mark of Kubrick uncurling as an artist is evident. One remark by some is that the narration is sometimes irritating, that the kind of B-movie police drama expository tone, and the information is too much. The voice is not my favorite part of the film, but the narration itself, the information, is an interesting mold in the film's structure. It adds on a layer to that existentialist subtext, as every description makes it sounds like the narrator's a reporter looking back on the past events with a (detached) objectivity. For me, this did make it a little much to concentrate on in the first viewing, however this is a film that demands un-thwarted attention for it's 83 minutes. If you turn away for too long, a piece of the puzzle will be out of sight. It's a great film, and it's gone on to inspire a flock of homagers and imitators in the last half century. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Characters In Here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Stanley Kubrick is best known for "2001: A Space Odyssey." "A Clockwork Orrange" or "The Shining" but I always found this to be my favorite of his films. This is film noir at some of its best: a tight no-nonsense story with tragic consequences, some of the best film noir actors in the business and great cinematography, which looks even better on DVD.Sterling Hayden is the gang leader in this heist film and the big man was up to the task as he usually was in these kind of crime films. He wasn't as rough a character as he was in "Asphalt Jungle," but his role reminded me of that film.What made this movie so appealing to me were four very interesting character actors: Elisha Cook Jr., Marie Windsor, Kola Kwariani and Ted de Corsia. Few people had those loser-type film noir characters down pat as well as the tough-talking Windsor and the meek and wimpy Cook. They played a husband-and-wife team here: that's film noir heaven!Kwariani plays a burley chess-playing wrestler who fights six cops at one time and Carey is a long-distance racist rifleman who talks through clenched-teeth and shoots a racehorse! As I said, some very interesting characters here. And, oh yeah.....for you over-55 readers, there's Vince Edwards, alias Dr. Ben Casey of TV fame, as a Windsor's young adulterer boyfriend trying to horn in on the money from the robbery.This film is full of surprises and always fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Young Kubrick's triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kunbrick was still in his twenties when he made this film, yet his confidence and self-assurance are all over it. It is a well-written story, co-written by Kubrick (based on a novel called "A Clean Break"), about a meticulously planned horetrack heist told from the point of view of the several people who were in on the plot. Most of these guys weren't professional criminals, but otherwise honest men who were down on their luck and needed a break. They turned to this audacious plan in desperation, thinking they could do some real good in their lives with their share of the money. I won't give away the ending of course, but keep in mind this is a Kubrick film. That's all I say about that.Standouts include Sterling Hayden as the ringleader, Marie Windsor as a snide, manipulative woman, Elisha Cook as her milquetoasty husband, Timothy Carey, as creepy as ever, and Kola Kwariani, the thinking man's Tor Johnson, as a chess expert/hired thug.Speaking of chess, this is the first movie I've ever seen with a scene taking place in a chess parlor. Being from a provincial New England town, and not being a chess afficionado, I never knew such places existed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crackling heist story that will have you glued to your seat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's little to fault in Stanley Kubrick's classic robbery tale. The acting is first-rate with Marie Windsor, as Mrs. Peaty, a sarcastic stand-out. The story just pops off the screen - and at less than 90 minutes, there's literally no filler. I love the winding time line ("earlier that day" etc.), which has been liberally utilized by Quentin Tarantino (Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs). This film was made right before Kubrick's WWI marvel, Paths of Glory, and his genius is apparent in both. No wasted words or actions. Love that last line!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick-Noir: recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this movie fascinates me. Even the unexpected ending has a compelling and unique flavor to it. Sure, it looks like many crime dramas of the 50's. But we are talking about of a movie with a director of the prodigious talents of Stanley Kubrick.Sometimes you wonder which genre Kubrick could not have handled brilliantly. He seems to know exactly what to do in such a wide variety of movies...Crime, Drama, War, Surreal, Historical Epic, Science Fiction and Black Comedy. My only wish would have been if Kubrick could have made MORE movies. When he died, that left only Woody Allen as the only major director who is working as a pure artist in the film medium. THE KILLING is filled with crime-noir touches that form an absorbing whole that is hard to beat. The acting is top-notch, the scenes are set in gold taking from every crime movie and creating a whole that could not have been done so well by just any director - perhaps only Hitchcock could have pulled this off. Then there's the jazzy score that underlines the action which punch and atmosphere that just curdles off the screen.Even if you're not a Kubrick fan (which might surprise many people when they find out he was the director) you will enjoy this movie.Right to the end...which I won't reveal...but has an inevitability written with classical balance and a submission to fate that leaves a wry smile on your face.Sterling Hayden is great in this role and he populates this character with just the right sort of mystery to keep you guessing until the end.Recommended without reservation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really fantastic film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays, every dang films from studios are being beef up to epic size length. To be honest, I find this very dull and pointless and too many filler scenes, which aren't necessary at all. The Killing is great example of keep it short and sweet with no fat on it. It's just straight to the point and no complicated plot twists over plot twists over plot twists like modern hesist film. Kubrick's direction is very brilliant in this film.It's very straightfoward, even if it's in nonlinear sequences, which is very unique for its time. Nowadays, too many films are use nonlinear sequences to add gimmicky appeal to the audiences, which is waste of time. Sterling Hayden is wonderful as Johnny Clay, who is the mastermind of the hesist plan. He should have get nomination for Academy Awards because no one can play that character like Hayden. It is seldom to watch nice and taut film that is clocked approximately 90 minutes. This film have all basic elements of film noir, which is one of my favorite genre. You can see Kubrick's signatures began to show in this film, i.e. 3 ways enemies. Kubrick is the star of The Killing, that's for sure. The directors who want to make a hesist film should learn from The Killing because it's outstanding film. One of the best hesist film of all time.****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crime classic, and a monument for actor Elisha Cook, Jr.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of a meticulously-planned race track hold-up is a stunner in every minute you watch it, and the film's progressive use of a partly documentary style has often been acclaimed as uniquely supporting the dramatic goings-on. It definitely put a modern touch to the somewhat out-of-fashion film noir in 1956, but still greatly relied on its basic rules.A fine new note was the neat distinction between the gang's members' motives, ranging from repaying underworld debts (De Corsia) and hope of offering a better life for his ill wife (Sawyer) to the vain ambition of pleasing his vamp wife by doing something special (Cook).Despite the film's qualities, Kubrick's treatment of the women's rôles seems more than old-fashioned today. Women here are either the homely and sweet type (Coleen Gray) or the Bette-Davis-eyed and cherchez-la-femme type (Marie Windsor). Both are accordingly taller or smaller than their respective partners by a head.I should like to mention one of my favourite pans: that's when the bald philosopher-catcher walks up to Joe Sawyer's bar. Lucien Ballard's camera follows him all across the crowded tote hall, a take which must have been very difficult to organize and shoot. Later, the scene is repeated with Sterling Hayden.This motion picture is also a monument for the great histrionic art of Elisha Cook, Jr., in a stand-out performance as the born loser. (German dubbing gives him the apt voice of Stan Laurel's speaker Walter Bluhm.) This little man never just did his job in unnumerable supporting rôles but has rendered effective homage to the tragic figure on the silver screen more than any other (non-comical) character actor I can think of. Regardless of his versatility in lots of different films, his impersonations of a likeable man who is doomed to fail make him unforgettable: take his lethal parts in "Phantom Lady" (1944), "Shane" (1953) or the likes, the audience's sympathy was always with this fine actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most skillful and entertaining suspense movies of the Fifties?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The formidably promising talent shown in "Killer's Kiss" helped to secure for Stanley Kubrick studio backing for his next straight thriller, "The Killing," made in 1956? This was a much more "professional" job than its forerunner? Kubrick had the casting of a bunch of actors so experienced in the "character" parts that as soon as they came into camera view you recognized them from a score of Hollywood movies? "The Killing" lacks for me the dimension of humanity of its predecessor? It reminded me of one of those documentaries that give you every conceivable fact with immaculate accuracy and leave you without the heart of the truth? This has something to do with the style of the storytelling?. Once again there is a narrator; only instead of a lonely failure with blood in his veins, this one sounds like a "March of Time" commentator: loud, confident, detached? The film opens on the horses preparing for the off at the track and, even before the titles end, the dramatic music has started building the tension? One by one we are introduced to the characters as once again, we don't know for a while what the plot is going to be; but this one uses the time to build the mystery and tension rather than to deepen the characters?Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a convict just out from five years in Alcatraz, master-minding the two million dollar hold-up? He collects (how, we are never told) a bunch of flawed human beings to fit, like jigsaw pieces, into the intricacy of his plan? There's an Irish barman, an amiable old book-keeper, a tough crooked cop; and there's little George Peatty, played by Elisha Cook Jr ? he of the bulging eyes and mobile mouth; here the incarnation of fear and uncertainty and in countless other Hollywood thrillers the personification of the staring-eyed boy killer...Kubrick plays tricks with time as his characters become caught in the plot? He takes each of them and plays his incident through to the next turn of the screw; then goes back to an earlier moment in time to see what somebody else was doing?Even the incidental small parts have "character" stamped right through them? The marksman hired to shoot a winning racehorse to cause a diversion from the robbery is a war veteran with deformed speech? The old retired wrestler, who picks a fight with the police to create another diversion?If "Killer's Kiss" had one big dramatic set-piece, "The Killing" has a score of small dramatic touches to heighten the irony and the tension?"The Killing" is one of the most skillful and entertaining suspense movies of the Fifties? It mesmerized like a ticking time bomb, and every few minutes, with sure skill, Kubrick recorded a new peak of suspense? And all with very little violence, again, though with the obligatory sudden death?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisitely Timed Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While people die violently in The Killing, the title comes from the thought of a financial killing. This film is a choreographed chess match - Kubrick had a lifelong passion for chess - with human pieces, where the gambit is a racetrack heist of two million dollars. The heist is brilliantly conceived. Johnny Clay, recently paroled, must have thought of nothing else in prison except this heist. The precision with which this scheme comes together is exquisite and absolutely flawless. There is one minor loose end during the heist itself when Marvin Unger shows up at the track drunk, contrary to instructions, but this is a red herring. The heist is brilliantly executed. It goes literally like clockwork, and that is the best, maybe the only, metaphor to describe it. It reminded me of a road rally where drivers had to be in certain positions at certain times. Clay recruits accomplices on the inside, track employees, who must play small, but critical parts, for the heist to work. Everyone does his job beautifully, the heist comes off with hardly a hitch. One accomplice is killed by police, but no one else - conspirator or bystander - gets hurt, and Clay gets away clean. No military operation was ever planned so minutely or executed so precisely. But, once Clay has the money, things come a-cropper. We know, of course, that the plan cannot succeed. Nefarious plans *never* succeed in film noir. It's a rule. How this particular scheme came undone and was foiled seemed contrived and forced to me. Here is this exquisitely planned operation, flawlessly executed with military precision. And yet this scrupulously planned, perfectly timed attention to detail is tossed aside once Clay has the money. It's almost like he expected to fail, or never counted on succeeding, like he thought, "Okay, I've got two mil in small bills. Now, what do I do?"But, that would be telling. How the perfect crime is foiled is the film's climax, and its only weak moment. Sterling Hayden is brilliant as Johnny Clay. His precise, clipped, monotone delivery, almost like a newsman, is perfect here. The liner notes for my DVD said that the studio wanted Jack Palance or Victor Mature for the role, but Kubrick held firm. Either would have been good, but Hayden was brilliant. Marie Windsor is not one we would think of as a femme fatale, but she is also very good as the selfish, vain, scheming and very attractive wife of one of the co-conspirators played by Elisha Cooke, Jr. He married out of his league, and in film noir, that's a guarantee for disaster. One of Kubrick's best, and one of the best film noir's ever done. A solid 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock like in style...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick directed 15 odd movies in half a century (let's exclude Spartacus). His skills as an auteur may not have been recognized till Strangelove but they were on display in films like Lolita, Paths of Glory and of course The Killing, his first certified classic.The Killing is about an intricate race-track heist involving a group of non-professionals with clean records. The mastermind, Sterling Hayden, has however spent some time in prison. The unique thing for the time is the non-linear structure of the film - particularly the heist sequence. This was probably Hayden's finest role - yes, better than Jack D. Ripper of Strangelove or Altman's The Long Goodbye - as the doomed hero, Johnny Clay. He is very tall and physical and quite brilliant in this role. He is well-supported by an old favorite of mine from The Maltese Falcon, Elisha Cook Jr. whose venomous wife, Marie Windsor plays a femme fatale of sorts. There is also the cult favorite Timothy Carey as the person assigned to shoot Red Lightning. Reservoir Dogs, a cult film inspired by The Killing is dedicated to Carey.While The Killing is certainly noirish, it does not have the pure noir look - well, pretty much most of it is filmed in the daytime. In fact, if Kubrick was inspired, it would have been more by Hitchcock's tight pacing than by Chandler or Cain's hard-boiled dialog. The camera-work and editing are brilliant - for me even better than later Kubrick classics. Kubrick was forced to add a voice-over by the studio - something he really wasn't inclined towards. His ingenious solution was to have the VO not directly comment on the movie, but to add another layer to the films structure. It works! This film is not dated, although the Marie Windsor character is a bit one-dimensional and what is visible in the short length of the movie is the tight pacing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was Kubrick thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** spoilers **This is like a bad episode of Highway Patrol that was chopped up and reassembled. Instead of a straightforward narrative, Kubrick keeps throwing in this corny narration-- "forty minutes before that...", "Two weeks earlier..."-- to cover up inexplicable jumps in the time line. The story's been scrambled for no apparent reason, and it just seems like inept storytelling, like listening to someone who keeps forgetting key details.Kubrick also used the narration to cover up holes in the exposition, like he didn't want to go back and re-do scenes for clarity-- for example, that bit about how they were supposed to split up was mentioned just in time by the narrator, like it was an afterthought. "Oh yeah, they split up because it was part of the plan. Sorry we didn't mention it earlier."And there's some major plot elements that aren't explained either. Why did they have to kill the horse? None of the race fans who were "distracted" by it would have seen the robbery anyway. And why was Timothy Carey's character shot when he tried to drive out of the parking lot? How did Sterling Hayden's character get away with slugging a cop in the middle of a crowd? How did a shotgun blast kill everyone except the person it was aimed at? Why didn't Johnny and his girlfriend take the train when the airline wouldn't let them carry on the suitcase? And that bit with having it fly open in the middle of the runway-- I could see that coming a mile off. (I thought all the money was bundled up when he put it in the duffel bag-- what happened there?)Overall it was sloppy, contrived and poorly executed. This is a first effort in every sense of the word, and belongs more properly to the canon of second rate cop shows of the fifties. Fortunately, Kubrick seemed to have learned from the experience, but that's about all you can say for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with average plot, fair acting, but superb direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is truly one of the most gifted directors of all time. He wasn't afraid to be boring(2001: a Space Odyssey) or critically bashed(The Shining) or risque and disturbing(A Clockwork Orange, Eyes Wide Shut). He simply did his job: to provide a well made film with strong theme and meaning. The Killing is definitely not Kubrick's best work. It seems to me that Stan wasn't famous enough and too little known to make The Killing the way that he wanted to. It was though, still pretty entertaining. It has one of my favorite attributes that most movies don't even steer close to: a non-linear plot. A non-linear plot is when scenes are put in non-chronilogical order, i.e. Pulp Fiction, Out of Sight, Fight Club, etc. It makes the audience pay more attention and makes the plot seem more interesting and intricate. In this movie, the plot wasn't way out of order, but it was enough to be conidered non-linear.  Another cool part of the movie was the heist itself. It was very well planned and executed and obviously took time to think up. The depressing climax and ending lean a lot towards the work of Hitchcock. In fact, if this film had been in some parts been by Hitchcock, it would not have been too much of a surprise.  If you're in to classic, black and white crime dramas, then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Ol' Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time. He's made some of the greatest, thought provoking, controversial films of all time, and his style is out of this world. But before The Shining, before A Clockwork Orange, before 2001, before Dr. Strangelove, even before Spartacus, there was The Killing. It's a very good movie, but it's not one of Kubrick's best; and I was sort of expecting that. Rarely is a director's first movie his best, and even though it has some flaws, it's still a great movie. One problem I have with this movie is the unnecessary narration. I know that wasn't Kubrick's idea, but it's bad, and it's noticeable. It's actually pretty insulting to the audience's intelligence. I think Kubrick trusted his audience to be smart enough to follow the film, and I wish they would just remove it from the film. Another thing is that the movie feels very lopsided. The first half isn't bad, but the second half is definitely stronger. We get a lot of dialogue for the first half, and then we see the action in the second half. It's very well written, and it does keep my interest, but the scale is totally tipped. It's similar to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies. The first movie is non-stop action and wildly entertaining, and the second movie has very minimal action, and is mostly talking. Like I said, I love dialogue (especially when it's well written), but I wish it was more balanced with the action. So what's good about this movie? Well, the characters are great. You can tell Tarantino took a lot of inspiration from this movie when he made Reservoir Dogs. It's one of the first instances where the main characters are bad guys, they're very mean spirited, but you cheer for them anyway. Also, the ending is unique for the time. Just like I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang, the ending is just very haunting, and leaves you with a dark feeling. I think the best thing about this movie is the cinematography. Kubrick is known for his incredible cinematography, and it's really cool to see where it all started. You can just see the future genius that lies within. The Killing isn't a perfect movie, but it's still really good. For a low budget crime drama from the 1950s, it's amazing. And even though it's so low budget, you can still see that Kubrick style slowly growing. It may not be one of his best, and it does have its flaws, but it's still an engaging, dark, intelligent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a complete directorial fail on the part of Kubrick. In fact, the only reason I think anyone would say this mismanaged, poorly told story was any good at all is they are worshipping at the altar of SK. The story is non-linear which would not be a problem if it was well-made. But without the hackneyed, try-hard narration in background, you wouldn't be able to follow what was going on in this film at all. It was simply a mess of things happening to your eyes and ears for the entirety that it was on screen. The bar fight made no sense and was poorly shot. Several people witnessed the Sterling Hayden's character walk through the door. Characters were written in and quickly dismissed with no explanation. The final scene were the money was blowing away was so predictable that several minutes before it happened, we paused to recite the exact ending. Elisha Cook's character was the only character that made you feel anything towards them. The rest were so clichéd, it felt like a joke. The only redeemable part of this film was the one line where the guy didn't know what sort of crime killing a horse would be.If this had been some no-name director, almost no one would have thought this was good. I was only more disheartened by the fact that it was Kubrick that served me this offal.</fullReview>

Film-noir is alternately exciting and heavy-hearted, with scenes that tend to plod and performances which aren't terribly magnetic. Sterling Hayden excels as always, and Elisha Cook and Vince Edwards do well in character parts, but the other roles are disappointingly filled and the production is on the cheap side. Although Kubrick's film garnered sterling notices in its time, it hasn't aged well and is mainly worth-seeing today only as a curio. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Several men conduct a grand robbery at a race track.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the way the telling of this story was conducted. In the beginning the viewer isn't too sure of who the "main character" is because the story keeps shifting to different point of views of each person involved in the grand robbery. Throughout the story there are different cues that give you the idea that the robbery isn't going to work as planned. But to the viewer's surprise it does, at first. I suspected something to go wrong at the racetrack but everything went as planned there. I didn't feel that the commentary or narration was necessary. In certain cases it was for instance when the story jumped around and didn't go chronologically. I also liked the variety of characters involved in the robbery. The teller who's whipped by his wife and possesses little self-esteem, the "leader" of the pack who's a handsome man with a good head on his shoulders, a quiet old man who plays little part in the robbery, and the list goes on. The story was interesting, however, only once the plan started to go into play. Beforehand, the story was moving slow and I found myself disinterested. However, overall, it was a success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's first serious effort packs a punch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing is a film whose legacy can still be seen in many films today. This film is not only Stanley Kubrick's first acclaimed film, but it is also credited with inventing the concept of non-linear story telling for the film industry. Some recent films that have used this technique are Reservior Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Go, Wonderland and The Usual Suspects.The story deals with a motley crew of assorted criminals, inside men, and average joes just looking to get their hands on a large sum of money by stealing it from a racetrack. Sterling Hayden plays Johnny Clay, a hardened criminal who just finished serving a five-year prison sentence. He is the ringleader of the bunch who is determined to only go for the big heists from now on. He figures they can put you away for stealing ten dollars as easily as ten million, so what have you got to lose? The rest of the crew are mostly average people with average problems, as Clay explains early on. Some of them work at the track. One is a crooked cop. Two are hardened criminals added at the last minute to cause diversions. Everything has been timed and planned out to the letter. Of course in a film like this, things never go as planned. It wouldn't be entertaining if they did.The killing was made on a budget of well below half a million dollars, and it shows. The film looks cheap at times, but the story is more than enough to make you forgive its financial shortcomings. The acting is nothing too special. Hayden is strong and resourceful as Johnny Clay, but he's pretty wooden. Elisha Cook Jr. is pretty good as a hen-pecked husband who is taking part in the scheme to impress his high-maintenance wife. If this film were re-cast today, you'd have to think of William H. Macy to play this character. Timothy Carey is always memorable, even with such a small part like the one he has here. Such a strange-looking guy! He gets the most interesting assignment of all the people in on the heist.You can really tell this was made fifty years ago. Even though there are hardened criminals and low-lifes in nearly every scene, nobody ever says the F-word! There is, however, a fairly gory shootout in one scene which you normally didn't find in films back then. The killing was ahead of its time in more ways than one, I guess. Please be sure to check this one out! 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thick, Pulpy Roots of Modern Heist Epics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's coming-out party from the mid '50s is a startlingly accurate prediction of film's future. By way of a non-linear narration and a few remarkably fresh transitions, Kubrick adds considerable weight and magnitude to a tangled heist tale and its focus on the crooks behind a slick, daring stickup of the local racetrack. Confused by the film's radical new approach to storytelling, test audiences hated the first cut, leading to studio meddling and an almost-complete disintegration of its marketing budget. Kubrick fought back, though, and with the obvious exception of a horribly heavy-handed deadpan narration, the finished product seems virtually untouched. Concerned mostly with the planning and hand-wringing before the big theft, The Killing tensely builds anticipation throughout before finally boiling over in a machine gun-paced robbery scene, terse payoff and all-too-brief elaboration on the major players' ultimate fates. Acceptably acted at best, the real stars of this picture are the complex plot and the harvest of fresh ideas going on behind the lens. A clear inspiration for Tarantino's big hits of the '90s, it's a daring and stylish major market debut for the famed director that hints at the lengths his development would ultimately take the medium.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Killing at the Racetrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SOME SPOILERS) Stanley Kubrick's 1956 Film/Noir classic that plays with the clock in putting most of those involved in this robbery of a California racetrack in the same time-frame in a series of overlapping episodes.Planing to rob the tracks handle, money thats bet, as well as it's concession and tickets sales mastermind Johnny Clay, Sterling Hayden, plans the robbery to take place on the tracks biggest racing day when it holds it's most expensive feature race the $100,000.00 added Landstown Stakes. Working together with a number of track workers, a ticket seller and bartender, as well as a policemen to make the getaway with the cash without being noticed. The plan laid out by Johnny goes off almost without a hitch. Only one of the robbers Kikki Arcane ,Timothy Carey, was shot and killed by track police and all the rest got away. It's later the robbers meet up at their prearranged hideout, minus Johnny, things start to fall apart. As their all waiting for Johnny to come over with the $2,000,000.00 in cash that was taken in the robbery Val, Vince Edwards, and friend break into their place in order to rob them of the cash that they don't have. A gunfight breaks out with everyone there shot dead but the track ticket clerk George Peatty, Elisha Cook JR. who was in the other room and surprised them Val &amp; Co. by starting the gun fight.George badly wounded staggers out of the room to his car to go back home and deal with his two-timing wife Sherry, Marie Windsor, who was having an affair with Val, behind George's back. It was Saherry who tipped him off about the robbery and where the money is to be split between the robbers. As George leaves the house shot and bleeding Johnny pulls up with a laundry bag loaded with the $2,000,000.00 in cash to split up with the rest of the robbers. Seeing the police coming on the scene Johnny takes off to pick up his girlfriend Fay, Coleen Gray, and together drive down to the airport and get on a flight to Boston with the cash. George meanwhile goes home and confronts Sherry who at first though, when he opened the door,t that he was her lover Val and shoots her dead for double-crossing him and his fellow crooks.At the airport the final chapter of this film is played out with an ironic ending for both Johnny and Fay in their attempt to get away Scot-free with the track loot after everybody involved with it ended up dead. Like the domino effect in the movie that started with the shooting at the hideout between the robbers and Val &amp; friend the last piece to fall, after all the others fell, was just about to go down. The time sequences in the movie added at least twenty to the films final 85 minutes but instead of padding the movie to lengthen it's running time it actually enhanced it's story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Kubrick's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb" is by far his best movie ever. However, my favorite Kubrick movie after that is "Th killing". I think it's better than "2001: a space odyssey", "Paths of glory", and "Clockwork orange". Plus, he had everything right for the movie, especially the actors. Stirling Hayden couldn't have done a better job and no other actor could have been more convincing. As usual, Kubrick's name is all over the credits. He directed, produced, and wrote the movie and did a great job in those three categories. Of course, the script is original and helps the movie be great. Johnny Clay (Stirling Hayden), an ex-con, decides to round up a few men to do a robbery. It takes place in a race-track and the murder of a horse is included (that's where the title came from). Johnny finds all the men he needs and explains them how the robbery will go down. So he has one man to shoot the horse from a parking lot. He has another man to pick up the money once it was robbed, one man to create a diversion in the race-track, one man to open him the door to the money and finally, himself to rob the money and the man upstairs to hope everything goes the way it was planned. But does the man upstairs really like them? Hayden delivers a strong performance as well as the supporting cast does. But it is Kubrick who, with his strong writing and directing, makes the movie a classic. Once again, there are a few scenes where you can see how Kubrick was an avant-garde director and once again, the movie was over-looked at the Oscars getting absolutely no nominations. It's a shame great movies like this one were often disregarded at the Oscars because if you ask me, if "The killing" had been nominated at the Oscars that year, it would have robbed every award including the best picture Oscar which was awarded to "Around the world in 80 days". But the movie is still a gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS* I really enjoyed "The Killing2 but, like many, felt that the ending was fatally flawed. Johnny Clay appears to have every meticulous little detail in this robbery worked out to perfection, yet after the heist he removes the money from the secure baggage it is in and transfers it to a second-hand suitcase that he knows the locks to be faulty on. Over two million dollars in hard currency, yet Johnny can´t be bothered securing the suitcase!. Right Oh!. From the moment Kubrick´s camera focused on those faulty locks, the viewer knows instinctively that the whole shabang is going to be blown wide open. Two million dollars Johnny!. A new suitcase, a secure suitcase would maybe have set you back twenty dollars. And why didn´t you consider this aspect when you were making your meticulous and brilliantly executed robbery plans?.

		<shortDescription>An odd sense of exhilaration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is seemingly the most exhilarating and uplifting movie I have ever seen. I go away from it strengthened and encouraged for the task or lonely road ahead. I know it would be wrong to identify with the protagonist, Johnny Clay, but I certainly sympathize with him. It may be indicative of some baseness in my character. I don't know or much care after the movie is over. His terrible downfall is, oddly, an upper rather than a downer for me. My only difficulty is rather too much exhilaration, and I need to be brought back down to earth after the curtain falls maybe by some silliness that serves to remind me of the pointless futility of human endeavor. Oddly, "The Killing" does just the opposite. Go figure. The casting and narration and direction are superb. I've read a criticism that the actress playing Johnny's girl friend is weak or miscast. I disagree. I think she's perfect for the part and lends a great verisimilitude to it as well as other qualities that are crucial to the overall effect of the story on me. I don't have a favorite movie anymore but I'd go see this one again if I were lucky enough to be able to see it in a theater, where it should be seen. The movies being made today usually ain't worth mentionin'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing is a welcome improvement upon the disappointingly flat, Killer's Kiss. Some have gone as far to say that The Killing is the best film out of Stanley's entire filmography! Whilst, I'm inclined to strongly disagree with that statement, I still enjoyed The Killing (what's with Stanners and all this killing and killers?) for what it was. A stylish little crime thriller with a narrative which goes back and forth in time, which is reminiscent of Quentin's Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.A lot of noirs from the 50's can be extremely slow and, to be frank, boring! The Killing however didn't bore me for a second of its tight running time. In Stanley's later films, he tends to pad out the narrative, but here he keeps it economical and to the point. We begin at the beginning of the heist and then flip back to the group of men planning the robbery. It's a fairly unconventional storytelling method for the 50's, although Citizen Kane did attempt it first a decade or so earlier.Unlike Citizen Kane though, The Killing isn't boring. I enjoyed it's nice array of characters, particularly George and his acid-tongued wife. A large amount of the film was dedicated to this odd couple and the dialogue between them is especially witty and entertaining. It's a shame that some of the other guys didn't get as much screen-time, so I cared slightly less for them. It doesn't matter too much though, because The Killing is all about building up to the grand racetrack heist and it does a cracking job.Once we reach the heist we see it multiple times from everyone's different point of view. It's very engaging and clever to see how it all pans out and you're almost rooting for them to complete it cleanly. Some of it was also very well directed. I enjoyed the fight at the bar which was done in a realistic way and only in a few shots. I also liked the tense robbery itself where a character sports a clown mask not too dissimilar to the ones in the opening of The Dark Knight.In a fairly, yet satisfyingly contrived way, the film obviously pushes its moral that robbing is bad! Suffice to say that the characters meet a sticky way one way or another. I did find the ending a little too sudden and rushed, but overall The Killing is a pretty fine film. I loved its use of narrative and some of the characters were quite memorable too. It's far from Stanley Kubrick's best film, but it's a welcome leap forward from Killer's Kiss. I shall look forward to Paths of Glory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 194With The Killing, Stanley Kubrick established himself as a great director. Unfortunately, 55 years later, this film is unfortunately less remembered because it isn't released between 1957- 1987. It's a shame The Killing isn't seen more, because viewers are treated to an excellent and suspenseful crime noir.Here is a heist with a straightforward plot and nonlinear storytelling. In an hour and a half, the first half is set up and the second half is all payoff. First we neatly learn about the characters, and some of their reasons for the job are exposed. The second half is pure awesome- the slick, simple heist is played out from several perspectives.Huge success comes from the characters: they're great. Instead of a couple of stiffs, the conspirators are old, corrupt, meek, foreign; there is one stiff. Maurice and Nicky in particular stand out, great characters. Sherry as well, but for quite the opposite reasons. The script is stellar. Most noirs are nonsensical, The Killing is correct to the minute. Dialogue comes fast and furiously, and scenes are repeated from other characters perspectives, but they don't feel redundant: we learn more each time.There are a couple of things that have occurred in Kubrick's first three films: narration and great music. The trumpet blaring during the heist really raises the tension. On another note, it's apparent that Kubrick could now realize his projects however he wanted. A neat tidbit: I liked the chess club scenes, because Kubrick was an avid chess player.Technically The Killing is great as well: the horse following, the tracking shot echoed by Goodfellas 35 years later... the lighting is great, like when Clay leans back into darkness as he goes over some details.My 50's heist knowledge is quite thin, so this was very original to me. I also noted some very influential aspects, notably the entire concept of Reservoir Dogs, as well as things found in, say, The Dark Knight? Anyway, The Killing is an excellent film that hasn't been seen as much as it should. A very well woven tale. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about a group of men pulling off the ultimate heist at a horse race track...one that has never yet been pulled off. The actual robbery wasn't as impressive as the storyline. Right from the beginning, the film focuses on each character involved in the heist. It takes a look at each of their home lives, and tells us about their characters before the actual plot begins. I love this sentimental and intimate subjective view that is rarely seen in old movies like this. You really get a feeling of sympathy for a character like George, when you find out that his wife is unfaithful, and think..."maybe he is a good guy after all, and maybe his wife is the villain". The plot is more or less a typical 50's film noire piece, but it's early retrospective viewpoints(Tarantino-esquire)and overall suspense make this movie much more than your typical black and white crime flick. This movie had an absolutely perfect ending. It definitely gives viewers a good look at Kubric's cinematic craftsmanship at an early stage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrik gallops out of the gate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Killers" obviously owes a lot to "The Asphalt Jungle" of four years earlier, and also reflects the influence of the kind of semi-documentary post-war intrigues that Henry Hathaway and some others made -- "The House on 92nd Street", for instance -- with their baritone narrations and emphasis on clockwork precision. It isn't quite what we think of as a Kubrik film yet. The lighting, for example, doesn't seem to emanate from such strange sources as the floor, and there is still genuine emotion being shown on screen, a real sense of humanity, rather than its near absence.All that aside, it's an involving story of a complicated race track heist with a first-rate cast. Marie Windsor, as the treacherous adulteress, is sexy and gorgeous. (I kind of find Ileana Douglas interesting too.) Coleen Gray has less time on screen but is likewise sexy and gorgeous, but in a much more housewifely way. Yipes, what a nearly perfect face, full of excellent bone structure. It could have come from noplace but Nebraska. You can imagine Gray as once having been a virgin whereas the Windsor character seems to have been born debauched.The men are equally good. Sterling Hayden, the human monolith whose career ranks right up there in the first rank of the second rate. He was more interested in his yacht than his vocation, which he thought was silly. Elisha Cook, Jr., the schmuck, taken advantage of and repeatedly humiliated, yet again. Ted DeCorsia as a reliably corrupt cop, for him a role filled with decorum. Vince Edwards as a non-acting sleazy gigolo. A hairy mountainous Greek wrestler with some lines that reek of pomposity. (He's a chess aficionado; maybe that accounts for it.) Joe Sawyer as the low-echelon participant with a sick wife. (As I said, it harks back to "The Asphalt Jungle.") Timothy Carey as a racist equinocide who gets what's coming to him for using the "N" word. Then there's Jay C. Flippen in the complex role of the financier. It's "complex" because I've seen this film a dozen times but only tonight did I pay any real attention to the scene in which Flippen and Hayden part for the last time. Flippen has been an aw-shucks kind of softy throughout, but in this scene he tells Hayden that Hayden is like a son to him and proposes a trip around the world for just the two of them -- "Let the old world take a couple of spins" -- which today sounds suspiciously like a gay come on. Hayden however doesn't seem to catch any undertones and his departure is no more than friendly, but the camera lingers on Flippen's expression of extreme disappointment after Hayden has gone.I understand the movie had to be re-edited to make the narrative clearer but although some of the scenes overlap in time I didn't have any trouble following it. The plot is pretty clever, with no more than the usual number of holes in it. (One shotgun blast and one pistol shot and half a dozen people are turned into mincemeat.) It's an enjoyable movie with an ironic ending -- all that cash flying around in the prop wash, caused by some snotty lady's tiny and deformed dog -- but one supposes the moral code called for crime not to pay in 1956. I'm all for the punishment of thieves and murderers but I wanted to make a grab for all those bills floating about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Kubrick Feature Film of Real Worth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE KILLING was one of several movies made in the 1940s and 1950s that looked at the planning and carrying out of a robbery. Some of these films did not concentrate on them (like WHITE HEAT or HIGH SIERRA) but treated them as part of the plot. A few used the planning to comment on social hypocrisies (THE ASPHALT JUNGLE, where Louis Calhern is a prominent lawyer and backer of the jewelry heist, and the corrupt police chief remains a figure of importance in the smug self-congratulatory activities of John McIntyre's crusade against crime). But few went into the details of the heist to a really great degree. The contemporary film RIFIFI by Jules Daissin did, and it also showed how the great planning of the crime could not cover all contingencies nor the fact that their really was no honor among thieves (two points also brought out more comically in THE LADYKILLERS).Kubrick's film fits into this group, but it is also looking closer into the motivations of the participants: Elisha Cook's desire to make a "killing" so he'll have the money to win the love of his sexually bored wife Marie Windsor, Sterling Hayden's attempt to make the big theft that would make up for his prison time (and his hope to go off with Coleen Gray into a better future), Ted De Corsia's need to make a "killing" to pay off the loan sharks, etc.All the elements are brought together and fall apart one by one. The scheme (a robbery at a race track) requires two decoy events. One has a professional wrestler (Kola Kwariani) pretending to be drunk and starting a fight - so that the cops and guards at the track are spirited away from the area near the offices where the money is kept. The other has an army trained sniper (Timothy Carey) set himself up at the track's parking lot, to shoot a thoroughbred horse at the key point of a major race.The wrestler does a good job (in the disaster that follows, one hopes nobody links him to the events). But Carey gets fouled up (fatally, as it turns out) due to his attempts to be momentarily ingratiating with James Edward, the parking attendant. Edwards is an African American who is fully aware of the bigotry in our country. Carey, whether truthfully or not, acts very kindly, so that Edwards actually responds well. But Carey finally finds that Edwards sudden friendly responses are interfering with the timing of the shooting, and he turns nasty. Edwards resumes his stiff, unfriendly view of white people (understandable under these circumstances), and walks away. Later, when Carey dies, Edwards looks on quite coldly.The film, if it has a flaw, is a bit too quick in the results of violence. The mutual destruction of Hayden's gang and Vince Edwards gang (making the title really ironic) is a bit too sudden - but then most violence is really sudden.It was a neat, workman - like film, and it certainly showed that Kubrick could bring everything together (plot, cinematography, acting, characters). It was a giant step to the budget of PATHS OF GLORY which followed this film, but the strong hand in that director's chair was already making movies about crime before he turned to World War I.</fullReview>

In this attempt he has a crew and he organize his plan even better because he wants to succeed and take all the money and after to distribute them into the members of his crew.I liked this movie because of the plot which I believe that it was really good and the direction of Stanley Kubrick who made a really good job in this. His good job was obvious in the whole duration of this movie and if you watch this movie you will understand what I mean by this. About the interpretations I have to say that Sterling Hayden who played as Johnny Clay was simply outstanding and one more interpretation that I liked was Elisha Cook Jr's who played as George Peatty and he was equally good.Finally I have to say that "The Killing" is not a simple crime movie, is a movie which shows us what money can bring to people but also what things can take with them. Also wants to shows us in which things a man has to pay attention to and what really worth for him.</fullReview>

In my opinion, this movie is not the best. I found it a bit confusing, with the different point of views showing the same event going on throughout the movie, and the plot was not of major interest to me. I've never been into crime or violence or anything like that. I also found the ending to be a bit painful to watch. I did like a few things about it, although, the two consecutive scenes where the reluctant participant kills each of the other characters in the room after the robbery, and where he goes to see his girlfriend and shoots her, and then drops to his death himself, scared me quite a bit. Overall, I thought that it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen (it had its merits), but it was not my favorite, either.</fullReview>

Given his performance in The Asphalt Jungle I would have thought Hayden would have been a first choice for fledgling director Stanley Kubrick.Hayden was in the muscle end in The Asphalt Jungle, but in The Killing he's doing some planning as well. What he's got planned is an intricate robbery of a racetrack with crooked cop Ted DeCorsia, track bartender Joe Sawyer, Jay C. Flippen, and parimutuel clerk Elisha Cook, Jr. Each has a most specific job that is timed to the split second. In addition Timothy Carey and Kola Kwariani have some jobs to perform that are unknown to the others and are getting a flat fee off the top for what they do. Cook hasn't got his head in the game though. Who would with two timing high maintenance dame Marie Windsor as a wife. She learns enough to tip her boyfriend Vincent Edwards off to the scheme. Coleen Gray has the Jean Hagen role as Hayden's loyal girl friend.The robbery comes off pretty good, the scenes are done in the same manner as The Asphalt Jungle. Of course the usual problems involving the split and the getaway occur. A lot of that is taken from The Asphalt Jungle as well.The film was shot in and around Bay Meadows racetrack so it looks very real. Stanley Kubrick got such good reviews for this and deservedly so that Kirk Douglas hired him to direct the much bigger budgeted Paths of Glory. A career was born.The Killing is a finely edited and finely crafted piece of movie making. It's both a noir and a caper film and succeeds at both. The characters are realistic in a realistic setting. Everybody here can be proud of their participation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Momento: StinkBomb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Nobody loves Stanley Kubrick like I do. I own all of his movies; even this one and EYES WIDE SHUT, which is even worse than this one. I have an extensive collection of Film Noir but I am sorry this movie is awful. The main problem is that, while on a small scale, it does the usual Kubrick template of showing how deadly misconceptions of people are; it still does not work at all. The main problem is the MOMENTO temporal disaster. Like the even worse VANTAGE POINT, it tries to play temporally with before and after and show each character serially within the story. It just does not work. It wrecks the linear flow of the movie; ever grow up with a parent who wanted to go in the middle of the movie and stay and watch over up to where you came in? That is this movie. The whole idea of taking each character's story and showing it one after the other, with the other characters does not help thematic unity it produces chaos. No one's memory is that good; if you present each individual character's story and then unify for the short anticlimax it ruins the film. There is a reason this was never attempted again until Momento. Look, every master is entitled to a bomb. He was just starting out. I know if it were restored to a linear presentation, with this cast, photography it would be at the top of the film noir catalog with OUT OF THE PAST and LAURA. I paid 65 bucks for a Blu Ray Criterion Collection of this: it is just awful. Again, the story is excellent but the temporal juxtaposition will make your brain go, oh, I give up. He was up to his Alpine heights with his next effort; PATHS OF GLORY. From then on, he was from one mountaintop to another. But please, this is just terrible. It has none of what made Kubrick a genius; it is a straightforward Noir but the ripping the character stories into threads just wrecked the picture.The climax is a disaster. Does anybody think a criminal this intelligent would stuff all that money in a flimsy, threadbare, old crappy suitcase? Look, in Noir, evil always loses. This is ridiculous. It is such a clumsy, poorly written way to have Haydn get caught. It has zero credibility given the meticulous planning this character already evinced all throughout the movie. These two things together equal Kubrick's second worst movie; it is miles below his other works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, a superb final film noir of that era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy was this a surprise! Although I have been watching films for over 40 years, and had indeed heard of this movie, this was my first encounter, wow! When done well, there is no other genre that satisfies as film noir and this one was aces. Frankly, don't jump all over me, but I had considered Kubrick quite over-rated, never a big fan of Dr Strangelove (saw it first at way too young age, then ten years ago, and recently ... sorry, did nothing for me). On the other hand, in high school watched in awe 2001:A Space Odyssey, a long awaited film that was not very well received by critics, but adored by yours truly. Sure Kubrick gave us the the overlong, but incredible cast in Spartacus, the dazzling but uneven A Clockwork Orange, and so on. But for me, I'll take Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, WilliamWyler, even peak Spielberg,and many others over Kubrick.But with this low budget masterwork, I may have to think again. Too bad more 50's movies did not gamble by assembling a cast like this one! And although Philip Marlowe has been brilliantly done by Bogie and Mitchum and yes, Dick Powell, I wonder how Sterling Hayden might have tackled the role. Marie Windsor was overlooked for an Oscar nomination here, and Elisha Cook dazzling. Kudos to everyone and this precocious 27 year old director.Even better than Asphalt Jungle ... but, alas, why did we have to wait almost twenty years, and Technicolor, to deliver another film noir of this brilliance ... Chinatown of course!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shades of Kubrick greatness to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Killing', the late, great Stanley Kubrick's 1956 film about a race track heist stars Sterling Hayden (best known as Capt. McCluskey in The Godfather) as Johnny Clay, a recently released prisoner who already has his next job lined up ? holding up a race track, which will garner he and his gang, some of them employees of the track, a killing. Like most films of this genre, some elements of the plan work and some don't, causing a gradual unraveling until the story builds to a climax.The film itself is well-written and decently acted with virtually no stand-out characters, but Kubrick employs a writing technique that is fairly pervasive in film today, but not always done well ? telling the story from several different perspectives. I would imagine in 1956 it was fairly unusual to see the same scene several times, but from different angles and perspectives depending on who is featured in that scene, and probably not entirely popular, but in terms of vision it is brilliant. In 1956 cinema, gone were the days when an audience expected the guy in the white hat to win, but turning the villains essentially into protagonists, then giving each of their sides of the story was probably fairly rare. Kubrick, in writing 'The Killing' did just that, and did it with such style and intelligence that certainly it was expected that he would exhibit the vision and talent he would later be hailed for. Filmed in a stark and stylish black and white, 'The Killing' is a classic film noir masterpiece that is rarely mentioned, but those that have seen it praise it and its director, Stanley Kubrick, a man whose films are gut-wrenchingly phenomenal. 'The Killing' exhibits his early talent and flair for not only style but for writing a good, solid screenplay. This is a must-see for any Kubrick fan, certainly, but also for anyone who wants to see an early example of maverick storytelling.--Shel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we get a perfectly selected ensemble cast, seamlessly crackling dialog, a seedy locale, and such classic criminal obsessions as get-rich-quick and we're-smarter-than-everyone else. It all adds up to a hell of a ride. This film is great fun from the intense music in its opening frames to its inevitable, but not-quite-foreseeable denouement. We enjoy a little shiver of appreciation as we greet each character taking part in this superlative caper. Along the way we savor wonderful snippets of psychology brought to life -- the crooked cop interacting with his loan shark, the wimpy guy wrapping himself around the pinky of his slutty wife, the timid bookkeeper anesthetizing himself with booze to cope with the reality of his actions. The whole thing is expertly choreographed by the supremely confident alpha male played by Sterling Hayden. He thinks he's got his ducks lined up but doesn't plan on the inevitable crap that always somehow hits the fan in this life."They've got their problems and they've all got a little larceny in them," he tells his moll, Fay, played tremulously by Coleen Gray ("I'm not pretty and I'm not very smart, so please don't leave me alone anymore!"). Here we meet the likes of Marvin Unger (a crinkly browed Jay C. Flippen), the bookkeeper with a "contempt for gambling"; the track bartender (Joe Sawyer) who needs money to buy his wife's medicine, and the ironically titled Patrolman First Class Randy Kennan (Ted de Corsia), who craves the perks he can't afford on a cop's regular salary. "So I like to live good -- got any objection?" he asks his loan shark (Jay Adler). "Not at all -- as long as you don't overlook your obligation to me...Thank you, Randy. I was sure you'd see it my way..."Ooookay...Crowning this rogue's gallery of schemers is Elisha Cook, Jr., a milquetoasty cashier driven mad by his sexy, murderous spouse. Cook's facial expressions amaze, and his interactions with Sherry will leave your skin crawling. Even the tiny roles here are expertly pulled off. How about Kola Kwanani, the fight provocateur (read this Ukrainian wrestler's Wikipedia entry and weep)?; Vince Edwards as Sherry's slimy lover; James Edwards as a fascinating parking-lot attendant, and a threateningly mugged actor (whose name I couldn't discern) as a racehorse assassin. This movie shines as an example of amazingly executed ensemble work. It is also a paean to the messiness of life and man's fatal hubris. We humans only THINK we've got things straight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Undisputed High-Water Mark of American Noir - Kubrick Kills It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing is a smart-ass heist drama - a noir of the highest order - with a lip-smacking precision which is at odds with the summation: that all human designs are futile and frustrating. Stanley Kubrick's 84-minute labyrinthine thriller transports the moral contortions of film noir to the overwrought atmosphere of the race-track, suffusing them together with dread-inducing temporal uncertainty. The Killing is a story of a group of low-level hoods that hops around a heist at a race track, viewing the events from the perspective of the men involved. Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden, competently thumping a restrained characterization), just released from a 5-year stint in prison, instigates the operation, recruiting inside men from the track like bartender Mike, book-keeper Marvin, and clerk George (Elisha Cook, a particular standout), along with corrupt policeman Randy Kennan to orchestrate the daring heist. Each represents a specific role in the intricate process, a key piece to the overall puzzle which is deliberated over through clandestine meetings. Our unlikely schemers all believe their newly acquired riches will salvage whatever opportunities they've previously squandered. But as in most film noir, here too a dame holds the key to doom. The weak-willed George naively believes the money will satisfy his wide-eyed viper of a wife, Sherry (spectacularly portrayed by Marie Windsor). Her passive-aggressive interrogations are ripe with assaults on George's nonexistent masculinity, and what begins as idle pillow talk quickly avalanches into full-blown disaster. Overall the plot works like clock-work; drawing us into the scheme and then milking the pleasures of witnessing it unfold exactly as planned. Well almost! The movie soon settles into a thrilling vein culminating into an unexpected and brutally ironic climax as the group's hard-earned cash literally blows away - a compelling image of great symbolic value that visually mirrors early images of the racetrack grounds littered with losing tickets. Kubrick holds the image for maximum impact, and the look on Hayden's face is a deft summary of film noir's intrinsic fatalism: all are doomed, and the only question is how.It is a tremendous pleasure to see how it all unfolds, largely because Kubrick directs it with the skill of a consummate pro (despite being all of 27 years old then). Kubrick's structuring of the material makes it a brisk film noir, moving us around the narrative like an unassembled jigsaw puzzle that slowly but surely comes together in the end, but never in the way we might expect it. And by doing so, he propels the acidic realm of film noir into something even darker!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great heist movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Career criminal Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) leads a band of crooks in a complicated racetrack heist. There is a corrupt cop Kennan (Ted de Corsia), betting window teller George Peatty (Elisha Cook Jr.), sharpshooter Nikki Arane (Timothy Carey), a fighter (Kola Kwariani) and the bartender Mike O'Reilly (Joe Sawyer). However the plan doesn't include George trying to impress his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) who instead tells her boyfriend Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money for themselves. Clay is thinking of settling down and marrying Fay (Coleen Gray).Stanley Kubrick has taken the familiar heist movie and filled it with the dark backstory. It's a bit confused at the beginning which is alleviated by the constant narration. The plot flows a bit better with tension after George tells his wife Sherry. She's a great character and gives the movie a jolt. While Sterling Hayden is a very good actor, the movie probably needs somebody much more charismatic. That's my only complaint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a fantastic Noir and its no surprise from a Stanley Kubrick Film. This movie set the foundation for so many classic crime stories to come. This movies roots can be clearly seen in so many classics of our time. This movie sets the tone for films such as Goodfellas, the Oceans series and so many other crime dramas. We really see Kubrick take off and find his style in this film. The filming style is so experimental, something never yet seen before that Kubrick would turn into his own form. This movie gets a bit of a dated feel from the dull narrators voice and the horrible way they show the passage of time using this narrator. Many of the characters were one dimensional but that is something typical of a crime heist type movie such as this. To say Kubrick is a perfectionist is an Understatement and that can be seen in The Killing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the recurrent themes in Stanley Kubrick's filmography is the conflict between rational and irrational: reason on one side and random, fateful events on the other. In Barry Lyndon, the key moments of the protagonist's life fall like domino pieces under the push of unpredictable circumstances, starting with his father's death; in 2001, we have the hominids and the monolith, HAL and the astronauts; in The Shining, the Overlook ghosts tapping into Jack's psychological deterioration.In The Killing, one of Kubrick's first efforts, an adulterous woman, a dog and a horseshoe are the unforeseen factors which turn a meticulous heist into a wobbly, doomed disaster.Unlike the robbers' plan, the movie itself goes off with clockwork precision - neat cinematography and precise performances for an underrated noir.7,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing was a cool movie in that fact that it was a well planned and thought out scheme to rob a horse race of a lot of money. The actors all portrayed the devious group really well and the execution of the plan was quite elaborate and was excellent. The only thing i didn't like was how it would tell you all about 1 persons day and then go to the next. It was kind of hard to follow because once you got to the 3rd guy it was hard to remember what the first guy had to do at say 2:47 for example. It would have been a lot better to show everyone doing what they had to at the same time instead all of one persons at once. Overall the movie and idea is superb just the way that they filmed it was what bothered me.</fullReview>

The form was not superb, however for this film it was very fitting. The characters played their parts correctly, in really portraying their emotions through character. The message of this film was very deep. I feel between form and content, I was more interested in the content. This film probably was not meant to be a part of the elaborate type. It jumped right into the scheme of the plot. The way the film was put together and scripted, there was no way an audience member would be left thinking " I wonder what happened". This film cuts to the chase and is very straight forward. As in every film, the lighting is very important in that it really set the tone for the murder scenes. The music played an important role as it also staged the emotions of the audience. Like I mentioned, the plot was awesome, however this was not my favorite film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I thought was going to be a shady horse race movie turned out to be a lot more than I expected. The Killing became more of an action movie, with guns and money. One scene that I was drawn into was the scene where the guy puts on the mask and holds several people hostage until he gets his money. The guy who's wife is cheating on him...you know he's not coming out on top. Instead he's getting the short end of the stick. Several scenes in this movie are rather far-fetched, like the scene where the winnings get thrown out the window. Really, no one noticed the large money bag dropping several stories to the ground? The airport scene was completely ridiculous, all thanks to a runaway dog. In a way, everybody is a loser in the end.</fullReview>

It reminded me of ammeter wrestling, i could help but laugh. The hold-up it self was very well planned. I thought they might actually get away with it. The scene when the character George (the loud mouth) falls to the ground after being shot and brings down the parrot cage with him was a clever play by Kubrick. George just couldn't keep his mouth shut, just like that parrot. The protagonist Johnny (Sterling Hayden) played a superb role. His voice, personality and demeanor was right on point for his character. I couldn't believe after being so meticulous Johnny went and bought cheapest crappy suitcase when he had all that money.</fullReview>

I especially enjoyed the bit of editing done where the viewer saw what the shooter of the horse was aiming for. I like how it was like we were seeing it all magnified. I also thought the scene at the end with the money floating all around was beautifully shot, even though in the movies context it was an unfortunate thing to happen. The different characters were interesting. I enjoyed how they all had distinct personalities and they were relatively easy to differentiate. The actors did a fantastic job as well, especially in the final few scenes. However, something in this movie just didn't do it for me and I can't even pinpoint what it was.

		<shortDescription>Even one of Kubrick's earliest films is truly something special!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the very few Kubrick movies that I had never seen before. It's also being one of his earliest ones, making it perhaps all the more surprising to find out how great this movie actually is and how much I turned out to love it. But then again, there is no such thing as a bad Kubrick movie, so perhaps I should had known better.Evertything about this movie works out great in my opinion. It's not just Kubrick's directing that makes this a great and entertaining movie to watch but also really its story.It's more being a film-noir type of movie and its absolutely fascinating to see Kubrick handling this particular genre. Like all of his movies, it's not just being a standard genre movie, that plays by all of the rules or sticks to all of its familiar tropes. It's perhaps only being a true film-noir in its setup but the overall execution of it is something far more than just that. It uses many ingredients, from multiple different genres and Kubrick manages to blend them all together into one great and entertaining little movie!A great aspect about its story and storytelling is that its being for some part non-linear. Now, nothing special about that you would think but you have to remember this was a 1956 movie and non-linear storytelling in movies really wasn't anything that common yet. Sure, movies always had flashbacks in them, pretty much since the earliest days of cinema on already but non-linear storytelling is a whole other ballgame. The non-linear storytelling is mostly used to show us how the big heist plays out. It's absolutely great to see how the many different characters all did their little part and how it adds up to the eventual heist. And it's always showing you something more and different, so it never feels as if the movie starts repeating itself after a short while. It's great fun and fascinating to watch, all throughout! It besides lets its simple story and setup work out as something great and real clever.What I also really liked about its story were its characters. It's being a real heist movie but not with some typical heist characters in it. There are no Steve McQueen's or Paul Newman's in this movie. Just a bunch of middle aged guys, who look like they could be your next door neighbor. They are not being typical crooks and they are all in it for different and often personal reasons. And the movie really takes its time to show the motivations of the many different characters, which lets it all play out as something engaging and it gets you more involved with the story and its different characters. This also helps to make the movie often a more tense one.The movie has some really great moments in it, that show what a perfectionist and visionary film-maker Stanley Kubrick was. I especially also liked the very dynamic black &amp; white cinematography of the movie, which also helped to give the movie some real pace, even though it probably isn't about halfway through that the actual heist gets set in motion. Kubrick style is definitely showing already in this early movie done by him and it's fun to see how some moments and compositions should remind you of some of Kubrick's later works.It's a wonderfully put together, stylish, fun and fast paced entertaining heist movie, that I absolutely loved watching!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>original heist film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen a Stanley Kubrick film, and I must say this was quite different from most other contemporary movies I've seen from the time period. Kubrick's method of showing the audience how the heist takes place is both unique and effective; as he brings us back to the same point in time on different occasions to show us what each individual member of the heist crew was doing. It's an interesting technique because I don't think it was seen before this, and has been copied ever since (Ocean's Eleven, Resivior Dogs...). The thing I think I enjoyed most about this movie was that even though the main characters, with whom we somewhat empathize and maybe even relate to, are the "bad guys" and do not "win" in the end. George's character is especially easy to hate, as he lets others walk all over him and is completely naive to the fact of his wife's infidelity. Many scenes with George are film-noiresque featuring heavy shadows with him attempting to sort out problems with his wife (or the "femme fatal" aspect). Overall this movie was great and I really enjoyed it. Nothing too flashy in terms of special effects or camera-work, just pure dialogue and event driven madness. Loved it, especially the end scene showing the heist money being blown away by a plane on the runway. Classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Killing Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really appreciated the ending of this movie, where most of the characters involved in the heist were actually killed, further playing off of the title of the film, "The Killing". A killing, aside from referring to the taking of a life can also refer to making a "killing" of money such as stealing it, which is what the plot revolves around in the this film.Kubrick used a very unique style for the time to tell this story, jumping from one character to the next as events unfold, sometimes even retelling parts from the point of view from another character. Of course, some of this uniqueness was lost when it was requested he include a narrator to help keep the audience informed. I wonder how it would be to watch it without the narration, if I would still be able to keep up or not. I suspect that I would, as today we are more familiar with timelines not always following chronological order.</fullReview>

It is a classic robbery film. Never leaving a dull moment The Killing(1956) was very well plotted. The characters if in any other situation would not have been friends or trusted in each other. Although they were different they had a similar greed to be wealthy. This is a reason it was so unpredictable. It kept you wondering if their plan would work and if these characters would stick together. Some of the characters although committing a crime were in it for the right reasons,like having a sick wife. The narration helped keep track of the time. The darkness of the film helped set the mood for many of these cold characters. The ending was great. You had to know that was too good to be true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie used a unique form of story telling in which it sets up each characters role and how they prepare before the job. Right before we see the job it rewinds to another characters actions that day. I also liked the use of the narrator to set up the time and place in order for the viewer to keep things straight. Another thing that I found unique to this movie, at least up until more modern times is the use of a point of view shot. That really gave a sense of what happened and I felt as if I was right in the scene. The action was good and I think that it was a good plan overall which really made it disappointing when it goes terribly wrong. This film also uses some film noir style lighting for dramatic effect in which the men are planning the heist. A great story of how you can't plan for everything and that nature can foil even the best of plans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing was a groundbreaking film in terms of presentation of plot. If not the very first, it was one of the first times a film was shown as a series of simultaneous events all culminating in the "ultimate heist." You would think this would add confusion for the viewer (and so did the brain trust behind the film as seen with the use of the narrator) but I think the film could've moved along just fine without it. The only criticism I have of the film is that the narration seemed a little heavy handed at times. What I really like about this film though, is that it's the emergence of Stanley Kubrick. Arguably one of the best directors in American film history and this is the film that really propelled him into the A movie market. Solid movie with an innovative plot structure 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is to this day one of my all time favorite directors. Film's like "A Clockwork Orange," "The Shining," and "Eyes Wide Shut" are all moving, shocking, and sometimes terrifying. When I was about to watch this movie, I geared myself up for some kind of mental mind twist, and anticipated wanting to watch it multiple times in order to understand it. Instead, I found Kubrick's first movie, which was a B movie, exactly that, a B movie. It was a low-budget crime movie that was generally okay, but lacked the Kubrick mind-bend. While Kubrick brock the mold with elements such as real time series of events, and a surprise ending, the movie was still just a crime drama where the bad guy looses in the end. This movie did not measure up to any other Kubrick movie I had seen before and was utterly disappointed in it. Perhaps I, and others, would find more entertainment in it if it was not in fact a Stanley Kubrick movie, but something by another directer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not my kind of movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're watching the killing and looking for a more mature movie, you've come to the right place. This is Kubrick's first serious film and he does a great job of capturing that tone. For me though, I felt that it was boring because I don't usually like the serious toned movies. That doesn't make it a bad movie in my opinion though because i'm not a fan of the genre. He captures the actors beautifully and his lighting is magnificent. The actors banter between each other is on point and they add on to each others acting. The adventure in itself that the characters go on is pretty exciting on its own. There are twists and turns that keeping you guessing what is going to happen until the very last scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repetitive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not a fan of this film in the slightest. It did not hold my attention and I was constantly distracted and even so, I found that I didn't miss anything. It's not to say that I didn't like this film because I am not a fan of crime films or of "B-movies" I was just not a fan of it because the plot was thin and also extremely repetitive. At the time of the heist everything was seen about eight different times to see the different points of view of each character and how they pulled off their robbery. Though interesting in it's execution, there was only a sour ending as none of them ever got away with it because they died or were caught. This film did not leave a good impression in my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best heist movie I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing was honestly unbelievably awesome. When I think of recent heist films like the Ocean movies or Italian Job, I think that those are great heist movies, but then I saw The Killing, and it put those to shame. First, the cinematic side of it was great. It was fast moving, tightly constructed, and the lighting in each scene mattered. Take the scene where they are planning the break-in with the low key lighting, as they are centered around a table with one overhead lamp. The shadows on their face are so great you can barely make them out. The back and forth of going into the past to see the planning, and then coming present to the actual heist was brilliant. The voice over could have been done way with and was not the right voice for the voice over. But that's beside the point.Now the plot, it was genius. Pulling people from every different aspect of life, a police officer, a track worker, a random gun expert, etc. There were no holes in the plan, except for the weak torn husband, who was naiive to his wife's adultery, which ruined the whole plan. The rest of the plot was perfect, and would have work if it weren't for the one weak husband. Everybody is killed, in two sequential bloodbath scenes which was kind of sudden and unbelievable, but the ending was the most unbelievable, and yet it still worked. The money flying all over the runway is a bit out there, but it works and leaves us angry but in awe of a great ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story, unsatisfying ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can tell this is Kubrick's early work, because it doesn't possess that special feel that or the truly amazing photography that every following movie has. So I guess I could say it was the last of his non-trademark movies. And what a finale it was. The story is entertaining, kudos to Kubrick for a truly great script. There are no complaints about the acting either, for some reason I especially enjoyed the screen time of Kola Kwariani as Maurice Oboukhoff. Sadly this was the only movie he ever made. I especially remember the scene where he starts the bar fight and the cops simultaneously tear his shirt so he's left topless. As I said the photography isn't anything special, but there are some nice light and shadow moments that were also present in "Killer's kiss". The only bad part of the movie are the last five minutes. After all the hard work and the successful completion the "stick up" Johhny Clay, trying to get out of the city, makes an unnecessary scene at the airport check in. After demanding that they let him bring his enormous suit-case on board, and failing, he makes a terrible excuse and doesn't even tell them to take special care of the valuables inside. I mean c'mon, there are 2 million dollars(an enormous amount of money) and if you couldn't bring it with you on board you would at least insist they take special care of it, because there's some priceless china or something in it. Right?! What happens next is even more idiotic, and any fool can guess what happens, but the main actor just stands there and does nothing. He could at least, AT LEAST, duct tape that friggin suit-case, because I knew exactly what was going to happen(and if you saw the movie you know exactly what I mean) the moment the close up of it was shown. If it were me, I'd mummify that sucker, it'd be safer than a black box. Sadly, the ending doesn't round up a great movie, it spoils it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film that put Kubrick on the map seems very dated. Excellent use of light and shadows with mostly solid acting but Hayden's performance doesn't hold up nowadays. Some of his dialouge is almost laughable. Fight scene at the bar racetrack looks terribly staged by today's standards. Are theydancing or fighting? Please! Best performances, without question, belong to Cook &amp; Windsor. I knew the racetrack looked familiar and surprisingly, it's the recently closed Bay Meadows in San Mateo. Ending on tarmac is rather crass with poodle then turns anti-climatic as Hayden knows it's over. However, lots of heavy hitters involved in The Killing so as a curio or film noir, it might hold solid interest for some but seem rather trite to others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this intended to be a comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching The Killing for the 2nd time after recently purchasing the DVD to complete my Kubrick collection. I came away from the experience with a slightly higher appreciation than I did upon my initial viewing, though by and large I find many aspects of this film to be laughably bad.It's difficult to discern whether or not this film is attempting to be a deliberate deadpan hard boiled drama that hasn't aged well or a parody of one. It's possible it was intended to be a little bit of both, and if so, then Kubrick truly was ahead of his time (certainly Elisha Cook's relationship with his wife has comical overtones, and the squaking parrot during the shooting scene is intended to be funny) but I tend to think that in 1956 the general public's appreciation of satire wasn't as fine tuned as it is now.The cinematography is gorgeous and obviously inspired by the film noir films of the 40's as well as the acting styles, but The Killing reminded me of a Dragnet episode in it's delivery - from the monotone narration to Sterling Hayden's fast talking character, one doesn't feel as if they're watching a film from 1956 than from, say, 1944. Dragnet was never intended to be a comedy, but I find it one of the most hysterical shows ever made because it's so laughably deadpan and serious in it's dramatic presentation. It can easily be judged harshly with a modern eye because the scope of modern society's appreciation for entertainment, or more specifically, our sense of humor, is more sophisticated now and has developed over time. (although Kangaroo Jack throws that theory right out the window). So, having said all that, I'm not completely convinced that Kubrick intended this film to be a satire, and I find it unintentionally over the top. It plays like a jumbled mess from a young filmmaker still finding his talent and honing his storytelling craft, entertaining, for sure, but at first appearing to be meticulously crafted and ending up with one of the dumbest copout finales ever put to film. (unless this IS intended to be a comedy).See Taking of the Pelham One Two Three for a similiar plotline/finale that's done right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't agree that it's a great film; Kubrick hadn't broken out yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Paths of Glory, we see Kubrick's "coming out"; the beginnings of his future aesthetic, with uncompromisingly straight-up dialog and a directness and unaffectedness of approach that made him an the undisputed master we now know him to be.In The Killing, we see the beginnings of his beginnings. The hints are there, but it's too patchy to be able to say that the end product is well-knit. Some of the dialog is good. Attention to getting professionalism out of the actors/actresses lapses often enough to attract notice and mar the experience. I used to think that voice-over was invariably a cheap expedient; but upon refection, Kubrick's voice-over work in Barry Lyndon is well, well implemented. The voice-over work in The Killing grates the moment you first hear it, and then it becomes a noir ghost come back to haunt you every time it kicks in.I think the story is trying to say something about "best-laid-plans", and that's cool. But the set-up for the denouement doesn't feel whole and right and good. Hayden's character has 2 million bucks, but buys a cheap, cardboard suitcase from a rundown dive of a luggage shop to stow it in? Sorry, it just doesn't compute, narratively speaking. I'm reminded of the ending of Manon of the Spring. Montand's character finds out that his whole amoral/jaded outlook on life was the result of a letter lost in the mails, before the age of the telephone. You have to digest that plot twist in light of the technical limitations of the period in which it is set. The plot twist at the very end of The Killing doesn't have this excuse. Even the similar, chaos-wrought twist at the end of No Country for Old Men works better because it is truly out of Anton Chighur's control. Perhaps Kubrick might have more carefully considered how to engineer this to make Hayden's character a true victim of circumstances.What's good? Like I said, much of the dialog is good; some of it soars. Characterizations are generally good, even if the acting is a little stilted here and there. Of course, the cinematography is excellent. Oddly, the decision to make Hayden's character's love interest a last-minute, undeveloped character struck me a lot more honest than other crime movies where the plot development seems to be on its knees begging us to emotionally bond to criminals by over-developing the love interest angle. The Killing doesn't do this, and in fact even goes the other way, by showing shallow, self-deceived romantic conceits and feints among the criminal set. That's honest, and therefore good.It's worth watching simply because it's Kubrick. If it works better for you than it did for me, then good. If you find some of the same issues I did, then at least it informs your perspective on how a great director/artist like Kubrick grows. Personally, I've always enjoyed watching artists grow, even in retrospect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent but unnecessary crime thriller; and as always, old Stan can't help his rabid misogyny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't agree, just remember how the coup fails and everyone?except Arane--end ups dead or in prison because of a woman. Two women are in fact responsible for the disasters that befall the whole group. The bulk of it is betrayed by the wife of one of the men who tells of the robbery to her lover, which proceeds then to ruin everything when becoming too wise for his own good and trying to rob the robbers. Then, Johnny, who had managed to break free and unscathed, is unintentionally brought down by another woman, whose poodle escapes from her arms in the airport and runs to the runway, causing the fall of the suitcase with the heist money from a golf cart and its accidental opening, which makes the bills come out and scatter to the wind. No, old Kubrick could never conceal his hatred of the female gender. I'm not trying to pass myself for a sharp knife here, but I already knew where things would end up when--earlier--scheming Sherry had told her husband that there was something unsavory about his friend Johnny but she couldn't quite bring herself to say what was it. Naturally, I didn't need to be a foreseer to know where this one was going; I only needed to know of Stan's pathologic misogyny. Anyway, TK confirms to me--if any need I had--that he went from mediocrity--the 50s--to greatness--the 60s, 70s--and back to mediocrity, and blatant misogyny--in the late 70s and beyond.As title says, a decent but superfluous crime flick. Almost everything here had already been done, seen, in better flicks. The characters are stereotypical: ex-cons shooting for a big job; gals, good and bad; corrupt policeman; washed up fighter, wrestler; proverbial barman; tickets clerk, it looks like a dry run for The Sting. It's like SK is just trying to prove his hand; like say Tarantino trying to do science fiction. The "intimate" scenes look rather contrived and man, Edwards is the worst actor I've ever seen; what makes him look even worse is that his "romantic" scene goes right before another excellent one with greats such as Hyden &amp; Cook.I'd say, the only thing that saves this one from being a regular dog is the superb acting by some, especially Hayden. This man was the real deal. Every one of his scenes drips tension, he heats up the screen just by being there. The cinematography is in so-so land; the pacing, decent but the editing from hell. Stan gets all artsy and mixes ups time lines, which only brings confusion, when a simple lineal plot would have had the same effect. The plot is just Been There, Seen That stuff, but the plot development makes for a mildly interesting flick, if you can put all together in your mind. Good for a 6/10. BTW: TK lacks real thrill, as you know beforehand the ending--this is "clean" money to be robbed, not "dirty" one, as in The Sting, Jackie Brown. Also, a voice over is usually there to help with the atmosphere of a flick; to complement mood, visuals?as in AB, AN--but here it's rather making up for SK's shortcomings, telling us about what he is incapable of showing in the screen.A few obvious flaws: some people saw Johnny slipping into the restricted area during the fight; why didn't they rat on him? How could Arane expect to shoot the horse without being seen by the parking lot attendant, only meters away? How Randy was able to retrieve the money bag thrown from the window, in broad daylight, in a horse track with a attendance of 100000? When Johnny knocks out Sherry he doesn't know who she is; yet when she wakes up, they talk as if they knew each other, she even calls him by name. I don't think that cops guarding 2 million would leave them alone to go stop a bar fight. And why a room containing all that cash got no bars, grill, in the window? The firefight is badly done too. You hear some shots, see nothing and suddenly everyone in the room is dead. How it happened? Sherry's shooting is even worse. She sees fitting to spout a few comments on life, marriage, all that with a slug in her tummy, before falling dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, But Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are films which can stand the strain of time with complete success, and others which have difficulties in surviving this process. I am more inclined to put "The Killing" in the second, rather than the first category.This should not mean that we are not talking about an interesting film. Directed by young but talented Stanley Kubrick, "The Killing" is a typical film-noir in which we watch the preparation and execution of a heist in which a race track is to be robbed. The master mind is Johnny Clay (Hayden), who has planned the job and recruited the team who will assist him in perpetrating it. Everything goes smoothly, bar one detail: After learning about the heist by her weak husband George Peatty (Cook), Sherry (Windsor) tells her boyfriend Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) about it, and he in turn, decides to become part of it...The plot probably sounds average, and indeed it is so. Shown in numerous variations throughout the history of cinema, the story of the heist-gone-wrong-due-to-someone's-betrayal can't be very elevating; all the more so, as in this case we do not encounter any significant twists which might raise the heat a bit.Also, the performances are simply satisfactory, but nothing beyond that. Forget about big names giving breathtaking acts; everyone is doing their job as required, but that is all.Yet, despite the beyond-average plot and the just-above-average performances, lies Kubrick's excellent direction. He is the powerhouse behind this film, and it shows.And what is the net balance of all the above? Well, although it was probably considered great four decades ago, one cannot help but feel it is quite dated in 2005. The film is interesting, yes, but its age cannot be concealed. Features like the use of a narrator voicing the plot were probably OK for the time, but they tend to be annoying today. 5/10.</fullReview>

Sterling Hayden carrying a guitar case like in "Johnny Guitar" the year before. Perfectly suited music all the way. Three, no, four very important ladies, very different, each with excellent characterization - one gets shot. Kola Kwariani almost succeeds in stealing the show in the first rustle. Elisha Cook Jr scared stiff all the way but almost a survivor. Marie Windsor frightfully cool. How could possibly anything go wrong? Well, it all did. As hardcore and hard-boiled as a noir can be. No exaggerations needed. Already in his next film Kubrick started exaggerating. "A day at the races"?</fullReview>

Maybe this movie does not raise this question, but that was my thoughts when watching this first superb movie by a maestro S.Kubrick. Acting was good in this movie but it the direction that makes this a very involving picture from start till finish. At running time 1 h 24 min it sometimes gets a bit draggy when in scenes with one character wife - she is beyond a manipulative one, even for a movie. Overall, "The Killing" is a very, very good movie. It is surely not maestro's best, but it was a great start. Superbly directed simple and kinda average story is not to be missed one who loves good old movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's noir stands the test of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even as a young (28!) director, Kubrick manages to tell a story masterfully. It is a heist movie, and it tells you just enough to let you know what is going on. There is never a "ok, here's the plan"-scene, but rather you start piecing it together as you see it start unfolding. You are never explained how this assorted group of gentlemen find their way together, but the chemistry and (sometimes lack of) connection between them is still obvious.Maybe due to it being a cheap movie for its time, some of the acting is a bit overdone, but not in a way to break the flow of the story. And if you like the noir-style of man, you will not be disappointed.The climax of the movie is a bit silly compared to the rest of the movie, and while the relationship between the characters has its consequences, the ending of the movie is more about luck, or lack of it. Maybe that's a fine irony to have in a movie about betting on horses? All in all it holds up well. Kubrick didn't want to have narration, but it adds character to the movie, and makes it stand out against modern day films that are inspired by it. The fragmented way of telling the story seems natural, as it builds tension rather than act as a distraction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing is a very talented thriller noir film that shows the robbery of a horse race track. Coming from Stanley Kubrick, we expect him to shoot the film in an interesting way. And we get just that. The first portion of the film shows us the daily lives of the people who are to be involved in the robbery. No nonsense leader Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is planning to take his share of the stolen money and run away with his fiancé Fay (Coleen Gray). Others in the team include Patrolman Randy Kennan (Ted De Corsia) who is a corrupt police officer, George Peatty (Elisha Cook) a bank teller at the rack, and a sharp shooter named Nikki Arane (Timothy Carey). Then we see them meet and discuss the robbery. Peatty is the inside man, Clay will grab the money itself and throw it to Kennan, and Arane will create a distraction. The most exciting sequence is the heist. I won't spoil that scene but it is very intense, well shot and exciting. And those are the words that really describe the film. It's a very good bank heist film so give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I found out that this film was directed by the great, Stanley Kubrick, I had high hopes for it. I really enjoy movies where the main character, usually a criminal, states that this will be the last heist/robbery/drug deal that they will commit before going "straight" because if there is one thing that I have learned from that, its that they almost ALWAYS get caught, or something goes array. Although the heist goes off without a hitch, in the end it doesn't go as planned because they loose the money. My favorite scene had to be the scene in which Johnny and Fay are at the airport and trying to get the luggage with all of the money on the plain. In true Kubrick form, the suspense in not knowing whether or not, after all of the deaths, Johnny and Fay would get away with it. This film doesn't take place in a linear form, but that's okay because it is not that difficult to keep up with and understand, as some non-linear films can be.</fullReview>

At first I thought the movie was going slow but it surprised me, the film moved at a fast pace. It was needed because it kept me drawn and at the "edge of my seat." It's pace was great for the plot, it made you feel as if you were apart of the robbery. When the characters were at the track some of the scenes felt a little redundant. One scene in particular, the camera man showed the horses lining up to begin the race. I think it was great how the scenes were mapped out. One scene would show us something that happened later in the robbery then it would go to something that currently happening to something that happened earlier in the day. It worked out perfectly. It made for a great story line, and it kept the film going. It also made it interesting to the mind and eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's first masterpiece. Not his first movie - his third, in fact - but his first classic.Not your typical Kubrick movie though. Quite short - about 80 minutes - and essentially a film noir crime drama. We are used to sweeping epics with a large morality tale or social commentary built into them. This is a straight-down-the-line crime drama (and a great one at that).Essentially Kubrick used this movie to establish his reputation, then started making the sorts of movies he wanted to make.Solid plot. Has a fair degree of complexity, as the crime requires many moving parts and almost split-second timing. However, this doesn't make it confusing. Everything fits together perfectly, and makes sense.The attention-to-detail shown must have influenced Quentin Tarantino, as it reminded me of movies like Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown.Great direction by Kubrick. Everything fits together seamlessly and the pacing is spot-on. The only negative is the narration, or, more specifically, that is is there at all. Much of it wasn't necessary - we can see which character is involved, we can figure out what is happening. It felt like spoon-feeding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing is an innovative heist film about the planning and execution of a complex racetrack robbery. The film stars Sterling Hayden as Johnny Clay, a convict fresh out of prison and the mastermind behind the heist. After his plan ends successfully and he has the cash in his possession, Clay arrives at the hideout to find an accomplice wounded and bloody. He tries to devise a new plan but buckles under the pressure and becomes too clumsy to escape.The Killing is what I would consider to be the standard definition of a 'very good' film. More than good, less than great. In the film we get an interesting heist, executed very well, and structured in a unique way. The dialog holds up well enough to progress an erratic narrative, and when the heist itself is underway and we get to see the plan in action, the film shows enough to not disappoint. Once the heist is over and the real climax takes place with George Peatty confronted by the man that's taking his wife away from him, the film begins to fall apart. Clay, the man who singlehandedly orchestrated the daring heist the film is centered around, is now faced with devising a new escape route for himself. This should be a simple task for the criminal mastermind, but everything he does becomes poorly conceived and falls apart. His plan boils down to "I need to buy a suitcase large and sturdy enough to fit millions of dollars into, but I can't spend very much money on it so I'll settle for this busted up pawnshop suitcase that looks like it'll fall apart any second! Then I'll just fly away like nothing ever happened." This may have been on purpose to show that Clay had fallen victim to the stress of the endeavor, but pair that with the clumsy, pointless scene where he pulls over on the side of the road to stuff the money into the suitcase as haphazardly as possible and you've just completely lost me. The film redeems itself just the slightest with a great final scene in which we see Clay give up on himself and surrender to the authorities. It's so well done you could see the defeat in his eyes and feel it through the screen, and fading out there did a lot to preserve the impact the film had prior to the broken suitcase, but the damage was done. This is what took a solid 8 down to a 7, for me.It was interesting to see a Stanley Kubrick film from before he had developed his distinct 'Stanley Kubrick' type style. You get to see reflected in The Killing the work of a talented writer/director before he had the chance to recognize his potential. Kubrick gave this film a real earnest effort; it was before he was so well established and he still needed to prove himself. This gives The Killing a much rougher, tougher feel than his future films. This is partly a major asset to the film because, as he will go on to prove, Kubrick is adept at creating violent tension, but it also takes away. It lacks the originality we all know he can add to his films. It seems as if he's holding back in some aspects to create what will hopefully be a success without defying convention. You can see what looks to be glimpses of his signature style breaking through to the surface, but I don't think he had the experience to refine them into classic Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film! For the most part I think the characters overall "plan" was quite mysterious and great BUT I did notice some parts of it that didn't make sense to me and I just couldn't get past. To start off with, yet tragic it was bound to happen. I do not understand why someone with 2 million dollars would buy a suit case that couldn't even shut all the way. I think that he could have spared just a twenty or something to in the end keep the whole 2 million. I do realize that he was in a pinch because his buddies had some technical issues on their end BUT he specifically said earlier in the film that whoever was left with the money would keep it until it was safe to split up. They should have had a back up plan. I also didn't get why he had to go to a random field to dump the mass amount of cash into the suit case?he was just in his secluded room that he rented out for the entire week. Why go to the field where you risk your money blowing away? Foreshadowing? These aspects ruined it for me big time!I did like the use of discontinuity editing though. I think that it added a bit of confusion that was really nice. All of a sudden while watching you realized that you saw this part (the part when the Greek guy gets into the bar fight, and the guy makes the move to steal the money) all ready, but then it goes into more details and it actually shows him taking the money from the race track people. This was a really nice way to show it. Overall the little glitches in the plot were annoying but the whole movie, in my opinion, was a success!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An immaculately made robbery movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An immaculately made robbery movieI knew Kubrick as a man with surpassing amount of vision that shall overpower any kind of human imagination. Be it Barry Lyndon or A Clockwork Orange everything has to be immaculate and at the same time engaging and the feeling at the end of it all should be 'I need more' and The Killing was a beginning of a new vision called Kubrick.It's a simple tale about planning of robbery but it's so well made that it is gripping and exhilarating. There are stereotypes for most part that have to do their role as specified by the leader of the Mob and he too acts out his part well but what is captivating is not the characteristics or characters but the motive and how they achieve it.The art direction is superb and so is the cinematography the editing so precise that any frame if removed makes the movie bland but all said and done above all the screenplay is what has to be appreciated and awarded. A scene even though comes multiple times has different perspectives of different characters and that's what makes it special. Mind you its made in 1956 where the classic format is still at the helm as there was no Nolan or Kaufman yet but this was an attempt that was so convincingly made that the conviction of Kubrick must be more than commended or lauded it should actually be rewarded while ironically it did not get even nominated. Which means probably of the quality of movies being made at that time?Having said all the above, the movie ends in a silly way, an altercation about a suitcase and then the dog's hit and run case. Yes, this was the humorous part I believe.It's a not to be missed out thriller that's simple yet engaging surely watch it for Kubrick's vision. It's 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling Heist Film Noir with a Memorable Femme Fatale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Sean Lamberger ("The Thick, Pulpy Roots of Modern Heist Epics", Sean Lamberger from Bradenton, FL, 20 January 2012) provides background information about the evolution of the story. Although Robert J. Maxwell's review has spoilers ("Kubrik gallops out of the gate", Robert J. Maxwell (rmax304823@yahoo.com) from Deming, New Mexico, USA, 10 June 2005) he also provides good information that this review borrows from.**** The Killing (1956, Stanley Kubrick), a race track caper, is one of cinema's best examples of Film noir&#xfeff;. Despite its low budget, it is also a premier heist film. Just 85 minutes and without any filler, it is quite thrilling. For my money, it is easily Kubrick's best film.Kubrick's use of a non-linear narrative structure is experimental, and possibly the first time it appears in cinema. The film's structure and the narrator are linked. The consensus is that when a preview audience reacted unfavorably to the non-linear narrative, United Artist executives wanted Kubrick to change the script. Kubrick resisted. The studio then introduced the narrator. The narrator, clearly law enforcement, removes any confusion over when a particular scene is occurring. However, my view is there is too much reassurance with having law enforcement providing context. While every character who appears in the film is corrupted, the narrator is incorruptible. Hindsight is easy, but if the narrator had been Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) instead, "The Killing" would have been even better.The narrator notwithstanding, every cast member and character is very memorable. Each actor really seems to be living the desperation that engulfs their character. The principal figure is Johnny Clay, the ring-leader of a gang trying to rob a racetrack. Sterling Hayden's imposing physical stature and hard-boiled delivery make him a very convincing and compelling hoodlum. (In real life, Sterling routinely disparaged both his vocation and his skill. He was his own worst critic.) Timothy Carey, a popular character actor to film buffs, is an Army-trained sniper with clenched teeth who agrees to shoot a racehorse. Jay C. Flippen (as Marvin Unger) is very effective as the possibly homosexual gang member funding the caper out of love for Johnny. Kola Kwariani is the chess-playing thug, who cannot be arrested by less than five police officers. While Coleen Gray has received mixed reviews as Clay's wife Fay, I think she is good. Yet, two other cast members steal the show.The one-sided relationship between Sherry Peatty (Marie Windsor) and her cuckolded husband George (Elisha Cook Jr.), a race track cashier, is very rich and central to the plot. Seldom has a wife so thoroughly emasculated her spouse in the eyes of an audience. She looks down at him in multiple ways. (Windsor was 5'9", and Cook was 5'5".) She cheats on him. She manipulates him. She plots to have her lover (Vince Edwards as Val Cannon) steal the recovered loot from Johnny's gang. Marie Windsor's Sherry is a uniquely alluring and treacherous femme fatale. Meanwhile, Elisha Cook deserves a lot of credit for his brave portrayal of hapless George Peatty. It takes courage to play a role that invites unsophisticated viewers to believe you are a similar loser in real life.There are two scenes with animals that might be regarded today as cruel. The first is when a galloping racehorse is brought down by a jockey. (This stunt appears to have been done safely, but I know little about horses.) The other is when a parakeet is apparently in a cage that falls to the ground. Maybe they took the parakeet out of the cage for this shot. Still, 1956 audiences had a completely different perspective of how animals should be treated in films than many people share today.It is fun to find flaws even with great films. Other reviewers have pointed out that killing a prized horse during a race is not particularly beneficial to the gang. Also, at the conclusion we have fewer gunshots than fresh corpses. And, if an airline won't allow a large suitcase on a plane, why is taking a train not an option? I would add that a race track that keeps an unlocked locker room for employees directly opposite the room where millions is being held is inviting trouble.George Peatty married out of his league. Film noir fans can guess know how his marriage will turn out. Cinephiles are encouraged to head over to the revival theater playing this to absorb a classic heist movie that bends time. Just keep your stolen loot secure getting there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's pretty bewildering to think that the director of 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining made this. I don't think it's very noticeably Kubrick here, although some might disagree. I don't think it's all that amazing either, but it doesn't matter, it's a lot of fun knowing that Kubrick was behind this one. It's all very entertaining, with richly drawn supporting characters. The moral of the story is pretty easy to figure out, and not all that complex, but there's something so beautiful in its rejection of pretentiousness that many detect in Kubrick's films. Overall, this is very much a worthy entry in his filmography, very much recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For being classified as a B rated film when it was released, I found The Killing to be a lot more compelling and a more thorough then many movies from this time period. The most significant aspect of the movie is its organization as non-linear. Before there was a chronological order in most movies but in The Killing different point of views, events, and crucial plot points are out of order. However by the conclusion of the movie we are aware of what has happened to ever character. This is how the movie is thorough, in a sense it leaves no stone unturned. In a lot of crime movies, including film noirs, there is often some supporting characters who we are unaware of what happens to. The Killing is significant (at least to me) because although the story might be slightly unrealistic there is a sense of realism brought to it because we are aware of how each characters involvement in the robbery pans out. Aside from that the key significance is the non-linear approach to the screen duration. This was even perhaps a model for later crime dramas such as Pulp Fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie like no other I have seen. The style of this movie is very unique. The features I found interesting was the voice over that narrates the movie to keep us on track because the other interesting feature is the sequence of events. The movie is shot pretty choppy, jumping around to different characters that are all connected with the plan in some way. The movie is almost like a puzzle, and as we move forward it slowly pieces itself together and you feel as if you are beginning to figure it out yourself. In the beginning it may seem a little confusing and hard to see where it could be going but I do think that the narration helps to follow along. Although it may be a little bit of an over kill at times. The characters of this movie are very strong and all very different which I always liked because it gives the movie some character itself. My favorite scene of this movie is the ending scene at the airport. After all that happened and everything that everyone goes through is all taken away because of a little dog. The scene's tone is very tense and we feel it by the different shot used, we have lots of close ups of our two characters faces and really showing their emotions. The lighting is also a low key lighting so there is lots of shadows which only had to the darkness and intensity of the scene. At first I wasn't thrilled with this movie but after the first 30 minutes the plot started to thickened and the storyline began to really fall in place, so I just suggest to stick it out and give this movie a chance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a good setting old time movie that takes you back to a different time. That doesn't matter though because you could simply relate this many modern films of today.The Killing is not any simple plot, because once you start watching you think you know what will happen very quick but then more starts to happen.Taking all views of a planned robbery that should have been simple adds more of twist when you learn what each person in the robbery is doing and for how much. Learning the past of the mastermind behind the robbery-Johnny you learn he wants revenge for being kept in jail, but is it enough for him and his friends who helped or did he make some mistake in the middle.The movie itself holds a dark look and a similar atmosphere with dark lighting and using a lot of shadows in the movie keep it perfectly set for a robbery. Not only this but sets up the film for any consequences after the robbery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing (1956)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest; I was never really a fan of crime thrillers. To me they're all very much the same basic plot, told in the same predictable way, with the same predictable out come. Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing" however, was the exception to my disliking-of-crime-thrillers rule. With a unique and interesting perspective on the physical making of the movie, the film had just enough of a twist to keep me interested.Revolving around a group of individuals who decide to rob a racetrack, the story focuses on the the planning and the aftermath of the events. The unique twist, mentioned above, is a major contributor to the film's making. The film's story is told without the use of any formal sequence and often in a repetitious manner, often going back to the same event multiple times and retelling its relation to the rest of the plot. Coupled with a booming narrative, the film is displayed in very much a checklist type of way.While the film is in many ways, very repetitious and sometimes somewhat boring,"The Killing's" unique editing helps set it apart from all other crime thrillers of the era. Going on to influence filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, "The Killing" has a quality about it that no one had ever witnessed before. Although the fate of the criminals was less than what they had hoped for, the success of the film emphasized that innovative techniques can in many ways change the way people perceive films and what that can do to inspire generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing (1956) Deserving of Praise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT The Killing (1956) by director Stanley Kubrick is an excellent film about crime and chasing monetary gain. The film is about a group of men who try to make a 'killing' off of the race track betting. They have a plan to rob the race track, by shooting a prized race horse during a race to add confusion. This film has an excellent plot line that keeps you enthralled, and great fleshing out of its characters. The main character of Johnny Clay is a cool and collected criminal who seems to have everything in control, but you'll see by the end this isn't the case. The film ends with all of Johnny's accomplices getting killed, and Johnny presumably getting arrested at the airport by the feds. The film is basically conveying to us that crime doesn't pay, but the movie is so enticing, because of how it shows us this. It doesn't do this in a cliché way, which is key. The final scene is great as it is ambiguous. Johnny presumably was arrested, or was he ? You the viewer are left thinking after the movie ends, which is always a good thing. Overall, The Killing (1956) is a great film deserving of its praise. I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film immediately has the sort of aura that Kubrick evokes in all of his films. There's a sinister edge to everything that goes on. Each character is clearly defined by a trope and in the case of this film it is a very effective method of film making. This film could also stand the test of time and a possible remake, but I would not wish that kind of risk on a great film like this. You find yourself rooting for the characters who are the bad guys, in reality, but you don't care. You want them to be okay in the end. Kubrick refuses to give the viewer that satisfaction. It's a sort of tantalizing film that leaves you wanting more in the end.</fullReview>

I think it was one of the most genius and entertaining crime movies from this time period I've ever watched. The way that it was set up was a little hard to keep up with, but was interesting and grabbed your attention off the bat. All the characters fit their role very well and displayed real life emotions. The way the characters revolved around money shows their true emotions in the film. It also displays how unfortunate events that take place for this reason can be. Kubrick's a phenomenal director.</fullReview>

I was absolutely intrigued to see how everything linked together and wasn't disappointed with the ending.That being said, I never found myself drawn to any of the characters. This was a pure plot film, and that is not really to my taste. To feel like there are stakes in what is happening, I have to be interested in the people I am watching, and that didn't translate for me here. The one scene where I really found myself engrossed in the back and forth between characters was the scene with the sniper and the car lot attendant. I also really liked the way they touched on social issues in that moment.A good film, especially for being who like suspense and plots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is actually a good movie. I realized that this was in black-and-white, like "Psycho". Sadly, I don't understand a lot of this movie, because it keeps going back and forth from one scene to another. Also, the movie keeps repeating one scene while one narrator tells the story. The narration is another thing that I like but don't understand most of the time. I wouldn't have known the story of the movie if there was no narration to help me out a bit. Unfortunately, the worst thing about this film is the ending. I really don't like how the film was so dark. But the movie overall isn't really bad. It has inspired other studios to make more movies that relate to this. For this one, I don't think I would want to watch it again, because I am not a big crime type of guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first when I started watching this, I didn't think it was very "Stanley Kubrick-y" I haven't seen all his films, but the man definitely has a certain style. But, after a little while it became relatively obvious that it's one of his. He has this way of making normal things feel slightly off, to the point of making them unsettling. It's very hard to pinpoint exactly how. He also has a certain pace to many of his films, The Killing included. They feel like they take their time to unfold the story (even though it's a relatively short amount of time) but are never slow enough to be boring. I really love the plot structure, and didn't find it confusing at all. (this film is VERY like Ocean's 11) The viewer is told just enough to keep them in suspense the whole time. All building, it seems, to the robbery. Yet, the best climactic part was definitely when the suitcase burst on the runway. The pace in this felt similar to The Shining, and the fragmented plot and voice overs also reminded me of it. The way the date stamps are used felt like they had a similar effect to voice overs. There's nothing I can really say about the photography, other than pointing out that every shot is beautiful. I'm used to seeing Kubrick in color, but the composition of the shots always feels similar to me throughout all the films I've seen of his. Lucien Ballard is DP for this, and I think he did a stunning job. Favorite photographic moment: when George comes home after being shot? the light is just amazing here, as is the acting. I love the repetitious shots throughout, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although released the same year (1956) as flatulent would-be epics such as GIANT and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, this movie has the verve and energy to be expected of a new generation of film-makers.Was it Kubrick, I wonder, who thought of hiring Jim Thompson to write the dialogue? Whoever had the idea, it's what raises THE KILLING to join the greats of film noir. And no one spits out the script's barbs better than Marie Windsor: her definitive conniving hard-boiled moll is the story's cold heart.Superbly photographed by Lucien Ballard, already a veteran by this time (he was von Sternberg's Hollywood DOP in the 30s), many camera moves are clearly indebted to one of Kubrick's idols, Max Ophuls - those horizontal tracking shots following characters as they pass from room to room, giving a strange feeling of prying, prowling, eavesdropping.The voice-over narration feels a little quaint now, Gerald Fried's score is perhaps over-present, and a couple of the performances might have been improved upon by a few more takes. But these are quibbles. It's not quite RIFIFI, but almost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the difference?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick considered this to be his first mature feature, after a couple of short warm-ups. It's tempting to search here for themes and a style he would return to in his later masterpieces, but few directors seemed so determined to make every one of his films an individual, free- standing work.That being said, This is a heist movie. The durable form inspires directors to create plots that are baffling in their complexity or bold in their simplicity. Kubrick's plan here for a race track robbery involves two of those plot aspects; not so much the acrobatics. His narrative approach seems blunt, but the narrative itself is so labyrinthine we abandon any hope of trying to piece it together and just abandon ourselves to letting it happen.Perhaps a motif can be found in the movie's storefront chess club which, I learn, Kubrick frequented as a kid. The game of chess involves holding in your mind several alternate possibilities. The shifting of one piece can result in a radically different game. Johnny Clay has devised a strategy seemingly as flawless; but it depends on all the players making the required moves on schedule. If a piece shifts, everything changes, a possibility Johnny should have given more thought to. The plot jumps around like a chess player's mind.Kubrick brings all types of characters on screen, and makes it clear who they are and sees that we will remember them, while only gradually revealing their roles in the heist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Slick And Stylish Crime Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Stanley Kubrick's work and I have watched all but 2 of his films, Dr. Strangelove and Fear and Desire. The Killing is one of those movies that is definitely heels above it's competitors of that era and some that follows it. It's definitely a classic and herald by some as their personal favorite from Kubrick, I for one see it as one of his good efforts and just can't quite get up there with his films like A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey.The Killing was written by Kubrick and Jim Thompson, and was based on the novel "Clean Break" by Lionel White. I am not sure how much Thompson has contributed in the writing of the film, maybe a handful as he does get given the title of "screenplay by" in Paths of Glory. The Killing has a plot that has definitely been covered somewhat on films before this but it isn't the writing of this film that stands out but rather the style that Kubrick employs in telling the story. The Killing's characters for the most part are interesting enough that they don't become boring or lacking in personality. I did enjoy the work that these man had to go through for the plan to follow through, so cheers to Kubrick and Thompson for that. The aspect that truly brings this film down is the narration that drives the film. Sometimes I don't mind narration but here it just lacks that insightful depth in telling the story that it doesn't really say much other than the facts. It would have been nice for a little subjective view of the characters involved in the robbery or at least a voice over or two from some of the characters in particular moments.Stanley Kubrick's vision for this film is quite ambitious as a style like this can keep the film from moving forward and having certain areas repeat itself and become tiresome. I admired his choice of telling the story and it has definitely inspired filmmakers in the future to embrace this narrative style. It felt like Kubrick was a little restricted when making this film as it just doesn't to seem to have that edge that his post-Paths of Glory films do. The film overall does feel a little safe but given the story that this film has it cannot really be as imaginative as his other films endure.Lucien Ballard was responsible for the film's photography. I have yet seen another film that Ballard has worked on but I am curious on how he handles the Western films from the 60's. The film's photography is definitely well thought out and Kubrick and Ballard definitely knows what shots they want. The camera pans and moves from time to time but done so in a way that feels slick, which supports the style that Kubrick was going for. Before coming into this I was hoping that the film will have a much more darker and murkier photography to enhance a certain style that would fit in with the story. The style that Ballard uses is still fine though, I just felt it could have been more.Gerald Fried worked with all of Kubrick's pre-Spartacus films and though his score is not as remembered or praised like Kubrick's later films, he does give his best for the films he works on. Fried's score for The Killing is not something I will remember in the long run but at the time of watching, I did get sucked in to what was happening and his score does add on to the tension and suspense that the film demanded. There are parts where it does get a little too much but not to the point where it becomes bothersome.The Killing has a few characters it showcases and each one has their own moments especially in the first 30 minutes of the film but none can outdo Sterling Hayden's performance. Hayden brings this tough but yet prepared and logical character to life. When Hayden gets his speeches, it sounds very cool and slick. The rest of the cast on the other hand were decent and only one or two that felt a little bit too over the top, I'm looking at you Marie Windsor.The Killing is definitely an interesting approach in telling a crime story, though used quite abundantly now, and it has a terrific performance from Sterling Hayden. Personally it's not in the higher rankings when compared to Kubrick's other films but it definitely isn't bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, Taut Pulp Caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch "The Killing" to witness the brilliance at birth of director Stanley Kubrick, you might walk away disappointed. But if you watch it as another pulp suspense yarn from an era when Hollywood churned them out with blinding speed, you will come away impressed.After a long stretch in prison, Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a man with a plan. He and four associates plan to rob a racetrack in the middle of its biggest race. Unfortunately for all of them, one of the associates has a big mouth and a bad wife...There are three key reasons "The Killing" stands out. One is that it the first film Kubrick made on something more than a shoestring budget. Two is the unusual non-chronological way the film unfolds, showing us individual episodes from the caper out of sequence (though unlike say "Momento" they are presented logically as pieces of a larger puzzle.) Three is the terrific star performance by Hayden.Kubrick's negatives as a filmmaker are also in evidence in early form, like some painfully robotic line readings by Elisha Cook, Jr. and Marie Windsor and a heavy emphasis on process. Still, "The Killing" is a good story its director and co-writer Kubrick tells very well. You care about these characters, in a way that didn't always happen in Kubrick films.The biggest weakness of "The Killing" is the narration, a clumsy device that wasn't Kubrick's idea but which he could have done more to mitigate. It seems every time there's a scene change, the narrator from the old "Batman" TV series is there to tell you the time and not much else in an obtrusive, clunky way: "At seven p. m. that same day, Johnny Clay, perhaps the most important thread in the unfinished fabric, furthered its design..." It really gets obnoxious.Other tinny lines could be obnoxious, except one makes allowances for a capable genre flick, especially one with a good star. When Johnny tells Windsor's Sherry character: "You got a great big dollar sign there where most women have a heart," you not only let it pass but enjoy it for the hard-bitten, sure-handed way Hayden delivers the line.What's especially great about "The Killing" is how well it builds and sustains momentum over its 84-minute run time. The film also feels very lived-in, with bits of reality constantly creeping into the corners of the frame, like the junky motel where Johnny stashes his heist equipment or the rinky-dink apartments where the various characters live. The robbery itself is lit in an almost sickly way that emphasizes the cheap florescent lighting and sweaty concrete walls.There are also unusually edgy aspects to the movie for its time. One of the accomplices, Marvin (Jay C. Flippen) exhibits what might be a homosexual attraction for Johnny, though if so it's subtly presented. There's nothing subtle about a moment of racism in a parking lot, which obviously is meant to leave as much of a scar on the viewer as it does on the conspiracy. Kubrick's ability as a director to work you over in the process of delivering a good story is in strong evidence here and throughout.Watching "The Killing" is not to witness the creation of a genius, however, but more his development toward same, which arrived with his next film, "Paths Of Glory." That's for the ages. This is more for genre fans, but it's a terrific film for them and worthy entertainment for everyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing directed by Stanley Kubrick was a fantastic film, it kept me interested throughout the whole film wondering what was going to happen next. I actually personally loved the non-linear narrative, it gave the movie just what it needed and worked perfectly with the storyline. The use of harsh darks and lights set the tone for the movie, great film noir. For some reason throughout the movie I was rooting for the bad people to succeed at their plan. Of course I did not expect the ending to happen like it did, but that's the beauty of it. I love not knowing what is going to happen while watching a movie, and Kubrick knew just what to do to make that happen. Another aspect in this movie I liked was at some points in the movie you had to assume something that happened because the screen would go black the reappear showing that something did happen but it wasn't shown. Overall great movie, many aspects made it as great as it came out to be.</fullReview>

As if this movie was a reference to the series. But it definitely is not. This film was a genius film, the way the plot was set up. If this movie were to be referenced to any modern-day movie that today's youth would have seen, it'd definitely be The Town (Starring Ben Affleck). Even though this movie was in black and white, it brought vivid colors and understanding to the audience how everything was to be done. The whole mise-en-scene was brilliant and captivating. I'd definitely watch this film over and over again without getting sick and tired of it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the ultimate story. It has a little of everything, violence, drama, love, sex, greed, and ultimately justice. I enjoyed the style of the story, how it was primarily parallel editing that told the story. Also, I enjoyed the narration of the plot, it made it more like a story and easier to follow along with. Had great acting as well. The camera gave us several different angles to look from, which makes it that much better because it adds some dimension to the movie. This movie is a good example of how cheaters never win. The guys get to their goal and are all satisfied but fate just does them in the end. Which is unfortunate because throughout the movie you feel like the characters are good nice guys and you want them to meet their goal but that just wouldn't be right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing: an overview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of his earlier films, Stanley Kubrick is not best known for The Killing (1956) but that does not mean that it's not one of his greatest. Cast with some of the best actors of that time, this film noir is one that just keeps getting better with age. Focusing on Sterling Hayden as Johnny Clay, a gang leader who has just been released from Alcatraz who has decided that from now on if he's going to commit crimes, goal better be worth the possible punishment, and comes up with a mastermind plan to steal $2,000,000 from a racetrack, thinking that "no one will get hurt." However, the flaw in the plan that he does not see coming is one of his accomplices's greedy wife telling her boyfriend. All goes according to plan until the boyfriend holds them up after a successful robbery. With a surprise around every corner, it's definitely a movie for a night when you're looking for a laugh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly enjoyable heist film from Stanley Kubrick. Watching this film makes you wish Kubrick did more movies like this, or maybe collaborated with Quentin Tarantino. Kubrick tells the story using parallel editing, which gives you a more broad perspective of what's going on. The film is about a heist on a racetrack. You can see elements used in this film in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1993), and Pulp Fiction (1994). Many characters are involved in the heist and of course something goes wrong. This movie is very well made and is unique in its delivery. The type of film that influences future films of the genre.</fullReview>

Everyone I watched with was laughing or chuckling tongue-in-cheek through much of it, though the end has brutal consequences and redefines to what the title could be referring. The femme fatale was very harsh to her husband, and there is some great symbolism throughout. The parking attendant got to take out the guy who insulted him with a racial slur, and those who couldn't keep their mouth shut were taken out in a room with a squawking parrot. So clever!

		<fullReview>Watching this movie after watching The Shining, also directed by Kubrick, I was very surprised. The style of this movie is vastly different from The Shining but in a good way. I really enjoyed this movie because it was so unpredictable and surprising. Although at times I was confused I really loved the way that the story was told out of order. It was much more interesting to see certain bits and pieces and have to kind of put everything together in your mind. I really loved the entire ending. I don't know why but for some reason I was really upset for the main character at the end, even though he was technically the bad guy. I actually wanted his plan to work and as that money flew around the airport I really felt bad for him. I think the reason that I felt that way was because Sterling Hayden's performance was so genuine. You could literally see all hope drain from him in the very last two scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film with a really pretty amazing story. Its a complicated plot, with a rather intricate plan that falls together pretty well. Being a noir film though the bad guys cannot win (and lets be honest our protagonists are the bad guys, and there must be a balance to this brilliantly planned heist. Kubrik does not let the viewer down, and though the ending is in some ways a bit of a let down, it is the best way the film could have ended. Giving the story from multiple angles is great, giving us the little piece of the puzzle that each member had and then letting the viewer assemble them. The photography is beautiful and every shot captures exactly what Kubrik wants you to see, nothing more. Overall excellent film, I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good crime movie, particularly one from the robber's perspective which I think is more fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fantastic crime film from Stanley Kubrick. Not only we have memorable characters here, but also a very inventive way of storytelling and a brilliant ending. I can totally see how this influenced Quentin Tarantino on making Reservoir Dogs and notice quite a few similarities between the two. I really liked how Kubrick constantly goes back and forth in time, in order to demonstrate each character's assignment and how everything must happen with precise and flawless execution. You really feel how important and crucial they are for the heist to go according to plan. Another great aspect of the film is that the director takes his time to show everyone's motivations behind the robbery, building a nice character development for them. My favorites of the bunch would have to be Maurice Oboukhoff and Johnny Clay. The first one is a professional wrestler who is both cerebral and humorous, having a mesmerizing fight scene, which is just raw and awesome. The latter is the mastermind crook behind the whole scheme, who meticulously plans the robbery and is always charismatic, cautious and intimidating. Finally, without spoiling anything, the final scene really made an impact on me because it contradicts with everything Clay's character is. The Killing is one of Kubrick's early efforts and a splendid crime film. A must-see for everyone who appreciates the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing that I found most hilarious about this movie is that they went through all the trouble to stage a huge robbery and even had it planned out beautifully but in the end the last two end up with nothing and being arrested. Overall their plan was good and the robbery was successful however George Peatty made the mistake of telling his wife, Sherry, about the robbery because ultimately her telling her lover, Val Cannon, is what ultimately caused the failure of anyone from receiving any money. I seemed like a never ending shootout and in the end when it was Johnny and Fay struggling to get away with the money they still end up losing it all when the suitcase hits the ground and they are discovered. Overall the picture quality was very good and clear and the camera work was good as well. The dark scenes in the movie added to the much intended drama of non-stop killing all for greed of money and wealth. The lighting was very good in the way it hit the actors and actresses faces also. Overall I enjoyed this film for its quality and cinematography but I didn't enjoy the cliché plot of the film in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A decent film that is weakened by its obnoxious cast Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing" is a thrilling crime story with a great plot. The whole movie has so much potential, I really did enjoy the story, the camera work, and all the sets but Coleen Gray and Sterling Hayden made me want to stick my face in a blender. The final scene at the airport is an instant classic after viewing and makes everything worth watching. I feel as if Kubrick had made this movie with a larger budget it could have been even greater than it is with some different actors and no Coleen Gray. Great symbolism hidden within the scene where Johnny returns from the shootout. Kola Kivariani's appearance is good and I think it was hilarious when they have him distracting the cops. Many people complain about the narrator but I feel as if he is a necessary addition since the thickness of the plot line gets a bit confusing when jumping between scenes. Wonderful work done by Kubrick makes this a masterpiece even though some roles would be better off with different people playing them.</fullReview>

It's pretty amazing to me that someone was able to think up and write out that whole scenario. I'm one to suffer from anxiety, which this film actually bought upon me afterward. So perhaps it was a little too exciting, ha ha. It would be worth watching again to understand more of the beginning. I knew it was going to be confusing, since I know nothing about horse racing or how betting on it works at all. The acting and settings were pretty believable, minus the bar fight scene.

I found myself rooting for these men to successfully pull off their endeavor; but naturally, their efforts were fruitless. Everyone involved in the plan dies in the end, but so is the Noir style.

		<shortDescription>An early Kubrick gem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Killing" has been described as the film that put up and comer Stanley Kubrick on the map, and rightfully so. It's a perfect example of how to make a tense and compelling crime picture that often hinges on its dialogue, and it really comes to life for its exciting finish. One can easily see where someone like Quentin Tarantino would be influenced by its structure, as it follows a not quite linear storyline.While screenplay credit goes to Kubrick (based on the novel "Clean Break" by Lionel White), what really helps to make the movie soar is the hard boiled dialogue courtesy of author Jim Thompson ("The Getaway", "The Grifters"). The top notch, stark cinematography is the work of Lucien Ballard, and the pacing does have an incredible forward momentum. The action is further enhanced by the striking music score by Gerald Fried.A wonderfully low key Sterling Hayden is Johnny Clay, the ringleader behind a daring plot to hold up a racetrack. Among his co-conspirators are Marvin Unger (Jay C. Flippen), a cop named Randy Kennan (Ted de Corsia), Mike O'Reilly (Joe Sawyer), and nerdy racetrack employee George Peatty (Elisha Cook Jr.). All of them are in very fine form, and supported by an eclectic mix of performers including Coleen Gray as Johnny's girl Fay, Marie Windsor (she and Cook Jr. are brilliantly mismatched as a highly unlikely married couple), Vince Edwards as Windsors' lover, legendary eccentric Timothy Carey as creepy sniper for hire Nikki Arano, wrestler Kola Kwariani as businessman Maurice, James Edwards a a parking lot attendant, and Kubrick favourite Joe Turkel as Tiny. Most fascinating are the scenes with Windsor and Cook Jr.; one has to wonder how these two wound up together.The final half hour as the job is pulled off and unforeseen developments arise is some truly great stuff. It's just full of tension, and jerks the viewers' emotions around with ease.This viewer would agree that this classic black &amp; white picture deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as other Kubrick favourites like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange". It's highly recommended to any fan of film noir.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Killing" is proof that not all low-budget films are awful. Stanley Kubrick made a B-movie that dips into the cinematographic lighting and plot of a film noir, but that also isn't afraid to go beyond that and give it inspiring camera work and editing. The characters hold up well, mostly due to the fact that their reasons for wanting to rob the race track are different from one another in terms of how each reason affects its character and how that reason affects the robbery as well. The plot was one of my favorite aspects of the film. It moved at the right pace and in the right direction to build tension and deliver thoroughly. The ending was one that I didn't expect coming, and when it finally did happen, I was blown away.</fullReview>

The replaying of the same horse racing scene was very annoying and too repetitive for me. I know that it was to serve the purpose of importance, but in my opinion it was just "getting old." I also thought that the plot was not as good as it should've been, for it bored me and I kept wondering when it would be over. But, the one element I loved from the film was the snappiness of Sherry Peatty's character. She was a very outspoken, sneaky girl with many sassy comebacks and a big attitude. I think her character was the one who filled up the screen and actually made the movie a little better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir with a twist..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin? This, master director Stanley Kubricks first ever major motion production, is a good piece of cinema. About this, there is no doubt. Every aspect from the well-timed editing, to the exceptional use of contrasting lights and shadows to reveal characters intentions and nuances, as well as the general plot ( written by Kubrick) make for an outstanding film. The first major point that must be discussed is the amount of money, or in all actuality, lack there of, that this movie was made with. This movie, with all its different moving parts, parallel editing, and interweaving plot and story lines was made for only $320,000. This was a paltry sum for a major Hollywood production, even during that time. The reason it seemed so pertinent to me to discuss money is the fact that first and foremost, Hollywood is a town built on money, or more appropriately, one hand washing the other. This is interesting if you think about it in terms of the context of this film, as in the film, "washing hands" is exactly what keeps the overall cohesion of the gang. More to the point, nobody does anything for free, everyone has their own angle. Essentially I mean to say this: The fact that Kubrick et al... were able to make such a sensational film while adhering to such a stringent budget is nothing short of awe-inspiring. So on to the actual aspects of the film. As I stated earlier, the editing in this film is phenomenal; nothing short of such top notch editing could have kept the story and plot of this very complex film so well woven together so as to keep the viewers interest. Also in regards to editing, the overall flow of the film is very smooth, save for the omniscient, yet extremely ill-placed voice of the narrator. On to my next point, lighting. The use of lighting to both reveal and shadow, not only in the way that any commonplace light could do, but rather to such extent that even the most casual viewer can be effectively made to feel what the character on screen is feeling or going through, is excellent. A particularly memorable scene is close to the finale of the film when Greg, having been wounded in the attempted hold-up, shows up at home to find Sherry packing. The use of various lighting makes that already ominous scene all the darker. The last thing I wanna touch in the verisimilitude- or overall believability- of the film. While this clearly a far flung idea, it is not outside the realm of possibility for those with the time or the talent. That is what I truly enjoyed about the film. I, clearly not a criminal, am not saying this to inspire others to become so, I am merely stating that the plot flows so smooth that the viewer can become fully immersed in this world, and begin to ponder the what-if's namely, " I wonder if that is really possible?" That is what I mean in regards to the films overall believability aspect. So I said all that to say this, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and furthermore, I would and do recommend it to anyone who is a fan of caper or heist films, as well the more contemporary Quentin Tarantino.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could a brand newly born genius do in 1956 at the end of the famous maccarthyism that had bled Hollywood like a slaughterer bleeds a cow in a slaughter house? He decided, maybe not by himself and alone, to produce a thriller, in black and white please. The subject is a holdup at some race tracks and it is organized and shown in its minutiae and even more than minutiae.We just wonder what the interest of that perfect schedule can be, but we are fascinated by the perfect direction of actors and actresses all along with their frontal aggressiveness and violence. That is perfect and yet so perfect that we are more or less thinking something must be wrong in that schedule and scheduling of criminal events.And sure enough it all goes wrong in the last fifteen minutes or nearly and the lesson is that if you are a small accomplice in a crime you better not tell anything to your wife, especially if she is burning with frustration because you did not deliver the riches and the fame you had promised.Don't think it is because women cannot hold their tongues, and the plural is necessary in such a perspective, but they have their own agenda and they may decide to play their own flush or joker and get the whole profit for themselves.And what would happen in this criminal world if women started having their own interests and the intelligence to play their own game? Well it would not be any better because in a team they all die when one, even a side kick, plays it alone and against everyone else.Don't believe you can go unharmed and unpunished if you call a black man a n*** to get rid of him. The n-word will have the last word and will be the last word you ever utter in this world. Welcome to the other side of the moon and the other face of the devil.Especially if there is a small barking Pekinese on the runway. Such a little non-entity of a dog may cause a jumbo jet or a Concorde to crash or a fast train to derail.And that is exactly what happens and that is funny.A good beginning and promising young Stanley, but you still have a lot of work to do and distance to run, young man.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing (1956) employs cinematography well ahead of its time, and a sometimes non-linear storyline that higher-ups in Hollywood believed would "confuse" the audiences of the day. It is because of this that an insipid and utterly detracting narration was added, without which the movie would be a truly excellent piece. The development and fleshing out of the more prominent characters is wholly enjoyable, and while in many cases they are not exactly likable- they are believable. Kubrick also employs an element of suspense as he lays out the story, making it almost impossible to look away. But perhaps what is most enjoyable about the film is seeing how markedly different the cinematographic style is, from movies of the time mixed with the storyline that jumps back and forth weaving an intricate web between the principal actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome Movie. Stanley Kubrick's film Noir "The Killing" is an excellent movie. It's very dark and very moody. Low lighting, lot's of shadows and the way Kubrick directs the actors is very cold and strange. Kubrick is known for directing his actors in a very unrelating way. The characters were very dark and eerie, it was interesting to see how well they worked with the darkness of the film. It almost reminded me of Oceans 11 or The Italian Job, a group of guys work together to knock over a gambling bar and track, but it wasn't funny it was very moody and cold. One other thing that was cool was the narrator. Lot's of people don't like it but I thought it was cool, because it was so unique. A narrator kept the story on track, telling a non diegetic narration in like every CUT to a new scene, pretty cool. I was also very surprised by the end of the movie, didn't expect what happened. This movie also had some really cool camera techniques, lots of dolly shots and smooth artistic pans and tilts. Very smooth and not forced. Great stability and equal composition. Also Kubrick and the DP had some very unconventional type shots during intense scenes. Very unequal and compositionally stressed, made us as the audience feel very uneasy at times, it worked so well. Kubrick is known for that, an innovator with camera flexibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for History of Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being considered a B-list movie i have to say this was great. I have always loved heist movies, it's always fun to root for the bad guys. It reminded me a lot of "Oceans 11" which I'm sure was actually inspired in part by this film. Not much time is spent developing any of the characters, which i think made it pretty much emotionless. That is not a bad thing necessarily. It got a bit confusing with all the jumping from one characters story to the next and moving forwards and backwards through time, but everything fell into place when the actual heist happens. One aspect that did get on my nerves however is that every time the race announcer would speak there was a shot of the megaphones to, i guess make it known that the voice was coming from the speakers. I know that some people might get confused between the narrator and the announcer, but i believe it's a fairly obvious distinction. One scene really reminded me of director Quentin Tarantino's style. The scene where all the heist members are waiting for Johnny Clay to bring the money and two men show up to steal it from them and everyone ends getting shot and killed except for George. I can really see how this movie has inspired many modern films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No main character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I believe made this film great was that there was really no main character to the plot. Everybody who starred in this film all strictly had one main role throughout this films entirety. I really liked how they filmed a movie from the mobs point of view rather than most films I have watched where the movie is told from the police officers point of view. To me, this movie didn't interest me at all until the day of the horse race. The beginning scenes just kind of dragged on longer than they should have, but the ending reflected on those boring scenes. Everyone in the mob had done their job as far as setting up the scandal and being in the right place when they needed to be. The ending was really random when all of the money fell out of the suitcase and blew away. I was not expecting that at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had me at the edge of my seat the entire time, i couldn't take my eyes off it. There wasn't really any boring part of the movie. I loved the action scenes and just the overall plot of the movie. If i had the chance i'd watch it over and over. I loved how when the guys were executing there robbery they would jump from one character to the next. There was also a scene When George was walking around the room with all of the dead men in it and the camera angle was in first person, i really liked that.Also the ending wasn't what i thought it would have been but i guess i never really knew what was going to happen the entire film and that's why i loved it. I really like the theme that the movie was hinting towards as well, that crime never pays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greed, low-life, tension, stimulation {Stanley Kubrick}</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the one hand, you have a 1956 film noir, {the essential period of this genre}, with all the expectations that the aforementioned statement implies, fully realized. However, because this was the "Meister" Stanley Kubrick's first commercial success, {he was 28 years old and this was his third feature}, one can't simply review this movie as a genre staple, {which is then either a good example or bad example or neither here nor there}, within the accepted hard-boiled conventions.One's expectations are always high, when sitting down and watching the title credits roll, for a Kubrick creation, {I know mine certainly are}. I expect more than a well told tale, cinematographically executed, in an awesome manner, with an interesting assemblage of cast, and camera angles, flashbacks, and period detail.Psychologically, we are presented with a group of lost souls, who have decided that life and its vicissitudes, demand that they align themselves with Mammon {or if you like the Devil}. Sterling Hayden {reprising his role from "The Asphalt Jungle 1950, perhaps}, is an interesting lead, as his charisma is introverted, whereas most lead actors beam out at the audience. The daring and complex heist plan, offering its conspirators ,the "Big Prize" of loads of money, is standard fare for most crime thrillers. Remember this is a Kubrick movie, so the ride is punctuated by sub plot elements, that give the proceedings an edgy frisson, that most movies do not have.Yes folks, these characters, that are the subjects of this tale are like Aesop, simply overwhelmed, by the expectation of a huge change in their material circumstances. To be blunt, they can't wait {especially as Kubrick masterfully ratchets up the pressure: debt, sordid dissatisfaction with the imprisonment of poverty, lack of choice, that the financial circumstances of these cinematic losers endure. They are teased to the point of despair by the "Messiah of Money" that will give them the relief that they dream constantly about. Kubrick brilliantly conveys a drooling anticipation of the "taste of money". Kubrick, makes it clear that they are doomed, by merely observing the twists, conflicts and struggles, that anyone in these characters position would plausibly endure. What unfolds is not, however, the usual predictable outcome, but a refreshing finale, {still so in the year 2011}, which leaves the viewer surprised and entertained. This movie is a clear indicator of why Kubrick progressed from this point to movies like Lolita {see my review}, Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut. If you are fascinated by the history of the "Cinema" and want to see all of Kubrick's oeuvre then this should definitely be joyfully experienced by you.PS. This movie also heralds the entry of Jim Thompson {the novelist} into the field of cinema. Kubrick hired him to do the screenplay but only gave him the dialogue credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picked this up on sale without knowing anything about it. Brilliant in every respect.This movie has a couple of clever devices: 1) The timeline of the scenes is mixed up so that eg. one scene stops and an earlier scene might begin next, sometimes ending up at (or overlapping slightly with) the scene you just saw; and 2) there is one significant scene of almost slapstick violence with multiple people killed by one shotgun blast.Where have we seen that before? Exactly, "Pulp Fiction". PF got much press for it's creative intermixing of time and scenes, as if it was invented by QT. Kubrick managed it in "The Killing" in 1956 - 50 years ago. Did QT credit him? Of course not.The difference is that this is a real movie with a tight storyline and an incredible pace. And clever characterization. PF is some witty and clever dialogue around sloppy and nasty violence. You always see QT working to trick you; Kubrick here just tells a crisp story. "The Killing" isn't a perfect movie (hence the 8/10 rating) but it's Hemingway clean and doesn't miss a beat. Acting is near flawless on all counts - special mention to Ted de Corsia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe because it was the plot, which I found myself being bored of. It's something I've seen a lot, a heist gone wrong, but what can you do? What I did like was the different scenes going on all at once, even if they weren't exactly in order. The editing in having them pieced together, to make the flow going was excellent. I just really wish I'd see something like that for a different plot. There's better movies with this type of editing, obviously. It's just kind of a shame, in my opinion. I'm not sure if you were really supposed to feel for the cast, although I was disappointed when the hit-man was taken out. Needless to say, it's not a bad movie. It's actually well done, but the plot isn't exactly my cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Kubrick effort; minimal character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing is a 1956 suspense film directed by Stanley Kubrick. While the story focus is on the six primary characters, this review will only look at two characters ? Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) and George Peatty (Elisha Cook Jr.). Johnny is an ex-con planning one major heist before retiring from his life of crime. Johnny assembles an eclectic gang to rob the money counting room of a racetrack during a major stakes race. The plan is to use several diversions to allow the team access to the money; planning by Johnny is precisely to the minute and each man knows his job and expected timing. Kubrick uses repetitive scenes of the horse track to focus attention on each individual gang member as the hour approaches for the heist. The film follows each character to the hour of the heist, and then starts anew from the morning with the next gang member. In order to avoid confusion by the audience, the film employs a 3rd person narrator throughout the movie to clarify the action. Johnny is a detail oriented man, always ready for the unexpected, but surprisingly makes a critical mistake in his planning. George is a mousy, brow-beaten husband with an unfaithful wife. During the course of the movie, George comes to realize that his share of the heist money will not change his marriage, or his life. In the end, George surprises the gang with his actions.The film is short at 83 minutes, staying focused on the heist itself. There is little character development, and we only have the opportunity to observe the characters within the storyline of a few days prior to the heist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Stanley Kubrick has directed many other great films (i.e. The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, etc.) this film was not the greatest. The plot throughout the movie was a little boring and it was hard to stay focused the entire time. The acting was good, and there were some funny parts, yet the movie as a whole was not that entertaining. There was one really amusing part at the end of the movie that was really memorable, but that was about it. The story in the movie was kind of a bland one, so paying attention was a bit of a struggle. Like previously stated, Kubrick is a great director who did a lot of great films, but this was not one of them.</fullReview>

When I first heard the title, I definitely didn't imagine this kind of movie, I pictured more of a horror movie but surprisingly I really enjoyed it still. The whole plot to pull off the perfect track robbery was really exceptional and well thought out and well planned. Each little detail of what could happen was thought of for the most part. There was a great mix of characters that came together for the need of one thing... money and they would of achieved getting rich if there wasn't a lack of trust and people interrupting their plan like the one guys wife who was just greedy and wanted her boy toy to steal the money from them which lead to a blood bath. Definitely a good robbery movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit it was a complicated story and honestly not one that I felt I needed to seriously follow. The entire film contained that classic Kubrick sense of detachment, that cold and calculating style which distances us considerably from the characters and pierces straight into the action instead, which he's known for in most of his films. The one character played by Elisha Cook Jr. was unique though, he had that John Cazale in Godfather part 2 look going on, that complex psycho loser lost and fiery eyed and reckless look. You felt sorry for him. You definitely see Kubrick's influence in other heist films and this might be the first one in that modern style that we're used to. The climax at the end at the airport was nicely executed. The film was quick though and if you didn't pay attention you could miss something important, it's worth another watch . Everything about it had a sense of senseless urgency and I liked how that came out as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'll take care of myself, that's my specialty."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm intrigued by the movie's double entendre title - "The Killing" relates to both the shooting of the racehorse Red Lightning, and the idea that the heist masterminded by Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) would result in a proverbial 'killing'. That two million dollar payday isn't chump change even today, but a half century ago would have been more than a king's ransom.This is certainly one of those stories where the best laid plans of mice and men can get instantly sidetracked by unintended consequences. I'm in full agreement with other reviewers who fault Johnny for settling on a flimsy suitcase for the getaway, as it presaged the ending just a little too clumsily. It would have been more believable if the suitcase took a hard bump to the pavement and then discarded it's contents to the four winds. In that regard, I found the ending just as ironic as the one in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre", the difference being that hoodlum Johnny got to experience his loss after all that meticulous planning.Supporting Hayden are some terrific actors with folks like Elisha Cook, Jay C. Flippen, Marie Windsor and Joe Sawyer just perfectly cast for their characters. The pairing of Cook and Windsor seemed totally bizarre to me, but as the story progressed it became more believable that they would have wound up married to each other. Sherry was always looking for a quick money fix and George was just one step away from a really big score. But I have to admit, the one time they wound up in a passionate embrace, it just totally creeped me out.As for the picture's non-linear style, I'm a fan of this type of story telling, but would have found it more effective if the voice-over narrative was kept minimal or dispensed with altogether. I understand it was done with the studio's insistence, but sometimes I think you have to give the viewer credit for knowing what's going on. As an early forerunner of this this type of structure, I can see how Tarantino would have been greatly influenced by director Kubrick. Personally, I think the style makes for a more interesting story, enough so that I'll be watching "The Killing" a few more times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was good, it actually surprised me at times. I think the technical elements used in this movie helped make it into a much better movie. The elements seem to be very thought out and intense at times. Especially in the lighting, where low lighting was used, showing a lot of shadows. There was a great range of light used and when intense lighting was used it added to the mystery of the movie.In a couple of the scenes they have the background blacked out, with a white lamp shade and a gray toned face, showing this great range in one shot. The interesting perspectives and angles that are being used help you feel this mysterious feeling about the characters and scenes. When the man is walking the screen is almost black, leaving you wondering what is ahead of him. The different locations used for this movie make the movie seem more realistic, for example the different apartments and bedrooms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing is the classic heist movie. I really enjoy a good heist film and this one was defiantly one of them. There is a group of people who are planning on stealing a large amount of money from the race tack. Each person needs the money for one reason or the other. Like most heist films most of the movie is about how the group prepares to pull of the job. When it comes to the execution of the plan, it is done with very little flaw. Once the money was stolen, most of the crew were waiting for it to arrive when they were found out by two thugs. Every one died but two people, one ended up dieing later after he killed his cheating wife. The other, when he made his attempt to flee the suitcase full of money fell on the tarmac and all blew away, and he was captured. I give this film a 8 out of 10 because it was such a great film, and because i love this kind of genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior to watching this film, I confess to having never seen a Kubrick film from beginning to end. (Although it's been on my bucket list for quite some time) I knew he had a very experimental style and I knew some of his directorial trademarks, such as really testing the audience's patience with certain scenes. The Killing really shows early Kubrick and even so, the film proves that he's always been brilliant.The first half of this film may be dull for many. I found myself zoning out at points because all the characters are doing are discussing their plans which they put fourth in the much more exiting second half of the film.I saw the version of the film with the narration which Kubrick was originally against and with good reason. Much of what the narrator says is obvious common sense to a modern day audience.The plot is simple, an elaborate heist at a race track. What makes it so special however? Kubrick employed a unique narrative twist in which the heist was shown various different times from the perspectives of the characters involved. Kubrick was really one of the first if not, the first director to employ this technique which is widely used today in many Hollywood films even today.The film itself is quite monumental in that sense, and it gives us all an early taste of one of the greatest directors of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not one of Kuberick's best but a great underrated noir and stepping stone for Kuberick into cinema. Its got a good simple suspenseful plot about a $2,000,000 racetrack heist that never lets up until the end. One of the things that makes this film so memorable as a classic noir is the the plot is played out non linear at times from different perspectives of the crime and for a film from 1956 thats very impressive hence its influence on Tarantino films. The acting is good all around with some standout performances by Elisha Cook Jr., Mary Windsor and Sterling Hayden. Kuberick's direction is solid but the major gripe I have is that the exposition narration points out the obvious at times but since this is Kuberick's early work I can forgive that. Other than that this is a good film noir and a must see for film buffs. 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is a linear story necessary? Nope, and this is a perfect example of how a film can be made with a non-linear story. I wish that movie makers in the fifties would have given movie-goers a bit more credit. Though I have never seen it without the narration, I think the stories progression is pretty clear. It was pushing boundaries and seemed necessary to tell the story that the writer wanted to tell. I find that a lot of modern movies that have non-linear story telling do it more as a gimmick then they do anything else.This is a typical heist movie, but unlike most typical heist movies, this one keeps you riveted to the end.</fullReview>

In a way, it kind of makes the viewer see the criminals as the good guys, and maybe hope that they get away with the crime. While it is understandable that segregation was a part of life when this movie was made, I was still caught off guard when the n-word was used in the movie. It made my jaw drop a little, and I was surprised hat they honestly allowed that to be done on film. My overall favorite scene in the movie would have to be the very last shot in the film, with the two detectives walking out the airport doors toward the camera, drawing their guns. It gives the viewer a feeling of anxiety and suspense over knowing that the criminal has been caught, yet still making them wonder what will happen next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dollar Sign in place of a Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. What a treat to see this one on the big screen, some 56 years after its release. This is famed director Stanley Kubrick's first real feature-length film and is a quasi-film noir near the end of that genre's run. You undoubtedly know Kubrick's more famous work on 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining, among others. His amazing eye with the camera is on full display here, but this provides quite a different look.Sterling Hayden stars as Johnny, the leader of a gang who plans to rob a racetrack of $2 million dollars. At its core, this is a traditional heist film, but it is presented in anything but a traditional manner. It's non-linear timeline and constant flashbacks and flash-forwards influenced many future filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan. For the era, this was incredibly unique and a bit experimental. In fact, the studio forced Kubrick to add the narrator post-production. The narrator is Art Gilmore, a prolific voice actor, who was heard in numerous movies, TV shows and previews.Support work is provided by many familiar character actors that we all recognize. Elisha Cook is best known for his work in The Maltese Falcon and Vince Edwards gained fame as TV's Ben Casey. There are two actresses of note here. Marie Windsor plays the scheming, double-crossing wife/girlfriend whom Hayden's character claims has a dollar sign right where her heart should be. Ms. Windsor appeared in Swamp Women, director Roger Corman's directorial debut. Coleen Gray plays Hayden's loyal girlfriend. Ms. Gray had a long, prolific career as an actress, but never achieved the stardom that many predicted.As viewers, we are included in most of the strategy involved in the heist and recognize many of the details as they occur. One of the more fascinating scenes is a staged bar fight featuring Kola Kwariani. This is a very unusually staged fight and is actually quite humorous today, with a touch of The Three Stooges. This was Mr. Kwariani's only film appearance and it's quite memorable for a professional wrestler! Another sequence that really stands out features Timothy Carey as a sharpshooter. His speech pattern is a bit bizarre, but we never doubt his commitment to the cause. Carey's character has a very daring exchange with a race track security guard that is even uncomfortable so many years later.Kubrick was groomed as a still photographer and his expert eye is obvious in each of his films. The approach to filming the horse racing scenes is spectacular, and stands in contrast to his love of stressed faces in close-ups. Supposedly Rodney Dangerfield appears as an extra during the bar fight, but I missed him. Probably need the DVD for that! This one is certainly worth checking out for a glimpse into early Kubrick and the screen magnetism of Sterling Hayden ... who 16 years later would break the jaw of Michael Corleone, and later be the victim of one of Hollywood's all-time death scenes in Louis restaurant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never underestimate the destructive power of human factor ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "The Killing" is mostly admired for its inventive and confusing editing, I felt it owed more to the script and the direction, which both consecrate it as a gripping masterpiece of storytelling. "The Killing" is even more impressive because it was directed by a young 28-year old Stanley Kubrick with the confidence of a veteran, betraying on the surface, his passion for photography and on the content, for chess games.Indeed, "The Killing" displays a lot of technical novelties illustrating Kubrick's eagerness to make something new. The film is full of endless traveling shots where we goes from a room to another, conveying the feeling of a disturbed intimacy and contrasting with the crowd shots in the track races. The film plays as a self-reflexive demonstration of talent and perfectionism that would become the trademarks of the master, respecting the unity of space, time, and plot in a revolutionary three-dimensional way, with a plot, a plot within the plot, and the implacable and inevitable human factor. This doom is the key of "The Killing"'s modernity that inspired such gangster classics as "Reservoir Dogs" and the intelligence of the story relies on the very fact that the failure is never due to hazard but to the very human factors on which the success of the operation depended too.Like a ingenuously constructed chess game, "The Killing" is governed by the same mathematical precision used for the plot, where each move counts and nothing is left for hazard. I wonder if Kubrick counted the length of the reels and knew his film wouldn't exceed 80 minutes, because it manages to get immediately to the essential: the heist, and yet, takes time to deal with the characters and plunge us, through the dark and shadowy photography, in their intimacy. We progressively discover which part each one will play in the heist, which piece of the puzzle they are, a clever metaphor made by the narrator, conveying the notion of unity, as every action would obey to an established set of rules, hence the plot within the plot, the heist within the story.And the horse race heist is a template for criminal organization, whose audacity matches its ambition. Like in the o less glorious predecessor, John Huston's "The Asphalt Jungle", the plan implies the use of many internal elements from a cashier clerk, Elisha Cook as George, to a cop and a barman, and some outsourcing: Nikki, an isolated sharpshooter and Maurice, a ex-wrestler coming to divert the attention (two great performance from Timothy Carey and Kola Kwariani), two jobs that justifies the participation of a loan shark. The most crucial part of the heist is handled by a professional, Johnny Clay, remarkably played by Sterling Hayden. The first act is indeed a masterstroke of malicious perfectionism providing a feeling that won't be deceived in the following part.During the heist, Maurice must be handled by a group of cops who come from inside, letting George open the door to Johnny. Even a pawn can play vital part: that's precisely where the thrills of the film relies on, we stop wondering how this masterfully prepared plan will work, but how it will not. And this is the second plot of the film which occupies all the emotional aspects, focusing on two Clay, the thief with principles and the weakling cashier who wants to buy affection for his bullying wife, a reminiscent of Edward G. Robinson's character in Fritz Lang's "Scarlet Street".George is such a weak personality that all he does is in order to satisfy his wife, fatally ruins the plan. We already anticipate the failure, but it doesn't ruin the impact because "The Killing" is precisely about that, as there is no perfect murder, there is no perfect heist, and the more links it uses, the more likely it will be undermined by the weakest one, it's pure logistical logic. Nothing can be determined by a perfect timing, and if the characters respect the timetable, that's only because in their hearts, they're motivated by greed and personal motives. This is why the choice of featuring these characters in their ordinary life is crucial, while in today's films, it's mostly used for the most important protagonists.Greed is tricky, and if it's the very cause of the perfectionism that will govern the major plot's actions, to a degree of exactitude that certainly elevated the editing of "The Killing" to the level of genius, it's also the reason of the characters' fall. And in this gallery of despicable antiheroes, Johnny works as the mastermind, the voice of reason who has enough authority and diplomacy to deal with the team and to know how and where to act. In the iconic airport climax, when he knows the cops are coming at him, he can run but he knows it doesn't make a difference. Indeed, in a previous scene, when Timothy Carey's character tries to escape the police after shooting the horse, he's instantly killed. Unaware of the perfectionism that conducted the plan he took part of, he couldn't, like Johnny, believe in fatality.And this is the noir-theme dealt in "The Killing", a sort of fatality that inspires all the revisionist questions, what if George didn't tell his wife? What if Johnny wasn't taken by the traffic jam? What if he took less money or bought too briefcases? Quickly, we understand that some things are meant to come, because nothing can be governed by pure rational logic when human factor is part of the game, let alone, when two million dollars are at stakes. Why did the plan fail, because it needed to rely on non-professionals who couldn't help but let themselves guided by their emotions.Believing the plan could work was as ludicrous as believing there is such a thing as honor among thieves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick At His Absolute Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without batting an eye I will refer to this as the greatest heist film, the best Kubrick film and also (My Personal Opinion) the greatest Black and White film. All of which, should say a lot about how absolutely bliss this film is.As for Stanley Kubrick, he is in my top 5 favorite directors of all time. I find all of his films to be a genuine masterpiece, with the exception of "Full Metal Jacket", which is still outstanding. Anyway, I was breathing heavily from the second I picked up the Criterion Collection Edition of this and viewed that chilling picture of the man with the clown mask to the very end of the film.This following sentence is a spoiler. I don't know what it is about unhappy endings, I just find that there is so much more to be explored with them compared to happy endings. This ending, is just simply perfection and possibly the most classic unhappy ending of all time. I mean, throughout the movie, just waiting for something to interfere and then just such a simple mishap leaves the entire operation in the dust.To be honest, and I know that this is said about a lot of movies that people adore, but I couldn't think of a single flaw. Story-wise or anything. There may have been some continuity issues, but who cares about that(I didn't notice any, anyways). There is not an unnecessary scene in this and there isn't a scene that I would recall being fantastic. This film is necessary and I couldn't tell you why I've put it off all these years.</fullReview>

The fragmented chronology is a curious touch, maybe not entirely necessary but it keeps things interesting.

The casting is outstanding and everyone plays their part to a tee. I'm not sure the casting could have been done any better.Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 8.5* - This is my favorite Kubrick film that I have seen and I was kind of skeptical when I saw he wrote and directed it, but it is pieced together very well and I'm surprised he didn't pursue this genre more.Plot/Characters: 8* - A group of down on their luck men plan a heist to steal money from the racetrack during the 7th race. I will admit that the storyline is what made me want to see the film and I am glad that I did. It is a different kind of heist film that involves a racetrack instead of a casino, jewelry store, or bank.Entertainment Value: 8* - As mentioned, it has a very good pace and keeps your attention throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to make it part of my library very soon. I highly recommend and would watch again anytime.My Score: 8.5+8.5+8+8 = 33/4 = 8.25Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being who I am I have a passion for Stanley Kubrick movies of all shape and form. The Killing was one of his first movies which means its quality is a testament to how good Kubrick naturally is. What the Killing lacks in creative storyline it makes up for in Kubrick's shots and techniques. Kubrick's parallel editing techniques are awesome. When he uses the load speaker to establish a time frame it inspired me to think of new and innovative ways of doing just the same thing. Kubrick's shots of the apartment after the killing actually happens are disorienting and really play up the confusion of walking in on multiple dead bodies. All in all i love this movie for it hard crime feel with its wonderful shooting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast Paced Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing is a fast paced thriller that was ahead of its time.Stanley Kubrick directed this and it is considered his breakout film. The story is about a ragtag group of would be robbers that plan an elaborate heist of a racetrack. Kubrick keeps a very fast pace in this film and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. Kubrick also used parallel editing to show the film non-sequentially, meaning that the story jumped around and you would see the same stretch of time shown repeatedly, but each scene was focused on what a different character was doing during that time. Kubrick was way ahead of his time with this idea. The acting was solid in this film lead by Sterling Hayden. The story was interesting and entertaining, and enough humor was sprinkled in at random intervals to make it a very enjoyable crime film/ B movie.</fullReview>

You never know what to quite expect next with the cast, which is enjoyable. The cinematography is done very well, the camera angles are what stand out to me the most. Certain shots have a way of zooming in close to the characters face during a certain defining time in the movie, which helps you get a better look into the emotional turmoil of the character. The actors do very well in the portrayal of these characters, I found myself immersed in the film. The film is dark, shifty, and keeps you constantly guessing. The relationship between the leading man and woman is done very well. They both compliment each other in a way that screams film noir. The film does well with its sense of verisimilitude, the lighting, camera angles, editing, soundtrack, all add an element of darkness and surprise. Good film.</fullReview>

And the diegetic jazz music that plays during the aftermath was very innovative as well. The ending is absolutely hilarious. The scene on the runway- ha!

		<fullReview>An interesting journey through the conception and execution of a brilliantly planned heist, full of anticipation and surprises. I felt the narrator was a bit much, or a bit too documentary in style, but admit that I would have been lost without him. The editing I found quite effective, showing what happens at different locations during the same time. There are many interesting shots used, like the long tracking of a character as they walk through multiple rooms, or the dazed stylized shot from George's point of view after everyone dies in the apartment shootout. I felt it appropriate that George be the lone survivor of his own wifes double cross, and was even more satisfied when she was shot by the very man she was manipulating and scheming against. The final disastrous turning point for Johnny was foreshadowed nicely, with the faulty suitcase, and the obnoxious woman with her little dog. It seemed that irony played an important role in the film, epitomized in the shot where a lucky horseshoe ruptures the tire of the fleeing hit-man resulting in his death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing (1956)5 word summaryCrooks plan on robbing racetrack a Film-Noir thriller brought to us by Stanley Kubrick, and personally my favorite of his films. It's a different style film than a lot of or his later movies. Its not really in the same style as like Clockwork, Full Metal Jacket, Paths of Glory, and so on. the Killing is dark in more than one way. It obviously shows the darkness of humans, as most Kubrick films do and as well as most film- noir. The cinematography also is very dark. It is similar to that of a black and white Godfather, just a minimum of light, from a lamp or whatever. As always Kubrick's directing is fantastic. I don't have anything bad to say about it. Just everything is straight to the point but doesn't seem forced. Everything works great together, the dialog, acting, music, and cinematography makes it a really beautiful film. ****spoilers****Once the plan is in motion and all the characters are doing their job the film starts getting pretty tense. Everything starts to go wrong, like the guy with the rifle has to deal with the man working the parking lot, and gets shot. After they finally get away and Clay has to leave with the money it seems like the film still has quite a bit left. It doesn't seem like we can conclude anything anytime soon. Then when the money spills onto the runway your heart stops, you feel like Clay standing there watching. He can't do anything. We just feel shocked and have to walk away. Nothing accomplished, but everything lost.****end spoilers****So I don't really have that much to say about it other than how wonderful everything is. The film should be enjoyed by everyone, especially Kubrick fans and film noir fans</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small budget big movie, meticulously constructed plot, classic 1950s stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing (1956)An early Stanley Kubrick movie, shot in a kind of crystalline black and white that isn't quite the murky low key of traditional noirs. But this isn't really a film noir in many ways (it does have a classic femme fatale), but a crime caper, with Sterling Haden as kingpin and a cast of great bit players (including Elisha Cook) around him. It probably borrows most from The Asphalt Jungle in its basic intention, and its focus on the characters as much as the crime. It's a low budget film ($300,000) but makes the most of every penny, and the movie shines even today. And the location shooting at Bay Meadows racetrack is great (and brief).The plot is clearly stated (and "stated" is a good word here), and yet the order of the narrative flow is unusual, cutting back and forth in many different pieces, and to different points in time (usually earlier in the day from the the main event). To keep the pieces in place, a narrator explains the time and sometimes the circumstances of the different flashbacks. It is so keenly constructed you are increasingly drawn into the events, putting it together almost like a cop might, afterwards, following each piece of the puzzle back and forth in time. Much of the movie (the interior shots, the apartments) was shot at a studio, and there are even cameras moving through walls and so on, making clear that this is not a cinema verite style. It's an artificial drama, and that fits with the cool tone of the narrator (he seems to be sitting back with a martini the whole time, though we never see him). It's highly contrived but so beautifully made, and so well acted, you finish in a state of total appreciation. Not shock, and without tears, but in cool satisfaction that you just watched a very well made movie. "Gangsters and artists are equal in the eyes of the masses," says an over-sized thug in a key moment. And they "wish to seem them destroyed at the peak of their glory." That's so Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubricks third film with a low budget, but still very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say this is pretty good for a directors third film, and the fact that it was made in the 50's makes it even more impressing. The Killing may not be like most Kubrick films, but it is still packed with tension, excitement, and a fair point to tell. I guess this is Kubricks way of saying "crime does not pay", and since it Kubrick it is shown in a very blunt and stylized way. Sure it is a low budget film, and from time to time it shows. But this is a great example on how a good story and good acting can save a film. So except for a few minor mistakes that you hardly notice, this is a great heist movie that I would recommend to anyone, especially if they're a Kubrick fan. A fun piece of trivia may be the fact that in order to make this film, Kubrick had to make it for free, he received no pay whatsoever. Now that's a man with a heart for film-making.Anyway I give this film a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Kubrick's Early Attempts, Overlooked Too Often</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a veteran criminal planning one last heist before settling down and marrying Fay (Coleen Gray). His plan is to rob the money-counting room of a racetrack of two million dollars during a featured race, and to do this he assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop; a betting window teller at the track to give access to the backroom; a sharpshooter to shoot the favorite horse during the race, distracting the crowd; a wrestler to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and the bartender.One lesson to learn from this film: Sherry is a horrible wench. If your wife is as mean and heartless as Sherry, keep an eye on her. She may be cheating on you or planning to kill your friends.Despite being one of Kubrick's earliest writing and directing attempts, he successfully created a gripping narrative that rages on, in and out of plot twists, chugging at full speed for a full 84 minutes (a shorter film, but long enough to tell the tale). I haven't read the Lionel White book this is based on, but the way the story is woven from the beginning, not always in order, works very well for dropping revealing pieces in the right order.This film seems like an inspiration for "Reservoir Dogs", and probably was, as well as many other gangster or heist movies. I single out "Dogs" because of the team of men who do not know each other. But really, a heist this complex is hard to pull off... maybe it also influenced "Ocean's Eleven" -- I don't know. First great caper on film.I have seen the majority of Kubrick's works, but never this one until now. I was impressed. One of the master's least known films is possibly one of his best. The sniper, the wrestler, the smooth criminal... these characters are just wonderful and were well-cast and well-shot by Kubrick. Pure genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the impressive Killer's Kiss, film maker Stanley Kubrick the Killing shows that he is starting to flex his muscles regarding his unique approach to film-making.Like Killer's Kiss, Kubrick still has to work within the Hollywood archetype of films of the time. The films budget was still small, but much bigger than his previous film. There are many more characters, all giving good performances, albeit there is a standout from Sterling Hayden as Johnny. His performance anchors the film with a no-nonsense, focused and single minded character, but someone who perhaps is very reluctant, if not unwilling, to kill anyone.The noir atmosphere is very well realised, with excellent photography, albeit just one scene's back projection doesn't really work. Nevertheless, Kubrick does push to get some very good shots, particularly the horse racing footage. Most of the composition is understated but stylish, using practical sources to create atmosphere for interior scenes. Editing is understated but effective. Also, both in this and the previous film, Kubrick seems quite happy to 'cross the line' in terms of directing, and it doesn't seem to cause a problem.What is most innovative is the non linear approach to the film's time line, supported by a narrator, which works very well. The ending is appropriate, but personally, I felt sympathy for the lead character and actually wished the film ended differently, but then this a Stanley Kubrick film.In summary, an excellent small film, and a clear progression in Kubrick's rise as a landmark director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick makes a real killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't help wondering if Sterling Hayden didn't get the feeling that he was just rehashing his biggest hit The Asphalt Jungle when he starred in heist movie The Killing six years later, but today Kubrick's shoestring production holds up much better than its big studio predecessor. Only three films into his career and Kubrick was already setting out his big theme ? society's need to break individuals that threaten it into manageable cogs in the machine, aided in its task by their own character flaws. He even has Kola Kwariani spell it out in so many words: "You have not yet learned that in this life you have to be like everyone else. The perfect mediocrity. No better, no worse. Individuality is a monster, and it must be strangled in its cradle to make our friends feel comfortable. You know, I often thought that the gangster and the artist are the same in the eyes of the masses. They're admired and hero-worshipped, but there is always present underlying wish to see them destroyed at the peak of their glory." The individual in question is Hayden's crook planning the biggest heist of the century with the help of a corrupt cop, a bartender and a racetrack cashier, bankrolled by Jay C. Flippen's moneyman, who clearly has a crush on him and goes straight to the bottle when he realises it's not mutual. The film's big gimmick at the time was the film backtracking to follow each member of the gang as they carry out their part in a vicious but ingenious and perfectly planned-to-the-second racetrack heist. But perfect plans, like computers or Marine recruits, have a tendency to break down due to a human error in the programme, and in this case the human error is Elisha Cook Jr., or more precisely his wife Marie Windsor in a double-crossing downmarket femme fatale role that would have been played by Gloria Graham in a bigger budgeted picture and who delivers a performance that seems the template for Joan Collins' entire career. Desperate to keep her even though she's cheating on him with Vince Edwards' punk (who in turn is cheating on her), he gabs a little too much about the plan? Hayden gets probably the best role of his career, his fast-talking no-nonsense totally in control delivery giving the film an urgency even when it's just men sitting in dark rooms talking, and when he delivers his forlorn last line it's as if the man really has had all the humanity drained out of him. Yet good as he is, the standout in the cast is Elisha Cook Jr in what may well be the his very best performance as the "joke without a punchline" clerk, a man who loses control the more he tries to display it. There's some fine black and white camera-work from Lucien Ballard boasting alternating stark, almost reportage-style rough-and-ready shots with some strikingly controlled long tracking shots that Kubrick later revised into a visual trademark, and there are a few other pointers to Kubrick's future work as well ? seen with hindsight, Hayden's clown mask looks remarkably Droog-like, while two of the doomed soldiers in Paths of Glory, Timothy Carey (a man who could look sleepily menacing even when stroking a puppy) and, briefly, Joseph Turkel (best remembered as the ghostly bartender in The Shining) turn up in supporting roles. The Dragnet-style narration can be excessive at times, but does help immensely in the heist finale as the narrative constantly doubles-back on itself and the film's timeframe, and there's some terrific dialogue courtesy of the great Jim Thompson ("You like money. You have a great big dollar sign there where most women have a heart."). It's still tied to the crime-must-not-pay morality of its day, but it executes it with startling immediacy and a great "What's the difference?" ending.</fullReview>

Flippen, Vincent Edwards, and Colleen Gray and directed by Stanley Kubrick.Hayden plays the mastermind in the robbery of a race track. The viewer is shown all of his partners - a clerk at the track (Cook), a bad cop, a strong man, a hit man, and a former cell mate. After the robbery, he plans on leaving town with his girlfriend (Gray). What he doesn't plan on is the interference from the clerk's wife from hell (Windsor) and her crooked boyfriend (Vince Edwards).The structure of this film is just great and will remind many of "Pulp Fiction" and "Jackie Brown," both of which immediately sprung to mind while watching this. Once Hayden has hired everyone, we see each person preparing for their role in the robbery, though you're not always sure what that role is. When the robbery actually takes place, you see it from the point of view of each person as they play their part. The plot has several neat twists as well. Another interesting thing Kubrick did was not put a "button" on many of the scenes - some of them ended mid-conversation or without the usual finish of someone leaving the room etc.Though "The Killing" was a B film with a B cast, the excellence of the script, performances, and direction says A! It's very exciting and tense right up to the last moment.Never a favorite actor of mine, Sterling Hayden acquits himself very well in the lead role. I always found his real-life personality much more interesting, but lately I've seen him in a few things where he was very good, so my opinion is changing. Elisha Cook has a larger role than he usually does, and he's up to the task as a pathetic, naive man in love with the wrong woman. That wrong woman is Marie Windsor who apparently thought her husband was coming into some money when they got married. Not only hasn't he got any money, he's evidently not much in the sack either, and she looks elsewhere and finds smug Vince Edwards. Windsor, a good actress and a good-looking one whose face and body said she'd been around the block so many times she was dizzy, specialized in this type of role. Lovely Colleen Gray doesn't have enough to do. The actor who plays the strong man was virtually unintelligible in everything he said due to a very thick accent.One odd thing is an encounter between Hayden and Jay C. Flippen, where Flippen suggests that the two of them go away together alone rather than Hayden getting married. Interpret it as you will.Excellent film, don't miss it. And WHAT an ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of it's type.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raw 50's crime/heist movie, typical of United Artist's tough crime movies from this decade such as D.O.A. (1950) and Kiss Me Deadly (1955). Sterling Hayden is perfect as the head of the operation to rob a racetrack and the other actors perfectly portray their desperate roles. Of all the parts I think that the husband/wife roles of Elisha Cook and Marie Windsor are the best and most entertaining. Windsor is brilliantly sarcastic and manipulative and the dialogue between her and Cook is enjoyable all the way. Why the two are married in the first place (As Cook has no money or looks and is middle aged) is a puzzle but is also crucial to the movie as it's Windsor's philandering that puts a spanner in the works. Timothy Carey's cagey and sullen gun for hire is also terrific and totally believable. There's one aspect that prevents this movie from being perfect and which must be mentioned - the ending. While the ending is exciting it's hard to believe that someone who has committed such a crime and has millions in their possession would turn up at an airport with it rather than lay low somewhere in hiding. Also Hayden's character finds the only suitcase in the country that doesn't lock properly to put the money into!! The movie is very well structured and is a forerunner of Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs in that aspect and the narration is sparse, pertinent and no hindrance. It takes my vote as the best Hollywood movie of it's type (For a different take see the French masterpiece Riffifi).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to find gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went hunting for this flick after seeing Sterling Hayden in The Asphalt Jungle. This was a few years ago and it was very hard to find then. When I found out Kubrick directed, I intensified my search. When I read reviews about it, I resolved to get the movie no matter the cost. I was not disappointed. It's a shame more people haven't seen this movie. This heist movie shows itself in later movies and the non-linear movement of the film shows in other movies we all know and love. It's easier to find now, so go and get it. You see why Kubrick became such a force. Sterling Hayden is my second favorite cool guy action after Steve McQueen and before Chow Yun Fat (the Hong Kong movies). And the scene at the racetrack for which I believe the moved was titled it is intense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best crime movies out there: A true Kubrick Special!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing has pretty much everything a dark crime movie should have: Evil dames (aka black widows), good guys who aren't so good and a twisting plot that revolves around a big criminal heist. Sterling Hayden, an often overlooked actor who was only nominated for one award his entire career (a BAFTA award nomination for Best Foreign Actor), does an excellent job in this film in every facet of his acting...from his spoken lines right down to his body language and facial expressions. Indeed, Mr. Hayden was so much more than the corrupt Police Captain McKlusky from The Godfather, a role he's almost always associated with...He was so much more of an actor than that and this movie proves it&gt;&gt;&gt;His career spanned 5 decades!!! Also, I'm not quite certain and I'd appreciate some feedback on this, but it has to be one of the first movies whose chronology has been re-arranged and the story is told out of its natural order; Much like a Pulp Fiction. I won't give up any of the details, but in telling the story out of its natural order Kubrick twists the viewers guts in anticipation: It's torture after a while....Every time the viewer thinks the climax is on its way the movie back tracks again and again!!! The affect this creates is incredible: it fills the viewer with anxiety and keeps him/her truly on the edge of their his/her seat. A great crime movie...a very dark movie...I loved it so much I never want to see it again!!! A+ on the gut twisting scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film noir heist flick, brilliantly acted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can believe Sterling Hayden as the hard man heist professional he portrays in this movie. Every pore on every face in this movie oozes character, with Hayden standing out as the toughest man in cinema. He assembles a motley bunch of cons and crooks to commit a daring robbery during the height of the racing season at a crowded racetrack, yet the film concentrates much more on the before and after than the actual crime, since it's merely the pivot around which all the characters and story lines revolve. The style stands out for the time, innovative use of montage and editing to help the multifaceted story along were unheard of in mainstream US cinema at that time. Were it colourised you could almost mistake the visual style for a Tarantino flick, a man influenced in his later works by this and other Kubrick films. This has to be the best 'men on a mission' movie that doesn't in some way involve war, with absolute top notch acting throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*************SPOILERS HEREIN****************************************Okay, there sure are dated touches here and there. What film made 45 years ago doesn't show its age, even if just a little? But there is something special in this film that achieves timelessness. I haven't read or heard what Tarentino's take on this film is, but I understand `Reservoir Dogs' was very much influenced by it. The non-linear storytelling, the failed heist, the divvying of the loot (which Tarentino mainly concentrated on) and the final stand off between the crooks themselves all echo his style. Someone told me that this instantaneous explosion of gunfire amongst criminals is called a `Mexican Standoff.' I'm not sure where that comes from or if it's true, but it makes me wonder if this device doesn't have its origins elsewhere. I've also heard Tarentino was inspired by a scene in a John Woo film as well (if he was, I'm unfortunately not familiar with it). So like Tarentino, `The Killing' has an uneasy tone, snappy dialogue, moments of shock &amp; violence but still manages, above all, to be a heck of lot of fun. So much cool stuff.I have read several pieces in regard to whether or not Marvin's character is homosexual. To me, this seems pretty self-evident after scanning through the available criticism on the film, but it wasn't so obvious to me the first time I saw it (keep in mind, this subplot is intended to be suggested, not overt. The material was, after all, subject to the rigors of the Hays Code). Of course such richness and variety of characters in `The Killing' is one of its merits. On this issue, I can think of no other reason Marvin would appear at the racetrack drunk, jeopardizing the heist, after he was specifically told he was no longer needed. All he had to do was wait for his cut. His behavior goes beyond any possible jealousy over his small role in the heist, especially when one considers the content of his conversation with Johnny Clay (bedside, no less!). Notably, he sheepishly asks Johnny if he would like to `go away together, just the two of us.' He shows up at the track because he felt chided, despondent and rejected. But even after understanding Marvin's story, the importance of this scene, to me, always functioned as a complete red herring. It's a fascinating choice for a subplot given that it's not integral to the telling of the story, but given the times, quite heavy in subject matter.Another common question: why would Johnny buy such a lousy suitcase? Clearly, it was panic on the surface, but is that believable given how his character had been developed up to that point? It may have been a time issue. Considering that he went to a second hand, and not a luggage, store in the throes of an emergency, that suitcase may have been all he had to choose from. A recent IMDB reviewer mentioned - almost dismissively in fact - the angle of the `self-destructive loser.' I like this interpretation a lot. To me, I've always found the ending to the `The Killing' oddly satisfying in that crime-never-pays fashion, but beneath its surface always lay something odd &amp; different. This self-destructiveness may be exactly what creates this feeling, especially given Johnny's closing line of resignation, `Ah, what's the difference?' To be fair, this behavior is not totally unjustified either. We do know that Johnny had: 1) done at least a stint or two in prison so couldn't have been all that successful as a crook; 2) a helpless, insecure girlfriend that has been waiting a LONG time for Johnny to make good on his many promises (I guess losers love company); 3) picked up a circle of apple-polishing co-conspirators who were all failures themselves in one way or another (a corrupt cop, a submissive race track teller, a deranged dog breeder - or whatever Nikki was - etc.). Significantly, the only person to suggest any honesty and/or lack of greed, the philosophical Maurice, is also the one spared of death. Johnny's choice in cronies is so poor in fact that his heist becomes an exercise in ineptness. Is it that surprising he would begin to self-destruct, especially once lifelong imprisonment seemed eminent? Moving on.Timothy Carey's performance is way ahead of his time. The realism he brings to his psychotic killer demonstrates what Brando pulled off in `On the Waterfront,' or at least `The Wild One,' but also suggests the type of unpredictable excitement one would later expect from a Harvey Keitel or even character actors capable of on-the-edge-dangerousness like Peter Stormare (`8mm,' `Fargo'). Even the cadence of his line delivery is so odd and uncomfortable to listen to that it reminds me a little of Andy Garcia or, better yet (!), Christopher Walken. Had he capitalized on his physical lankiness, he may now be remembered as an American Christopher Lee. Carey also played an altogether different character in Kubrick's `Paths of Glory,' so it's clear he had some range, but was sadly seen guest-spotting on such TV tripe (well, for him anyway) as `Charlie's Angels' and `CHiPs' fifteen years later.Marie Windsor as the ridiculing, controlling, and manipulative wife of passive-aggressive Elisha Cook (whom she physically towers over like something out of the Amazon!) is absolutely fantastic. Her death scene (`it's like a bad joke -gasp! - without the punchline!') is so hammy yet perfectly embodies the quintessential 50s pulp bad girl. Sterling Hayden tries his hand at some wise guy Noir dialogue with amazing success (to Marie Windsor, something like: `I read you like a book: you're a no-good dirty tramp, the kind of dame that would sell out her own grandmother for a piece of fudge - oh, but you're smart along with it. You've got a gret big dollar sign here where most women have a heart!'), and gives one of his best performances.</fullReview>

A great example of noir film, a film every "new Tarantino's fan" should see to realize the influence of Kubric's genialty. In 90 minutes we enjoy the great ambientation, the extraordinary music, and a really master's direction.</fullReview>

I liked how the movie was told from many point of views, I think that is one of the only things that kept it interesting for me. I suppose it did leave me surprised at some points but over all I was just bored through out. I think that since I knew it was by Stanley Kubrick I expected a lot. I have seen "The Shining" a couple times and I was always impressed by it (even though it leaves me with terrible nightmares every time). Maybe if I did not see "The Shining" I would think that this movie was better than it was. The stories are not similar at all (which is fine and that is not why I am underwhelmed) but I think I just had high expectations for this movie because of the director. Maybe if I did not know who the director was before the movie it would have been different as well but unfortunately I did and I did not really enjoy the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Establishes Kubrick As A Master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing was director Stanley Kubrick's first major film effort though, like his earlier films, it was economically produced with an inexpensive cast.The film noir features Sterling Hayden, Coleen Gray, Vince Edwards and Elisha Cook Jr.It was written by Kubrick and Jim Thompson and it was based on the novel entitled Clean Break by Lionel White.Veteran criminal Johnny Clay is planning one last big heist before settling down to a respectable marriage with Fay. Teaming with several cohorts, Johnny masterminds a racetrack robbery. The basic flaw is that all the crooks involved are losers and small-timers who find themselves in way over their heads despite their supposed cleverness. None of the participants is more pathetic than George Peatty, who is goaded into the robbery by his covetous and far-from-faithful wife. As in a Greek tragedy, Johnny's best-laid schemes go awry. At 27, writer/director Stanley Kubrick, in his third full-length picture, has shown more audacity with dialogue and camera than Hollywood has seen since the obstreperous Orson Welles went riding out of town on an exhibitors' poll.Despite this only being his third feature and his first with a significant budget, he displays many of the thematic preoccupations and visual traits that would come to define his unique, cinematic voice.His breakthrough film is one of his very best, a classic film noir that has influenced many directors in narrative structure, visual style, and tone.It also has established him as a full-fledged filmmaker and a potential master.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing is one of the best pieces of filmmaking; it's short and sweet, thrilling and chilling, and most importantly artistic and thought-provoking. The film creates a web of stories for us in the beginning and later ties them together, subsequently revealing the character's intentions. The psychology is what brings the thriller to life though. The film is intensely dependent on psychological motivation and manipulation other than stylized violence and likewise. The mixture of artistic psychological storytelling with the constant non-linear storytelling makes this a shining accomplishment for the then young Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

It was your simple gangster film, some suspense but nothing really special, no plot twists. I did like, however, how they had multiple views of different perspectives of the characters and how they all came together in the end. There were some suspenseful moments like when Timothy Carey has to shoot the horse and then get away in time .Besides that it was just a simple story about how these criminals put together a robbery at the racetrack.

		<fullReview>A former con man, Johnny Clay, gathers four pals to perform what he thinks will be a flawless heist at a California racetrack where two million dollars will be on hand at a particular day. The plan that is worked out involves inside help from two men working at the track, and two outsiders. The men promise to keep the operation secret; no one is to get even a hint of what is being prepared. Johnny figures the money is his ticket to an easy life with Fay, his girlfriend. Unfortunately, George Peatty, the betting clerk, is the weakest link to the heist. George is married to Sherry, a woman that is two-timing him with the hunky Mikki Arcane, a criminal, himself. Sherry, who is about to walk out on George figures her husband is involved in something big, and he, being the milquetoast he is, fearing losing her, reveals something that will put the plan in jeopardy. Exactly what Johnny did not want it to happen.The heist goes well. The idea was to have one man shoot the favorite horse while the race is going on from a distant spot in a parking lot. The sniper runs into an unexpected problem: the lot is already closed to vehicles. The black attendant is persuaded by this man to let him go in, but the sniper, a racist bigot, has words with the employee who, in turn call the cops. The idea was that after the horse is shot, the resulting confusion will create the chaos that is needed for Johnny Clay to go into the audit room to steal the money. Prior to the robbery, Johnny had secured seats on a night flight out of town; he and Fay will be on that plane with all the money. Johnny did not plan on something that will be crucial for his get away. He had packed the money in a big suitcase. When he checks in, he figures he could take it with him on board, but little does he know about the logistic of such an idea!The film directed by Stanley Kubrick, was based on a novel, "Clean Break" by Lionel White. The director wrote the screenplay with Jim Thompson, a man that specialized in depicting these low types, helping with the dialogue. The result is a fine film that, according to most of the comments submitted to IMDb, became a favorite of this genre. The director uses a documentary style with a narrator telling us what is about to happen and introducing the characters.Sterling Hayden was perfect for Johnny. He gives his usual understated performance, acting without effort, yet giving a great reading to his character. Elisha Cook Jr., who made a career out of playing this type of man, makes a tremendous contribution to the enjoyment of the picture. Best of all is Marie Windsor, playing Sherry. Others in supporting roles, Vince Edwards, Ted DeCorcia, Colleen Gray, and Timothy Carey, among them doing a fine job for Mr. Kubrick.The black and white cinematography of Lucien Ballard gives texture to the film. The original music was by Gerald Fried. Director Stanley Kubrick showed why he was one of the best directors of his times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Times at Belmont Stakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing" was probably the worst of his career, second only to "Lolita." This is an overblown, overwrought, comically-black heist film and about as anti-climactic as any film I've seen.Let's start with the obvious problems: The movie is narrated by a hard-boiled Raymond Chandler-like character who sounds as if he's been up all night drinking black coffee and reading Detective X comic books. He sets up scenes with a clichéd and grating monotone: "Johnny Clay was up at 7 AM that morning, knowing today might be the last day of his life." The cheap device is also used to explain some massive plot-holes, especially in the film's finale: "The men had agreed beforehand that if anything went wrong in the robbery they would abandon one another immediately and whoever had the money at the time would keep it for themselves." How convenient! The second problem is the non-linear coverage of the heist itself: we spend so long watching the men prepare for their racetrack robbery that once it begins we don't want it to stop. But stop it does- several times- as we see each character's view of the heist and jump the timeline backwards at least half a dozen times. Watching an exciting scene unfold and then flashing back to an hour beforehand sucks all the energy and joy out of what action there is.The over-the-top performances are yet another problem. Why is Sterling Hayden's girlfriend in tears in the film's opening scene, begging him to "Be careful, Johnny," before vanishing from the rest of the film? Why does George's wife consider him such lowly human garbage that she has no reaction to seeing him bloodied and shot, going so far as to refuse him a ride to the hospital? Why does the black security guard take such an unlikely and instantaneous liking to Nikki that he brings him a program and a horseshoe (?) before Nikki finally has to get nasty and ask him to leave? What was he going to bring next, a refrigerator/freezer? A pinball machine?Finally, the film's finale is about as weak as I've seen... but I suppose a similar situation has happened to all of us at one time or another: A wealthy matron's toy poodle breaks free and dashes onto the runway which causes a baggage handler in a golf cart to swerve and drop a triple-locked suitcase full of cash which instantly springs open and blows every last bill into oblivion with the help of spinning jet propellers. It happens all the time. This clunking deus ex machina might be acceptable as an ironic twist if Johnny still got away, but in an act of inevitable moralizing he fails to catch a cab in time and the pigs descend upon him, dooming him to a life behind bars and us to our requisite guilt for ever identifying with the bad guy.sigh...Stanley Kubrick is a masterful director, and so much better than what happened here today. After reading the other reviews on here I feel that some people refuse to admit that even a great director can make a terrible film. They can. And "The Killing" is Exhibit A.I'm starting to sound like the narrator.GRADE: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's All In The Timing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Killing" is an exciting, fast moving crime caper in which a gang led by ex-convict Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) conspire to carry out a $2 million racetrack robbery. The job is meticulously planned by Clay who recruits a group of non-criminals to help him. As he explains to his girlfriend Fay (Coleen Gray), they are just normal people who've got their own problems and "have all got a bit of larceny in them". Significantly, two of them, George Peatty (Elisha Cook Jnr.) and Mike O'Reilly (Joe Sawyer) work at the racetrack as a cashier and bartender respectively. The other gang members are corrupt policeman Randy Kennan (Ted De Corsia) and accountant Marvin Unger (Jay C Flippen) who embezzles funds from his employers for the gang to use as working capital.George Peatty is besotted with his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) and she treats him with utter contempt. She's sarcastic and insulting whenever possible and he's exceptionally weak and humiliates himself by ignoring her abuse and continuously trying to impress her. It's on one of these occasions that he tells her about a big pay off that'll be coming his way soon. When she finds out enough details, she tells her lover, Val (Vince Edwards), about the planned heist and they devise a scheme to steal the proceeds of the crime.In order for the robbery to be completed successfully it's vital that all the gang members carry out their parts at the precise times planned by Johnny. Similarly, two other participants, a pugilist called Tiny (Joe Turkel) and a sniper called Nikki Arane (Timothy Carey), who are both employed to create distractions at the track, also have to conform with the very strict timetable. After the robbery is completed, the gang await the arrival of Johnny so that the share-out can be made. Johnny is late however, and Val arrives on the scene before him and a gun battle ensues in which everyone but George is killed. When Johnny arrives outside the building, he sees George rushing away and sensing that things have gone wrong, takes off with the money.The action is delivered at high speed throughout and it's entertaining to see how the detailed plans are carried out. The group of characters are hardly stereotypical and the complications of their predicaments add another level of interest as well as some unpredictability to the events that follow. The way in which the arrangements after the robbery unravel is down to a combination of Sherry's treachery and a bizarre incident at the airport which results in nobody profiting from the crime.The movie was tightly directed by Stanley Kubrick who, together with Jim Thompson, was also responsible for the screenplay. The timing and co-ordination of actions which was so vital to the gang's work is cleverly presented by using a series of forward and backward jumps in time to show how everything dovetails together. This device on its own would probably have been too confusing to follow and so a newsreel type narration is effectively used at various stages to keep the viewer on track. Sterling Hayden, Marie Windsor and Joe Turkel all provide good performances but the standout ones come from Elisha Cook Jnr. and Timothy Carey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Kubrick's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film that made Stanley Kubrick--and he was still in his 20s when he made it!Story of a robbery at a race track. The gang doing it has worked it out clearly to every last detail--it seems nothing could go wrong. Naturally things do.This film is not shown in straight forward fashion. It starts on the day of the robbery then keeps giving us flashbacks showing how things slowly developed. It works beautifully--it keeps the viewer off balance and lets you see events through various characters. Also Kubrick directs this beautifully--most of it takes place in small rooms with the men plotting, but Kubrick always keeps the camera moving shooting from every conceivable angle. Wonderfully edited too. It's very well-acted by a string of the best characters actors around back then. No one is bad but special credit goes to Sherling Hayden (as the head of the gang), Vince Edwards, Marie Windsor (who's just unbelievable) and Elisha Cook. Also the script is very well-written full of clever lines and never stops moving (the picture is under 90 minutes). It makes you actually care for the men pulling the robbery. They're not evil men--they just need the money to survive.Only two minor quibbles--the too loud obtrusive music score and the character of Maurice--he's played by someone called Kola Kwariani. I know he was a wrestler and not from around here--his THICK accent makes all his dialogue unintelligible! But those are minor details.All in all this is a superb film that everyone should see--even if you don't like Kubrick! I give it a 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "killing" in the title refers to "making a killing," which is what ex-con Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) wants to do as a kind of last heist before running off to matrimonial bliss with his girl friend Fay (Coleen Gray). This early work by Stanley Kubrick qualifies as a film noire, I suppose, since we are compelled to identify with the bad guys, especially with Clay who is a regular kind of joe who just happens to be a stick up artist. The Hollywood "code" that demanded that all bad guys get their just desserts before "The End" (yes, they still ran "The End" in 1956) was apparently still in effect, so I'm not so sure. I recall that Hitchcock in his television series used to make fun of the code by sometimes ending his weekly episode with the bad guy getting away clean, only to appear himself after the commercial and tell the audience that the bad guy was, alas, run over by a truck after helping an old lady cross the street, or something like that. The Killing, aka, "Clean Break" from the novel by Lionel White, is a tightly plotted thriller, scripted and directed by Kubrick in a very instructive style. By that I mean Kubrick demonstrates just how tension can be created and maintained by aiming all the action and characterizations toward a single event, in this case the seventh race at (either Hollywood Park or Santa Anita, I couldn't figure out which). This "spokes all pointing towardthe hub of the wheel structure" (if I may call it that) has been much admired and imitated. I am thinking in particular of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992). It looks easy to do and it plays so well, but if we don't care about or identify with the characters, it won't work. Kubrick makes us identify with his second-rate hoods by giving them dimension and motivation. Elisha Cook Jr., in perhaps his greatest role, plays the little guy loser to perfection. I say "perhaps" because I have only seen about a dozen of the over one hundred films in which this great character actor has appeared. His desperate face with the wide, round eyes (as he's about to be hit or blasted away) is not to be forgotten. Marie Windsor plays his two-timing, money-hungry wife, the dame that gums up the works.This is a superior venture not only because of the tight plotting but because of the vivid atmosphere created and because of some memorable scenes and some clever "movie business" attached to the scenes. I am thinking of the black parking lot attendant who thinks he is being befriended (or perhaps more) by one of the hoods, and the middle aged woman carrying on the conversation with her dog at the airport (a kind of Hitchcockian aside, actually). I was amused by the appearance of a chess and checker parlor ("15 cents an hour") because Kubrick was an avid chess player, although he wasn't very good. It's too bad he never made a film with Humphrey Bogart who loved to play on the set between scenes.Most modern thrillers have several plot red herrings not only to keep us guessing but to divert our attention away from the loose ends they never manage to clean up. Kubrick's rather brutal method of tying up all the loose ends lacked subtlety, but at least he cleaned them up. And there were only a couple of red herrings. One was having the money man show up at the track drunk so we'd think maybe he was going to somehow screw things up, and the other was when Marie Windsor's character intimates to her jealous husband that Clay had his way with her, which makes us expect that Cook will gum up the works in a fit of jealousy.The final sequence at the airport and what happens to the contents of the suitcase is not to be missed, after which Clay's final words of profound exasperation are just perfect.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>A lean, mean Kubrick noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Yes, but The Killing was better (than The Asphalt Jungle). The problem of imitation leaves me indifferent, above all if the imitator succeeds in surpassing the model. For me, Kubrick is a better director than Huston. I haven't seen Lolita but I believe that Kubrick can do everything." - Orson Welles "The Killing", Kubrick's first major film, informs us of Kubrick's world view. This is a highly deterministic world in which every action is governed by chance, coincidence and luck. Johnny Clay, a veteran criminal planning one last heist, in many ways is Stanley Kubrick. Clay is a perfectionist, always constructing meticulous plans and constantly trying to orchestrate his own future. Clay, like Kubrick, wants total control in an uncontrollable world.But as the film shows, no matter how hard he tries, man ultimately has no control. Human rituals, plans and patterns ultimately always give way to some form of chaos."The Killing" is like a little essay on determinism (or indeterminism?), the philosophical proposition that every event is causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences, a point deftly highlighted by the film's flashback narrative, in which past, preset and future are intimately intertwined.But in many ways, "The Killing" also marks a point of intersection between Kubrick's auteurist and generic interests. The perfectly planned robbery which goes wrong can obviously be related, for example, to those later technological systems which go awry in "Dr. Strangelove" and "2001: A Space Odyssey". Simultaneously, with its constant flashbacks, its male voice-over, predatory female, and high-contrast lighting, the film can easily be appended to the noir cannon.But "The Killing's" interest lies not in how these two approaches dovetail, but rather in a sense of mismatch. For example, just before she dies, one character's faithless wife describes her story as a "bad joke without a punch-line", and this rhymes perfectly with the sense of randomness that infects the film's ending.The film breaks down into virtually self-sufficient units, with the constant emphasis on specific times serving only to underline the arbitrariness of their sequence (or indeed of their very inclusion). For example, we see Johnny throwing a bag of money from a window, but by the time the reverse angle is included (as the gang listen to a radio account of what we've already seen), the shot seems bizarrely out of place. Similarly, certain scenes function almost autonomously, their own mini-narratives effectively unconnected to the larger scheme, which grows more tangled and opaque as Kubrick sketches in the details.Consider Randy's strikingly shot encounter with Leo, to whom he owes money, or Johnny's attempted seduction by Sherry, which ought to, but doesn't quite account for George's later eruption into violence, or the weird homosexual implications in Unger's abruptly expressed desire to leave with Johnny (to save him from the trap of marriage), which is totally odd and unmotivated. Strangest of all is the scene between Nikki, a hired sniper, and a black car-park attendant, where the latter's strangely embarrassing, insistent attentions are given an edge of racial tension which seems divorced from the suspense involved. The end result is that Johnny Clay is DISPLACED from the centre of his own world, not so much by an overriding sense of fate as by a wayward, darkly playful sense of narrative possibility. The final circumstances leading to the stolen money being thrown to the wind are at once so over-emphatic (the woman and her poodle), and so arbitrary, that Clay's shrugged response seems the only one possible: "Eh, what's the difference?" Indeed, in a film where dead horses become vengeful "lucky horse shoes", and Nikki's "dog shaped" practise targets becomes the poodle that spill's Clay money, one can't help but sympathise with poor Johnny. The guy is trapped in a cruel, wicked universe.And so Clay's closing remark (like Alice's "f*ck" at the end of Eyes Wide Shut) highlights an important change. Clay has been broken, reshaped and re-moulded. He has evolved from a meticulous, striving and all controlling man, to one of inaction and passive acceptance. This version of fatalism, of course, is known as defeatism.10/10 - A brisk noir, filled with precise camera work and punchy storytelling. The only flaw is a rather abrasive, bug eyed femme fatale.The film has also been quite influential. Bars (the kind found on prison windows) are a ever-present motif, and the Coens would incorporate a similar device in "Fargo". Similarly, Tarantino has cited "The Killing's" flashback narrative as an influence on "Reservoir Dogs". Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There are some things, my dear Fisher, which do not bear much looking into"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Kubrick's third film, and generally agreed to be his first really good one. It's a heist-gone-wrong noir along similar lines to John Huston's Asphalt Jungle (which also starred Sterling Hayden) and Jules Dassin's Rififi.Kubrick obviously still had a long way to go in developing his style. In terms of shot composition, editing and camera movement he takes a very standard, by-the-book approach in The Killing. Not necessarily a bad approach ? just nothing striking. But The Killing's strengths are in its substance, not its style. It bears little similarity to the poetic weirdness of Kubrick's better known later films, but is still directed with intelligence.There is a methodical line to the narrative, mirroring the piece-by-piece construction of the racetrack robbery. At the beginning each character is introduced one at a time in a series of fast-paced scenes, showing their individual troubles and weaknesses, while an authoritative voice-over details times and places. Then, the pace and mood change, becoming less frantic but with more underlying menace, when Sherry Peatty (Marie Windsor) goes to blab details of the robbery to her young lover (Vince Edwards). Putting this scene out of sync with the previous ones highlights the fact that this is the unexpected factor which brings the whole plan into disarray.Throughout the picture it is made clear that, in spite of all his detailed planning, Sterling Hayden's character fails because he forgets to be a professional ? buying a cheap suitcase, working with amateurs who end up giving the game away. This lack of professionalism is also reinforced symbolically. For example, during the robbery he wears a clown mask to disguise his face.This was a cheap production ? the sets and lighting are extremely minimalist. Kubrick continually turned this to his advantage, especially the single-source lighting. In one scene, where gang-leader Sterling Hayden explains the robbery plans to his accomplices his face is illuminated when he leans in towards the others, becoming a dark silhouette when he sits back.Sterling Hayden is good, as usual, but his performance here doesn't rank alongside his appearances in, say, Asphalt Jungle or Dr Strangelove. This isn't Elisha Cook Jr.'s best performance either. He speaks his lines flatly and without pace. The only really memorable performances are, ironically perhaps, those of the gang's two hired accomplices. Underrated character actor Timothy Carey breezes through his the role a laid back Italian hit-man who cradles a cat in his arms while talking over the business of killing. Better still is professional wrestler Kola Kwariami's turn as a chess-playing heavy who imparts philosophical wisdom with the same level of believability with which he throws cops to the floor.The Killing will probably come as a surprise to anyone who only knows the Kubrick of Clockwork Orange and The Shining. However one characteristic which is consistent throughout his films is his supporting cast of quirky minor characters. This, coupled with the quick pace, make this an unusually breezy and watchable film noir. I'm not personally a big fan of film noir, but this is one of my favourites in the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick directed this slick heist film early in his career, and it stands as one of the most exciting of the many crime thrillers released during the 1950s.Our friend Quentin Tarantino owes much to this film. Anyone who thinks Tarantino invented the gimmick of telling a story through topsy-turvy chronology should watch this to see how much this movie had to have influenced "Jackie Brown" and "Reservoir Dogs." Stylish black and white photography (which includes some trademark Kubrick Steadicam shots) add much to this film's atmosphere. Watch and enjoy.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Killing' is one of those movies that doesn't fool around with anything in the movie. Hell, the movie isn't even a hour and a half long! The tight 85 minute long movie moves so fast that it doesn't bother explaining one thing again.'The Killing' of course like all Kubrick movies, was based on a book 'A Clean Break'. The movie is classic noir. The story is about a heist at the horse track, the deal is an inside job with employees at the horse track, and to mix it up, there's a woman involved 'with a dollar sign where most women have a heart!' - Johnny Clay 'The Killing'.The movie is directed VERY well. Not one error in the movie. And to top it off, the novelist Jim Thompson does the voice-over narration! The movie is so good that I find myself watching it over, and over, and over, again! To say there's a mistake in the movie, is a lie! 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can call in Film Noir. I refer to it as a "downer" movie that grabs you early and doesn't let go. It is original and timeless. It could be shown twenty years from now and called a "period piece." The cast is as good as casts got back then. Timothy Carey is superb, as usual. (See him in "One Eyed Jacks" and "Paths of Glory.") A career criminal, dower and stern Sterling Hayden, plans an intricate robbery of a California race track. His plan is flawless. The character who plays Marie Windsor's henpecked hubby, Elisha Cook, tries to quiet her harping by bragging about the upcoming caper. She tells her lover who tries to hijack the loot. But what brings Hayden down right at the edge of his getaway are a yapping, runaway dog and a cheap suitcase. Spectacular ending. Don't swallow any downer pills while watching this. It could bring on a serious overdose. A movie you won't forget and will recommend to friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film, But Heist Not Well Planned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the group can't get together towards the end of the film, to divide up the money, Sterling Hayden's character has not planned very well at all for such a contingency. He is not prepared with something to carry the money around in, just in case. The idea that he would buy a crummy old suitcase from a pawn shop is pretty lame. Once he sees it won't lock, he should find another way to transport the money. This is still a very fine effort by Kubrick, with all the cutting back and forth in time and in aspect of the different characters. The viewer can still keep up with the plot, as complicated as it is. Interesting to note that he cast Hayden again a few years later as General Jack Ripper in Dr. Strangelove.I'm not sure if that's a spoiler, so I clicked the box just in case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imagine "The Killing" if it were remade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing is the ultimate movie time capsule. If it were to be remade, think about how it would turn out:First, cast Tom Cruise as Johnny Clay for box-office protection. Cruise, as usual, would never change expressions except when flashing his famous smile. One can see him pumping his fist in the air (and smiling) when he's got the $2 mil. Then add Kim Basinger as the sluttish Sherry Peatty, Crispin Glover as George Peatty, and Kevin Bacon as Marvin Unger.Then, of course, add lots of needless explosions - such as blowing up the horse instead of shooting it. Show the dead horse and jockey flying into midair, in slow motion, from the resulting fireball. Also, have the Vince Edwards character come in with a flame thrower instead of a shotgun - then show Randy the cop, Mike the bartender and Marvin the accountant trying to scramble out of the room before the fire hits - in slow motion of course. They don't make it, naturally.That said, I can't agree with the last reviewer's assessment of the film from 9-2-03. Yes, there are some plot holes, and the narration was corny and unnecessary, but this was 1956, not 2003. A 2003 film would have every aspect meticulously explained, and all of the rest as listed above, and be boring as hell, which the Kubrick film isn't.The structure of the film was unusual, and added to the impact of the film. The charcters were well defined and were portrayed well by all involved. Much has been commented on by others about the work of Sterling Hayden, Marie Windsor, Tim Carey and Elsiha Cook - all were excellent, especially Carey - but I think Jay C. Flippen, Ted DeCorsia and Joe Sawyer were equally good. All were respected character actors of that time and are familiar faces to old movie buffs. DeCorsia, in particular, personifies a New York-style flatfooted cop.I agree with those who think Johnny Clay was stupid not to get a decent suitcase, and even more foolish to let the money go on the plane. But with roadblocks probably being set up all over the place, what could he do? And how could he know the others would get killed, forcing him to keep all the money? You know he won't get away with the crime, so something had to trip it up.One scene not mentioned in most reviews is the scene where Maurice, the wrestler hired by Johnny to keep the cops busy, goes into the racetrack lounge to do just that. The moment where he flips two cops into somersaults, one with each arm, was great. Also, when a bottle is broken over his head from behind, he swats aside that person as one would brush away a fly, sending him sprawling across the room.All in all, despite some flaws, I would give this film an 8.5 out of 10. It holds your attention from start to finish, something most of today's films can't do. Let's just hope this one doesn't get remade, a la The Getaway, D.O.A., and others of this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shades of Reservoir Dogs - but only faint ones; and the music is ANNOYING!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS FROM THE OFF: Essentially The Killing is about a racetrack heist that (eventually) goes wrong, but you know that from the panic-stricken mockumentary style voice-over the minute it begins. It succeeds in making you wait for the somewhat disappointing, corny ending. And it's a pretty stylish heist movie, but it's also half-baked: whether Kubrick ran out of time, cash or patience, the whole film is a lot less good than it might have been.The grizzled, unglamorous actors playing the gang work well, and Nikki and the Russian, the scariest two, seem to have been cast for their authentic speech difficulties; the plan seems to be a good one, and the attempted rip-off by the really bad guys at the end is a nice complication. There are time-jumps in the narrative that reminded me strongly of Reservoir Dogs, though in The Killing they begin to seem put in just to preserve the feel of a dramatic newsreel report, and become unnecessarily confusing. The success of the actual heist is threatened by the obvious-to-anyone-but her-husband no-good girlfriend of the inside man at the racetrack, and it's good that the story unfolds in an unexpected (and 'modern' non-linear way).I can put up with directorial indulgence for a good story, but three things spoiled The Killing for me - 1) the dreadful soundtrack which is a kind of bebop stream of consciousness that runs all the way though in a nonsensical, irritating fashion, 2) the somewhat pathetic ending which asks more questions that it answers about how stupid Johny Clay really was, and 3) Sterling Hayden's uncharismatic turn as the anti-hero, a kind of poor man's Fred MacMurray. Had Robert Mitchum been given a crack at this - no doubt he'd have been too expensive in 1956 - and maybe Marilyn Monroe as the flawed floozie, the style of the movie might have triumphed over the shortcomings of the script and Kubrick's aim of making a splash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even from the start, it was obvious that Kubrick was a genius. The screenplay, the direction, and most of all the camera angles are just amazing. What could've been an ordinary heist story is turned into a masterpiece and Kubrick would go on to even better things from here. "The Killing" is certainly not his technical masterpiece, but for me it ranks with "A Clockwork Orange" as my personal favorite from him. I'd rank it with "Touch of Evil" in fact as the finest film noir ever made. Its also the greatest heist film ever made.One of the things that makes the film work so well outside of the script and the direction is the acting. This is one of the most perfectly assembled casts caught on film, each actor at the height of their abilities. They manage to deliver the hard-boiled dialog and play noir stock characters with conviction. Sure, they may be a bit clichéd but its the best use of the clichés in a film noir. Sterling Hayden is tough yet a great leader. The final scene just adds amounts of depth to his portrayal. Marie Windsor is simply put the most unlikable femme fatale and Elisha Cook Jr. is superb at playing her annoyingly nebbish husband. Vince Edwards is very cool as Windsor's lover but I kind of wished he had a bigger part. Jay C. Flippen turns in an emotionally powerful mentor to Hayden. Plus, my favorite actor Timothy Carey gives a memorable performance as a too cool hired gun.If there is one thing that prevents the film from being a complete masterpiece, it has to be the narration. Added at the studio's insistence, it is both distracting and confusing to the action on screen. Its delivered in an overused "Dragnet" style. Luckilly, you become too caught up in the story to pay too much attention to. This is the best heist film ever made with an ingenious screenplay. Any fans of noir or gangster pictures must see this!

This was definitely NOT one of them. I really don't get it - what do people find so appealing about this film? I think people are just raving about it now because it's one of Kubrick's first. I'm a fan of Kubrick's work. Hated this one. First of all, you can't tell it's his work - there's no feel to it. Maybe that's exactly because it was one of his earliest films.The characters seem cut out of cardboard. Absolutely two-dimensional.We know almost NOTHING about them except for the roles they each play in the upcoming heist - this one's gonna shoot so-and-so, that one's gonna create a diversion, etc, etc... There's nothing that makes you like them or hate them or whatever. By the end, I really didn't give a crap whether the robbery would work out or not. And the plot is brilliant, some say? WHY?? It's almost moronic! It's a simple robbery and the plan has such obvious holes it's ridiculous.(*** possible spoilers ahead ***) The ending is good? Not sure why. Sure, it's not your typical-garden-variety-Hollywood-wishy-washy-happy-ending. But it's certainly not original or completely unexpected.The narrator is annoying. And unnecessary.If you're looking for a good robbery or heist movie, check out The Sting, The Score, Heist. FAR better in all aspects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fluttering with Reveille!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is often times referred to as the greatest director ever in the history of Hollywood.. Certainly, his name is in the same breath with Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Copola, Milos Foreman, Mike Nichols, Woody Allen, Oliver Stone, Alfred Hitchcock, Frank Capra and John Ford!! So, the bottom line is that he is up there with the stellar directors of the silver screen!! Some of Kubrick's works are an unprecedented compendium of emotionally pejorative images which wind up leaving the movie audience spellbound!! Inevitably, it is a critically acclaimed assumption that what "2001 Space Odyssey" achieved for technological theatrics; and what "Dr Strangelove" achieved as a succinct satire depicting the nuclear Holocaust; and what "Clockwork Orange" achieved for creative depravity, and what "Eyes Wide Shut" (For which, Kubrick became the posthumous recipient of many noteworthy accolades) achieved for the recognition of the formidable foe of perdition, "The Killing" unabashedly achieved for the intellectual itemization of a mystery!! "The Killing" emanates a compilation of Kubrick's subsequent movies by incorporating an intense artistic innovation with an aggregate moral debasement of the main characters in the film!! The elements of human pitfalls in this movie homogenize into a dark comedy. Such aspects of dramatic identification are what Kubrick is so brilliant at illustrating!! Saying that this movie is sensational is a masterpiece of understatement!!When larceny has a sibilant overtone to it, it is a lethargic knee jerk reaction to blame the victim's environment!! It later becomes a run of the mill motive to take the issue of pecuniary remuneration into your own hands! What afflicted the mentality of the lone rebel philosophy in this movie was the myriad of interpretations to such a fate. The despicable human intensity to the characters in this film is absolutely uncanny! A prevailing avariciousness for the overall plot of this movie purports a very visceral form of callousness. The cerebral tenacity to consummating the plot in this film evoked a calculated fervor which is almost an ancient relic in the cinema today!! Fuscillades of fire, building pieces, and blood, so frequently replace heartfelt and esoteric expressions which are displayed commensurately with the numerous facets of an enormous number of perpetually dis allowable academic concepts!! I can be bamboozled with high tech gimmickry as much as the next person, but, let's have a little balance, at least a 10 to 1 ratio would be nice!! The movie "The Killing" became a film which was a précis of egregious and deliberate subtlety, especially when it is compared to the insightful exaggerations of an Alfred Hitchcock film...Made right around the time of "Rear Window" "The Killing" sparked an interest which was pertinent to a dialectic perspective of some malcontent's yearning for vindication!! At the same time, these nefarious situations in "The Killing" propagated an ultimate philosophy of, right or wrong, these were the existing circumstances!!Being a mystery, I cannot delve into the sordid details of this film without ruining the surprise ending!! I will say that the finalization to this film which wound up being a metaphorically resonating fulguration of fluttering debris, was utterly FABULOUS! The ending to this film is considered one of the top 20 endings of any American movie made whatsoever! One more thing, it is very possible that a seven pound dog should have been offered a lucrative job with the F.B.I! Stanley Kubrick comes through on this picture, as it is a harbinger of things to come with his directorial genius!! Not only is the directing spectacular in "The Killing", but also, the acting, filming and innovative plot to this movie are all emphatically first rate! Please see this film!! A perfect 10!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...but there's really no way to spoil this gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no way to reveal too much about this story line, because it gives itself away purposefully right from the beginning. It was made in the 1950's, when "crime didn't pay." The fact that there's a narrator (reminiscent of not only Dragnet, but also the "Gang Busters" radio series preceding it) describing events subtly suggests that these scofflaws didn't get away with it. In the final analysis, none of that matters, nor does it diminish the suspense or the greatness of the story-telling. The "hook" is not in whether they got away or not, but how they TRIED to get away with it. Criticisms that there are errors in the plan for the heist are misguided. The obvious problems with parts of the plan just play into the realism of the story. These guys aren't Nobel-prize winners, they're just two-bit hoods trying to make a score that's way out of their league. On top of that, this is probably the best cast of any of the "film-noir" movies. Sterling Hayden is solid, as always; Elisha Cook Jr. and Marie Windsor simply "cook", and Jay C. Flippen gives a tremendously nuanced performance that belies his bulldog appearance. Not a single part (well, perhaps one) is overplayed -- even the "bartender with the sick wife" subplot is sensitive and realistic when it could easily have gone over the top into schmaltzy and maudlin.My only point-deduction was for the slightly bungled part of the Greek wrestler recruited to cause a disturbance at the track. The fact that his shirt ripped readily into halves was just a little to much homage to the then-burgeoning field of professional wrestling.One amazing part of this film, in my opinion, that hasn't received much mention in other reviews, is the poignant interplay between Tim Carey's borderline psychotic sharpshooter and James Edward's African-American parking lot attendant. I thought Kubrick did an excellent job, in that brief scene, of highlighting the injustice of the racial disparity prevalent in this country at the time. Both men were war veterans, and both had been marred (one mentally and the other physically), so there was at least a potential connection between them. The pitiful reaction of Edward's character to Carey's faux kindness was heartbreaking. I can't think of a more incisive harbinger of the social unrest that followed in the 60's.This is a fabulous film and shouldn't be missed by any fan of either Kubrick or 1950's crime dramas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A solid noirish caper movie, this film is constantly given just a bit more credit than it warrants. This is probably due to its director, whose unimpeachable reputation among college students was fomented by strikingly photographed psychedelic juvenelia like 2001 and A Clockwork Orange. Told in an occasionally clumsy non linear manner, the Killing is considered groundbreaking and daring by anyone who's never seen Jules Dassin's Rififi (it's in French, which would explain it.)Still, it has a lot going for it. Kubrick is a noir true beleiver, and has quite an eye for unsettling detail. Sterling Hayden was one of the 1950s most underrated actors (check him out two years earlier in Nicholas Ray's Johnny Guitar), and his performance here is quite effective. The film's pacing is a bit odd, and it's obvious that Kubrick was still learning to direct.Ultimately, it's a reasonably inventive genre picture, no masterpeice of the genre like Orson Welles' "Touch of Evil" would be two years later. Kubrick made better films in the years to come, not the least of which was his next one, Paths of Glory. But he also did a lot worse. A good rental for Kubrick fans and film noir aficionados.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing is just a sequence of absurdities and coincidences.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before telling anything about this movie I will not refrain from saying that "Full Metal Jacket" is really the only movie I really loved by Kubrick. Other than that I find "Eyes Wides Shut" a bit sophisticated and worth pondering upon but I always found something I hated in his other movies.I think what people should look for in heist stories is that how much they really look "realistic". Maturity or immaturity is not what the real problem that one should discuss in such a story like some IMDb users are doing on the board of this movie. When you first watch the movie which limns the efforts of a heist man named Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) and an assembled team to rob a racetrack you notice the non-linear movie style and the multiple story like sequences which you appreciate for the movie's time.One may notice this better if she/he sees newer movies like Pulp Piction before seeing movies like The Killing.Being a pioneer of non-linear movie style does not make this movie a perfect work of perfectionist Kubrick. Even if Johnny tries to trick the shooter for example by telling ""that's not first degree murder, in fact it's not murder at all, in fact I don't know what it is." a sharp shooter like him is supposed to be more smart than that and should not jump onto it.After all his hesitation to run away or not-panicking after the shooting does not really make sense if he really swallowed the bait that horse killing is not a first degree murder.If he really bought why did he try to run in the first place? The second is even if Johnny was in a hurry and when he bought the bag he may not have thought to check out the lock but he should not have put the money in such large case and go away with it in a plane.If he were a perfect planner,which he is in the movie,he should not have done that so all we could ever say it was just a coincidence? What else...Why does the dog start to get uneasy at the drop of a hat and why does the suitcase open so easily? Last but not least what is that admiration over Sherry? She is ugly,masculine,and sulky.Her husband was a sort of insecure guy so it is understandable why he calls her pretty but why does her longtime paramour admire her? You could name a long list of questions that may lead to answers in this Kubrickian movie.The Killing is just a sequence of absurdities and coincidences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick's first "very good" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who considers Stanley Kubrick one of the greatest directors who ever lived, 'The Killing' is not one of his very best (his masterpiece being '2001').This said, 'The Killing' is a big step up from the still solid if flawed 'Killer's Kiss' and especially the very poor (for me his only misfire) 'Fear and Desire', which only had the camera work and use of light and shadow going for it.My only two complaints with 'The Killing' are with the ending and the narration. The ending was rather rushed and anti-climactic, ending on too much of an abrupt note. The narration poses more of a problem, apparently it was forced into the film and the tacky execution really shows, it is annoyingly cheesy, over-explanatory and overused and the film would have fared much better without it like Kubrick intended.However, 'The Killing' looks great, complete with brilliantly evocative camera work/cinematography, atmospheric use of light and shadow and suitably claustrophobic sets. The music score is a marked improvement over the music scores for 'Fear and Desire' and 'Killer's Kiss', it's not perfect with parts that are a bit too loud and intrusive but here it is not inappropriately jaunty, it has its haunting and tense moments without being too obvious and unlike 'Fear and Desire' it doesn't sound like a bad Bernard Hermann imitation.Also significantly improved is the dialogue, excepting the narration. Here the script is witty and deliciously sardonic, providing some really enjoyable chemistry between the characters and actors. Kubrick directs with a masterly touch, with much more of his own style coming through (one can say that he had not found it with 'Fear and Desire', was starting to find it with 'Killer's Kiss' and found it with 'The Killing). The story is ground-breakingly non-linear but tightly paced and with some genuine suspenseful tension and moving poignancy.Of a strong cast, yet another big improvement, standing out are Sterling Hayden, Marie Windsor and Elisha Cook Jnr, who are all excellent in roles perfectly tailored for them.In summary, while not one of Kubrick's best (he went on to do even better, with his first masterpiece being 'Paths of Glory') it is his first "very good" film. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guys And Dames Eh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We want to make good movies, and make them cheap. The two are not incompatible" - Stanley Kubrick.The first of a collaboration with Producer James B. Harris, "The Killing" is Kubrick's first movie with actual financial backing from the studio United Artists (Everything prior was financed by Kubrick and his family). He was 28 at the time of the movies release, and it continues to hold up incredibly well for a cheap, heist movie (Reportedly Quentin Tarantino said it was very influential when it came to his 1992 debut "Reservoir Dogs", both of which use non-linear time-lines). Though its praise was high, the movie unfortunately bombed at the box office. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer however, was so impressed with the film they offered Kubrick-Harris $75,000 to write, direct and produce the spectacular "Paths of Glory" (1957).Based on the novel "Clean Break" by Lionel White, a thief plans to commit one last daring heist before retirement and marry his lover. With his crew assembled, one of them reveals the plans to his wife, who has also made significant plans of her own.The Killing's cinematography is certainly memorable with its larger sets that gets filled with extras when things all come to a head. I bring the cinematography up because of the infamous tale when Lucien Ballard moved a camera against Kubrick's wishes, almost leading to Ballard's firing. The music particularly excels, the scenarios and failures of communication between men still leave an impression and even though Sterling Hayden remains the best actor in the movie, the scene where wrestler Kola Kwariani (Who was also Kubrick's old chess friend) fights off a series of policeman, shirt ripped and all could possibly remain the best overall scene of the movie.Final Verdict: "The Killing" remains one of those old movies that I grow more and more fond of when reminiscing particular moments. Certain scenes dash hopes, but in a tale of greed ever player gets his overall comeuppance. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film noir. The Killing was directed by Stanley Kubrick; starring Sterling Hayden (Johnny Clay), Colleen Gray (Fay and Vince Edwards.The movie is about a criminal who is scheming a plan to rob about two million dollars from a racetrack. The heist will involve several characters. Himself, a corrupted office, a betting teller and a sharpshooter. The heist itself is successful. However, a few pay the price with their lives. But does Johnny find a happy ending with the money and the girl of his dreams?

		<fullReview>The Killing is a thrilling film about a robbery at a horse track. The story is really interested around the men involved in the heist, they are all different in personality and the job they have. I liked this because they aren't predictable. Another thing I enjoyed is how the story is told at different times and shows what each charter is doing during the job as another situation is happening. I thought the ending was great too, with all the money blowing away was great because it movie wasn't really all about the money and more the job and people around it, so I also liked that. Everyone's performance was well done and Kubrick did a great job and this one is another one of his classics that should get more attention. The Killing gets an 8/10.</fullReview>

Just only now ..... I saw The Killing (1956) by Stanley Kubrick. Those trailers must have based themselves on THE KILLING.

		<fullReview>The Killing was not one of my favorite Kubrick films. The film tells the story of a group of criminals who plan to rob a racetrack. I did not find many of the films characters to be fully fleshed out and did not form much of an attachment to them. The highlight and most interesting aspect of the film was the heist scene, which builds up tension and suspense by showing each stage of the plan work in action. The resolution to the film also stands out as the stolen money is accidentally compromised and the lead criminal is caught. It is also interesting to note that the film is quite similar to a film noir by sharing many of their qualities, but can not exactly be considered to be one. While this is not the greatest Kubrick film, it is still worth checking out to someone interested in Kubrick's older work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing was a B-rate film when it was released in 1956. although it was a low budget film it was a major success helped shape the genre what we now call Inde-films.It roughly followed the outline of a film noire without any of the film aspects of lighting and use of shadows. This film did have a fem-fatal however and a down on his luck man who gets tricked into going along with a plan to kill a race horse and win big with the bets that they placed beforehand. He did not want to we big so he could live a nice easy life though. He wanted to win so his girlfriend would finally be satisfied with him because all she wanted was money and material items and it is this that also helps tie it back to the film noire's that were popular in the 1940's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I was excited to see this Kubrick film. I am a huge fan of some of his later work, so needless to say I was curious to some of his early exploits. This film, to be honest, is confusing. I understood the multiple events leading up the the crime, but overall, everything felt it was a little too hectic, especially initially after the robbery. A few moments later, I was able to piece together what had just occurred, but this film will really make you think about what you just saw, and make you wonder what else is going on. Despite my confusion, I still enjoyed the movie. I don't think I would classify this as a film noir, but it is definitely darker than I imagined it would be after I picked up on the plot. The only way that you can decide on a film is by watching it yourself, which is my best advice to someone who was curious about this film.</fullReview>

Soon after they reacquaint themselves he tells her that he has to go away for a few days to do something. That something was an idea to rob a race track of it's money, to do so he needed a lot of help. He was able to put together a little team : a friend of his that would cause a distraction, a bookie that would get him inside the building, another bookie that would opening the money room, and a police officer that would pickup and take the money away. The guys successful do everything that was plan but gets killed.

		<shortDescription>The First Masterpiece from the Director Who Changed Cinema Forever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ingenious work of filmmaking &amp; a memorable example of film-noir, The Killing is Stanley Kubrick's breakthrough feature that showcases many potentials of a filmmaker who would later go on to cement his legacy as arguably the greatest director of all time. Modest in budget yet uncompromising with its subject matter, The Killing experiments with many aspects, especially the manner in which its plot is structured &amp; narrated as well as the characterization of its finely-scripted characters.The plot concerns a veteran criminal who masterminds a heist of millions of dollars from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. Joining him in the plan are a crooked cop, a betting window teller &amp; a track bartender plus a wrestler &amp; a sharpshooter brought in to cause distraction for the robbery to take place. But when the manipulative wife of the teller is able to extract out this secret from her husband &amp; later reveals it all to her lover, it sets in motion a chain of events that goes terribly wrong in the end for all of them.Kubrick's direction presents a significant maturity compared to his previous feature &amp; begins his unprecedented run of delivering one influential cinematic jewel after another. The script too deserves a mention for its non-linear chronology &amp; different character perspectives to tell its story. The camera work is very fluid yet expertly controlled, editing is carried out in a steady manner &amp; music makes its presence felt in the vital moments. Lastly, the performances by its cast led by Sterling Hayden is pretty convincing with Elisha Cook Jr. &amp; Marie Windsor standing out as the teller &amp; his wife, respectively.On an overall scale, The Killing is Kubrick's first masterpiece that commercially bombed at the box-office at its time of release but over the decades has built a cult following that's only going to get stronger as the years pass by. An unforgettable work of film-noir, its contribution to cinema cannot be understated plus since Kubrick accomplished even more remarkable feats in his future films, The Killing remains one of his most underrated films as well as one of his most enjoyable works. If you have been postponing it for long, like I did, then delay it no more &amp; just go for this equally amazing &amp; amusing cinema. You can thank me later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hard boiled and more than a little ironic, Stanley Kubrick's great heist film has rightly become a classic. Sterling Hayden leads a motley group of small time crooks bent on robbing a race track. Kubrick bends time (keeping within a few short days) to let this masterpiece of film noir unfold. Hayden, so good in the earlier ASPHALT JUNGLE, is excellent and the supporting cast is stellar: Elisha Cook Jr.; Timothy Carey; Vince Edwards; Coleen Gray. Ted de Corsia plays a crooked cop and Joe Turkel (soon to become a Kubrick regular) is "Tiny." Best of all is fish-faced Marie Windsor as Cook's duplicitous wife. She's a quintessential noir bad girl, the kind of dame that would sell her mother for a piece of fudge. The dialog was written in part by Jim Thompson and it feels very much like it's out of one his pulp novels. Filmed in some seedy sections of southern California. Audacious and thoroughly entertaining.</fullReview>

So well done. Must watch. Many times. I cannot believe as another reviewer noted Kubrik directed this in his twenties.If anything was a draw back -- I would say was the music which was kind of dull and could have been better positioned just to support the suspense.

		<fullReview>Those who know this film don't need neither an introduction to it nor a need to hear yet even more praise for it. But here goes. Stanley Kubrick has made with "The Killing," not only one of the best examples of film noir, but quite possibly the best ever. And, that's saying something, considering the examples of film noir at its best, such as The Set-Up, Sudden Fear and The Narrow Margin, which coincidentally stars one of this film's stars Marie Windsor. And, that's not even counting many other great ones. But the list starts with this heist of a horse racetrack with all that money. Sterling Hayden is the mastermind of the heist, who has been in stir and vows not to go back. Coleen Gray is his girl. And, the film contains quite a cast, including Marie Windsor (dubbed the Queen of the 'B' movies,) Elisha Cook, Jr., Vince Edwards, Jay C. Flippen and Jay Adler. A crooked cop is needed, of course. Someone shooting a horse and someone causing a fight are both diversions and part of this elaborate plan. Watching everyone talk calmly yet firm heightens this very taut and action-packed little film. I say little because it's only 85 minutes. But what a wallop! If anyone stands out among all the actors, it's Marie Windsor, who delivers her lines with vinegar but very subtly. If you're a fan of film noir and you've missed this one, your film noir badge should be stripped off you. Find it now! They're killing me, and I love it! Let the chips fall where they may.</fullReview>

Likable to many film noirs in that it is very dark and cold. I especially liked when they were brawling in the bar . The movie got kinda boring sometimes and I would find myself nodding off just in time for something more interesting to happen.

		<fullReview>The Killing, by legendary director Stanley Kubrick, is an engrossing if conventional noir thriller. It's about a man that sets up one last heist in an elaborate scheme involving multiple subjects with various parts. The film creates some terrific suspense and has a visual style that's simple but appealing. The acting all round is pretty strong, though no one really goes that much beyond what their required to for the plot.When watching the movie I was waiting for Kubrick's unconventionality of storytelling, but other that a small non-linear sequence I never really saw it. It, probably along with Lolita, is the most straightforward film I have seen from him. It's about what it's about: schemes and intrigue, double-crossing and violence. It was the early bloom of a director that became masterful, but at this point he had yet to be in his prime or really discover his style. Still, The Killing is more than worth watching because as entertainment and suspense it does its job very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What's the use of kicking, Leo? You wouldn't believe it anyway."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How often do people actually seek out the early works of well-known directors? Are fans of a certain director actually interested in seeing absolutely everything in their filmography? Answering these questions is probably easier with a movie lover in mind, but is a bit more difficult if you consider a casual moviegoer. A director like Stanley Kubrick is best known for films like A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and The Shining, but Kubrick dabbled in crime and film-noir long before he gained any recognition from anyone. The Killing is just that; film-noir that is one of Kubrick's first full-length features before he was ever even a blip on the radar.One of the more intriguing aspects of The Killing is that it features a nonlinear narrative. It's told out of chronological order. A good portion of both Quentin Tarantino's and Christopher Nolan's résumés are filled with nonlinear films. The story takes something simple and puts a slightly complicated spin on it. The film revolves around a robbery at a racetrack, which sounds straightforward enough. The way The Killing gets you to that point is something unique though. You're continuously strung along as Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) masterminds this elaborate plan that takes more than half the film just to set up and get all the right people together. There is so much riding on the plan going right and such an emphasis on the money everyone is going to receive if they pull it off that you expect something bad to happen when it finally comes time for everyone to play their part. The film gives you all the players up front though. All the cards are on the table as far as whose involved is concerned, but the robbery and its aftermath is where the payoff truly lies.It was interesting being able to see a character walk through a house in one continuous shot without walls obstructing our view. The ability to go through walls thanks to the way the sets were built gives you an interesting perspective. There's also another scene where George (Elisha Cook Jr) is first shown talking to his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor). They re-locate themselves several times during the scene in the same room, but the camera is always strategically placed to make you feel like you're sitting right next to them and actively part of their conversation. The digital restoration can probably take credit for this, but I don't think I've ever seen a film this old look this good. The film may be lacking color, but it's still crisp and clear. The lighting is fantastic, especially in the scene where the clown mask comes into play during the robbery.I've always had this thing about gangsters. I think a lot of people do otherwise gangster movies and the crime genre in general wouldn't be as popular as it is. But that cliché gangster voice is just incredibly entertaining to me. It just reminds me of Rocky and Mugsy from "Looney Tunes." The Killing is filled with guys that talk like that and it's incredible. The narration just made it feel all the more genuine, which is odd since apparently Kubrick hated adding the narration into the film. That criminal atmosphere just speaks to you in ways other films don't. There's quite a bit of dialogue in the film that does the same. It'll probably sound dated to most, but that's the way gangsters should sound. "Standin' outside the door measuring the keyhole," and "That's a pretty head you got on your shoulders. You wanna keep it there or carry it around in your hands?" are things you'd never hear anyone say these days.As Johnny Clay first has everyone gathered and they're discussing the plan for the robbery, there's this big round table discussion. It's littered with booze, chain-smoking, and wise guys getting slapped in the face. It's fantastic. But the way the scene is filmed, the way it makes you feel like you have to lean this way or the other to see around somebody else's head to get a glimpse of whoever's talking, is very reminiscent of the war room scenes in Dr. Strangelove.The Killing isn't going to change your mind on what your favorite Stanley Kubrick film is. It will, however, reveal that Kubrick had a unique vision of cinema even when he was first starting out. With a compelling cast, an engrossing story, and a straightforward but completely satisfying conclusion, The Killing is incredibly solid from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Killing is among Stanley Kubrick's lesser known films. 'Over the years since 'The Killing', many have attempted to recreate the magic by copying it or drawing inspiration or whatever other term one would like to use. One popular example is Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs'. However, they failed to reach Kubrick's level of cinematic achievement. The atmosphere, dialogue, tension, humour and suspense come together brilliantly in this little film. It has a more modest look in terms of execution and budget compared to Kubrick's other films but 'The Killing' has a very noire style to it with his signature execution. Told in a non-linear fashion the tension is well built and suspense maintained right till the very surprising ironic end. The drama too is effective as it depicts a dark yet human side of the characters while keeping the viewer involved. The dialogues are loaded with wit and humour. The cinematography, soundtrack and lighting are first rate. The cast does a great job. Sterling Hayden is good as the criminal hero. Marie Windsor and Elisha Cook Jr. are brilliant. While many have found the narration to be irritating, I quite enjoyed it. On an end note, Kubrick's 'The Killing' is a cool little movie. It's the real deal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inventive structure and compelling action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enigmatic director Stanley Kubrick's The Killing(1956) was ahead of it's time in terms of structure and content. One of the first American heist films, it's low budget, B-movie status allowed it to escape the attention of Hays Code enforcers and create a model for many films that would follow it's lead still more than half a century later. The film moves crisply through the scenes and the ensemble cast keeps the pace moving with steady and believable performances. The tone of the film is very dark and the audience has a sense throughout that the heist is not going to end well. Kubrick's filmmaking skills are on display in spades but the script and the story fall short of his later more meaningful films but how much meaning do you really want in a heist film anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Perfect Crime" Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Killing" directed by Stanley Kubrick is a great heist movie and is an incredible crime thriller in variety of aspects. The variety of characters in the film ultimately contribute to what makes "The Killing" a great film. Every face brings a different kind of personality which is made even better as every character has a role in the crime to some degree. The subplot with Sherry's plan to make off with all of the money by intervening with someone's scheme adds a needed depth to the film that makes it more enjoyable. The efficiency of which the robbery comes together is remarkable. The way in which each character has their own story and role in the robbery only makes the film more complex and entertaining. The grittiness of the film and the tense moments leave every point in the film feeling significant and necessary. traditional noir camera work makes an appearance in the film and ultimately enhances the mood of the film and makes it appear more dark and criminal. Essentially "The Killing" is a remarkable crime thriller whose entertainment value and quality makes it a classic and very significant even when compared to modern films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely brilliant. From the very beginning until the very end, it proves to be a story that is exciting and meticulously planned, the kind of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I like the way it jumps back and forth, slowly building up to the moment of truth: the killing. The noirish high contrast lighting is highly effective in setting the mood. Some scenes have only one lamp as a single light source. I liked the unexpected ending, but I was a little surprised that no one ended up getting the money. I guess this is just Stanley Kubrick's way of revealing the true significance of the story - that crime never pays off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the narrator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The structure and editing of The Killing is what obviously stands out the most, and it certainly is brilliant and works so well with the story. The audience gets to see how each piece of the heist is worked out from everyone's different point of view, which isn't only interesting and revealing, but builds a great deal of suspense. The camera work and lighting is perfect especially for the low budget, and the acting didn't particularly stand out, but was not what you'd find in a high budget blockbuster. I find all of that perfect because it gave the film a raw look which worked well with the story and editing. I've heard plenty of bad things about the narrator in this movie, but I found him to be one of my favorite parts. Although not completely necessary at all times, he kept the audience on track, and his delivery seemed to bring some comedy and a breather to the audience in between some intense scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still stands out in the industry today!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing was Stanley Kubrick's first successful full-length-film, and not soon did he begin his legendary career which was unprecedented ever since then.Multiple narrative lines is one of the advantages of the film. Frankly speaking, this is not the first time this narrative technique being used in movies, but they are nothing like this, which composed of different point of views by everyone participated in the robbery. Not according to ordinary time order, the omniscient narrator leads us to co-construct the plan with Johnny Clay step by step, and the robbery only began after we finally depict the whole story.Uncertainty and Greedy are two main issues in this robbery, and both of them implied Sherry the most likely spoiler. As a matter of fact, she actually met our expectation and got everyone except Johnny killed. Therefore, the robbery became the killing without anyone alive to spend the money, and how ironic is that? Unfortunately, the last chance to walk away with the money, Johnny, was too stupid to be busted at the airport for his lacking of patience and the obvious behavior as a criminal. However, I seriously doubt that the director will make the same ending if he got the chance to do it again.Like most films Stanley Kubrick made, The Killing demonstrated many skills and techniques in film making, but most important of all, it also possessed penetrating observations in humanity. The case in this film is between Sherry and her husband, and each time they chatted, the madness and greedy is so prominent and direct that I just can't help wondering why her husband won't leave her. However, things happened for a reason, maybe the human nature suggests that one should never love someone who is easy to get, and always admire those who are hard to chase.Though the movie is made in 1956, it still stands out in the industry today. Stanley Kubrick did not make too many movies, but each one gets extremely high evaluation, and that just makes Stanley Kubrick one of the greatest directors of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noir at it's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a film!I caught this on Netflix when I was looking for a crime caper. 'The Killing' is a tightly wound,fast paced thriller, with all the ingredients of a great noir film, but without the clichés. Sterling Hayden is an ex con who just got out of Alcatraz. With one last score before he goes straight, he assembles a crew to take down a racetrack on the day of it's biggest race. Oh sure, this movie has dames, and tough characters, but they do seem real. That's one of the things that makes this movie satisfying. Corrupt cops, cheating spouses, and guys looking for the good life all abound. But it's Sterling Hayden as Johnny that steals the show. Mean, tough and smart as a whip, he plans the heist to the smallest degree. But with everything so perfectly planned, can anything go wrong? Stanley Kubrick directed this thriller, (and it is a thriller!) with his usual panache, which is to say a non-linear storyline. This device really helps the story and puts all the pieces together for a wonderful film any fan of crime capers will love. Highly Recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember at some point watching a movie that had to do with or make mention of a robbery at a racetrack, but I just cant remember what it was. But the plot is different, you often watch movies where crooks are ripping off banks or fancy stores. But the whole race track thing was different and really interesting to me. So basically everybody's got their part to pull of the robbery, it almost has an Oceans Eleven feel. very suspenseful, held my interest, kept me wanting to know just what was ganna happen next. I think the acting throughout is just so so to be quite honest. The dynamics of the characters were very interesting though. Overall I think its definitely worth seeing, classic film noir(and one of the better ones that I've seen).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very eager to watch this film because I have enjoyed films by Stanley Kubrick before; such as "A Clockwork Orage" and "The Shining." And this film was no disappointment. This film was a great film noir. I greatly enjoyed the storyline of the robbery at the horse track. I was constantly on my toes and always wanting to know what happened next. I thought the characters played there roles really well. I felt as though I was watching real people, rather than people pretending to be someone else. Some of the scene changes were a bit confusing however. It would jump from the race track, to it suddenly being the next day. This is a film I would definitely enjoy to watch again and tie all of the loose ends together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Several Stories Playing at Once to Create One Larger Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is about a planned race track robbery that includes the parts of many different people. Without all these different people doing their parts, it would not be able to be done. With all of these different stories, you can see one man recruiting people to help pull off this heist and he is a very important man in the movie because of that. The movie plays and you see the part of each of the characters. This is especially seen during the Heist. In the movie, only a small window of time has passed but you see several different scenes with the different characters. At first the camera focuses on one character and finishes their scene, then the camera shifts to another character and focuses on what happened during the time of the first scene. This created a very unique feeling during the film that let you see everything that was going on in the movie and created it very enjoyable.</fullReview>

The plot has a really cool interesting crime plot that twists and turns.The other thing I thought was interesting was during parts of the film you would see the camera go past a door showing the door frame reviling the set, I do not think it was a mistake but just something different that I can not quite put my finger on. The most notable thing about this film was toward the end of the film after the shootout in the apartment there is this great first person long take walking through the apartment looking at all the carnage that took place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film really shows you how brilliant of a director Stanley Kubrick was. He knew what he was doing with the camera, with the actors, with the story. The man was perfection. He knows how the film should look and its brilliant here. Its tightly shot, it really puts you in the intensity of the situation but then he knows when to pull it back and to let you observe everything from a safe distance. The camera is used as an all seeing eye. He also knows not to overshadow the events of the story with ridiculous camera tricks but that doesn't mean the camera work here is boring and stale. Far from it actually, as I said, Kubrick was a master of the camera. Sterling Hayden is brilliant here, he is one of the most underrated actors in my opinion. Kubrick knew how to get effective performances here, of course there are the usual stiff old Hollywood style actors here they don't drag the film down. The only complaint I would make would be the narration, I know it fills us in on everything but it just gets distracting. This is a brilliantly intense film made by a genius film maker, this is Kubrick just getting warmed up</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing was a very dramatic film noir and I felt as though it was more of a modern film compared to others during this time period. The use of lighting was especially appropriate for the time and theme of the film. When characters were being mysterious or talking about something that was secretive they faces were in the shadows. I found it interesting that the film used the women's heights as part of their personality. I found that when women were good to their husbands they were shorter and women who were evil and only thinking of themselves were shorter. I loved how they told the story of the day of the heist by going through every characters play by play. I didn't like how it didn't have continuity and created disruption in the story line. The story would be at the 7th race and all of a sudden we would be following someone else and it was 11am. There is a very ironic ending and it shows how crime does not pay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarantino did his Homework to this film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the last of the "noir" genre, this film is an interesting study of celluloid. Director Kubrick puts into use many of the devices that would turn up later in the films of Quentin Tarantino, especially "Reservior Dogs", which is also similar in plot. Rewinding the scenes and going at them again from different angles and perspectives probably was not completely new in Kubrick's day...just that it had never been fully exploited then, and was not exploited again until the 1990s. This film tells the tale of Sterling Hayden as a loser, who just got through doing a stretch in the pen, trying to pull a race-track heist in conjunction with a number of other underworld slugs who come out of the woodwork and lend their talents for just such an occasion. $2 million bucks is just short of peanuts in today's world, but it was one heck of a lot of dough in 1956, and a lot of guys, even a crooked cop, were willing to cast their lots in with each other just to get a share. If you have not seen this film...and I think everyone should...I won't jump the gun and give away many vitals. The performances are good, very credible, and the cast is outstanding. Jay C Flippen, Elisha Cook, Marie Windsor, James Edwards all give outstanding support to Sterling Hayden. In the race track robbery scene, I think I spotted an aged Robert Emmett O'Connor (of "Sunset Blvd" and "Public Enemy" fame), but I cannot be sure. Also, the uncredited narration of the film sounds, to my ear, like the voice of Art Gilmore, who also narrated the TV series "Highway Patrol", and was a staple on radio and TV in the 50s and 60s. One point where I differ...though Marie Windsor's character pumps info from her weak kneed husband, Elisha Cook, it has no real bearing on the robbery...but it has quite a bearing on the aftermath. A pre-"Ben Casey" Vince Edwards tends to that, in a somewhat grisly fashion. But Hayden's ultimate undoing were circumstance and faulty planning. He sees the handwriting on the wall, and knows that running would be to no avail. This caper ends his criminal career for once and for all. I had never seen the film before. It is an incredible watch, more than a watch, actually, but an accurate study in human nature. I recommend it very highly. It is also very entertaining.</fullReview>

In 2001, Empire magazine named the film one of the 50 greatest crime films ever.The Killing is an incisive, entertaining, downbeat caper film clearly influenced by The Asphalt Jungle (1950), Rififi (1955) and probably Rashomon (1950). Its most remarkable feature is director Stanley Kubrick's reconstruction of narrative, telling the story of the heist from the viewpoint of individual gang members, thus assembling the truth through a gradual drip-feed of information. It's an enormously influential third feature by a director who by this stage clearly had talent and technique to burn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good crime drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In almost every top ten of heist movies "The Killing" is mentioned. The discovery that Stanley Kubrick had directed this movie encouraged me even more to watch this movie. With movies from yesteryear there is always the chance that they disappoint because it's too dated or nearly not as exciting as it was at the time it was made. Am I glad to report that "The Killing" isn't dated at all. As a matter of fact it is quite actual in relation to people trying to earn a buck in a hard economy and taking care of your family. I loved and hated Marie Windsor as the cunning and double crossing wife of Elisha Cook Jr. She convincingly portrays a type of woman that many men have encountered today in this age. In combination with the tight and fast direction this is surely a good crime drama. However to me this wasn't a masterpiece as hoped for. This is a matter of taste. I have to give this another watch and try to see what others have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said about the genius of Kubrick that hasn't been said. I hadn't had the chance to see this movie and am i glad that i saw it today!Everything about this thriller is so exciting, right from the taut storytelling to the characterizations.The actors had been well chosen for each part, especially Elisha Cook Jr. as the poor Sherry Peatty and Marie Windsor as the nemesis. All the other actors from Sterling Hayden to Timothy Carey as Nikki the sniper did a wonderful job of breathing life into their characters.This is by far the most accessible of Kubrick's work i have seen and the movie reminded me of Paul Newman Robert Redford starrer "The Sting"; but this is much more grim,dark and with an impending sense of doom and doesn't pull any punches!. This movie is not just any other escapist cinema, it has glimpses of the Kubrick that was to come!The scenes between Peatty and his wife are so dark they could only be made by someone like Kubrick who'd later give us "Eyes Wide Shut".The camera angles and lighting were so effective.The score adds to the tension. I couldn't help but realize that this movie must have inspired so many filmmakers of later years and the countless rat-pack heist thrillers that we've seen through the years clearly seem to have some element or the other of this movie's story-telling style and even props and accessories(robber in clown-mask, shotgun in a rose bouquet...to name a few!!) This movie was probably ahead of its time at the time of its release.Instead of going on and on about the movie i conclude by saying that it is probably the best crime thriller I've seen. I wish Kubrick had left behind a protégé who possessed a bit of his vision and genius!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Kubrick's odyssey truly began</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick's first studio movie and first collaboration with producer James B. Harris is this cheeky, witty, lively story about grand theft at a horse racing track. This is also where began Kubrick's marriage with solid literary sources for each of his movies.Sterling Hayden is ideal as the mumbling, swaggering Johnny Clay, who puts together a crack team to carry out the meticulously-planned heist. "Crack team" is perhaps a misnomer - they're really no more than a handful of endearing swindlers; their coercion techniques do not extend beyond a couple of sharp back-handers. Clay is cocksure and quick-witted, almost to the point of self-parody; it makes his final line even more caustic.Kubrick and original novelist Jim Thompson's script simply crackles, not least when flimsy George (Elisha Cook Jr) and femme-fatale Sherry (Marie Windsor) share the screen. Their dialogue is clever, witty, ludicrous even, and most of all rollicking good fun. Other characters bring texture to the tapestry: Art Gilmore plays an amusingly idiosyncratic narrator; we expect to see Kola Kwariani's affable bruiser eating a whole cooked chicken like George 'The Animal' Steele's Tor Johnson in Ed Wood; while Timothy Carey's vile sharpshooting psycho Nikki is fascinating viewing. (Carey would go on to play a very different role in Kubrick's next film, Paths of Glory.) It's no surprise that Tarantino cites this movie as inspiration: the hopping narrative is a technique he used in Reservoir Dogs, while Jackie Brown made similar use of the heist scenes' multi-viewpoint setups. Testament indeed when you consider that in 1957 Kubrick was only just beginning his odyssey...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick picked Sterling Hayden up off of the Boone County, Kentucky ground of the close of THE ASPHALT JUNGLE (1950), gave him life (and a five year stint in the prison), and brought him back, on time, for THE KILLING (1956), to engineer a heist of the same quality and complexity, this time centered not on jewels, but his personal passion- horses.(1950): On his dying drive to Hickorywood Farm, Hayden speaks of a black horse, a prize horse of much promise, raised by his father, who we learned earlier broke a leg and had to be shot. With his last breaths he relates the symbolic importance of the fate of that horse. (1956): Kubrick has a prize black horse shot during the day's critical seventh race. Does this make total-literal sense with the rest of the crime's plot? Is it a cross-film preview/clue that ends up involving, this time, to trump even the 1950 double-cross, a white poodle ?I don't know, but I appreciate the respect given by Kubrick to John Huston's masterwork.

		<shortDescription>A first-rate 50's film noir crime thriller gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shrewd ex-con Johnny Clay (superbly played to stoic perfection by Sterling Hayden) rounds up a motley assortment of small-time hoods and everyday nobodies to pull off a daring and complex $2,000,000 dollar racetrack heist. Of course, things go disastrously awry when human error enters into the equation. Director Stanley Kubrick, who also co-wrote the tight and sharp script with noted crime fiction novelist Jim Thompson, uses a supremely precise and economical style to relate the arresting story: the snappy pace never lets up for a minute, the tension steadily mounts to a nerve-wracking fever pitch (the caper itself is quite gripping and exciting), the intricate and innovative nonlinear narrative structure which gives multiple perspectives on the plot greatly enhances the overall suspense, the cramped sets likewise add to the claustrophobic atmosphere, the hard, gritty, no-nonsense tone ensures that there's never any sticky sweet sentiment, and there's no padding or filler whatsoever. The rich and vivid rogues' gallery of pathetic minor league criminals and ordinary losers rates as another substantial plus: Jay C. Flippen as amiable bookkeeper Marvin Unger, Elisha Cook, Jr. as meek, henpecked teller George Peatty, Marie Windsor as George's greedy, sarcastic, venomous wife Sherry, Vince Edwards as Sherry's smooth heel lover Val Cannon, the ever-freaky Timothy Carey as creepy sharpshooter Nikki Arane, Joe Swayer as kindly bartender Mike O'Reilly, Ted DeCorsia as penniless, down-on-his-luck patrolman Randy Kennan, and, arguably the most colorful of the offbeat bunch, Kola Kwarian as philosophical chess-playing wrestler Maurice. Coleen Gray makes the most out of her relatively slight part as Clay's sweet and loyal girlfriend Fay. Kudos are also in order for Lucien Ballard's stark, shadowy black and white cinematography, the deliciously sardonic dialogue (Windsor in particular gets most of the best lines), Gerald Fried's booming, robust, stirring full-bore score, several inspired quirky touches (the horseshoe, the clown mask, the parrot, the old lady at the airport with the dog), the uniformly terrific acting by a top-notch cast, and the great downbeat ending. Only the annoying and obtrusive cornball "Dragnet"-like narration detracts a bit from this otherwise superlative winner.</fullReview>

This is the earliest of Stanley's movies that I've seen at this time. I have to say, as far back as this point in his career, the man knew what he was doing. This is a masterfully done noir crime-thriller, in stark black and white, that will have your attention from start to finish. Its impact on cinema is still felt today. I am here mainly referring to one specific aspect of it in particular. The narration can be a tad excessive, but you can find out where the blame lies for that by reading the Trivia(though I urge you to not read all of it until after at least your initial viewing of it). The dialog, however, fits perfectly, offers quotable lines, and is impeccably thought up as well as delivered. The acting in general is fantastic. The writing leaves little, if anything, to be desired. The pacing is spot-on. This is extremely exciting at its best, and even when not actively intense, there's nothing extraneous. The lighting is well-done. The cinematography is marvelous. The direction is fantastic. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick, and/or the genres it falls into, and the others who helped make this. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the 1950s, when movies weren't allowed to depict certain events or situations, Stanley Kubrick had to settle for making a typical film noir-type movie that was growing ever so popular during the decade. However, looking back, it is obvious to see that Kubrick was even able to make that type of film even more different and exciting than most of the other two-bit directors of Hollywood.Based on a novel, The Killing tells of a group of men coming together in hopes of pulling of a huge heist that will in turn theoretically make all their lives for the better. As the film progresses, we are plunged into the day before the big robbery and Kubrick does an amazing job at filling us in with just the right amount of information so we know each characters' needs and motivations. This is a brisk film at around 84 minutes, but it covers more ground than most two hour movies of today.The acting is universally excellent, led by Sterling Hayden as Johnny, the brains of the group. as well as Marie Windsor as a cheating housewife with plenty of ambition but little loyalty. Of course, Kubrick is the real star here as the director, co-writer, cinematographer and many other titles. He always was a perfectionist and this shows his creativity bubbling and building to foreshadow of what he would do in the future to forever change perspective of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent action and story including Sterling Hayden's performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing is probably one of my favorite movies 'cause I was only 16 when I saw it and was impressed by the story the action and Sterling Hayden's performance. He became one of my favorite actors and I tried to catch all the movies he was in. The way he carried himself and the way he spoke were the features that I liked. I guess the terms "he became an idol" and turned me into a "Fan" would be correct to use. Years later I was surprised when I came across some of his books and I read Voyager, which I enjoyed very much as some parts were similar to my own experiences and situations that I was involved with, at the time I was reading it. Therefore, the connection to this actor continued twenty years after I originally saw the movie. Kubrik's sequences development of the drama was better than anything I had seen up to that time, especially how it builds up to the ironic ending of Life &amp; Fate's annoying dog, the poorly belted suitcase, including the precarious way it was sitting atop of the pile and the plane's propellers blowing all the money into the air--all the planning, greed, and efforts all blown in an instant. In reference to the title, I always thought the Killing referred to the thug's machine gun going off and killing everyone. but some folks think it referred to the planned killing of the horse --any comments on that..?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick, quite possibly is best known for his works such as "A Clockwork Orange" and "2001: A Space Odyssey". Being one of his very first films, he had not yet reached the status of what Kubrick is. Although he still had a very good reputation with the suits of Hollywood, he was still relatively unknown. "The Killing" has been considered one of the most influential crime thrillers made. Ex-Convict Johnny Clay has just been released from prison and has left a rehabilitated man. He now knows that if he's going to do some time, that particular crime that he committed better be worth it. Despite Oceans 11 being released almost a half of a century later, it is worth it to mention that these two movies are very similar. A small tight net group of guys are brought together to different assigned job all to accomplish one thing: Make the star of the movie a rich man. Of course like any good noir style movie where a lot of people are involved, someone is always bound to not get the memo of what to do. If not that they manage to always find a way to become distracted or foul up their roll in the plotting scheme of the film. Kubrick had co-wrote and directed this film all before the age of thirty. That is of course after finishing two other films before "The Killing" became a movie. At such a young age the ability to recognize good actors and have them perform well in such a complicated script is possibly only something Stanley Kubrick could have pulled off at that age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping And Suspenseful Low-Budget Classic Of Racetrack Robbery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Clay has planned the perfect heist; a racetrack betting office during the biggest meet of the year, involving inside men, two separate staged distractions and a crooked cop on the take. He's thought of everything, so what can possibly go wrong ?The first of several pictures with his producer partner James B. Harris, Kubrick's third feature, despite its puny budget, is a confident, mature, exciting, expertly-crafted crime thriller which influenced everyone from Jean-Luc Godard to Quentin Tarantino. It has a few limitations - stock footage, a voice-over that dates it - but it succeeds where so many gangster movies fail by imbuing the characters with intriguing and varied personalities, as opposed to just by-the-numbers hoodlums. There is a perfectionist planner (Kubrick allegory, anyone ?), a nervous patsy, a nice guy, an old friend, a hardass and a psycho, as well as the two standard women - the dependable dame and the back-stabbing hussy. Each of these has their own stake in the robbery and they are painted with simple but evocative clarity; even the minor players like Kwariani (a friend of Kubrick's from his chess-hustling days) as the philosophising wrestler are fascinating in their own right. The pathos of the story - the plan is an utter disaster - is richly detailed, from subtle nuances like Johnny going to the wrong door at the motel, down to the fabulous finale with the money blowing all over the runway. The cast are uniformly excellent; look fast for Turkel (the bartender from The Shining) as Tiny, Val's partner at the shootout. In the end, the great thing about this movie is not its highly original multiple-timelines narrative or its hard-boiled pedigree, but the director's perceptive subtext - no matter how clever or careful we are, the random frailties of human nature always creep in to make things more complicated and mess things up. Co-written by Kubrick and classic pulp novelist Jim Thompson (The Getaway, The Grifters), based on the book Clean Break by Lionel White. Trivia - in Tobe Hooper's 1979 TV-movie Salem's Lot, Windsor and Cook play unrelated characters who seem like older versions of themselves in this movie. Shot by Lucien Ballard in San Mateo County south of San Fransisco; with the exception of the disowned Spartacus, this is literally the closest the great Kubrick ever got to Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No nonsense robbery caper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is established with this norish-like crime drama. Kubrick directs and writes the screenplay from a novel by Lionel White. Sterling Hayden is flawless as Johnny Clay, an ex-con who engineers a daring racetrack robbery. For the caper to be pulled off successfully, detailed planning needs to be followed down to the very minute. Dirty cops, greedy racetrack employees and a sharpshooter must all do their parts with precision. Character actor Elisha Cook is outstanding as the mousy George Peatty. Marie Windsor is his greedy wife who alerts her boyfriend Vince Edwards that there is a fortune to be stolen. Cult favorite Timothy Carey is the sharpshooter hired to shoot a race horse as a major diversion. The finale is unpredictable and very abrupt. Other players: Joe Sawyer, Coleen Gray, Kola Kwariani and Jay C. Flippen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's day at the races.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick scored big with The Killing back in 1956. A heist film, like this, is difficult to be duplicated especially when you take the Kubrick 'feel' of it into account. Sterling Hayden plays the infamous Johnny Clay who puts together a team in order to knock off a racetrack, shortly after serving a 5 year sentence in Alcatraz. Johnny, the criminal mastermind, brings in several men seeking the $2 million financial gain to be earned at the end of the job. The heist is planned down to the minute and executed before the film even reaches it's climax.While many Kubrick fans rate films such as 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Full Metal Jacket', 'The Shining', etc. to be his best films, I would easily swap one of them out for this film. The Killing redefined the film noir genre as a whole back in 1956, and paved the way for Kubrick's next major success: Paths of Glory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Crime Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Stanley Kubrick and The Killing is excellent film noir from him. The basic plot is a group of men plan to rob $2 Million from a racetrack and split the money evenly. What makes this film so good is the way the story is told; instead of telling it straight like a lot of directors would have done, Kubrick tells the story from the points of view of the different characters. It shows how the events of the robbery were done and interlinked. This technique has influenced and been used by Quentin Tarantino in Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown. The film could have portrayed the gang as badguys, only in it for the money, but in this film we actually care for the characters and you want them to get away with the money. It shows one character who has a sick wife and just wants to make her live more comfortable, another is unhappily married and his wife derides him and uses him and the leader of the guy wants to set himself up and live happily with his girlfriend. There are also unsympathetic characters in the film and there are twists in this picture. The film also starts Sterling Hayden, a fine actor from the 50s and 60s, and is the best person in the Killing, but there are other decent performances in the film. The Killing also has some very good scenes and set-pieces which Kubrick is very good at. He is know for doing very good shots and a scene I really liked in this film was the fight in bar which was very well done. Finally the running time of this film is very short, making it a nice snappy little picture.The Killing is an clever little film which should be watched, especially if you are a fan of crime films, film noir or Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ain't fair. Ain't fair."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that struck me about The Killing is that the narration really doesn't seem to fit, which explains why Kubrick was so unhappy about being obliged to include it. My initial reaction upon learning this was to wonder why Kubrick would put up with someone forcing him to do something in one of his films that he didn't like, but then I remembered that this was very early in his career, and no one really knew who he was yet. Right away we meet an obviously unhappy couple, Sherry and George, and quickly learn why they are unhappy. Sherry has no respect for George because he had promised her a good life and a lot of money and has as of yet failed to do that. She belittles him and manipulates him, treating him like an irritating servant rather than as a husband. It is painfully obvious that he should drop her like a bad habit, but he is so in love with her that he takes it and continues to make her promises, even knowing that in order to fulfill them he will have to take a dangerous trip to the wrong side of the law.The build-up of the scheme to rob the race track is one of the film's greatest achievements, and Sherry manages to manipulate George into telling her about it, and then she immediately goes off to tell her lover about it as well. It is an interesting love triangle described here. Sherry is having an affair with a handsome stud but married to a whiny pansy who reminds me of Piglet from the Winnie the Pooh cartoons. George is desperately in love with Sherry, who has no respect for him, but is in turn in love with Val, a handsome man who clearly is only interested in her physically. At least until she mentions George's scheme to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars. Then he's interested in her financially, too. We know Sherry plans to betray George, and we can sense that Val intends to betray Sherry, which makes for some great dramatic tension later in the film. George is so intent on getting to trust his promise that things will get better that he doesn't think for a second that she would ever betray him, even when she is so clearly uninterested in him beyond the possibility that he may bring some money into her life. At one point he tells her, "I know I've made a lot of promises in the past, but this time it's not just talk. We're gonna be rich, and soon!" This may have been emulated in a classic Simpsons episode, where Homer says almost exactly the same thing ? "After years of failing at get-rich-quick schemes, I KNOW I'm gonna get rich with THIS scheme. And quick!"Kubrick has explored an astonishing variety of genres in his career, ranging from the beginning of time to the distant future and from sports films to science fiction. This one, I think, is his only film noir, and it is film noir by the strictest definition. I often notice that, with surprising regularity, it is women, or a woman, the generates much of the conflict in the movies, but here is a very clearly defined femme fatale that leads to the downfall of a doting man. (spoilers) There is a scene that suggests an ugly hint of racism, as the man hired to shoot one of the horses during the race (and thus create the necessary distraction) tells a polite black parking lot attendant to get lost in the ugliest way possible. I was a little disappointed to hear this kind of language in a Kubrick film, although it does fit in perfectly with the story and, more importantly, these are the last words the man ever says. Serves him right. This is Kubrick making social commentary in his own brilliant way. Very soon, he does it again, skewering corrupt or inept police and biased news outlets, which claim that the man was shot as he "attempted to shoot his way out of the parking lot." As can be expected, everything does not turn out to plan, and Kubrick has created a brilliant ending that is both disappointing and hugely satisfying. Disappointing because the tension was created throughout by causing us to wonder whether or not the robbery would be successful, and satisfying because, even though we didn't really even notice it until now, none of the characters are very likable. Except maybe for that parking lot attendant. After all that planning, it seems, you can't account for every contingency?Note: The eagle-eyed viewer will notice Rodney Dangerfield as an extra during the fight scene. I may be mistaken, but it looks to me like he is the man the second from the right just after the guy fighting flips two cops forward onto their backs at once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crooked Schemes Veiled By Manipulation, Shadows and Cigarette Smoke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Stanley Kubrick's first masterpiece arrived in 1956, that certain "masterpiece" is evidently the seminal and always influential crime-doesn't-pay flick, The Killing. It revealed Kubrick as a director of mass potential and distinct talent, wholly displaying his ability to make polished pictures on a minimal budget. Yet more than anything, it was not purely a trial-run of amateurish talent as with his previous noir, Killer's Kiss. Instead it was something which would advance Kubrick's career from underground status to that of an emerging auteur. Numerous directors, such as Quentin Tarantino and Michael Mann, have been principally influenced by this early classic and even today, it ranks highly among the greatest crime films in cinema history.It might seem cliché in this day and age, but the story of an ex-con returning to robbery for one last, meticulously premeditated heist was groundbreaking for its time. More than anything else, its method of storytelling was the most revolutionary element of all, with the use of retrospective, documentary narration pestering the ongoing story. Such an approach allowed the director to condense the narrative to a stringent, eighty-five minutes, without limiting the restless gist. Amusingly, such narration was allegedly incorporated due to studio insistence and Kubrick -never the man to concede to studio intrusion- used the narration as a means perplexing the viewer with mislead information. This lends the film its innovative, non-linear format and results in a more rewarding outing in viewer involvement.Crammed with gorgeous cinematography, dizzying camera positioning and chilling lighting effects it is impossible for it not to be considered anything but unadulterated noir. The irreplaceable black and white film could not have been more appropriate for illuminating the character's sustained facial expressions and nervous idiosyncrasies. Arguably, this is the first of Kubrick's pictures where the "Kubrickian technique" adjective can be applied and although it does not feature a fully-fledged tracking-shot it certainly details the characteristics first experimented formerly in Killer's Kiss. Ever serious about his work, the director did not keep to the traditional film-making traits of the period, but throughout his career persistently expanded the facets which should make an individual's work instantly recognisable.There is obvious weight placed on the characters who are dominant and those who are not, but even the most cunning of characters meet their match. The typical, Kubrickian formality was introduced here; showing little respect for those who meddle in crime and a disgust at humanity's gluttony. The majority of characters are double-sided, emotionless fiends who are merely using the other for financial gain. Typically, for a work of this genre, there is no compassion, solely a moral and an acidic manifestation of retribution. Dramatic irony will leave the viewer clinging and distantly hesitant over what they might encounter next, but with Kubrick no character is ever in safe hands. The Killing has a simple message of crime doesn't pay, but it says so without resorting to linear boredom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic early Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A highly influential film that set Stanley Kubrick up for greatness. I really like this movie a lot, flaws and all. With every Kubrick film, there are just always so many moments and scenes that you remember, long after you've seen the film. His style is very evident in this film: long, drawn out scenes where characters actually converse, sometimes about big things, sometimes little things. But the scenes always seem realistic. It's not the perfect film, but what really is. Wasn't overly crazy about the narration. I feel the movie would have been better suited to just letting the story tell itself. That being said, it's still great entertainment and a fun film noir movie. The time-travelling, point-of-view moments are what really drive the movie. In a current scene, which may have already happened earlier in the film, you find yourself thinking about what is happening at the exact point in time in a scene already shown. The characters are all interesting, too. In particular, Elisha Cook Jr. as a nerdy track employee and Marie Windsor as his slightly over-the-hill manipulative wife are standouts. Although scenes are long and drawn out, there are still unanswered questions about certain characters and their real motivations that leaves it to the viewer to ascertain what's going on. The open-ended ending is typical Kubrick, thankfully. All in all, a very unique, influential, and interesting film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A near perfect movie about a near perfect crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Committing the perfect crime has undoubtedly been an idea that has crossed many peoples' minds. Being about to get away with something not quite legal or right, but immensely profitable and just once is a very appealing and tempting idea. Perhaps that is why the crime-drama has evolved into its own story genre and it is very popular on film."The Killing" as directed by a young Stanley Kubrick is quite a film. It doesn't just get into the intricate details of the plan that Johnny Clay puts together to knock off 2 million dollars cash from a race-track betting office, but it gets into the people behind the each clever part of the overall clever plan. By getting into the people involved you almost want them to succeed. The plan they come up with isn't as distasteful as it could have been. No one needs to die, though a horse needs to be wounded, but otherwise the plan is clean. All about timing, precision, wits and the guts to go through with it. Giving criminals these generally good characteristics is a great set up for irony, since they are good things, but they are being used the wrong way. But the contrast of this juxtaposition is rather interesting. The other irony is due to the film's unchronological progression. We see each bit of the scheme executed but only see how that part fits in and works in the next section and so forth. It makes for brilliant suspense. Another surprise is a fight scene at a bar. It is -how should I put it?- pretty darn good! A big macho guy takes out several police officers as they try to subdue him and it contain some great choreography, though don't compare it to Jackie Chan, this movie is from 1956 remember.In fact the only negative thing is the often times dull voice over, that does it's part to contribute to the film, but since it was put in against the wishes of Kubrick he probably had a better idea to convey that information to the viewer. That aside, this is a first rate crime-caper all the way through. --- 9/10Not Rated, has some violence but is good for general audiences.</fullReview>

Marie Winsor is the Noir bad girl married to the wimpy cashier Elisha Cook. If Cook is in the film, it's going to be good. He always played the young punks in old Bogart films like the Maltese Falcon.The robbery is complicated. Guarded by a phalanx of coppers, the racetrack cash will be tough to crack. A hip-cat sharpshooter is engaged in order to distract the police. He's going to shoot the best horse in Race 7 on the down stretch as the robbery goes in gear. Sure, this is Hayden's last caper before he settles down with his girl. We know it's not going to work, but the character acting, Colleen Gray, Vince Edwards, the entire cast, pulps-it-up into a satisfying crescendo. Sure, crime doesn't pay in a 50's Noir, but this film is so influential, a hundred caper movies has it spawned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sterling Hayden leads a gang of robbers to pull off a heist at a race track. Kubrick tells much of the story using narration and initially this seems odd; I've never seen this in a movie before. The planning of the heist is complicated and interesting. A very Kubrick touch is the strange clown masks that the robbers wear which is both comical and creepy. Of course, since this is a Kubrick movie, there's more to it than just the heist. Although this is his second film and it's done on a very low budget, it's very watchable. If you're a Kubrick fan you have to see it. It is better than his first film "Killer's Kiss". Sterling Hayden is very good and so is Elisha Cook Jr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost ruined by the final 5 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- Kubrick's The Killing is very nearly a perfect movie. The story centers around the daylight robbery of $2 million from a racetrack. A varied group of five men are brought together to plan and execute the hold-up. Kubrick's decision to tell the story in a non-linear fashion was a good one. The viewers attention is focused on each part of the hold-up and how each part relates to the whole. The detail is amazing. Through different eyes and ears, we see and hear the 7th race begin at least four different times.- The heist itself is a thing of beauty. Every part fits perfectly into place. There are very few lucky coincidences (which always angers me in a heist movie) necessary for the hold-up to work. The plan goes like clockwork. My favorite part had to be the bar fight scene between wrestler Kola Kwarini and fifteen police officers. It might seem like a silly thing, but it was absolutely necessary to divert the attention of track security.- The acting is great. Sterling Hayden is outstanding as the schedule obsessed head of the group. Elisha Cook plays Elisha Cook. If you're a fan of Cook from other films, you'll like him here. Marie Windsor is especially conniving as the cheating wife who is out for herself. And I always enjoy seeing Jay C. Flippin.- I started by saying that The Killing is nearly a perfect movie. But it's not perfect. I was ready to rate The Killing a 9/10 until the final five minutes. The ending is a cliché ridden disaster. Surely Kubrick could have come up with something better than having a poodle running onto the runway. It's hard to believe that a simple moment like that almost ruined the movie for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserved to be nominated for some sort of Film / Acting award...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie catches your attention right from the beginning with the opening shot being at a crowded horse park where people are dressed in hats, dresses, suits &amp; tie for a day at the races. The music is tense and almost makes you wonder if its a war movie or a gangster crime movie. It has Dragnet appeal with its narration from a very good narrator to introduce each movement of this step-by-step approach on "How to rob a horse racetrack during the 7th race". The acting was on key with sometimes subtle overacting in some sequences which gives it the "B" movie flavor. Sterling Hayden was great! I liked how his character was derived and the knowledge Johnny Clay would furnish about each person's role &amp; penalty "if" they were caught. I guess he became a jail house lawyer during his "Nickle" stay at Alcatraz. Funny - I thought Alcatraz housed " only the best of the worst criminals. Very clever plot that weaved together "average Joes" with a little larceny in their hearts. The performance I thought that should have received stellar reviews and possibly an Academy Award nod for supporting actor was Elisha Cook Jr.s performance as Geo. Peatty. Cook owned that role and really brought it home for the "little man or affable, lovable, cowardly schmuck" who wants to "strike it rich" overnight. Peatty's mind is already clouded by being paranoid, jealous yet focused in spite of the odds. He rides on a guilt trip that no man should have to endure from his beautiful wife. Check out what Geo. Peatty does to prevail. There were other subtle moments in this movie that could have been deemed as controversial for the time. For instance - The scene were the character Nicky is hired. Nicky has a small confrontation with the guard at the gate who is a Black man. Nicky (Italian) has to bribe him to let him park his car at this lot. They befriend each other but Nicky later tarnishes that bond when the time comes for him to do his job. This Black man is in his way and Nicky has to use the "N" word to shoo him away from the task he needs to carry out. Well - watch it to see what happens next. Overall, this is a movie that embodies the use of concise scriptwriting, dialogue, lighting and great acting by each actor for each character in the movie. I enjoyed The Killing directed by Stanley Kubric from the beginning to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not Great (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sterling Hayden has a plan to rob a racetrack of it's proceeds, he enlists the usual oddball bunch but it all goes to hell in the end, of course.I think this is a good, not great movie. I think it succeeds despite Kubrick, not because of him: essentially there are two sensibilities at work in the movie and they jar.The first are the sensibilities that naturally come with the genre. This is a heist picture, a subset of the hardboiled genre, and a hardboiled story necessarily brings with it a kind of bruised romanticism. And indeed KILLING has all the tropes: failed love, Hemingwayesque "grace under pressure", corrupt law enforcement, manipulative, predatory women, etc. Indeed, Jim Thompson was involved with the script, the most bruised, pained romantic of them all.The second is Kubrick, and his is a quite different sensibility, of course. He's God, looking down on us poor mortals and showing us that our efforts at fighting back the chaos of life are in vain. These two sensibilities have real problems co-existing. The second half of the movie, which is primarily action-oriented, is dominated by Kubrick's and it's the best of the movie, quite exciting to watch. The first half, though, is all set-up, and necessarily dominated by the "romantic" sensibilities that I mentioned earlier. And this part is just thin-gruel: Kubrick obviously just didn't buy this kind of thing, and the whole first part of the movie seems pretty shallow and thin, like he was just uninterested in it all.More. I'm pretty sure I got the "point" at the end of KILLING: it all falls apart, the world is at the mercy of chance and greed, trying to impose order is fruitless, etc. That's not, though, a very interesting point. Every heist picture will tell you the same thing -- and the best of them will also give you strong characters, a world to be absorbed into, etc. The whole "feel" of KILLING is analytic, which is fine except that there's nothing particular interesting in the analysis. I guess another way to say it is that my problem with KILLING is the same problem that some people (not me) had with THE SHINING, which is that Kubrick didn't really understand this genre, and that his big revelation is pretty par for the course. I still liked it enough to recommend it: the heist story is such a strong one that even a non-commital one can work, if it's done well at all, and this one is. The second half is very solid. But it's not the great heist movie (I think the great heist movie is HEAT), and in general I have to say it's overrated.</fullReview>

A fairly short movie with a predictable premise, the director's genius shines through in many scenes - for instance, the axe fight in the mannequin factory. It doesn't matter which decade you're in, axes and mannequins have always been creepy! The dream sequences, shot in INFRA-RED(!) are enjoyable and shows the blossoming of the director's surreal side, which we've all come to know well in his later work. Before you rent Paths Of Glory and Lolita, find time to take a look at this often overlooked film. Of course, don't forget to watch Paths Of Glory!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scheme of the robbers in this film is so ingenious it almost makes the viewer contemplate emulating it. Of course such a course of action is morally and ethically wrong but it makes you wonder. Let's just say you feel for the protagonist at the end. The acting in this film is excellent especially from Sterling Hayden, Marie Windsor, and superb character actor Elisha Cook Jr. What else new can one say about Kubrick? This film probably isn't the highest regarded in his pantheon but being a huge film noir devotee I found his stab at the genre to be one of my most enjoyable cinematic experiences. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I certainly enjoyed the Killing. It was presented like a puzzle. Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is planning a racetrack robbery. Each piece of the puzzle is presented with much craftsmanship together with a good but not great acting. Then the major pieces come together to show how the robbery will come off. Finally things start to go wrong -- piece by piece ending with some surprises. I would not call it a thriller but it was an interesting, well presented story that kept your attention from the beginning to the end. A good watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing is about a gang of thieves who are about to pull off a score. But what score? The viewer receives the answer to this question in the form of a few jumbled conversations and commands by Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden). In preparation for the caper, a narrator goes around to each character, and it's obvious this film influenced the non- linear mode of story telling in Quentin Tarantino's "Jackie Brown". But that is one of the few flaws of the film. The narration seems a bit too excessive and it's hard for the viewer to get into the film when the narrator just says what is going on. Kubrick's used narration such as this in "Barry Lyndon" but that was much deeper and much more comic. It's the narration that also helps move along the plot, however, by giving off certain details. As Johnny Clay Sterling Hayden merely acts out what there is to act out, which isn't much. The role doesn't require much emotional performances except by Cherry, a deceptive little tramp who could possibly screw up the entire job to cash in herself. The Killing instantly builds suspense upon suspense of what could go wrong, and it uses this to also launch the plot forward. Stanley Kubrick's script doesn't include much character emotions, but it still maintains a constant pace. His direction is much deeper and the photography combines with the music well enough. He manages to show each of the characters with an optimal pace and never backs down. All in all, The Killing is nowhere near as excellent as other works by Kubrick, but it still manages to be good. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Prototype for many movies and shows today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing" has been referred to as the movie in which he hit his stride, visually, as a director. I do not find this to be the case, as there are few to none of the long, languid shots, nor of the voyeuristic shots from an unmoving camera. There is more style in this movie than in many movies made both then and now; the difference is that this is not the "classic" Kubrick style.That said, this is a movie that serves as a forerunner to Pulp Fiction and any movie that messes with timelines and shows multiple perspectives on the same action. Fans of the show Boomtown will appreciate the narrative style of "The Killing". Thanks to Tarantino, the non-sequential story line has been in vogue for the past decade or so (for more recent examples, see "Memento" or "Irreversible"); thanks to Kubrick and "The Killing", Tarantino had a template to use in pulling off this cinematic mini-revolution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a sucker for movies where a mastermind rounds up a bunch of other ragtags for a heist. Unfortantly when a movie like this is attempted today it usually always fails (see Heist). Kubrick masterfully directs this "small" masterpiece with excellent performances all around. I do however caution that you use the subtitle button on your remote when the wrestler appears on the screen. The "Dragnet" style narration is stupid and is the only flaw of this wonderful movie. It is also significant to note that when Sterling Hayden enters the store to buy a suitcase you can clearly read on the marquee of the club next door that Lenny Bruce is appearing at the club.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film on DVD, which includes the original trailer. Luckily, I didn't watch it before the movie, because it gives away the best shots, and key parts of the plot. I thought only modern trailers did that! Anyway, I didn't love this movie as much as some other reviewers, but what I did love about it was the realism with which the heist was treated. The robbers think they have a perfect plan, but they haven't considered the many everyday things that can pop up. There are also some great characters in the film, especially in the smaller roles. What I didn't like about the movie was the simplistic way some of the parts were written, especially Marie Windsor's role. Her character is so unmitigatedly unpleasant that she's not enjoyable to watch, and seems out of place in this otherwise fairly realistic film.

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's best and least pretentious film, largely because - unlike all his other work, with the exception of Paths of Glory - it has human beings in it. The choice of a formulaic genre, that of the Heist Gone Wrong, leaves no room for ponderous pseudo-significance and forces his creativity into the more interesting areas of character, motivation, and cinematic narrative. Sterling Hayden's personal disillusionment with the whole business of movies gives a melancholy integrity to his performance as the world-weary leader of the gang; Elisha Cook elicits true sympathy as the weakling of the mob, a decent little man who's in above his head in both love and crime. Kubrick's trademark brilliance in shot selection, montage and show-not-tell story development were never put to more entertaining use.</fullReview>

From five minutes into it my eyes were glued to the screen, the story is terrific, and like I said, ahead of it's time.The story is pretty basic, a group of men rob a horse track. I had seen HEIST, (80's Peirce Brosnan Movie) and I thought that was the best horse track heist I would ever see, but I was wrong. Clearly half of HEIST'S influence comes straight from THE KILLING, only THE KILLING pulls it off much better, and leaves no loose ends.If you haven't seen this movie...RENT IT. I seriously can't recommend this film enough, it has become on of my favorite Crime-Drama's of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When summing up Kubrick's career, this would not be on most peoples list. Most would actually be surprised that he actually shot this movie. A heist movie gone wrong may not be the most original idea by today's standards, but at the time this was revolutionary. Well almost you must take into account The Asphalt Jungle (1950), which this does at times appear to be a homage to. Great, subtle acting, a tremendous script and the direction we later came to expect from the genius without a soul. If you're a Kubrick fan chances are that you've already seen this film, but if this has passed you by then take the time out to watch this glorious example of how Kubrick can take any genre and craft a piece of magic. I recommend that this film is watched without disturbance, with popcorn and with a mate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex Narrative Structure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early notable film by Stanley Kubrick that is a layered box of flashbacks within flashback. While it may not be the Kubrick of his master works, The Killing(1956) is a very good crafted low budget studio film by the late filmmaker. Heist film whose major influence is The Asphalt Jungle(1950) which has a comparable plotline. What both films have in common are the lead role is played by Sterling Hayden who plays identical characters. With little of the Kubrick motifs and trademarks which first appears in Paths of Glory(1957). One trademark that does appear in one scene is the tight closeup with camera looking straight into the face of Elisha Cook Jr. Sterling Hayden exhibits why he was masterful in tough guy roles with hard-boiled performance in The Killing(1956).A complex puzzle box where the piecing together of plot is more important than the final results. Quentin Tarantino was influenced by this film because he uses the same techniques in his debut feature, Reservoir Dogs(1992). Another film where Tarantino again uses these techniques are during the department store sequence in Jackie Brown(1997). Multiple point of view technique I think is inspired by Rashomon(1950). The Killing(1956) and City on Fire(1987) are two of many films which influenced Reservoir Dogs(1992). Akira Kurosawa's work influenced many filmmakers including Stanley Kubrick. So basically this has the elements of Asphalt Jungle(1950), Rashomon(1950), and Rififi(1955).Montage was pretty revolutionary for the 1950s in comparison to editing style usually found in many Hollywood films from this decade. Many scenes flow along without any major flaws because of the crisp editing. What's different about this heist film compared to Asphalt Jungle(1950) and Rififi(1955) is its concern with the before and after of the robbery. Sure, there is a scene showing the robbery but not in such a detailed fashion like say the 30 minute Jewel heist of Rififi(1955). One humorous line of dialogue is spoken by Johnny Clay with his killing a horse isn't considered murder comment. Actors play their roles brilliantly especially Marie Windsor who has the Femme Fatale role down to perfection. A disorienting moment is the shootout between Val(Sherry's lover) and Geroge which is definitely a Kubrick moment.Sharp snappy and hard boiled dialogue were done by Noir writer, Jim Thompson who brings his motifs in a few scenes. Direction and screenplay are expertly handled by a master film director who is a genius at composing camera shots. The good camera work in The Killing(1956) was done by Wild Bunch cameraman, Lucien Ballard. Elisha Cook Jr portrays a meek and weak willed race tellar in the best role of his acting life. 1950s was the decade of the heist film with The Killing(1956) as one of the best. Most Noir pics from 1950-1958 dealt with people obsessed with committing the perfect robbery. Like most of Kubrick's films, The Killing(1956) does not end happily for any of the main characters.</fullReview>

Kubrick's influence on Quentin Tarantino is something I picked up on the first viewing (showing the events leading up to and including the heist, from the point-of-view of the different characters, was replicated by Tarantino to a degree in all of his films). But there is so much more here. A great nuanced performance by Sterling Hayden. Witty dialogue (worthy in spots of Billy Wilder). Edge-of-your seat excitement. But more than anything else, the film has moments of unpredictability. Despite the fact that I've watched this movie three times, I still can't remember what's going to happen next.

		<fullReview>One of the qualities of any good film is pacing - the way in which one scene captures the attention and draws the viewer onwards into the next scene, and so on. This is akin to the "page-turner" quality of a book. Very few films have ever been made with such perfect pacing as "The Killing" (off the top of my head, I can only think of "Goodfellas" and Hitchcock's "39 Steps").This is the story of an immaculately planned robbery of a racetrack, and the "run-like-clockwork" theme is echoed in Kubrick's masterful direction, the compact structure, the spot-on casting and word-perfect script. Sterling Hayden is perfect in the lead role as the smart-but-tough leader of the gang, Johnny Clay. Elisha Cook Jr. turns in a splendid performance as the little man pushed too far, and Marie Windsor comes close to stealing the movie as the heartless dame.Also a highly influential movie (e.g. imagine Tarantino trying to make "Reservoir Dogs" without having seen this first) - if I had to try to explain to somebody why I thought Kubrick was such a great director, this is the film I would use as an example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>in 1956 a youthful Stanley Kubrick directed a tightly-knit, fast-paced crime drama, called "The Killing." Shot in good black-and-white noir style, Kubrick and two associates crafted a sharp script that moved along smartly. A highly talented cast, headed by Sterling Hayden, Coleen Gray and Vince Edwards, breathed life into their looser characters--and Elisha Cook, Jr. and Marie Windsor created a model dysfunctional married pair. Lucien Ballard's cinematography was atmospheric, with interesting camera angles; and Betty Steinberg's editing was on-the-money. But it was Gerald Fried's original score that really provided suspence and tension, utilizing bold blasts of brass and percussion to punctuate the film's driving pace.This was a significant piece of work from this youthful director, and paved the way for a notable film career. "The Killing" today remains an engrossing crime study, and a worthy entree in the Kubrick folio.</fullReview>

This film is a classic example of "film noir", nail-biting suspense, and absolute shock at the unbelievable ending. Sterling Hayden gives a brilliant performance as a professional yet sneaky yet very intelligent crook who stages the absolute perfect robbery of a race track. I mean, this guy has it choreographed down to the last tense second. When I first saw this film on TV in the 70s before VCRs and DVDs I waited and waited until it came on again. You can watch this film over and over again and still be fascinated not only with the story but with the top-notch acting talents of Hayden and of "stand by your man" Colleen Gray, sleazy Marie Windsor and oh, so sexy-and-handsome-young-thang-back-then-before-Ben-Casey Vince Edwards in a minor but effective role as a crook, but who isn't working on Sterling Hayden's side. And the good-old whacked-out wimp, Elisha Cook, Jr., puts the icing on the cake. Even the smaller supporting roles give this film it's A+ quality. Oh, Stanley Kubrick, why did you have to leave us with crap like "Eyes Wide Shut" when you had this masterpiece to remember you by? Definitely worth a buy at the video store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favourite villains (Sterling Hayden: Asphalt Jungle, Dr. Strangelove) in Kubrick's first really solid film. Killer's Kiss (1955, Kubrick, also cinematography) was great too, but merely visually. The story of The Killing feels like pulp fiction and was obviously an important inspiration for Pulp Fiction (1994, Tarantino), because of the great structure of the story. I like to think that Kubrick was the first to construct a film that way, because after seeing it I felt that it would be really hard to tell the story of an organized crime in another way. The story shifts back and forth through the actual storyline, and even shifts sideways (Pulp Fiction anyone?). That in combination with the music makes this a unique experience, as most films by the versatile Kubrick. The comfortably jazzy background music is relieved with Gerald Fried's blasting score, to adrenalize Kubrick's distant observations of the crimes: as if he were a dozen journalists working simultaneously.Also, the dialogues are very ironic and seem cliche (Sherry: 'The punchline George, where's the moral of your story?' and Fay: 'I'm not a pretty girl and I'm not very smart, but...' make me laugh every time), but add to the sarcastic film-noir athmosphere. After Killer's Kiss, Kubrick is clearly on his way here to the surgical perfectionism he is known for. He didn't do his own cinematography as with Killer's Kiss: Lucien Ballard is responsible for that in The Killing, but I still say he should have done it himself, because the contrasty b/w photography of Killer's Kiss is really stunning compared to that of The Killing.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best noir films to come in the wake of The Asphalt Jungle(1950). The shift of points of views reminds me of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon(1951) where he uses similar techniques as Stanley Kubrick does here. The acting as a whole may be average but its the direction that makes this film a near classic. The Killing(1956) successfully fuses the narrative with documentary style filming. Sterling Hayden plays the same kind of character that he played in The Asphalt Jungle(1950). One of the many movies that influenced Quentin Tarentino when he wrote and directed Resevoir Dogs(1992). The best acting in the film goes to Elisha Cook Jr who is terrific in his role of George. A film that should be seen by anyone who's a fan of Stanley Kubrick or Noir films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a lesson for tarantino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing is a movie that everyone should add to thier `movies I have seen list.' Some have done this without knowing after viewing Reservoir Dogs, because Tarantino mimicked much of Kubrick's style and plot. If you have seen Tarantino's movie and liked it, The Killing will definitely be a good rental. Kubrick chose the novel Clean Break by Lionel White for the plot of his movie. The unique structure of the text is what appealed to Kubrick. The story of a robbery at a racetrack was told in fragments. It detailed one characters role in the crime and his reason for committing the act and then switched to another character at a different time earlier that day.This film was early in Kubrick's career but nevertheless a great work. It is very suspenseful and keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat because of the unique plot structure. It builds to a point of much excitement and then when the switch of character focus occurs, you can sit back and your seat and wait for suspense to build again. As in many Kubrick movies, he makes you want the characters to succeed, even though you know that they are criminals. He makes you sympathize for his characters, and I wanted to see Clay get away with the money. It is important to note that this ending would definitely not be accepted by society, for a message that crime pays tolerated. The film did not succeed very commercially which might be a result of the audience to which it was released. The choppy style may have been awkward in 1956, when it was released. I have viewed The Killing for the first time this year, and I am a result of modern cinema. The plot did not seem odd to me, especially after since I had viewed Reservoir Dogs many times. Audiences now would accept the movie more easily than those of the past. Regardless of the financial success of the movie, the product that Kuubrick delivers is always trustworthy, and I believe this to be one of his best.The only aspect of this movie that is improved upon in Tarantino's quasi-reproduction is the acting. Kubrick's actors were all great, but the dialogue was a bit cheesy or sappy, but the movies date of release has to be taken into account. Tarantino is a master of dialogue and a great director. I loved Reservoir Dogs, and after viewing The Killing, and comparing the two, I had more of an appreciation for it but more respect for Kubrick's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Kubrick not his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really enjoy this film until it reached the halfway point when things finally started to get moving and have a point. Sure, everything was set up this way to make it unique and at the same time, show us several people's story of the same crime, but it all seemed too jumbled together. The editing is definitely something different, but there are several times where short scenes with point, but no place, just interrupt the storyline. The cinematography is also quite interesting, but the acting isn't appealing at all. Kubrick's script isn't anything like a lot of his later works, which is good for a change, but the script was all over the place, meaning it was good at parts and odd at others. The Killing is worth a look, but don't expect the genius of Kubrick's talent as he shows us in so many of his later films.***?/5</fullReview>

It's a classic -- the movie that convinced me to start watching other '50s films noirs.From start to finish, you're on the edge of your seat -- and while certain characters are more sympathetic than others, there's no clear-cut hero or villain.Whatever you do, make sure you watch until the end.

		<shortDescription>One Of Kubrick's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Possible Spoilers** An ex-con engineers a race track heist in `The Killing,' a taut and suspenseful film noir from director Stanley Kubrick. Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is fresh out of Alcatraz after five years, and immediately goes to work on a job he figures to be worth upwards of two million dollars. He puts together a gang who are not real criminals, just `Some guys with problems and a little larceny in them.' Marvin (Jay C. Flippen) is good for some front money Johnny needs; George (Elisha Cook Jr.) is a cashier at the track, and Mike (Joe Sawyer) is a bartender there; Randy (Ted de Corsia) is a cop with loan shark payment problems. Clay's got it all figured out, a precision plan that can't go wrong as long as everyone does his part and keeps quiet about it, before and after. But George has a wife, Sherry (Marie Windsor), who wants nice things, and he can't resist the temptation to let her know it's all going to get better real soon. Trouble is, Sherry has a boyfriend, Val (Vince Edwards), who has more than a little larceny in him, as well. As it is with all `perfect' plans, there are, after all, imperfections. The presentation of this film is not one of them, however; Kubrick keeps the tension high throughout, working with a tight narrative and an out of sequence chronology through which he dispenses bits of information, building the suspense, until it all fits together in the end like pieces of a giant puzzle (Much the same as Tarantino would do with `Pulp Fiction' many years later). The stoic delivery, coupled with the stark black and white photography of the film, creates an almost surreal, fatalistic ambience that works so well with this material; especially at the end, for it underscores the climax and heightens the drama of the final moment, all of which makes for a truly unforgettable scene. The supporting cast includes Coleen Gray (Fay), Kola Awariani (Maurice), Joe Turkel (Tiny), and Timothy Carey, who makes his detached and indifferent hit man, Nikki Arane, one of the most memorable characters in the film. It must be noted, however, that Elisha Cook Jr. gives what may have been his best performance ever, here. His scene, after it all goes bad for him and he stumbles into his apartment, bullet holes in his face and wide-eyed with acceptance, to confront Sherry, is so cool and underplayed that it becomes one of the lasting impressions of the movie. Kubrick wrote the screenplay (with some help from Jim Thompson with the dialogue), adapted from the novel `Clean Break' by Lionel White. `The Killing' is one of Kubrick's earliest and best films; and it's not just for Kubrick fans or for those who love the `noir' genre. This is an excellent piece of work that will definitely be appreciated by anyone who likes good movies. I rate this one 9/10.</fullReview>

It had the added bonus of Colleen Gray, who I remeber from my MST3K days, apparently the role she played in 'Leech Woman' was one that was familiar to her.

It is pretty obvious that films like Killing Zoe or Reservoir Dogs got inspired by this one. Everything went perfect, I thought that it would be a perfect crime for Johnny...

		<fullReview>The Killing is a tight film. It presents its plot and moves slowly at first, introducing us to the players in this sordid tale. Then, on the day of the big race, the story quickly starts to move. A chain of events, meticulously planned, is set in motion and we want to see this plan happen. Along the way, there are little things that seem harmless at first, but then as the moment draws closer, gives you great anxiety. Kubrick balances the fragmented story well. He sets it up, then shows what happened a few minutes or a few hours earlier. Then he shows us what happens at that same moment, with a different character. Very well crafted, with a top notch script, and like all great film noirs, the characters are destined to fail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main reason I rented this was to see what one of Stanley Kubrick's earliest films looked like. And I must tell you, it's as good as anything he's ever done! To me, some directors do a masterpiece, while another one is a dud. No, not Stanley Kubrick! Everything he's done has been a masterpiece! He was a moviemaking god! And although this film was made in 1956, it was still strong enough to get me as wound up in it as I did. It's riveting, and cleverly told. This is a film Quentin Tarantino robbed from, with the constantly shifting points of view, whereas every character gets to tell his or her own version of the same story. We see the same incidents happening over and over again, but it's seen through someone else's eyes. And that is a very masterful touch to a film! And the ending has been imitated countless times in comedies, like "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World", with the big suitcase of money accidently opening up with the money flying like debris. If you are a hardcore Stanley Kubrick fan like me, watch this film. If you are not, you will be equally satisfied as a Kubrick fan!</fullReview>

Prime work from Hayden and Elisha Cook Jr., wonderful photography ("The Wild Bunch"'s Lucein Ballard, a great jazz score, and the tightest execution I've ever seen done in a film. There is not a boring second in this movie and once the crime is enacted, you become riveted. The overlapping sequences are fantastic. The way different stories overlap, is pure genius. Ranks as one the best films of the 50's, this underseen gem should be one of the classics of American cinema. Hopefully, on the heels of Kubrick's tragic death, the new attention brought to it will finally solidify its place in the American psyche.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not as highly regarded as some of Kubrick's later masterworks, The Killing is still a top-notch film in virtually every regard. With a time-fracturing narrative structure that would inspire many filmmakers to follow, the film reconstructs the details of a two million dollar heist set at a racetrack. Some people might be a little put off by the intrusive voice-over narration (which is the only really dated aspect of the production), but nobody will argue with the sensational cast, which includes a steely Sterling Hayden as the caper's mastermind. I love the truly strange Timothy Carey as the brutal sharpshooter and Elisha Cook as the cuckolded loser -- two outstanding performances in a movie loaded with them. The bleak, numbing ending is a total knockout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people make a big deal over the fact that Tarantino ripped it for RESERVOIR - but few mention the fact that THE KILLING is so far superior to that later film. Kubrick fashions his first masterpiece here, a taut, moody, cynical tale of criminals as chess pieces and a crime as a game. Visually, Kubricks obsessions can be found in almost every frame: Deep focus, moving camera, stacatto editing and framing that says more than any line of dialogue could. I'm sure the big moment when the heist goes bad was terrifying in the 50's...it even managed to grab a gasp from me when i saw it over thirty years later..With the exception of a few lines of drab dialouge, a nearly perfect film.</fullReview>

The story's about an ex-con (Sterling Hayden) planning a racetrack heist with assorted characters. It's tightly edited with a non-linear timeline, an unusual technique for the period. What a good cast, too. I'm not the biggest fan of Sterling Hayden but his laconic, almost wooden performance fits well here. Timothy Carey, Joe Sawyer, Kola Kwariani, Marie Windsor, and Elisha Cook, Jr. are all excellent. It's a movie that tries to be more realistic than what was typical for the time. Only real drawback is the monotone narration, which is annoying and cheesy. This also has one of my favorite movie endings from the '50s.</fullReview>

The use of shadow in the film added to the mystery of it all and the flashbacks helped tie everything together without giving too much away. This movie wasn't horrible to watch but, it's certainly not my favorite. It had the potential to be really good, but the lack of humor, depth, and drama held it back. The plot was decent, but it could have been flushed out more. I honestly wonder if the costume designers and makeup artists created Sherry's look based off of Betty Boop. George Peatty, played by Elisha Cook Jr., was such a sucker.

It doesn't have the unique Kubrick camera positioning, the attention to every detail, and even the exact music that will set the mood he wants. Truthfully, this movie could be directed by any other person. And based on that I give it an average mark. But little things like the weight of the money Johny has in the duffle bag. Kubrick would know that 2 million dollars in $20 notes would weigh around 200 pounds and the bag could not be tossed around as easily as it was.... Or the fact that the money was stuffed in to the bag in neat packets, but was all loose when it went into the suitcase.....or what about the obviously fake bird in the cage just before Sherry gets killed? Anyway, in 1956 film tape was expensive but this one will not go down as one of Stanley's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking Editing Makes Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In terms of complexity (and pardon the contemporary comparisons), The Killing falls somewhere between Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs and Nolan's Memento. The editing was a stark deviation from the norm; it was in no way chronological. Instead, the film jumped back and forth in time, depicting each character's take on the day's events. This, to me, was the most powerful and appropriate way to tell The Killing's story. Chronologically, the film would have been tedious and dull, and the ending would not have been nearly as shocking. Another aspect atop the list in terms of importance is the film's style. I suppose it fits the role of a "crime-noir." The film makes use of particularly stark contrasts in lighting between characters as a means to portray them differently and also make known the tone of the situation. Also, while the unorthodox editing was a nice touch, I did at times appreciate the narration, as the time-traveling could be a bit tough to follow. Truly a great film.</fullReview>

I thought there was way too much dramatic lighting, even though the whole movie is supposed to be dramatic. I wondered what the point of the clown mask was near the end but I couldn't really think of anything. Also, how did everyone in the room die from just about three shots? And at the airport, the suitcase was locked up tight so when it feel over there's no way it should've opened like it did. And the fight scene with the big guy was hilariously choreographed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing was fantastic. It was super exciting. It was the most complicated crime movie that I'd seen from before 1960. I thought that the intricate bank job plan was really interesting. All of the actors gave great performances and the characters were all very interesting. I especially liked the sharp-shooter character. I thought the way he spoke was cool. I'm not sure if that's the way the actor really spoke or if it was just acting. I liked it because it was interesting and I thought it gave the film some extra realism. Most older movies have all really sharp sounding actors and actresses, so it was cool to see some variety in The Killing. The film had fantastic parallel editing. The movie was able to show what was going on with every character without the film getting too confusing. The movie even jumped around in time at certain points, but because it was narrated everything was able to be explained to the audience clearly.The only thing that I didn't like about the film was the end, I actually found it to be a really detrimental flaw. At the end the character Johnny ends up with all of the money from the heist. He makes a bunch of ridiculous decisions and ends up having to let the suitcase with all of the money in it go through airport luggage instead of carry on. After all of his careful planning of the robbery it doesn't make sense that the character would be so stupid. The money gets exposed and he ends up getting caught. It seemed extremely forced, like it was only written that way to satisfy the hays code requirement that criminals have to suffer repercussions. And even if it was, it was still a lazily written seen. I really think the writers could have come up with something more creative if they'd have tried. Other than that I thought the film was really good and I liked it a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Kubrick's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE KILLING is a story about several guys who work together to pull a major heist. The group is led by the laconic Sterling Hayden and each step along the way towards the robbery is shown--often in non-linear fashion. For example, after showing what one character does up until the robbery, the film then backs up a bit and shows what another is doing just before this. While unusual, this style works just fine and was later adopted in other films. After pulling the seemingly perfect crime, it's interesting to see how things work out--a really clever way to show that at least in this case, you can't possibly work out every detail to perfection.THE KILLING is among the best Film Noir pictures and also among the best films of director Stanley Kubrick. It tells the story of a group who set out to rob a race track, but unlike many crime films of the era, this one is very minimalistic--straight and to the point, which gives it a heightened sense of realism. Much of this was due to the types of actors chosen for the film--Sterling Hayden and the rest looked more like real folks and played the parts simply and exactly. Much of it was due to the no nonsense direction by Kubrick, whose style was very different with this film than with his later projects. His later trademark was perfectionism--with scenes filmed and re-filmed innumerable times. Here, however, the entire picture was completed in about three weeks--showing that Kubrick probably should have trusted himself more with later projects since he COULD get it perfect the first time. The only negative at all about the film is the irrelevant and unnecessary narration--something that IMDb said that the director did NOT want and was added by the studio. It didn't help the film and actually served to distract.By the way, if you liked this film, also try watching the equally good ASPHALT JUNGLE--which also stars Sterling Hayden. It's a very similar film and just as enjoyable--though its reputation isn't nearly as good as THE KILLING's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubrick made this film before being stricken by what I call David Leanitis, a disease with no known cure in which directors who have done sterling work and enjoyed great success with 'small' films become susceptible to an overwhelming urge to do 'epic' witness Lean himself who made a brilliant and acknowledged all-time classic set largely in the confines of a railway station which served as a microcosm for the world at large but couldn't rest until he'd explored the vastness of 1) the desert, 2) Mother Russia and 3) the sub-Continent. If anything Kubrick went one better seeing Lean's desert and raising him outer Space. However The Killing stands up reasonably well after half a century albeit Kubrick more or less 'stole' the plot of John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle which was then some six years old. For movie buffs the cast is a dream from top-billed Sterling Hayden more or less replicating his role in The Asphalt Jungle with the minor difference that this time around he was the master-mind (a role played by Sam Jaffe in 'Jungle') instead of just one of the team, through Joe Sawyer, Jay C. Flippen, Elisha Cook, Jay Adler, Timothy Carey with a special mention for Marie Windsor as the femme fatale to end them all. It was made at the tail-end of the 'crime-does-not-pay' era or, more accurately, crime must not be SEEN to pay which means that there is a fairly risible ending in which Hayden, stuck with two million dollars in small bills buys a suitcase without bothering to check if it locks or even attempting to secure it with straps, etc, so that it can fall off the trolley taking it to the plane and burst open. Prior to that the planning and execution of the heist, shot out of context and beefed up by voice-over narration, had held the interest whilst being far inferior to Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge, which remains if not the last then certainly Next to the last word in heist movies. Certainly worth checking out of Blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugly as sin, and twice as fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Noir doesn't get leaner or meaner than Kubrick's exquisite 1956 racetrack-heist yarn. Other, earlier multiple-character heist capers from the decade ("The Asphalt Jungle," "Five Against the House") have the form down and are taut and well-made, but there's just not an ounce of fat on this one. Especially wonderful are Elisha Cook, born to play the patsy, as a sniveling weakling, and Marie Windsor as his scheming, every-line-a-quip wife; she's a poor man's Gloria Grahame and even more lethal. But the casting's wonderful down the line, with the fabulously creepy Timothy Carey (sort of the Steve Buscemi of his day) another standout as a racist, snarling marksman. Kubrick's taut screenplay fits together perfectly; 1950s audiences must have been startled by the back-and-forth-in-time setup, much imitated since, and the quirky, unexpected camera angles and editing. A too-bombastic score hurts a little, and lead Sterling Hayden perhaps underplays more than he should -- the don't-express-much antihero suits him well, but he's so expressionless as to read as nearly passive. But these are minor quibbles in a definitive, thrill-a-minute, low-budget piece that sets the bar for the genre very high indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how I missed seeing this one on its original release, but finally caught up with it last night and found it to be one of the most satisfying examples of a heist film that I've ever seen--and with an awesome ending.STERLING HAYDEN is the head of a gang that has every detail of their plan worked out so that they can share the loot at a racetrack at the end of the seventh race. He gives the kind of taut, bone chilling performance he gave in THE ASPHALT JUNGLE under another great director, John Huston. And it too was a heist film to remember.In THE ASPHALT JUNGLE it was Marilyn that filmgoers concentrated on when the plot thickened, and here it's MARIE WINDSOR, the hard-working femme fatale of the '40s and '50s who plays the seductive wife of ELISHA COOK, JR., a man who joins Hayden's heist plan in order to satisfy his greedy wife.Impressive support comes from TIMOTHY CAREY, STUART WHITMAN, VINCE EDWARDS, JAY C. FLIPPEN and TED DeCORSIA. But it's the fluid story structure that ties together all the elements needed to turn the film into a tense and powerful crime drama, aided and abetted by the precise camera movements, crisp photography and direction by Stanley Kubrick that turns the film into one of the finest film noirs of the '50s.***** POSSIBLE SPOILER ***** The ending is awesome and reminiscent of still another Huston film, TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE. Too bad Hayden was unable to improvise when his plan suddenly took the wrong direction and he had to use an untrustworthy suitcase to haul the loot.Definitely worth seeing--memorable film with an ironic ending.</fullReview>

Even though I'm not a huge fan for old movies, I thought that The Killing was a pleasure seeing. When I was watching the movie, it was almost as identical as "Reservoir Dogs." I mean I couldn't believe it. It had a robbery scene that turns out complicated just like Reservoir Dogs, it had flashbacks also and scenes out of order and things turned out bad. Besides all that, the actors were fairly good,especially Sterling Hayden and the movie can be quite bizarre at times but just remember it is, Stanley Kubrick directing it. So of any Stanley Kubrick fans out there, this is a good movie to not be missed, so I tell all of you to watch the movie.

		<shortDescription>Great Assault Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As always, Kubrick made a great movie. 'Killing, The' is a movie with an actual premise: a group of men united in a common objective - to rob a fortune for a big business enterprise (here, a horse race stadium). Hollywood still likes this kind of story (just remember the new version of 'Ocean's Eleven' with George Clooney and Brad Pitt and 'Heist, The' with Gene Hackman and Danny de Vito). 'Killing, The' is not just another entry in this genre. Kubrick give a slight but original approach in the narrative, showing many scenes of the drama in a unique moment of time. Pay attencion and you'll see the genious touch: the horses entered for the seventh race more than three times, and at each time a specific action (Hayden robbering the money, the shoot at the horse named Red Lightning). This simple way of telling a story tells us that behind the cameras there is a man who knows very well what he's doing. The movie has some little problems. Some actors give an overreacted performance that gives a far fetched aspect for some scenes, reducing its dramatic force. The actress that played the wife of Elisha Cook is an example. Anyway, Kubrick was never a great director of actors.A good movie that worth a sight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film that first brought major critical acclaim for Kubrick, and for good reason. Heist set in anytown, California, featuring an exceptionally strong performance by Sterling Hayden as the noble thief.After a mediocre opening sequence, with narration that I first found weak but which grew on me considerably, I was hooked on this top rate thriller! The plot unfolds on a need to know basis, and the film utilizes some interesting techniques in achieving this. A must see for writers. There is not a wasted moment as the plot moves along, which makes this a great counterpoint to heist films which feature too many plot twists (see previous reviews). This movie is crafty in its simplicity. This movie also features some finely nuanced acting performances. Most notable is Sterling Hayden, who doesnt range from his standard performance, but fits beautifully in this film. Also, look for Tim Carey as Nikki the thug. This actor has a fantastic ability to play a character who is at once despicable and crass or weak, but also so humane, or gentle, or lovable. If you are a Tim Carey fan, this movie features one of his most memorable performances as a hip young thug. His presence and the scene near the end of the film with the black parking attendant give the film a distinct feel of the American 1950's.This is a film dying for a remake, and by doing so I suggest only the most careful attention to quality as to respect the fantastic artistry of Kubrick and all the actors involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing is directed by Stanley Kubrick who co-adapts to screenplay with Jim Thompson from the novel Clean Break written by Lionel White. It stars Sterling Hayden, Marie Windsor, Elisha Cook Jr, Vince Edwards, Jay C. Flippen and Coleen Gray. Music is by Gerald Fried and cinematography by Lucien Ballard.Ex-con Johnny Clay (Hayden) has a plan to make a killing at the racetrack, with some special inside help he plots to nab $2 million in an intricate robbery. It looks a good thing, the right people are in place, but there's a potential spanner in the works in the shapely form of Sherry Peatty (Windsor), the unfaithful and devious wife of one of the robbers.Cheaply made by Kubrick and his producer partner James B. Harris, The Killing is a lean and mean mid 50's film noir. Poorly received at the box office and met with indifference by critics on its release, it's a film that has come to be noted as hugely influential; more so as Kubrick's reputation grew over the passing years. Clocking in at under 85 minutes, film is told in a fractured narrative structure that at the time was viewed as an oddity. Story is constructed around crosscut flashbacks as the robbery is planned and then executed, Kubrick's direction as meticulous as the actual robbery itself. It's not hard to understand why confusion was an issue back on its release, but now it comes off as something of a masterstroke. Even if Kubrick was forced to tinker with the final product, adding in a voice-over to aid those troubled by the nonlinear narrative (which the director despised).In spite of some problems, such as the cheapo sets and some stiff performances from secondary characters, The Killing is quintessential film noir. With Kubrick thriving on shooting his characters in cramped surroundings, the use of angles very effective, and Ballard photographing superbly for the low-key interiors, mood is perfectly set. Story is filled out with hapless characters, where destinies are defined by greed, betrayal and the devils trump card, that of bad luck. As is normally the case with the best film noir, it's a dame who holds the key to misery here. Sherry Peatty (Windsor excellent) is cold and utterly bitch like, and having a hold over her cuckolded husband George (Cook Junior never better) that would be easy to detest were it not for the fact George is so pitifully weak. From that coupling bursts a doom and bleakness that underpins the story, rendering the film with a fatalistic sheen.The Killing does have a dated feel to it, but only slightly so. While there's no denying that the budgetary restrictions, the voice-over and some less than good performances, stop this being the masterpiece of the crime genre some want us to believe it is. It is however a damn fine film, tense, exciting and very compelling, it does warrant a place on a favourite list of any self respecting film noir fan. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Noir Movie With a Non-Linear Narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a gangster who has just left the jail. He organizes a perfect timing heist to a hippodrome with a group of small-time crooks. He is successful in the robbery, but one of the members, George, spoils the scheme when he tells the plan to his bitch wife. She has a lover, who becomes aware of the intention of the gang, and tries to steal the bandits. The end of the story is very ironical. This great movie has all the elements of a film noir, like for example, the fatal woman, the dirty cop, sordid ambient and amoral plot. The black and white photography is magnificent. This is one of the first films in the cinema history, which presents a non-linear narrative, using different perspectives for the same event. In the present days, Quentin Tarantino `drinks in the same fountain' in movies such `Pulp Fiction' and `Kill Bill Vol. 1'. Highly recommended. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `O Grande Golpe' (`The Great Coup')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick made this film! You could have fooled me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Killing" (1956) Is by far the worst film Stanley Kubrick ever made. I completely under stand it was a B-movie and this was very early in his career but in my opinion this film is straight up terrible. The main problem is the film tries to follow to many characters at once. It also seems to focus to much on un-important characters and leave important ones with blank backgrounds or at least with major holes in their back stories. George and Sherry Peatty are the perfect example of getting way to much camera time. You would have sworn that they were the main characters even though that place is taken by Johnny Clay. The film also has this terrible narration placed in after post production because the people backing the film thought the films nature of jumping between characters all the time would be confusing. If anything it just made the audience think they were being babied and needed story direction spoon fed to them. The only thing this film has going for it are a decent overall plot, some strong performances by a few actors, and Kubrick's inventive camera work; including an amazing POV shot after a shoot out. I'd say stay away from this movie unless you have to watch it, but that's just one mans opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to think this film was really good, back in the day when I was younger and a devoted Kubrick fan. Now I'm at an age, early forties, where I'm starting to reassess his films. I just watched "The Killing" for the first time in more than a decade. This rather nifty little exercise in what's now called "film noir" benefits from clever and brisk editing and very good performances, but it suffers terribly by corny, cliched dialogue (mostly involving the women in the story) and unconvincing low-budget sets. This film should have been shot entirely on real locations, in real seedy apartments and horse tracks. Worst of all is a conclusion that makes no sense whatsoever. How the Sterling Hayden character can be so smart and professional all the way through, then be so incredibly inept at the end really renders the whole story meaningless, unless this story is supposed to be about a self-destructive loser, but we get no indication of that from what precedes. It also has dated, "Dragnet" like narration that seems out of place. I'd be interested in knowing how Kubrick later assessed this early effort. If you're attracted to old black and white heist movies, then you should find this one good, maybe even gripping, but the flaws I've mentioned really keep the film from ever becoming a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Killing has been a Kubrick film I've looked forward to watching. It takes my deep love for Film-Noir and my fascination with Stanley Kubrick and puts them together and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed, as if there was any doubt. Kubrick here presents a cinematic inspiration for those that followed in his footsteps. It's of no wonder that this film and its broken timeline inspired other filmmakers to present their storyline in a similar fashion. As a plot there isn't anything too special here, but like everything Kubrick, it's not what he's saying but how he's saying it. Visually the film holds together quite nicely and presents itself with low key lighting and very nice contrasts for emphasis. Your Kubrick catalog is not complete without The Killing, it's probably his most accessible film outside of Spartacus.</fullReview>

What it is, is a very interesting movie, however, I don't think it would get as much praise as it does without having Stanley Kubrick's name attached to it. This lacks the precision and style that Kubrick is known for, which essentially makes it another noir/heist movie from the 50s. What makes it worthwhile are the characters and concept of time.

		<fullReview>To be completely honest this was my least favorite film by Stanley Kubrick. Compare to his others such as a clockwork orange, 2001 space Odyssey , or even The Shining, I felt this one lacked the ability to catch my attention. However i was intrigued by the concept of having the plot come together in a non chronological order. I've herd that originally this film was intended to be a non-narrative however the production company felt that people of the time wouldn't be able to understand the storyline of the film. After watching it for the first time I can actually see where they were coming from. I really don't know if I would have been able to follow along with the story line without a narration, at least for the first time watching the film, and back then not to many people had the opportunity to watch a film twice. Aside from the non-linear plot i felt this film was put together very well. The angles of the camera work along with the shadows and lighting of the set really gives you a suspenseful and fast faced sensation. There is one clip towards the end of the film where there is one lamp hanging from the ceiling, attempting to light up the entire room. It gives off a very dramatic look. Another clip that seamed really interesting was the shot at the shooting range. The cardboard cut outs they were shooting at were at the bottom of the composition, almost giving the shot a frame or border. All in all i'd say this film was exciting and unique, just maybe not my favorite Stanley Kubrick film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the technical side of things, I was very glad for the narration. The temporal and perspective changes were occasionally abrupt and/or unclear but absolutely added a distinctive flavor that improved the overall taste of the film. Additionally, there were several instances where the camera would track or pan following characters while other objects (tables, chairs, walls, etc.) are in focus between them and the camera. This was perhaps a more realistic representation of how it would be if an individual was to track or pan in a similar situation, but also subtly seemed to jar a bit of the movie's verisimilitude loose.This relatively complex heist movie is interesting, but ultimately feels vaguely disappointing. Not due to the cinematography or plot, necessarily, but due to fate prescribed to the characters, presumably by the Hays Code requirement that every criminal pay for their crime. Sometimes, emotionally, we want to see something good (or at least to not see something bad) happen to a "criminal".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did not excite me, maybe it was the story line or the type of movie but I just could not get myself into it. Some parts were interesting, like the final scene where the main character has an "epic fail". That is something that was pretty shocking, seeing money flying from a broken suit case. But overall it was not my type of movie. The shadowing was really good though, the way it was mysterious. Other than that it was an okay movie and it was not so bad that I wanted to get out of class to go home. I could not relate to the woman character and normally I can. The way everyone died by the end was not shocking though because it was a crime movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing is a film noir directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1956. This mid-code era film captures the extensive knowledge and planning put in by a seasoned criminal to pull off his largest heist. The movie was filmed very well, keeping the dramatic and dark mise-en-scene. The integration of each character's role as a vital piece of the key to success sparks your interest and keep you on the edge of your seat. The typical film noir characteristics are apparent. The sets are dark and the actor's rolls are dramatic; wearing their emotions on the sleeve of their shirt. The lighting was interestingly done, directing your eye to where it's supposed to be. Definitely recommend this to any film noir fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The family had included a VHS Cassette of this film as a stocking stuffer about 5 or 6 years ago. It was a gift that wasn't forgotten, for prior to that time, this was a title unknown to me. We watched it a few times, enjoyed it, and like so many other titles, it just gets put away being more or less forgotten.Then, tonight, September 3rd, Labor Day, 2007, it was played on Turner Classic Movies. We looked at it again and learned a few things about its origin as an example of one of Stanley Kubrick's earliest films and the tricky path that it had in getting to the screen. Well, it did and thank you, Lord! THE KILLING, an almost generic title, came along in that period when Film Noir was tops. Brutal realism, ordinary people caught up in bizarre,extraordinarily grim circumstances. Most of the characters aren't really bad people, yet at the same time they lack any personal convictions, beliefs. This makes a person fall into that wishy-washy, whatever happens, happens types, lacking backbone.The script and story, from a Novel,"Clean Break" by Lionel White is among other things, a Caper Film. It makes use of one hardened bad-ass ex-con,Mr. Sterling Hayden, planning the tactical and logistics, while leaving the others all at least partly in the dark and mainly unknown to each other. It is obvious that there was real potential for a great film here! And yet, it was shopped around by Director Kubrick as a proposed film project. No Studio expressed any interest. Kubrick's stock had not risen to anywhere near the level that we think of it today. But the firm commitment of a top rank Hollywood player, or "Star" could change all that.Once Mr. Kubrick had inked Sterling Hayden to a contract, and financing came about by way of James B. Harris and Alexander Singer, the rest of the cast was filled by a mixture of veteran character actors and some up and coming types. Colleen Gray, Vince Edwards(Pre BEN CASEY),Elisha Cook,Jr.,Jay C. Flippen,Marie Windsor,Ted DeCorsia, James Edwards,Joe Sawyer,Bily Benedict,Jame Griffith round out the playbill. And veteran European Wrestling Champion, Kola Kwariani does a yeoman's job in his part as a rowdy, who creates a Bar Room diversionary tactical brawl.There appears to be very little(if any)use of Studio Soundstage filming, opting instead for location shooting; and excellent locations combine with fine cinematography and the glorious Black &amp; White photography, to give a fine, seemingly realistic, ripped right out of the daily paper film.The action and moodiness is greatly underscored and amplified by the Original Sound Track Theme and incidental music by Gerald Fried. It is at once intense, threatening and menacingly compelling.In one scene early on in the story, the main character,Johnny Clay(Sterling Hayden), describes his conspirators as "not being the real Criminal Type, but everyday working men, who all have a touch of larceny!" Hmmmm, is this food for thought here? Maybe it would be something like: There are Truly Evil People in the World, but those of us,who are kind of non committal one way or the other, the "Go Along Crowd", are the biggest problem, being the enablers. And it is these "common, every day types, who eventually turn into a pack of wild hyenas, loosing their savagery toward their own.After all, "If You Don't Believe In Something, You'll Fall For Anything!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's first masterpiece: a noir classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing can at the same time be considered Stanley Kubrick's third and first film: he had already directed two features (Fear and Desire, Killer's Kiss), but he wasn't too fond of them, considering them blunt, amateurish pieces of work and thus making this unconventional heist movie his first "proper" picture. And what a picture: filled with pitch-black humor from start to finish, it contains all of Kubrick's favorite themes (loyalty, deception and, ultimately, the uselessness of human life).Based on a book by Lionel White (adapted by the director with some help from noir master Jim Thompson), The Killing revolves, in non-linear fashion (hence Quentin Tarantino's decision to mention White in the closing credits of Reservoir Dogs), around a well-organized, audacious heist which will take place at a race-track. The mastermind behind all this is Johnny Clay (a great Sterling Hayden), an aged criminal who has just been released from prison. By knowing all the right people and making sure they will give him a hand, he is certain the robbery will be absolutely foolproof. But then again he hasn't taken human weakness into account: almost all of his associates are planning to get more than the share they have been promised, while one of them has been stupid enough to mention the job to his wife, prompting her and her lover to make plans of their own to run away with all the money.Someone once said Kubrick's movies have never been about people, at least not in a traditional sense: what he was interested in was the slow journey that inevitably leads to decay. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Full Metal Jacket and The Shining are good examples of this, and so is The Killing: the central heist is pulled off flawlessly, but after that everyone starts making his own decisions, leading to situations that are simultaneously sad and funny (especially the conclusion). In reality, Kubrick only made one "funny" film in his career, and that's Dr. Strangelove (although that movie is more dark satire than laugh-out-loud comedy), but The Killing's macabre humor contributes to making the atmosphere typically film-noirish, but not too heavily dramatic (even the classic Bogart suspense flicks had lighter, entertaining moments). Alongside the numerous time-shifts (supported by some of the best narration ever heard), it also justifies the film's status as a tame (in terms of on-screen violence and profanity) ancestor of Tarantino's body of work.In short, The Killing is essential Kubrick: perfectly crafted script, charismatic protagonist, masterful execution. What else is there to look for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perfect musical score by Gerald Fried</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been said about the clockwork precision of the acting and directing of this film. I do not think it would fit together without Gerald Fried's driving score.This film composer is not so well known as Bernard Herrmann or Alfred Newman, and I was surprised to see how many Star Trek Episodes he did. But then Herrmann did some of the best Twilight Zone music too.I note that others mention how exhilarating this film is, even if it is a depressing film noir story. It marches straight to a rather downbeat conclusion, but with horns blaring in a way I never heard. the music is not subtle but it is raw and triumphantly grim, and this music could have made a crude but powerful symphony.I cannot drive Fried's music out of my mind, but then I would never want to -- it is that perfect, and it is part of Stanley Kubrick's genius that he knew the right music for his films.If the same film had used mediocre music, I would not even notice it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..old crime thriller that is still enjoyable..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I have to join EVERYONE IN THE WORLD who says this is THE classic, film-noir of the 50s. I saw it tonight on TCM on which (author) Mamet said it was his all-time favorite. That's saying something from a guy who's written some pretty heavy stuff, himself.As I've written before, I am not a fan of any certain director/writer - it's the story that gets my attention. I remember when this film was first released, so I kinda knew the plot of "The Killing". I certainly think Kubrick knew what he was doing, but draw-back when people start writing about "genius". I've seen some of his later films, but think the actors/actresses added a little to the success of this film.Although I enjoyed Sterling Hayden's (Johnny Clay) acting in this film, he was from that gang of characters (especially in this film) who thought they had to deliver their lines as fast as they could get the words out of their mouths, a-la Richard Burton. As another comment pointed-out, the film was made on a few bucks - it showed, but it was admittedly a "B" film.......all of the other actors who played in so many of that kind of film were brilliant. Marie Windsor (the two-timing, greedy wife) was great in her role."The Killing" was of a race-horse, to create a commotion to make a heist of the race-track possible, as was several other situations, ditto. Every detail was planned to the nth degree, and it all worked in-spite-of the characters' personal problems and foibles. The lighting was excellent - but, I could have done with less of the score, which was seen by many to build-up tension. A little less noise so one could pay more attention to the excellent acting would have been o.k. by me.Lots of commentaries give full details of the plot, so read them, please. I'm not one to use the term "film-noir" too much, because I don't actually know what that means. It's French for "dark", maybe. "The Killing" was interesting to me for the simple reason it showed there are masterminded crimes, and some of them work.....and everyone played their roles well.This is another early movie which will let younger people recognize those films don't need all the colorful explosions, etc. "the Killing" was an appropos title - everyone got killed, except "Johnny Clay".Like other commentators, I knew the plan would unravel when I saw "Johnny" coming out of the pawn shop with a beat-up suitcase. You can guess what happened to the money.......but, at least, it's busting-open was due to an unforeseen, impossible-to-predict incident. That happens in real-life crimes - the best of plans are defeated by a tiny accident. Hurrah for Kubrick, but my admiration is for an excellent, working cast. A very entertaining film for a quiet evening.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent Film Noir, somewhat spoiled by the studio that prevented Kubrick from editing the film the way he wanted - the story would have been told in an even more non-linear fashion. As far as the experience goes, the side characters dominate, and particularly Marie Windsor steals the film every time she's in the picture! Her own favorite film was "Hellfire", and while it's true she had a bigger part there, her moments in "The Killing" are unforgettable, she IS the incarnation of the Sultry Mole &amp; the Femme Fatale. She is also the character who's actions actually causes the set-up of the plot heist to run off track, and is therefore the key character for the whole film. Supported by a memorable performance of Elisha Cook Jr. Great deliveries also by Timothy Carey and the always underrated Ted de Corsia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing, A Showing Of Early Stanley Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Killing is I think one of the most overlooked films Kubrick ever directed. With solid performances all round, especially from Peaty. The screenplay was amazingly written and very cleverly done in line with the book. The only problem I feel is the length, I thought there could have been a few more scenes from the book which could have been done amazingly and if those who have read the book and watched the movie they might know what I am talking about.Recently in a magazine I was reading I saw a poll on the top movies of all time. The problem was that people seem to go for the big favourites such as Cleopatra (Which was a 3 hour debauchery of cinema and the word plot), Gone With The Wind and Giant. Whereas great films such as those of Orson Welles, Stanley Kubrick seem to be forgotten and not awarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense, Interesting Story, &amp; Rather Creative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though at its heart a rather simple tale of crime and greed, Stanley Kubrick quickly establishes and then maintains a tense atmosphere, in telling an interesting story in this adaptation of "The Killing". The movie also has several creative touches, most obviously in its choice of narrative structure.The characters are relatively plain, but they are rendered believably by the cast. There was plenty of room to develop them more fully, but aside from Elisha Cook, Jr.'s character, the screenplay chooses instead to follow and highlight the events themselves. This might give it a little less depth, though it does make it easier to maintain the tension and suspense throughout the film.The back-and-forth narrative structure works pretty well, since the sequence of events seems to lend itself, at least to some degree, to a less straightforward story development. If nothing else, the approach seems a lot less forced here than it is in some of the more recent movies that have been made since the "non-linear" approach became so trendy.Sterling Hayden gives a straightforward but effective performance in the lead, and he seems well cast, given the chosen emphasis of the story. Highlighting his character's role also sets up an interesting and apt finale.There are numerous good sequences, combining creative ideas and good craftsmanship, and the story itself is wrapped up in a satisfyingly appropriate fashion. The whole might be just a bit less than the sum of its parts. It's creative, but least some of the time the creativity is for its own sake, rather than providing any extra entertainment or thematic value. It's still a solid classic of its genre, and it still compares pretty well with almost anything of the kind made in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And they're off...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In summer, 2003, I took a class called "Stanley Kubrick's Movies", and "The Killing" was the first movie that we watched. It focuses on a planned heist during a horse race. The opening scene shows the horse race starting, and the announcer shouts: "And they're off!" This might also refer to the people planning the heist. Leading the heist is ex-con Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden). He and his partners-in-crime plan the heist carefully, but they didn't count on one person.This movie has several identifiable features of Kubrick's movies. First, there's chess, which was Kubrick's favorite game. A meeting takes place at a chess club, and a heist is like chess in that one has to plan each move carefully. Also, there's an omniscient narrator, also present in "Barry Lyndon" and "AI".There is one scene in "The Killing" that seems a little silly (if you see the movie, you'll probably figure out which one it is), but the movie's really good overall, the way it contrasts the horses nearing the finish line while the thieves near their scheme's completion. Very intense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironic, Entertaining. *CONTAINS SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I had mentioned in my review of "Killer's Kiss", "The Killing" (1956) is Kubrick's first successful blend of art and entertainment. It's astonishing to see how in one short year Kubrick went from the amateur quality of "Killer's Kiss" to the complex frame work of "The Killing". Indeed, one of the qualities of Kubrick's film that separates it from other crime films of the time is its shuffling narrative structure. Sure, plenty of film-noirs had complex flashback within flashback structures before, but what was unique for "The Killing" at the time was that these narrative shuffles weren't flashbacks.  The shifts in time are an experiment in non-linear structure that create a new way to view an old genre: the heist film. However the structure isn't the only thing that makes "The Killing" supremely enjoyable. Great dialogue, and a wonderful sense of irony help as well.  Since the non-linear structure is the most noticeable difference between this and other films of any kind at the time, I thought I'd begin by discussing its use. I'm sure for an audience at the time, this radical departure from traditional cinematic story telling methods was a surprise. However, we are able to follow the plot with relatively no confusion. Only Kubrick himself seems to be confused at a few points: one, when two consecutive scenes involving the same character Johnny Clay, take place at the same time, and another when in one scene Johnny is "15 minutes late" for his rendevous with his cohorts, but in the next scene, taking place 14 minutes later, he is still "15 minutes late." This prompted some essays I've read on the film to question whether the voice-over that explains all this is "reliable," That perhaps Kubrick intentionally put them in there. In his book, "Stanley Kubrick: A Narrative and Stylistic Analysis", Mario Falsetto writes this:  "I believe that both errors are meaningful and that perhaps Kubrick is making an "authorial" comment through them. Both sequences present viewers with something of a dilemma. There is conflicting narrative information in each instance but no way of knowing which is the more truthful presentation. Whom are the viewers to believe? If they assume that, within the fictional world of 'The Killing', the omniscient voice-over and the fictional characters have equal status (that is, there is no reason to believe that one has more of a claim to the truth than the other), then there is no clear way to resolve the dilemma. The audience is given no further narrative cues to help resolve this dilemma, since the discrepancies are not referred to in any other part of the film."  Falsetto is probably correct in his theory. Kubrick was certainly an intelligent enough man to consider something like this. However, what would be the point of putting this in a crime film? Perhaps Kubrick was making a comment about how time seems to have no meaning in situations as intense as a robbery.  One aspect that I love about "The Killing" is the great dialogue. It is not the low key, realistic dialogue that I usually prefer in films, but rather highly stylized and obviously scripted. The film credits legendary pulp writer Jim Thompson with "additional dialogue," and I'm sure that he came up with lines like the one Johnny Clay says to Sherry Peatty: "Sure, I know your type, you've got a great big dollar sign where other women have a heart!" Sherry's first conversation with her husband George is also memorable: George asks Sherry what's for dinner. She describes all sorts of great food to him. "Sounds great," he says, "but I don't smell anything cooking." Her reply: "of course you don't, it's all still in the supermarket down the street." In other films, these lines might sound cheesy or over written. Kubrick however, chooses his actors so well, and directs the scenes with such speed and matter-of-fact timing , that everything falls into place and makes perfect sense within the world Kubrick has created.  The last point I would like to briefly discuss is Kubrick's use of irony. His first two features made some use of this, but "The Killing" was his first film to make full use of irony throughout the plot, something Kubrick would become known for doing in all of his subsequent works.  There are little ironic touches, such as the part where Nikki the rifleman is shot because he blows out his tire by running over the discarded horseshoe that he had previously declined as a gift from the security guard, then there are the major ironic plot twists: In his haste to make a quick getaway, Johnny packs his money in a broken suitcase which later opens up, spilling his money out onto an airport runway. Of course there are also ironic elements in the story that serve to illustrate perhaps a moral point. The only character who doesn't help with the plan is Maurice the wrestler. Although he is arrested, it had been stated before that he would only receive a light punishment for creating a distraction to enable the robbery. Since Johnny had already paid him his $2500, he is the only person to survive this ordeal with any compensation, which the audience feels good about since he is the only likable character in the whole ordeal.  Some critics have complained about the ironic touches saying that they are hard to believe and are heavily contrived. These people are missing the point. Like the statement I made about the dialogue, this is all part of Kubrick's world. The film is marvellously entertaining an exiting nonetheless.</fullReview>

I think that the acting comes off as overdone because the characters themselves are not very believable. The overall plot is very confusing, and made even more so by the announcements at the beginning of the segments. A subtitle for the timing would have been much more effective at the beginning, and then the announcing voice on the speakers taking over on the day of the heist. This confusion was one of the reasons I did not like the movie. A good movie should grab you within the first few minutes and this one started out so confusing that it was difficult to do so.</fullReview>

As far as the quality of the film visually and audibly I'd rate it an 8 out of 10 for some great shots and being able to capture the horse race sections that must've been very difficult shots. The sound was synced and sounded great as well.

		<fullReview>The Killing was an interesting movie I suppose, but nothing special. I found myself drifting of into thought for majority of the movie; it was not until the end that my attention was devoted to the film. It had a slow start and not much of an interesting storyline as it dealt with an everyday issue, but offered and impossible solution. Every scene seemed to be overly filled with drama, and the actors were not impressive at all. In fact the acting was so disappointing I did not even bother to look up who they were or what they performed in. As the story, or lack of story, dragged on it attempted to give off some excitement, but it was not until the last twenty minutes or so that I enjoyed any of the movie. Although it was a very impossible solution it was intriguing to watch as the men played out their scheme to rob the track. After the climax of the film the ending was dragged out just as the beginning, with an immature conclusion and a weak message.</fullReview>
