		<shortDescription>Beauty of a movie but something is missing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an almost perfect version of this well known story but my problem is that we do not feel the growing love of Belle for the beast too much. She's seeing in dreams who was the beast before, so we understand she can fall in love for who he was, but not too much for who he really is. If that makes sens. But all in all it's a very well made movie for all the family. The tone is a bit dark for little kids but always beautiful, as it's usually the case with Gans's movies. The use of CGI is obvious on the creatures, but it's done with good taste, IMO. It's a shame gans does not make more movies, I love his style. It's just that, after all this time waiting for a new movie of him, I wanted a little more substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good...not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story "Beauty and the Beast" is a classic. However, there is no one definitive version. Instead, it's a folk tale that's been passed down for generations until a very popular version was written by a couple women well over two centuries ago. And, since then, other versions have also been written. I mention this because if you watch ANY version of the story, you must accept that they will be different. This version is very different from the two most famous versions, Disney's and "Belle et B?te" (1946) by Jean Cocteau...and that's okay with me.This new French version is different from many other versions because it concentrates much more on the family's back story and how awful Belle's siblings are. This is a highly dysfunctional family and the father seems oblivious to the monsters he's helped to create. All are monsters, except for Belle. And eventually, you learn that the father isn't all that wonderful either. When he's lost in the forest in the cold, he seeks shelter in what looks like an abandoned castle. However, after eating like a pig from the sumptuous dining table, the guy begins stealing stuff from the place. He says it's because it's abandoned...but the food was warm and obviously the guy was just a thief. On the way out, he stops to pick a single rose for his sweet daughter--and that is when the beast appears and tells him of his punishment. He will be allowed to return home to put his things in order, but he MUST return to be the creature's prisoner. But, when Belle learns of this, she bolts to the castle--offering up herself instead. As for the rest of the tale, it's NOT what you'd expect. There is a story involving Belle's crappy brother and some money-lenders as well as the creature's back story. Unlike most versions, this one slowly reveals bits and pieces of this sad tale and exactly why he's been turned into a beast is quite strange. But again, since there is not one version of the story, such license is understandable.So was this film worth seeing? Well, yes and no. It's far from the best version I've seen but it is worth your time. Major pluses are how beautiful the film is in many places as well as a few changes to the generally accepted story. I appreciate how Belle's father really DID deserve to be punished, whereas in other versions Beast just seems mean and unfair in punishing the old guy. But, what didn't thrill me was the amount of extra story. With all the subplots and back story, so much of the romance between Belle and Beast is missing--and her falling for him seems to make far less sense. Plus, while some will love all the CG, I think after a while it was just too much--such as the HUGE creatures that appear at the end and start stomping on everyone as well as the bizarre crazy-eyed puppy creatures! I prefer a simpler version that is a bit smaller in scope and less intense. Call me a romantic at heart, but a bit less would have delivered so much more.By the way, the version I saw DID have English subtitles, but they were not very good in places. Once in particular, I would have misunderstood an important part of the film had I not understood what they were actually saying in French.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An opulent mess that's a feast for the eyes but completely misses the heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many versions of the classic fairytale of Beauty And The Beast - from operas and television shows to science-fiction re- tellings. The best-known incarnation of the story, of course, bears the Disney brand and features singing teapots and dancing candlesticks. It sounds ridiculous, sure, but anyone who's watched that film will know that it packs a genuine emotional punch. That's not something that can be said of this latest effort by writer- director Christophe Gans, an opulent, lavishly CGI-ed affair that hews closer to the original, darker story (at least at the beginning) but seems to have forgotten the heart of its tale along the way.The film opens on an elderly merchant (André Dussollier), who has raised a brood of narcissistic, spoilt children - apart from thoughtful, sensitive Belle (Léa Seydoux). As his fortune crumbles around him, the merchant stumbles into an enchanted castle, wherein he helps himself to plenty of food and treasures. The price exacted by the Beast (Vincent Cassel), mysterious owner of the castle, is a steep one: the merchant's freedom. When Belle arrives in place of her father, she finds herself both prisoner and guest - she's given beautiful gowns to wear and the run of the entire castle, but must spend every evening having dinner with the prickly and recalcitrant Beast. When the Beast finally allows Belle to see her family again, she inadvertently opens the way to the castle for people bearing prejudice, greed and, quite possibly, disaster.There's no denying that Gans' film looks good - Belle is draped in rich, velvety fabrics, ivory-hued statues lie wreathed in ivy and tears, and the castle stands starkly Gothic against lowering skies. Cassel's Beast make-up - which makes him look like a cross between a cat and a wolf - is decent enough, though it doesn't give him much room to emote. There are moments when the film and its ideas seem to flare to life too. When Belle dreams of the people who lived and loved in the castle before her, she becomes witness to a climactic scene in which a horrible curse is cast - a girl lies, dying and naked, on the ground, cradled in the arms of her broken prince, bleeding a gleaming, scarlet trail of blood. It's a stirring image that might give viewers hope that the rest of the film can be as good and as daring.But Beauty And The Beast seldom reaches those same heights. In busying himself populating the entire universe of his film with greedy vagabonds and comic-relief sisters, Gans forgets to enrich and develop the central relationship between Belle and her Beast. They share a few stilted, frankly terrifying dinners in which the Beast loses his temper or creepily breathes down Belle's neck. Slinking into her room to watch as she sleeps, the Beast comes across more as her pervert jailer than a legitimate romantic interest. In fact, none of their encounters suggests that Belle could ever find a place for him in her heart, so it's odd when Gans takes it as a given and barrels on towards his literally gigantic, CGI-overloaded ending.Indeed, Gans spends so much time on the visual effects of his film - from the droopy-eyed puppy-like creatures that trail after Belle wherever she goes, through to the huge stone statues that come to life to defend the Beast - that he seems to have forgotten to get his actors to act. Cassel and Seydoux, who have both delivered arresting performances in other films, don't seem hugely invested in the proceedings or in each other. The film as a whole isn't helped, either, by the dreadful dubbed version playing in Singapore - moments that might have felt more organic and engaging in the original French feel stilted and almost ridiculous when recited in either monotonous or heavily-accented English.Sometimes, it's easier to understand when directors lose sight of their characters in the flash and tumult of an action blockbuster - the focus, after all, is on spectacle rather than heart. It's less forgivable when the point of the entire story is the relationship between the two title characters. Without careful, gentle treatment, this centuries-old tale of Beauty and her Beast would have some pretty nasty overtones - which Gans fails to really remove from his film. In effect, his version of Beauty And The Beast is a love story without much love - and, as a result, isn't much of a story either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular foreign fantasy film on a par with American films Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie blew me and my wife away. Yes it's all subtitled but with the director of Silent Hill behind the lens this movie just screams masterpiece. The story is different on a better level. The cinematography and everything else was visually beautiful and Oscar worthy. This movie does not disappoint if you love movies with an actual story and characters. Christophe Gans could very well be Frances "Peter Jackson" or "Steven Spielberg". There is definitely something special about his directing and vision that is terribly underrated. I hope this film catches someone's attention here in the states because we need to hand him over some book series to turn into epic American films like he did here. Wife loved it. I loved it. I'd give it more than ten stars because of the quality and directing. Bravo France. Bravo. From America to your people we throw roses at your Beauty and the Beast masterpiece. ~ S A Storyteller</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning, but Sluggish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this French version of "Beauty and The Beast" for the most part. The cinematography and character designs are beautiful. I liked the fantasy atmosphere and sense of exploration in the first half of the film. I also liked the mystery of the Beast's origin.I appreciate the fact that it is more accurate to the fairy tale than previous adaptations. That being said, the second half deviates from the original story in a few respects and I found it sluggish in some parts. I found the final action sequence a bit too fantastical and left unexplained except via Deus Ex Machina. However, it certainly looks impressive. Ultimately, the film isn't perfect. The story has been done many times before and this rendition is sluggish at times. Never-the-less, I recommend watching the film for its stunning beauty alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, but empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Belle et la B?te is such a beautiful movie with high production values that it could pass for one of these recent Hollywood blockbusters picking up all those old fairy tales and turning them into live-action movies, but in fact it's a high-end French movie, so unfortunately not as many people will get to see it. Which is a shame, because it really is candy for the eyes. Although a good chunk of the movie is CGI, it really doesn't look like it, and most of the sets look real (unlike 'Maleficient', which also had beautiful imagery, but looked somewhat fake). The Beast's castle and surrounding gardens look magical, and the style reminded me a lot of 'Labyrinth'. The castle's interior decoration is so mesmerizing that it just makes you want to jump into the movie and explore it along with Belle. The music is also one of the movie's strong points, with melodies that really match the movie's beauty.Unfortunately, as beautiful and magical the movie looks and sounds, it feels quite empty. The story is a lot closer to the original tale than the Disney version, with a darker tone, but the love story was put aside in favor of showing the movie's aesthetics. Although the movie slightly dwells into Belle's life and the Beast's past, neither character really feels developed, making it unbelievable that they would fall in love. The movie strongly feels like a scene of connection is missing; one minute they're fighting, the next they're kissing, with absolutely no logic to their love story. Their love is never shown; you as the viewer don't see how they fall in love. A little extra 10 minutes to show their relation would have made all the difference. As it is, it makes no sense these two characters would be together. The Disney version did a better job at showing this.Nonetheless, the movie is still worth a watch for the beautiful visuals if you like the original story; it goes deeper into certain aspects of it, but sadly the love story was lost somewhere along the way. Too bad, because this could have been better than anything Hollywood could have brought us, if only they had put a little more effort into building the two main characters.</fullReview>

I loved them all, and finally the Closing credits was the biggest highlight which I watched over and over again and never get tired.Story we heard them in childhood, first I thought why French production team is repeating the same story which we have heard 100 times in our childhood time.I didn't plan to watch this movie.But somehow I ended up watch a trailer of this movie, in few seconds I was hooked into the movie.I always knew and heard, French people are perfectionist, what ever take, like Painting,Music,Cuisine even their kiss is famous all over the world. Director Christophe Gans is no exception in this matter.This movie will relax you from the fast forward life for 112 min. :- )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one is all beauty, no beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every few years, we get live action version of some of the animated classics from many years or even decades ago and 2014 brought us a new French approach to the famous "Beauty and the Beast". It is only loosely based though. there is no jumping candle holder or teapots for example and it is all much darker than in the original."La belle et la b?te" is directed by Christophe Gans from whom you may have seen "Silent Hill" or "Le pacte des loups". The characters mentioned in the film's title are played by Léa Seydoux and Vincent Cassel, yes in that order, despite Seydoux's complaints about the director from "La vie d'Ad?le". I think this is a good film for the whole family, except the very small ones maybe. It has been a long time since I watched the animated movie, but you don't need to be familiar with it at all to enjoy this one. Seydoux was a great choice for the lead character and it is no problem at all that her hair color differs strongly. She looks truly stunning here and plays the part convincingly. The landscapes are amazing to and turn this into a visual delight, the music was even more beautiful than you are used to it from french films and the story was thoroughly exciting. The result of all this are two very entertaining hours of movie action.One of the saddest scenes to me was the scene with the deer that turns into his women, the only one that had me close to tearing up. Cassel was a good choice for the beast character and these little dogs brought some comedic delight and helped efficiently in making this film not too serious. It is very hard to find a major criticism here. I guess the ending when the antagonist was devoured by twines did not completely convince me. After everything he did and how he almost defeated the beast by putting a knife to Belle's throat, I just expected something somehow different. It is difficult to put it into words. Also, I did not need the narration subplot, where Belle tells the story to her children. It was a bit clichéd I felt and these cuts to the future right between other scenes in the film did not work 100% well. Maybe the film simply should have ended the moment the beast transformed into a human or the moment he opened his eyes and started to breathe.Talking about the beast, I am a bit uncertain if I liked the looks of it. At the beginning I did not like it at all, but as the film went on, I got more and more used to it to the extent that I would say I even approve of it. Maybe I need to rewatch for a final verdict. What I will not need to rewatch it for, however, is the decision if I recommend the movie as a whole. I certainly do and I am pretty surprised this one got so many negative reviews from critics. Also all the other reviewers here on IMDb seemed to have enjoyed it speaking of the day I sent this review in. So give it a chance, I'm positive you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film is all Beauty, no Beast (The Majestic Love Story is Missing).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nice attempt by Christophe Gans, but certainly not his best work. The special effects are remarkable and the visuals are spectacular, but the movie has nothing much to offer other than that. The different take of the story might seem a little refreshing, but it lacks heart and soul, and the characters aren't developed much; one couldn't sympathise with or like any character in the film. Glimpses are given into the prince's life and his past, but nothing is done to develop his relationship with Belle; them falling in love doesn't make any sense in this story.Talented actors like Cassel and Seydoux are completely wasted; they're just there to look their part. But I have to say, Lea Seydoux's looks in the movie are synonymous with her character's name, Belle (beautiful).If anyone is a fan of the story, I would still recommend them to watch the 1991 animated musical instead of this one; it's better in every single way.Overall, the film is all Beauty, no Beast (the majestic love story is missing).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is another proof that French cinematography is on par with current Hollywood blockbusters in terms of CGI and outperforms them in storytelling. It might be wrong to generalize like this, but the previous sentence can't be negated in any serious discussion.Beauty and the Beast is, hopefully, a fairy tale known to everyone. Discussing the script or actors' performance would be beyond the point. The story is retold in a visually perfect manner. Actually, this is in line with movies in which a superhero does the same thing one more time, but with a different lead actor and targeting the audience that was too young to witness the previous installment.The best thing about this movie is the atmosphere. It is indeed a fairy tale, with some passion and some action, but it never becomes sleazy or boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating and enchanting fantasy, beautiful but not faultless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Belle et la Bete has all the whimsical magic and fantasy of a captivating fairy tale but with the humanity of a feature adaptation.There is just something about these fables that have the ability to touch the audience's heart. La Belle et la Bete (Beauty and the Beast) brings the French fairy tale to life in an equally as wondrous but more realistic manner than the Disney classic.American audiences will recognize the story without confusion as only minor changes are made with Christophe Gans's adaptation. A once prestigious and wealthy sea merchant (André Dussollier) is left disgraced and penniless when his three cargo ships go missing. With everything confiscated by the banks to compensate for his debts, the newly destitute family retreats to the provincial countryside. The merchant and father becomes lost when returning from a trip to the city. Seeking refuge, he finds shelter in a mysterious but magical castle. Overstepping the castle's generosity, the father must trade une vie pour une rose, a life for a rose.The French film La Belle et la Bete is what I had so desperately desired but failed to receive from Disney's Maleficent. Though it does not attempt to reinvent the tale from an alternative perspective, La Belle et la Bete does give audiences a refreshingly real story rather than a romanticized but far fetched fable.In every scene and with every single frame, director Christophe Gans captures the magical and otherworldly awe inherent in a fairy tale. The castle's fortress is a maze of crumbling corridors and overgrown staircases that we explore with Belle during the day. From the set design and landscapes to the opulent costumes and cinematography, La Belle et la Bete transports its audiences to a magnificent and enchanting fantasy land.In almost all regards, La Belle et la Bete is an overwhelming success but there are weaknesses in the narrative and film. The CGI is vastly inferior to the rest of the environment of the film and is a distraction. The writers and director do not take the added time to truly cultivate a love story between Belle (Léa Seydoux) and la Bete (Vincent Cassel). For a film that claims its genre to be romance, this is rather a large component and therefore complaint. Further the introduction of the Gaston character and eventual climax at the castle feels rushed and slightly out of place.La Belle et la Bete is a spectacular cinematic experience that should be voraciously devoured by lovers of the fantastical, especially children. (Though there is nudity, it is minimal, tasteful, unavoidable and completely nonsexual.) Please check out our website for all the recent releases reviewed in full.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic movie, it can bring you inside the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was amazingly made, and in every second, I felt myself devouring the movie with my eyes. Not even in one moment, I wanted to take a break and do something else. If you are feeling the need to distract yourself with something beautiful, then you found what you need.Everything since the soundtrack, the costumes, and landscape felt perfect. I was immersed in this magic world, for almost 2 hours, feeling all the emotions that the protagonists were showing, and for that I thank you Christophe Gans and crew. I am always searching for something like this, because it gives me what most people consider silly, something like - "Fairy tale hope".I loved this version that quite differ from what you can remember from the Disney's version. I liked that one, but this one is my favorite from now on.There is only one thing that I missed, and I really wished I had seen more : More scenes between the beauty and the beast, during their daily construction of their love for each other, before the ending.Oh, something else, I wish the movie had no ending. My eyes get tired of seeing disgrace everywhere, everyday. This is a divine delight for the eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In this live-action adaption of the classic tale, CGI is used throughout to help this version standout.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this was released before Maleficent, I must admit the use of CGI made me compare the two throughout watching the movie. I'd even argue that Pathe was likely trying to cash in on a new version of this story before Disney got the chance to. That thought aside, the major reason behind seeing this was without a doubt is Lea Seydoux, as well as Vincent Cassel who I haven't seen in a movie since Black Swan. But with a lot of new adaptations to classic tales due out over the next couple years, such as another Hercules and Cinderella movie, the question is: Does this movie make you think these classics should be left alone, or continue to be adapted for future generations?Characters &amp; StoryAfter multiple ship wrecks, and a promissory note unfulfilled, Le Marchand (Andre Dussollier) finds himself losing most of his wealth and being forced to live in embarrassment out in the countryside with his 6 children. Of said children, it is believed his youngest, Belle (Lea Seydoux), is his favorite and his eldest, Maxime (Nicolas Gob), his most troublesome. Why you may ask? Well, Maxime has a gambling problem and after Le Marchand is told he is broke, the embarrassment leads Maxime to leave and Le Marchand to look for him.Unfortunately though, unbeknownst to Le Merchand, Maxime's name is infamous to the point of possibly getting killed over. Especially by one man named Perducas (Eduardo Noriega) who has especially been looking to collect his debt from Maxime. But, before Le Merchand receives harm to his person, luckily he is given the ability to escape which leads him to meet Le Bete (Vincent Cassel). Their meeting though only comes about due to Le Merchand seeking more beyond the gifts Le Bete bestows him and looking to get a rose for his dear Belle. So, in exchange for the rose he must offer a life, and with Belle being the guilt ridden daughter she is, she switch places with her father and we live out the classic tale.PraiseLet me start off by saying I have not read the source material for this movie, so I cannot tell you whether this is a true adaption of the original story or not. However, I can say that in comparison to the cartoon version this film does present quite an interesting story. For while the film surely could have cut down how many children Le Marchand had, they do add a bit more oomph to the tale.Focusing on Belle/ Seydoux though, I do find it quite wondrous how even with this being only the third film I've seen her in, that she seems more versatile in her movie choices than a lot of actresses nowadays. For in Belle she has a very classic feminine look and persona, though a bit of sass and resiliency to keep her from becoming a bore. Then, with Cassel as La Bete, I loved the fact they really gave us a well told back story on the beast since the animated picture omitted any reason for why the beast was cursed. But this film corrects that mistake and creates quite a nice love story when it comes to La Bete's first wife and then his love which blooms with Belle.CriticismIn the intro I made a comparison to Maleficent, due to the use of CGI, and both films being adaptations of classic tales. But, what wasn't mentioned is that while Maleficent uses CGI well to enhance and forward the story, CGI does nothing good for Le belle et la b?te. If just because there is such a misuse of it, in my opinion. For example, in the film CGI is primarily used to animate Gremlin like puppies, and to animate these grand scenes in which la b?te fought, or threatened, people using giant statues. In both cases you are lead to wonder why this was done for the story. For while dogs were important to la b?te in his human life, it did leave the plot hole of wondering who was cooking these grand meals he and Belle had. Then, when it came to the statues, I didn't understand why la b?te had access to their powers, and why they protected him, especially considering he was supposed to be punished for what he did. And really, considering how ferocious they made him out to be, it would have been cooler if they had him hunt down Perducas' men as they stole from him over using what likely was expensive visual effects to create these stone creatures.Leaving one last critique: In the film there is this odd sense of time presented. Seasons change every few scenes from winter to spring and back, yet the film makes it seem that la b?te's castle doesn't take months to get to, but merely hours. So, while I'm not usually one to notice consistency issues, this one was just glaring straight at you.Overall: Worth SeeingHonestly, I am really tempted to say this is "TV Viewing" for the solely due to the film's odd use of CGI. For it really doesn't add much to the story, outside of a few select instances. But with the performances from the actors being good, the back story of la b?te providing us with a nice sympathetic tale, and Seydoux's grace, beauty and performance embodying the perfect Belle, I find myself labeling this as Worth Seeing. And I truly hope in future adaptations/ remakes, of classic tales, there is a similar tone and focus on story as this film has, with hopefully CGI not being used as much in a wasteful manner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a fairy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You probably have heard the story more or less, so you'll know where this is heading. Therefor the flashbacks might either work, because the movie establishes two time-lines (three if you take the storyteller into it) and the movie jumps forth and back. It's nicely told and it does have very good visuals.We get some fine french acting talent, with one from Spain thrown into the mix for good measure. Acting talent is up for it then, but might not make up for the predictability of the story. While there is no full nudity, there is a lot of skin shown, which is OK in Europe, but I'm not sure how it'll play over in America. Just be aware of that. Other than that, some CG looks a bit "cheap", but overall the fantasy aspect works in its favor (and it is aimed at the little ones, who are listening and kind of take the part of the viewer). Nice little touch at the end</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gans and Cassel really try. But did it work?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In France's long held cinematic tradition (famously, they made adaptations back in both the 20s and 40s to much acclaim) comes a new version of the famous fairy-tale-novella about beauty, romance and redemption. Really, what do I need to tell you about the plot?Director Christophe Gans is certainly an interesting cookie, having helmed Brotherhood of the Wolf (a pseudo period piece-Hammer throwback-martial arts film) and the first Silent Hill (which seems to have garnered a sizeable cult following in recent years). He's sort of a French Burton-Snyder; a visual stylist who does a lot of genre work. Indeed, the nod to Burton is apt as it's pretty clear this exists to be the French answer to Alice or Oz, a lavish fantasy reinvention. But, how do the frogs cope? Not half bad actually.Off the bat, the film is breath taking. The style takes from classic watercolour paintings and it gives the film such a vibrant gorgeous storybook feel, like the illustrations in one of those old leatherbound tomes. If one could guess what DelToro's Beauty would've looked like, this is not a bad approximation. What's more, CG aside, the Beast also sports some pretty decent practical makeup that does a good job conveying what a humanised lion may be like. Speaking of which, Vincent Cassel as the Beast is probably the strongest performer here; even under the makeup, he gives the role a ruthlessness but also gentility that perfectly fits the characters, and being tall certainly helps. Nothing against Lea Seydoux, who is perfectly fine as Belle, but this is Cassel's show.Now of course, the film's somewhat mixed reception isn't unjustified; it does run on fairytale logic, which doesn't make the smoothest transition to screen and sometimes has characters do things just because. Then there's also these weird cartoon dogs which, though they have a justification in the film's world, they feel completely perfunctory; they don't fit with the Gothic atmosphere, they're more odd than cute and they aren't even really out to be funny, which you'd think would be why they are included. Also, if you thought Gaston was goofy, here we have a robber baron with a gypsy-fortune telling girlfriend who has actual psychic powers. Oh, and the final battle involves stone giants (hmm, did Aronofosky get a sneak peek?) and living roots that turn people into trees. Yeah....But honestly, I found myself surprised by this one. Yes, it may not be very bountiful from a writing standpoint, but Gans' tricks and Cassel keep things constantly going and certainly with a lot more liveliness than Burton's rather dour 'Alice'. It won't wins prizes for bold new thought, but it's still a fairly impressive piece of larger scale filmmaking from Europe, and decent take on the famous story if you're maybe tired of talking candles and LeFou.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where can I watch this movie again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this at a friends house, have no idea how they got a copy. It was in french with no subtitles. What an absolutely gorgeous movie! I really can't even find the words that would do justice to the sets and costumes. Never have I seen such detail. The costumes, the flowers, the storybook transitions and the wonderful actors! I would watch this movie several times a year just because it truly is a magical experience. I keep trying to find out how I can buy a copy with subtitles, or where I can see it on the big screen. But, I find nothing? Why? Was there a dispute over distribution or rating? There is one scene with some nudity, but it perfectly fits and is an innocent scene, nothing that would disturb a 10-12 or older. I really can't say enough about this version of Beauty and the Beast. The french have captured this story to almost perfection, from beginning to end. I cannot wait to see this again and shall continue trying to find a copy to purchase for my library. One of my favorite movies of all time now. It seems amazing to me that this movie was not released in the US and still I am not able to purchase a DVD, it was released in Feb 2014? Sure would love to know why...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. If you are looking for dancing tea cups or singing candelabras, you've come to the wrong movie. If you are looking for the Gothic approach to the dark psychological analysis of the original story ? again, you've come to the wrong movie. Director Christophe Gans (Silent Hill, 2006) offers up a version that is neither animated Disney (1991) nor Jean Cocteau (1946), though his film does have a visual flair that will likely keep audiences (it's not for very young kids) engaged throughout.The familiar story was first written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villenueve in 1740, however, it's the revised version from Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in 1756 that provides the fairy tale/fable that has been filmed so many times since. The story's genealogy based in France instills a bit more hope and responsibility in a project starring Vincent Cassel, Lea Seydoux and Andre Dussolier, and directed by the Frenchman Gans.Ms. Seydoux is an admirable Belle, and her grace and beauty make for quite the contrast to her needy and entitled sisters. Her time in the castle with the Beast is limited, and therein is the film's biggest weakness. We never really see the transformation of the Beast to a man who repents, turns over a new leaf, and is worthy of love ? it all just kind of happens thanks to the beautiful dresses. Mr. Gans and Sandra Vo-Anh co-wrote the script, and this misstep deflates the core of the story. We are on our own to interpret the messages of class warfare, greed, and judging others by looks. The focus instead is on the visual presentation, which at times is spectacular.The set design and costumes are especially impressive and elaborate, and though the look of the Beast may not be precisely to your imagination, the film isn't shy about putting him front and center with the camera. Vincent Cassel's time as the Prince is pretty well done, and the CGI and explanation of the gold doe, nymph of the forest, magic healing water, pack of beagles and the curse are enough to move the story along ? even if some details are lacking.A bedtime story being read to two young kids is the framing device and might explain why the fantasy world is emphasized over the dark psychological undertones (more prevalent in the Cocteau version). While some might view the ending as somewhat mawkish, it's really nice to see happily-ever-after is not twisted into some contemporary take on independence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'La belle et la b?te' (2014).First time I saw this movie I had Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' (TOP-class) too much in my mind. I disliked 'La belle et la b?te' (2014). But the last one kept spinning in my head. After 3 times looking at this movie and trying to understand the French version (Dutch subtitled) I must say it is at least worth an 8-stars score. 'Two' points missing because of the too heavy 'anger wood' scenes in the end. 'Lord of the Rings' type animation. And so ending too far from the French fairytale. Other comments may be: Belle, Léa Seydoux: Typical French beauty with sad eyes. Beast, Vincent Cassel: Not the best casting choice. 'Little doggies' in the castle are weak animations. Belle's two sisters, 'too dombo' casting and too much dressed down. Holding a golden arrow in her hand on her dying ladies body is 'cheapness' and far from 'reality'.But, still for me this movie is a must have in my library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I am rating this movie is because the movie has got very low rating. I absolutely loved the characters, graphics and the actors. I have seen the movie about three times already! I made everyone I know watch it. I would have rated it 10 on 10 if the chemistry shown between the two was more vibrant and also the ending was redundant(you will know what I mean, when you see it).I was blown away by CGI. If you have liked Tangled or Anastasia, you will like this too!Must watch if you like fairytale movies! This is one of those FEEL GOOD MOVIES.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been stunned by the brilliant fluid direction of Gans with every movie I have seen of his. Even though this is in the French language and I watched with subtitles I found that the narrative is mostly visual so the small pieces of voice are easy to digest in the subtitles without taking your eyes from the main action on screen.Without giving too much away I was taken in by the story which is a complete reboot of the Beauty and the Beast tale and takes the viewer in new directions. The stunning CGI is clearly above the usual Hollywood standards we would otherwise be forced to endure. Hats off to France for that. The rendering of the deer was just captivating and you can get lost in the the landscapes and sunlight. The light and colour and texture at times makes you feel like you are watching a living breathing painting that is hyper-realistic. If you are a fan of Werewolfe type change sequences you will not be disappointed by the delicious long moments of change offered here.Disney have tried and failed, in my opinion, to capture passion that this film portrays with offerings like Return to Oz where they piled on so much dark that you feel like you have an icky taste left in your mouth and wonder what Disney were trying to do - were they genuinely trying to scare us and depress us.However this movie leaves you with no bitter tastes and although probably isn't suitable for children its a fantasy for Adults. Something Disney seem to strive towards but always fall short of with flat stories and predictable characters. They should take a leaf out of Gans book - or even better EMPLOY HIM. He could dig Disney out of a boring hole. Just a suggestion. Another superb Gans film not to miss is Lucy - much like this movie one to unplug your brain to and just sit down and enjoy. If you haven't seen Le pacte des Loups - you have not lived!Well done France for your new wave of CGI - possibly second now to New Zealand for stunning CGI with Hollywood coming in third.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy on the CGI, there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked "Alice in Wonderland" (2010), there's a fair chance you will like the 2014 version of the traditional tale of Beauty and the Beast, too. While it's not directed in the spirit of quirky Tim Burton extravaganzas, it shares a problem of recent Burton work: overindulgence of colors &amp; effects - and emotional underachievement.While certainly great to look at, with many spectacular set-pieces, the film makes it hard for viewers to emotionally bond with the characters. The cookie-cutter good-and-bad separation of Disney movie characters is replaced by somewhat flawed human beings (e.g. the prince is an animal-killing rogue, much to the dismay of vegetarian princess Yvonne Catterfeld), but the film's artificiality is too in-your-face to be overlooked. Probably a matter of taste - how realistic does a fairy tale need to be, really? I would have been happier with a slower pace (I'm not 21 anymore), and cringed at some of Gans' choices to update the story (such as the castle's bizarre anime-fied CGI beagle dogs, a Jar Jar Binks kind of addition that does not help to bring us anyone or anything closer at all).The heaving cleavage of Miss Seydoux is a sight to behold, shown with a frequency that might irritate audiences accustomed to sexless princesses, but it's just a choice of wardrobe, not a case of leering camera. Seydoux' sensual presence is a gift for the film. Strong dialog is not the main focus here, but she gives a convincing physical performance and gets the nuances right. Cassel doesn't have much to do here.Belle's relationship to the beast is depicted (ever so) slightly different as in previous romance versions of the fable. This I liked. Ultimately, far from a masterpiece, and hardly an evening-filler, but a good choice for a rainy afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of Cocteau Classic is more B?te than Belle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alex Farba-Deleon at the 2014 Berlin Film Festival. It's a sunny Valentines Day in Berlin, Day number 9, as the festival goes into wind down mode with a new edition of Beauty and the Beast. Two quick obituarial notes; the passing of two show business legends this week: Sid Caesar, 92, the great comedian of the early b/w television days and Shirley Temple, 85, child star of the thirties who was the highest paid actress in Hollywood in 1937 at the age of nine. At the height of her career bouncy dimply Shirley was a dancing singing flirtatious little pre-Lolita who brightened up the dark days of the Great Depression for Americans in the thirties."La Belle et la B?te" (Beauty and the Beast) is more or less a remake of the famous French film of the same name made immediately after the war in 1946 by surrealism maestro Jean Cocteau starring his beautifully handsome boyfriend Jean Marais. While the Cocteau master piece was a fantasmagorical dream in black and white, the current picture is an overinflated special effects nightmare in overrich color in which "Belle" (Léa Seydoux) is neither very beautiful nor very seductive, and "B?te" (tough guy actor Vincent Cassel) is far more beastly than the sensitive Prince Charming of Jean Marais. The momentous special effects actually overwhelm the story and ultimately bombard the viewer into a state of numbness. Director Christophe Gans is basically a horror specialist and has turned this famous French fairy tale into a horror spectacular that screams out loud for a 3-D treatment. Assessment; aaaaaarrghh! GIve it four stars out of ten for some dazzling lens work and the sincere effort on the part of the actors in the face of a hopeless task.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rushed ending, a real letdown especially when it started with much vigour!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just the first two minutes of the start of the movie had me excited out of my seat! It really was beautiful and intriguing, by the time minute 5 rolled about I've already tweeted to my friends to go catch it, praising the movie to be divine! The movie was shot beautifully, the music was romancing and the actors brilliant. The problem that this movie had was sadly the pacing. The director and screen writer had spent so much time developing the characters that I ended up relating more to Belle's family than the other important character, Beast himself! They missed out on the creme of the cake, Belle and Beast's relationship. It felt unreal that Belle so easily admitted that she had fallen in love with Beast when there wasn't any real moments in the movie that lead to explaining how this had happened. This movie is after all called, "Beauty AND the Beast," not "Week out with Belle," Luckily the stunning visuals and powerful leads helped save the movie albeit the ending felt rushed and a letdown. If you're going to see this, don't expect your typical romance but enjoy it for what it is -a feast of visuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty and the Beast flourishes with visual pizazz but flips, flops, and fails on every other level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some 70 years before German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm created fairy-tale characters Rapunzel, Snow White and the rest, French novelist Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve wrote and published Belle et la B?te ? the original fairy-tale we know as Beauty and the Beast. As a Franco-German production dubbed and retitled in English, that's about the only thing original about this 2014 remake Beauty and the Beast.Prince Charming is a beast, we already know that. But does he have to be boring too? Apparently, co-writer and director Christophe Gans seems to think so. Before deviating from the 1740 incarnation of the titular fairy tale, Gans' begins his story on familiar ground. A wealthy merchant (André Dussollier) has lost his ships at sea and moves his three daughters and three sons to a cottage they all hate but one that I can only dream of owning. The first deviation is the three sons, a subplot that gives rise to generous CGI meant for the action finale. But before that we learn that five of them are spoilt brats that would tell peasants to eat cake when they can't afford bread. Belle (Léa Seydoux), the youngest, is the only one with a heart of gold. While her siblings miss their former wealth (and cake), Belle is content with feeding them vegetables from her pumpkin patch. So when daddy goes into town, Belle only asks for a rose, while the rest asks for the moon (and cake). Of course, daddy ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time and then plucks the best rose. We know what happens here on. The rose belongs to a wretched beast who spares daddy's life only to hold Belle ransom until she gives in to his manly demands. And to think this story is being told for generations to children before they go to bed! It takes a few yawns and couple more winks before we actually see the beast, a CGI spectacle that's bound to knock Andy Serkis into uncontrollable spasms of laughter. Vincent Cassel plays a sheep in beast's clothing with as much tenacity as a wolf stalking a snail. Conversely, the only times he seems threatening are during flashbacks where we see him in human form as a spirited but arrogant prince. These flashbacks are shown as Belle's visions. She's bored (like us) and wanders around the desolate castle until she finds a huge mirror that never comments on her beauty (which is fine because the talking mirror belongs in a Grimm's fairy tale). Instead, she sees the man behind the beast and secretly feels the hots for him. Well, not really, because Gans deviates again, and instead of the originally themed romance, we get a mangled face-off between the aforementioned brothers and a bunch of villainous thieves. Owing to which, Seydoux and Cassell have little screen time together and never enough reason to emote. It's almost as if Gans has forgotten where the story must ultimately converge with the original and central theme of never judging a book by its cover. By this time Gans has also arm-twisted the story to reveal the mysterious spell that turned the Prince into a reclusive creature. It's a twist revelation but one that feels snatched out of a tragic Greek love story.If ever there's a dire need to watch this film, it would be for Christophe Beaucarne's stunning cinematography - a technical feat that somehow works in tandem with the heavy use of visual effects. Some of the backdrops are almost as impressive as those created in The Hobbit films and that's saying a lot. The other reason is watching Belle's transformation into a bodacious babe. Like my running 'cake' gag, Belle has her own - an array of bejewelled gowns she must wear each day at the dinner table to please her lord and beast. Forget about true love and all that jazz, the sight of bodice meeting bosom can transform any man into a beast!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Divisive Fantasy Epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christophe Gan's has made a very big name for himself off of just a few projects. CRYING FREEMAN, a hit in it's native France, is a love letter to the violent hong Kong action thrillers from the 80's. There's even kung fu! But it being a film made and set in modern day France does make one scratch their head. His follow up BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF took a well known and fascinating piece of french history and turned it into everything. No really, LITERALLY everything. The kung fu Gan's is clearly so enamored with but also Gothic horror complete with seedy brothels, secret assassins disguised as prostitutes (sent by the pope no less!) and more smoke, fog, and multi colored shafts of light than a Lady Gaga concert. He even films all the period costumes and Asian influenced battles in Matrix style slow motion. Lens flairs and gaudy unrealistic (but gorgeous) filters. There are folks out there that will take one look at a native American in a loin cloth running up the side of a building and roundhouse kicking three bad guys while doves fly across the screen and just roll their eyes. It IS ridiculous. It is over the top and not for one second realistic. But what his films lack in common sense, they more than make up for in sheer stamina and passion. Nobody pays for UNDER the top. This is a director that wants to make you FEEL, not think. His Silent Hill was his most divisive film yet. It isn't just unrealistic, a trait most horror film fans can look past. It's ANTI realistic. It almost seems to purposefully want to confound and irritate. The vague religious themes never really seem to go anywhere, and the sudden explanation of a Cult being behind everything just seems pointless and out of left field, because non of it adds up anyway. But once again the visuals are unmatched. The Sheer amount of atmosphere thats pumped into every scene in the film is a sight to behold. So it would seem that IF you were crazy enough to adapt Beauty and the Beast once again, you'd need someone as crazy as Christophe Gan's to do it. As expected, what he delivers is odd, idiosyncratic, and if your willing to go along with the ride, the most audacious movie he's done yet. First off he's adds some nice character moments that didn't exist in the admittedly slight original material. Belle now has some siblings that come into play towards the end. The Gaston role now has some more meat to it. The beast himself gets the biggest upgrade, with a much more heart breaking and layered back story that goes a long way to help invest in the character, where originally Belle was always the only real concern to past story tellers. However pleasant these additions are, they never amount to any seismic shift in the story itself. It's the same one you've heard and seen before. Where Christophe chose to add his trademark flair is of course in the visuals. Not just to atmosphere this time, here he visually insinuates quite a lot of subtext. It never occurred to me until this version just how sleazy it is that a father would let his daughter give up her chastity, and freedom, TO AN ANIMAL NO LESS! This is also the first time I've seen this tale bring up the notion that just maybe Belle isn't in love with the beast at all, and is just suffering from Stockholm syndrome. Interesting ideas, and certainly these kinds of things were tucked away in the crevices of the original fable, but never have they been brought out so vividly. It's easier to gloss over that stuff and water it down for the kiddies. This is where the film will get divisive for some audiences. Christophe films this movie with all the crazed energy of those old HAMMER British horror movies. Stormy nights, foreboding castles, a menacing beast. The story never calls for anything as graphic as what he's done in the past, but that doesn't mean he censors himself either. There is so much cleavage in this film, I'm honestly convinced I saw areola......on SEVERAL occasions.No matter anyway, there's also a sequence that involves a fully nude woman. It's not in a sexual context, and nudity is per the course for Gan's, but in a kids movie? And thats precisely what this is. Belle's siblings are goofy and obnoxious and slapstick. The Beasts castle doesn't have plates and dressers come to life, but it does have a litter of cute and adorable puppy/gremlin creatures that really serve no other purpose other than to be cute and adorable (and I'm sure in France right now the toys and merchandise is flying off the shelf). Fans of CRYING FREEMAN are probably not going to warm to these elements. Conversely I'm not sure what parent in their right mind would let their kids see full on nudity or sit through the long passages of Belle turning down Beasts sexual advances. Oh I almost forgot, though nothing is ever explicitly shown, there are SEVERAL "rapey" moments throughout the film. In the past Christophe Gan's' work was polarizing due to the mash up of genres. Here he not only has that element in full effect, but there's the added conundrum of just who the hell the audience IS for this. Too dark for kids. Too soft a subject matter for die hard genre fans. That juxtaposition of elements are a trademark of the filmmaker at this point, and it's almost comforting to see that he refuses to let go of this element in his craft, even in the face of critics, the general public, or even good taste.</fullReview>

The reason is that this movie was made in French, so I was busy to look the subtitles at first I watched it. I couldn't' t help gazing beautiful costumes which Belle dress in. In this film, rose is the important thing. Beast and Belle's father meeting is caused by a red rose. Also, Beast's house is covered by huge amounts of rose. The depiction is amazing.Also, Lea Seydoux plays Belle and her eyes show off her grittiness very well. The beast is scarring, but he is sexy. He is like a Phantom who is a main character of the Phantom of the opera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The classic fairy tale of a beautiful girl who has to live with the beast in order to protect her family. Now, the story follows almost the well known one, which is more than fine, as most of the Beauty and the Beast nowadays tend to alter the story too much. The landscapes were beautiful, the castle, the tower, the forest, even Belle's country house. And the costumes were nice, some of Belle's garments though were a little too much. Now, the story started okay, with a nice pace, but started rushing towards the end. When did Belle fell in love with the beast? I must have missed that part between watching her having dreams about the past and running away from him after taking a pick of him gorging over a deer. The special effects were a little childish and certainly unrealistic, but the final battle was okay. For me, the prince\beast should have been played by a younger man, but other than that the performances were nice and not too much over the top. So 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just watched the movie twice within a day and was completely blown away by this masterpiece. The visually stunning cinematography took my breath away.There is never a dull moment in the flow of the movie.On my first viewing, I was mesmerized by the artwork that goes behind the cinematography. The beautiful snow-capped landscape,the forest greenery, the lavish decoration of the castle interior and the rose garden are just visual delight to behold.The music tempo used in scenes of movement: speeding on horses, awakening of the giants and fighting sequences assaulted the mind with a heighten sense of flight and fled.Topping the icing of the cake.... are those gorgeous white, green, blue and red gowns wore by beautiful Lea Seydoux. Wow! Such beautiful and dazzling Gowns Art. There is so much beauty to absorb that I have to sit through a second viewing to enjoy the storyline and appreciate how the characters unfold.The storyline of a prince being turned into a beast for killing his beloved wife and later being removed of the curse by the tear of his new found love was a beautiful romantic fairytale. It is a familiar fairy tale retold with many refined versions.What makes this movie standout is the superb casting of Lea Seydoux as Belle who injected a slightly independent toughness in her love for the Beast by Vincent Cassel.Though her dreams, she begins to know the Beast and later fall in love with him as a person. On the other hand, Vincent Cassel convinced us with his tough exterior but fragile interior beastly nature.From his love and hate of himself, we can appreciate the suffering he went through and why Belle fall for him. The light-hearted moments of lovable gremlins and adorable dogs injected fun and humor which capture little kids imagination. It is a delightful family movie given a modern twist.All in all, it's an Oscar worthy masterpiece, which imprints on my mind what a great piece of work director Christopher Gan delivers. I will love to watch the movies he directs in the future:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fairy tail, transfered on the screen with respect to it's original plot, pretty much as it should have been told two and a half centuries ago, when it was first put on paper (1756). Of course, given it's age and the nature of fairy tail stories, there are many variants from region to region and from century to century but the core of the story remained solid and this is what we see. I really had the impression that the story that i was looking at was told by someone who lived in the past and not my grandma. The realization is quite satisfying, the costumes and the colors are impressive but it's a bit too dark at some points. Maybe there should have been more day time scenes but i guess they wanted to stress out the dark side of the story. This was tiring. The music was all right but i really think that the producers could have done a better job here. More intensively ambient music could have make this motion much more interesting for a young audience. Overall, i think it's a beautiful picture to take your family to, especially if you have children -not too young though,it can get scary-.</fullReview>
