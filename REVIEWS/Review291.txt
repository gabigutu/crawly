		<shortDescription>Some kind of wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really know what it is about Dirty Dancing.. there is some sort of absolute magic in this movie.. I cannot possibly recount the hundreds (yes, hundreds)of times I've watched it, beginning to end... but every time I do come upon it on TV, I am entranced and mystified and sit myself down and there I am, for two hours, loving the movie as if I'm watching it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey absolutely hated each other throughout the making of this film, they possess a beautiful chemistry on the set.. it makes the viewer enjoy it that much more, to see this passion and commitment.. and I can't help tearing up a tiny bit at the end, when Patrick comes up to the Houseman family and tells her dad, "Nobody puts Baby in a corner". (classic moment) For all those people who believe this movie is corny and sappy, maybe in a way it is, but it was the penicle of the 80's films, and put Patrick Swayze right on the map; his performance was immaculate. Three Cheers for Dirty Dancing !!Ps- The soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. I can't even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. This is one movie that I could probably watch every few weeks and still love.There is something timeless about this movie. I have loved other "blockbuster love story movies" like Pretty Woman and when Harry met Sally. I think their up there but there is something about Dirty Dancing that just makes it absolutely perfect. The characters, the chemistry between Swaze and Grey, the movie's direction, the INCREDIBLE dancing, the warm summery atmosphere, everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect. It is an instant classic and I've never really seen a movie like it either before or since.I don't think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things, a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, languid, summery mood, realistic characters, a relateable honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing, and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us. This movie is always on TV and I will continue to watch it as long as they show it. But I WILL mention I have no interest in seeing "Havanna Nights", this one they should have left alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>80s...........................................Dancing............................Patrick Swayze..............................Baby's in the Corner....................Abortion..........................Lake DancingWho wouldn't think this was one of the best movies EVER. Even as a very masculine male I find this film very entertaining. It represents a time when films could be based completely on dancing and music without the modern day clichés. This film represents a time when love could blossom in the summer, and also the unending (yet creative) story of a daughter who grows to be a woman ? through dance.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe a predictable story of girl gets man of her dreams but this film is still brilliant!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting to see this film for ages and I finally have! As soon as I heard the title I knew that this film would be my favourite film ever and when I saw it believe me I wasn't disappointed!This film had everything dance, love and Patrick Swayze! There was so much in it and it dealt with important issues, (that were at the time, 1960's) , such as abortion.The dancing in this film was fantastic, just like the acting was! Swayze was brilliant just like Grey was too!Although this film was absolutely fantastic you cannot say that you have seen it if you haven't seen the last scene. It really does take your breath away as the whole choreography of the last dance was done brilliantly, it had you dancing at the end of the film and it really wouldn't surprise me if it influenced people to take up dancing!Overall Dirty Dancing is a film NOT to be missed and even if half the actors are in the: "Where are they now?" period the actors will always have this superb film in their career!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dancing With Working Class Snobbery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, the dancing up at the worker's lodge is not dirty dancing it is gross dancing. Grabbing someone's ass while dancing is foreplay not art. The popularity of this film is a complete mystery to me. There is a reason why Jennifer Grey only had one other lead role in the virtually unknown WIND. Her voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard; when she raises her voice, which she does often, it sounds like cats being strangled. She ruined every scene she was seen in FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF. The film features some legendary cringe moments; how about the one that made all 500 people in the Eastgate die laughing? When Patrick, where are my muscles, Swayze leaps from the dais and begins what can only be described as hen jutting of his face back and forth I, and several other people, fell out of our seats onto the floor. Cut, Patrick, no more of that hen movement with the head sonny. The main problem with this unfunny, boring, badly acted piece of crap is the reverse working class snobbery. All the rich people, including Baby's father, are complete pompous asses. Of course, the workers are all saintly angels who are victimized by the evil rich owner and his arrogant, snotty, wimpy son. Yes, Penny gets pregnant but it is not her fault; the evil waiter Robbie who aspires to be rich and he even reads, brace yourself, ANN RYND. Oh, my God what a bastard!! Yes, baby is our bad acting, half ass missionary bringing the light to those saintly dumb asses who need her guidance. She is one of the Peace Corps for trashy dancing dummies. Please, OK we just ate; villains come in all classes for those watching too much of this crap. I happen to agree with gunnery Sgt. Hartman in FULL METAL JACKET; here you are all equally worthless. The cast is a who is who of bad actors. The stunning star of one of the biggest bombs in cinema STAYING ALIVE plays the poor, helpless Penny. It is so slow and boring; it drags on and on, one tired cliché after another. One hit song, hungry eyes, does not a soundtrack make; please want to know how bad the score is? When Patrick Swayze sings head for the exits rapidly. We have to listen to Jennifer shriek, whine and generally bitch the entire movie until I considered whether I could bludgeon myself with my red vines. Fans, there is a reason this director never worked again; The film is a big pile of poop. Yes, baby is not only a good dancer but she taught him the kind of person he wants to be: well, Patrick you taught us where we want to be; OUT OF THE THEATER AS FAST AS WE CAN RUN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, moving, touching and poignant classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I viewed this movie for the first time last night and I enjoyed every aspect of it ?the dancing, the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the script and the whole atmosphere that this movie created. I would highly recommend it.Jennifer Grey gives an absolutely wonderful and first class performance in her role as Frances (Baby) Houseman. She has a natural ability and flair for dancing and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor. But what is wonderful about Baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension to her character. This is not simply a movie about dancing but the scriptwriters have also given us a chance to see Baby deal with the various emotions and feelings that she is experiencing throughout the movie and to allow us an insight into how her interaction with others at the camp changes her life. Grey portrays her character with such realism and poignancy that you end up feeling deeply for Baby as she experiences all she does in this movie.Patrick Swayze is magnificent in his role as Johnny and truly succeeds in making his character come alive. He gives his character a comprehensive personality, strong appeal and great depth. The chemistry between Swayze and Grey is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this movie Cynthia Rhodes is great in her role of Penny and her portrayal of the ordeal that she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film. The other members of the supporting cast ?Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor deserve a special mention here-also give wonderful and imaginative performances that gives this movie an additional dimension of high quality acting and believability that is wonderful to experience. The dancing is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved. The script and interaction between all the major characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful fashion. The plot, although exceedingly predictable, is given more than enough life and vitality to make this movie successful. Furthermore the wonderful selection of music contained in this movie creates a truly magical atmosphere and very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the various scenes.`Dirty Dancing' is a truly powerful, magnificent and very appealing movie that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance. I highly recommend it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best movie ever, but that is my opinion. Some say it's cheesy but I think it is truly a beautiful film. The chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze it's like no other I have ever seen, and that is what makes the film so perfect. I always wonder what would have been of this film if these two actors never existed, because not just one them did it for me, they both did. If you have never seen this film, when you do you will understand what I mean. Dirty Dancing looks like it was done from the heart and it feels so real for some reason, like magic- and the soundtrack LOVE IT. Besides the 2 lead actors the soundtrack makes the film the beauty that it is. As you can tell I am in love with this film, and I know you will be too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie with my fiancée many years after it came out. I thought I would hate it, but to my surprise it is so cheesy that it's great. We've spent many hours reenacting parts of the movie ("Sylvia?!Yes Mickey?" or "I'm sorry you had to see that Baby. Sometimes in this world we see things that we don't want to."). My financee cracks up every time I imitate Neil. Also the music is classic and fun to sing along with, especially on road trips. Of course I don't admit any of this to my male friends. It's like a guilty pleasure. I seriously watch Dirty Dancing once a month or more and it is just as good every time. Jennifer Grey is also so cute in this movie. Its too bad her career never really took off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty Dancing Coming to Broadway for it's 20th anniversary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was talk on the E! Hollywood Special about the Making of Dirty Dancing which still is considered by many women including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite all time movies. Maybe the music, the dancing, or the melodrama around the plot of Baby Frances becoming a dancing sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course, this film established Jennifer Grey whose biggest role to date was the resentful sister in Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Patrick Swayze is perfectly cast as the heart throb leading man who sweeps baby away literally. Dirty Dancing has it all to become a Broadway or West End smash hit. It has the love story, the music, and most of all lots of dancing. Jennifer and Patrick could revive their roles easily. it is nice to see Jerry Orbach play a doctor instead of a police officer and Kelly Bishop as the mother. It all took place in the Catskills in the sixties where many Jewish families vacationed in the area during their summer vacations. At the end of the film, it is sad to see the hotel owner, Kellerman, be baffled by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and traveling through Europe than spending the summer in the Catskills. Those old grand hotels are becoming Indian gaming casinos. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well. After all, they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, this should be a no brainer! I know that this film is one of the favorites that you don't get tired of after watching 800 times. There are people that have probably seen this film-a 1,000 times by now. Somehow watching the making and the story behind Dirty Dancing made me long for my childhood days as a thirteen year old. Dirty Dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in the history but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeated watchers like the 800 club whose members have watched it so many times. I watch it fondly now with all the awkwardness of Baby's first days and her first true love with Patrick Swayze as heart throb, Johnny Castle. Nobody could have imagined this little film as a big hit then with the sixties music, two soundtracks, and even a tour in the late eighties. I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical. It would work for the audience to be part of a film. No wonder it still attracts kids and even adults particularly women of all ages to watch it over and over again. Well, Australia and London both have had productions of Dirty Dancing. It looks like it will come to Broadway in 2007 just in time for it's 20th anniversary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A giant cliché: Just a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, as you get older, you somehow think the movies you did not like when you were younger, might have been because of your youth and inexperience. Case in point, when I saw The Godfather at age 14, I thought it was boring. 20 years later, its an incredible movie to me. In other words, I grew up and began to appreciate great movies.So I rented Dirty Dancing with my girlfriend last night on her request, as she loved it at age 14 and I hated it at the same age. But I hoped, because I was young and stupid at age 14, perhaps this would be a new experience for me. So I sat down with her to watch, hoping to be enlightened.Well, the night after watching Dirty Dancing, I feel a violation. I feel like someone reached into my soul and robbed me of 2 hours of my life from watching this cheese fest.First, Patrick Swayze plays a 20 year old, but he looks like he is 35. And the premise of the movie is him seducing some underage teenager, wooing her with his dance moves. Really Creepy.Anyway, the movie is the cliché plot where the "wrong side of the tracks" guy and the "rich smart girl" accidentally fall in love with each other. Of course, their romance is fueled by the fact the "rich girl" can't dance a lick, so the "poor hero" teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the big end of vacation show, or something like that.But you guessed it: The disapproving father soon enters and forbids the two to see each other, and the movie progresses to secret meetings of dance lessons and love making. This all culminates into the final scene where the entire resort rallies around the two young lovers while the once antagonistic father accepts the 35 year old dancer as his teen daughter's new man.Even my girlfriend whimpered at the end of the movie as she admitted it was not anything like she remembered. I didn't press her, but I did smirk a little, and put the Godfather part II in the DVD player.</fullReview>

Itis a film about the change of a girl (baby) and her first boy-friend (Johnny)their relationships within the family, the changes in baby's and Johnny's view of the world during their relationship.DIRTY DANCING WILL FOREVER LIVE ON AS A TIMLESS CLASSIC. thank-you sorry though for only the short comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repeated viewings reveal a well crafted story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film was released I dismissed as being lightweight pop nonsense. That was a mistake. After repeated viewings and seeing a documentary of the making of DIRTY DANCING, discovering the depth of this film certainly increases its appeal.DIRTY DANCING is a film about change. The evolving nature of relationships within the family, the changes in one's view of the world during their coming of age, etc. The story takes place during August of 1963, the final weeks of the last summer of innocence for the American people. The many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in American society that would be marked by the Kennedy assassinations and Vietnam.Female movie go'ers adored this film and repeated trips to the movie houses made it the world's most successful dance movie. As a male I find the romantic pairing of ultimate stud Patrick Swayze with very plain Jennifer Grey very hard to accept. This would be fatal for most romantic dramas, and it also may have create the intense dislike expressed by most male reviewers.The film's soundtrack found #1 status before the release of the movie. To this day it is nearly impossible to attend a wedding reception without hearing a DIRTY DANCING song.Near the midpoint of the film Baby's mother wakes up and asks Baby's father, "Is anything wrong?"Baby's father, the anti-change family member, attempts to keep all that is happening a secret. He tells his wife to go back to sleep. However, resist as one can, change is unstopable. DIRTY DANCING is the story of one person waking up just at the final moments of our country's last sleep in innocence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You've Grown Up, Skip This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This reminded me of many of the 1970s sleazy films with tons of unlikeable characters with low morals and being portrayed by the sick scriptwriters as "good people." This movie was a favorite of of many, especially teenage girls who saw a real poor role model in Jennifer Grey's "Frances 'Baby' Houseman." Grey was extremely irritating to watch to listen to, a big pain in the butt. I laugh at some of these reviews that cite her "depth" and "dimension." Give me a break: she's a slimeball. Only a likewise immature bimbo would enjoy this movie.As bad as Grey's character is in here, Patrick Swayze's "Johnny Castle" isn't a whole lot better. He's a guy trying to seduce a teenager via his dancing prowess. That's all we need to see in that age of child sex molesters on the web and who knows where else. At least she was 17 so I guess the filmmakers felt that was old enough.From the sex-obsessed leads, to abortions, to the father changing his mind and giving approval to this male scum, this script offers nothing redeemable. "Baby" has no clue about anything and is one of the dumbest characters ever seen on film. I am not surprised to read about so many reviewers who thought this was "cool" when they were young and stupid, but now that they are a lot more mature, look at this film again almost in shock at how bad it looks to them now. Good for them; at least they've grown up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Over-Rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a good film by an standards. It is very poorly written and the acting is just a little above par (some performances are well below par, but Swayze and Grey do a very good job with little to work with).What was good:The dance sequences were choreographed very well and, as stated above, Swayze and Grey were high points.What was bad:The script. The "bad" guys were simply too evil to be believable. The best villains are the ones who aren't so obviously evil. These guys (the owner's nephew, the waiter who impregnates the girl) do and say NOTHING that would leave me to believe they could be real people (perhaps there are guys like them, but I sure don't want to see a movie about it).Another scene, the first where Grey and Swayze meet when the employees at the resort are "dancing". Swayze and Grey dance together and seem to enjoy themselves. The next time they meet, Swayze is hostile towards her. Why? What happened in between to make him dislike her so when they danced well together?And some of those lines, I mean COME ON (I cringed at the end when Swayze muttered the line "Nobody puts baby in the corner". How did he EVER do that with a straight face.)Another thing wrong, the setting of the 1960's. Everyone looked and dressed like the 1980's! Who was in charge of the costumes and hairstyles?The music (original music for the film) was laughable (with the exception of "I Had the Time of My Life" which was a good song).Not the worst film I've ever seen, but DEFINITELY the most over-rated</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One word sums up this film "Perfection". That's it really!! I saw this film in 1987 when it was released and was completely blown away and like Baby I fell in love with Johnny and Patrick Swayze. It has such classic lines as "I carried a watermelon" and "Nobody puts Baby in the corner" and too many others to mention. I loved the story, the characters, the setting, the dancing, and well ? the music was phenomenal not one bad song in the whole soundtrack. It just shows that you don't have to spend a fortune to make a great film. Thank you to the cast and crew for making such a wonderful film which makes me smile like a Cheshire cat whenever I watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up in the late 90's but I grew up watching Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey on "Dirty Dancing". Partick and Jennifer's chemistry is undeniable and you could tell they were more than just being Baby and Johnny, they were being themselves. From "Love Man" to "Cry To Me" to "The Time of My Life", you see how Baby and Johnny's relationship develops from just dance partners to lovers. Baby matures beautifully and blooms into a confident young woman while Johnny learns that someone actually cares for him and that their are good people in the world. Both Sawyze and Grey dance with great passion in the finale dance, which will leave you in a lovely mood.Rest in peace Patrick. You are greatly and forever missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After 20 years, I finally decided to give this a try. It's just touching... the title doesn't do justice to this little gem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the days I had refused to watch this. Every girl I knew liked it, it was marketed as "dirty" lascivious dancing, and I just hate dancing honestly. This seemed just stupid. Well, I had made a terrible mistake. Now that Patrick is gone (may he rest in peace), I decided I'd watch everything he ever did - because I really liked the style of the guy, and he fought until the end, like his Dalton character in Road House. Also, movies from the 80's have a heart compared to the cold twilight garbage of today. I'll concede I was a teenager in the later 80's so I may have a bias. Who wouldn't.What a surprise this was. First of all, maybe this was marketed as "dirty dancing" for the sake of attracting some crowd from the Saturday Night fever era (how sad that movie was btw), or to attract men to it - yet that was such a mistake - should have been called "Love dance" or something like that. This is a "coming of age" movie, about heart, love and dancing, it's a drama about the clash of social classes, abuse, a reminder of the consequences of prohibiting abortion(women pay a price), a movie about family, jealousy, team spirit and it's filled with nice music and songs. This movie is about beauty and fighting for what you believe is right and what feels right and it's quite touching for something that light and entertaining - it's a feel good movie. Yes, I'm a guy. Swayze shines with his dancing, his smile, his acting. He's very natural and fun to watch. Yet the movie is not so much about him as it is about everything else, he's just a catalyst... it's really about a girl becoming a woman through her love and compassion... it all has a "musical" quality to it without being a "musical".There's no need to go into the details of the story which you will easily figure out when you watch it. My point is that if you've refrained from watching this, well, just watch it, even if you have to do it while your girlfriend is asleep lolll (better yet, watch it with her and dance!!!)... it's just magical and cute!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am surprised this has a relatively low vote... i absolutely love this movie, it is a classic and the music is fabulous. This movie is so sexy, but there are no actual sex scenes which is something i really like... the power of suggestion is so much sexier then documentary-style visuals!!Patrick Swayze is so sexy and sincere in this movie, this and Ghost are his absolute best and are both classics for me.Jennifer Grey is perfectly cast and I think she is beautiful. Such a pity she destroyed her lovely nose with surgery... it just goes to show that smaller is not necessarily better.If you're looking for a real teenage love story that captures the passion, confusion, love and lust of that age, this is the movie. It is also about class distinction in modern America - and pseudo-liberalized values.Add to that amazing and ridiculously sexy dancing and a fantastic soundtrack.Nobody puts Baby in a corner... I carried a watermelon...have the time of your life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ultimate dance flick is still a timeless gem from the 1980s. It may lack polish or even sensibility, but the charm is unrelenting. Fronted by the heavenly pairing of Jennifer Grey as the timid town girl Frances 'Baby' Houseman with a need to exhale and the unforgettable Patrick Swayze as booty shaking dance instructor Johnny Castle. Sets in 1953, it centres around a simple case of mésalliance, when up-town teenager on holiday in Catskills resort falls for the crass, but empathic dancer. Aptly named Baby she is the apple of her father's eye, perfect and untainted. But growing up brings about urges and changes - idyllic family relationships are bound to either adapt or fall apart."Dirty Dancing" delivers a deeply felt promise of naive youthful romance with unbelievable chemistry between the two main protagonists. The story may be simple (albeit brings in a pretty touchy issue of abortion), but filled with magic which inexplicably refuses to die away with age or repeated watching. Even now, as an adult I seem still somewhat embarrassingly enticed by the simplistic allure, albeit notice the inherent flaws, stereotypical characters or shortcomings of the entire story. What is probably still the most successful in this movie is its terrific score with what could possibly be the best pop musical score in movie history.Probably the highlight of Patrick Swayze's career (although "Ghost" probably would give it some competition), "Dirty Dancing" turned out to be just 15 minutes of fame for Jennifer Grey, who self-mutilated her career by plastic surgery, which dispossessed her of a peculiarly enticing Roman nose, replacing it with something more generic and changing her beyond recognition.</fullReview>

I know for a fact there are blokes out there that either admittedly or secretly enjoy watching and love this classic film! (Not just English/British men-but men world wide!) and rightly so...nearly 18 years on, and this film is STILL watched and enjoyed- world wide, and people are still able to relate to it.I know all the words i've seen it that many times!Most of my dance moves i use for work-are taken from this film!There's so much energy.In fact it is my firm belief, if people were brought up thinking watching these types of films are deemed as 'cool' and OK to watch the world would be a slightly better place to live.An enjoyable film that doesn't make you want to go out into the world and cause havoc and heartache-do drugs or get into gun crime (coz its classed as being 'cool')this films makes you want to find a girl-that you can love and feel that special feeling felt in this film.It also makes you want to go out and enjoy yourself by simply Dancing!It's free,Legal and makes you feel good-while keeping you fit and healthy-not forgetting FUN! In my opinion, the films main two themes are 'LOVE', the true love story between Baby and Johnny (Jennifer Gray and Mr Swayze) (compared to Baby's sister's relationship-where she was just used for sex) plus classic Music. Yes music! The type you can really dance to! Every song on the soundtrack is fantastic! In true cheesy Dj style, i still play all the old classics from the soundtrack (especially 'Time of my life')and is still goes down a treat every single time! You just can't stop yourself! Anyway-everyone has wrote hundreds of reviews, and has pretty much summed up this film and explained the story...all thats left to say is....If you haven't seen this film yet...go treat yourself, buy the DVD (you can get if for an average of ?5 or less (British pounds) Roughly 9 American Dollars (i think!)It's well worth it, and highly recommended.If, you enjoy the film-please go out and buy one of the 'Dirty Dancing' soundtracks- especially the Ultimate Dirty Dancing (released in the UK 2004 in celebration of the films anniversary- as it contains all of the songs and is digitally remastered. (I got my second personal copy from the British supermarket 'Tescos' for an amazing ?6! (For anyone 'Up North' try 'Music Zone' as its only ?6 in there too!Anyway-cheers for taking the time to read this-i'm sorry i went on a bit! If your planning on seeing this film for the first time...enjoy! And as everyone else has said-very cheesily! Try and have THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE!I will go as far to say 10/10. Highly enjoyable-with lots of energy. Makes yo wanna move like Swayze and Gray!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad filmmaking 101</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter how lousy a film is, if you make it sappy enough people will just lick it up.This is one of the worst films of the 80s, and I can't fathom how so many people rate it so highly. The only good actor is Jerry Orbach, and he's hardly on screen. The film uses every single cliche in the book, from the "good little girl who's so repressed" to the "spontaneous" choreographed finale. This is like a lesson in how to make a bad movie.I'm not surprised that plenty of people seem to enjoy watching this film. But that doesn't make it "good". If you like the music because it reminds you of your childhood, fine. If you admire baby because you wished you could broken out of your prison when you were a teenager, fine. And if you like seeing Swayze shake his booty around, that's fine, too.But don't say this is actually a good film. It's awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably awful nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler warning. Criticising this movie is like bullying people smaller and weaker and more pathetic than yourself: it's too easy. First of all, what has happened to Patrick Swayzey Fantayzy? He spends half the film looking like a gay Terminator, and the other half looking like a comatose fool. Jennifer Gray, meanwhile, simply looks vapid and embarrassed. And who can blame her? If I were as vapid as her, I'd be embarrassed too. The dance sequences are so naff it's hilarious. The "plot" is inane and patronising. But the ending is the real humdinger. Here are the good and boring and conservative kids putting on their old-fashioned show, only to be interrupted, before the first song has finished, by Patrick Suwayyyzeee, telling them that only he has the right to perform on this stage. So they all p*** off and let him get on with it. Instead of saying, "Hang on, gay terminator man, we've put a lot of work into this, you arrogant prick. So sod off." But no, they all just drift away, allowing our plastic heroes to dance to "The time of my life". A song featuring synthesisers and singers from the early eighties. In a film set in the fifties (?). And no-one comments along the lines of, "Wow, what is this music of the future?" They all just dance. Holy crap, what a load of crappy crap. There are good teen movies out there, somewhere, but this really is the pits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dancing with Economic Stereotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead: First on an aesthetic point of view the dancing up at the employees' lodge is not dirty dancing it is gross dancing there is a difference. Grabbing someone's gyrating ass is not dancing it is foreplay. Second, does everyone notice why Jennifer Grey never again got a leading role again except in the dreadful WIND? She has the most annoying voice like nails on a chalkboard and she is a dreadful actress. When she says the line," you are right johnny you just can't win for losing?" everyone in my aisle started laughing though to be fair the closeup of Swayze after he jumps from the dais had the whole theater laughing yes cut camera crew no more closeups of Patrick's face OK? Let's pull way way back please. The music is as painful in 2015 as it was thirty years ago. One good song Hungry Eyes does not a soundtrack make. My main problem is the class stereotyping. Look nobody likes rich people but are they all so ubiquitously evil? Except for baby the rich even her father until his redemption at the end are all greedy cruel selfish creeps like Max's son who adores himself and tells baby how whatever woman gets him will be the luckiest one. The whole sub story with baby penny and johnny is the same schlock. The evil head waiter aspires to be rich and reads gasp ANN RYND. Oh no!!! He is the personification of the stereotyping of the rich as evil creeps and the poor as saintly misunderstood not to be held responsible for their choices innocents. Baby is the bridge she wants to be a kind of half ass missionary to the working class. At the end Johnny tells the audience that baby taught him the kind of person he wants to be; please I just ate OK? The world is not quite so simple evil comes in all classes and one class in not the repository for all goodness and the other all evil. Combine this with the dreadful music ham bone acting by Grey and Swayze, not Olivier by the way, and you get one of the most overrated pieces of crap since Grease. No the lower classes do not need baby to come down with daddy's money and teach them values how arrogant and condescending. Scenes of the meringue need to be banned from film. I am sure you are having lots of fun but hello YOU ARE BORING US TO DEATH MOVE ON WITH THE STORY. Jennifer Grey ruined the picture as she damaged Ferris Bueller's Day Off one of the most unpleasant actresses, I use the term loosely, they should use that voice as an air raid siren.

		<shortDescription>TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MOVIE (few spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that I will never understand how anyone with half an amount of common sense would ever like. I was once convinced to watch this movie with a certain girlfriend who was thoroughly upset and unable to understand how I could say it was AWFUL. And yes. I am ashamed enough to admit that I really have seen it.Painfully. ALL of it. The "love" story itself is straight cheesy and pathetic, but however, one can come to expect this in the case when a movie like this is made to fit in a specific genre like "chick flicks". So I can cope with that. I myself am a sucker for good (emphasis on GOOD) romantic movies. But this. This specimen clearly trashes all conception of what a love story SHOULD be.1. Patrick Swayze as a macho stud/tough guy does not work.2. Patrick Swayze as a macho stud/tough guy who dances competitively does not work.3. The dialog in this movie is terrible. I need only point out the part in which Baby asks Johnny if he has "had many women". Ladies. If you feel the need to ask a question such as this you already know the answer regardless of what is said in response. 4. The part that REALLY gets me. The above scene in which Baby hops in bed with Johnny IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWS another scene in which Baby has witnessed another character that is her female friend having gone through (what is assumed to be) an abortion(or painful complications). You get my point. It defies and basically destroys any sort of good character that this film tries to present.Now I understand this movie is a product of the late 80's. So I will accept that as responsibility for SOME of it's major flaws. But realistically, the only good thing I can say about it is the job that was done compiling the soundtrack. Go buy it. It is honestly outstanding. But this remains the sole gem among a large heaping of disgusting trash that everyone just seems to keep digging into and claiming it's really good stuff.For the sake of sparing yourself a waste of 100 mins that could be used doing otherwise useful (and enjoyable) things, I advise you to avoid this movie at all costs. It is certainly not what others crack it up to be, regardless of what they tell you. And in case you do end up seeing it...just know you were warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing is in my opinion a dreadful, cheesy movie. I disliked it the first time I saw it and my opinion of it has not changed since then! It is a badly directed and produced film and far to sickly sweet. It is an awful movie which for some strange reason was very popular despite its awfulness. Even the song 'The Time of Our Lives' is dreadful, Middle Of the Road bland 80's pop-bad music for a very bad film! If you have any taste whatsoever DO NOT watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good love story is timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since ever the rich families sought to protect their children from marriages that could jeopardize their status and prestige. Baby Houseman is a girl whose parents expect a lot, but things go wrong when her family learns that she is in love with a dance instructor with humble origins and dubious life. Directed by Emile Ardolino and with a screenplay by Eleanor Bergstein, it has Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey in the lead roles.This is probably one of the most famous romantic movies of the eighties. Jennifer Grey was up to the challenge and did a good interpretation but, despite her talent and commitment, she ended up overshadowed by a huge Patrick Swayze. This film can be considered the best in the career of this actor that was, precisely, a dancer before beginning to play. It's undeniable that his taste for dancing and talent for gallant roles were essential to his performance, contributing a lot to make him a true "male sex symbol" at the time. The script itself doesn't bring anything new: rich girl meets poor boy and they fall in love, jealous people try to separate them, girl's family doesn't accept their love etc... We have seen this many times in film, theater or even in literature. Nevertheless, it's a story that works well and it's enriched by some interesting details that help to thicken the plot, as the situation around an illegal abortion that one of the characters has to do. In addition to the interpretation of Swayze, the most positive point of the film are the choreography's and an amazing and memorable soundtrack, marked by the songs "She's Like the Wind" and "I've Had The Time Of My Life". The latter can even be considered one of the most famous love songs of the eighties and won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for Best Original Song (1987).Despite the time that has passed since it's release in the cinema, and Swayze himself has passed away however, this film continues to mean a lot to many people and to be a landmark of romantic cinema. Love overcomes barriers, and a good love story is always timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for me, but I can understand that people like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really sure what to say about this movie. I can understand that it is a well liked classic, as I'm sure almost every part of it - from the music and dancing to the relationships in it - hits it target audience right where it should. The fact that I'm not a part of the target audience doesn't mean it's a bad movie.With movies like this, that doesn't really try (or need) to flesh out its character, it's always interesting to see how the characters hold up with time. How some of the characters are portrayed would maybe be considered mean if the movie was made today. Or maybe it's in those cases a realistic depiction of the time and setting it was set in? I don't know.The (acting) performances are not too impressive, and especially Swayze didn't always convince when showing emotions. The dancing is well done though, both when it is genuinely meant to be good, but also when the actors are supposed to be bad. I also really liked the setting itself, the naivë dance camp for rich families.So what can I say? I am not trying to be objective in my rating of this movie, but I feel I have to point out that much of what didn't impress me (the plot, the characters, the relationships) were done intentionally, and hits home with many.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "one hit wonder" for Vestron! Great soundtrack as well!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It launched a small studio (Vestron) that never had another hit movie or hit TV show! In spite of it's unusual (semi-biographical) story, It succeeds entirely on it's music, dancing, and the strong animal chemistry between Patrick and Jennifer. The sub-plots are both inane and accurate. There was such a summer-hotel in the Catskills, and it was a Jewish Resort. (A fact. No disrespect intended.) Nobody cares about Patrick's original partner being "knocked-up". Jack Weston is totally annoying portraying the owner-operator of the place. The cynicism of the whole set-up rings true. There is only "Dirty Dancing" in one scene at a dance party. You can see Jennifers' undies in the "simulated sex" scene. What a wonderful title for a relatively "tame" movie by today's standards! As portrayed, the staff was certainly underpaid, lived in tents or cheap housing, and thought the guests were pompous and "Rubes". The movie only takes-off during the dancing, so it was always like "Grease" in the mis-guided critic's minds. Even the "cheap sets" work, and the old hotel looks real; slightly run-down and in decline. Both became crossover movies but both probably started out as "chick-flicks", I am sure. So ABC is going to remake it? Why? It's a great movie, in spite of itself. It's one-of-a-kind and I dare to put it in the same class as "The Music Man" and the original versions of "Footloose" and "Grease". It can't be equaled and it can't be re-made, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing was a sleeper hit that launched a phenomenal hit album. It is now regarded as a romantic musical classic. Some of the songs from the film have become unforgettable hits and the dance moves are now much mimicked.The film is set in the Catskill mountain holiday resort in the summer of 1963. Dr Houseman and his family are taking their annual three weeks holiday there. The youngest daughter Baby has taken a shine to the dance teacher, Johnny Castle who introduces her to a more wild style of dancing that the entertainment staff get up to.When Castle's female dance partner falls pregnant by one of the waiter's, Baby gets some money for her to have an abortion which gets botched and she has to go to her father to help her out. Her father is angry and forbids her to have anything do with Castle and the rest of the entertainment team. However she continues to see and learn to dance with Castle and they fall in love.The film is cheesy with some predictable plotting and a few bad lines including the now infamous, 'nobody puts Baby in a corner.' It has some hissable characters such as the immoral waiter and wannabee doctor who is dating Baby's sister and who knocked up Johnny's dance partner and then washed his hands off her. There is also the slimy nephew of the holiday camp owner with his constant veiled threats against the camp staff.Given all that it is still an enjoyable film now ripe with nostalgia and some cracking songs. Jennifer Grey is vulnerable enough and she has a good chemistry with Patrick Swayze. But this is really Swayze's film, he dances, he broods, he sings and he steals the film.Dirty Dancing shows a world that is changing something Dr Houseman wants to resist with his regular holiday at the Catskills with his daughters. Even the camp owner has realised that times are changing as young people want to go to Europe rather than spend a few weeks at the camp. The dance teachers are bored of the sedate dance lessons when they know that they are capable of more hip and happening dance styles and of course Vietnam war is round the corner. Its almost a final visit to a fading lifestyle and an emergence of a new youth culture that Dirty Dancing celebrates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern dance movie that stacks up well with the classics, in spite of cheesiness and overreach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When did dance movies get so serious? When Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made them they were essentially comedies, with just a touch of melodrama to move the romantic plot lines forward. But by the time of 1977's "Saturday Night Fever" and 1987's "Dirty Dancing," dance had become a framework for commentary about heavy topics like rape and abortion. It is arguable whether audiences really noticed; decades afterward "Saturday Night Fever" is famous primarily for its time capsule soundtrack and John Travolta's white-suited disco pose, while "Dirty Dancing" remains alive in the collective memory for one famous line of dialogue and for the slick moves that Patrick Swayze showed off and later parodied on Saturday Night Live.Yet to understand the non-dance bits of these movies, it helps to be familiar with the periods in which they were made. In the case of "Dirty Dancing," it is helpful also to know something about the time in which it is set: the early 1960s, the brink of a major generational divide. Despite Jennifer Grey's clothes and hair, a few of the song choices, and the fact that the font and color of the title look like they come straight off a Prince album, this movie is consciously and by necessity a period piece. It is set in a family-focused lakeside resort, a kind of place with a kind of ethos that no longer existed by the time of the movie's release in 1987. Much is made of the emergence of new forms of popular entertainment, new interpretations of old words like "baby," and the new social frontiers that would turn old- fashioned liberals like Jerry Orbach's character into conservatives without their knowledge. This is fertile ground for a drama, but a movie about dance?and this is, to its credit, a movie about dance?doesn't have time to do these ideas justice. The dangers of unsafe abortions in the pre-Roe era are highlighted, but in a way that is unfeasibly convenient. It is structured so that the romantic leads come out squeaky-clean heroes and their antagonists more villainous. The feelings of the woman "in trouble" are explored only in passing and only at moments calculated to serve the needs of the central story. Similarly, the prejudices of the upper middle-class are touched upon, but in the vaguest way. One oily sort speaks of sexual liaisons with the help as "slumming," and Swayze's itinerant dancer is obscurely identified as coming from "the streets." What streets, exactly, remain unknown, as does his ethnic identity, which he seems to hint at through a very tenuous, arguably Italian, inflection.Though Eleanor Bergstein's script takes itself very seriously, and though its desire to "say" something meaningful is laudable albeit misplaced, its real power is, quite rightly, in the dance sequences. Unlike "Saturday Night Fever," which spends far too much time away from the dance floor and among dislikable people, "Dirty Dancing" is a worthy successor to the classics because it spends the bulk of its time on music and movement. Grey and Swayze look genuinely happy when they dance, and when the world shrinks to them they generate a feeling of goodwill that overshadows the movie's missteps and instances of overreach. There is an unshakable cheesiness to the film that the great dance movies of the past were too self-aware and witty to fall into. The way Grey's character falls for Swayze's is so pat, the way he expresses himself is so hammy, and the way Orbach's comes around at the end is so cutesy and orchestrated. But the important scenes, the dance montages, all look and sound great, and it's easy to feel good while watching them.Happily, the film avoids the clichés of its genre. Nobody gives Grey a makeover, and nobody tells her to come out of her shell or to change who she is. In an early scene, she sheds an awkward sweater in favor of a sleeveless shirt without comment or even a visual acknowledgment of the wardrobe change. It's unclear whether that's a smart decision or just an oversight from director Emile Ardolino, but if it's the latter, it works in spite of itself. That's true of the movie generally.</fullReview>

She finds a senile, airbrushed safety (games by the pool, dinner parties) that makes everything available, except for the real stuff that make the heart beat faster. It takes place in the early 60s with Vietnam a faint worry, but just as well speaks to its own time of all the pleasing comfort and diversion that money can buy.She enters his dancing space instead, tiptoeing one evening out of the family bungalow and across a path to the big house. She finds rhythm, bodies grinding, cessation of etiquette and empty chitchat and in their place passion and soul; sex of course, dance as discovery. He enters her dancing space and finds in her the same zest and soul, a desire to help others and get tangled up in their problems rather than coast through like the other vacationers.She a pure girl, shy but eager. He a movie hunk, tortured but good. Superficial strokes for the rest of the characters; smug Ivy League waiter, vacant sister. The sex is that soft movie sex where silhouettes are caressed against an orange bedroom glow. The fallacy of realism may keep some from enjoying it, but that would be a pity. What movie is real? It's all about the point-of-view, the point from which we view. Here it's the girl's on her journey to womanhood, the story of meeting someone like him, a movie hunk with a dancer's body who needs her nurturing, something she would dream about. Would the sex be more 'real' if we were shown a cold slapping of thighs? The recent Life of Adele comes to mind. It would be if sex was merely bodies writhing together. Of course it's a commercial decision to not show for example nudity, and to offer us simple dilemmas in the story. But it does also embrace what this girl covets; touch, intimacy.The princess can leave all this behind on her way to the safe life. Roman Holiday with dance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey, Jerry Orbach, Cynthia Rhodes, Kelly Bishop, Jane Brucker and Jack Weston star in this 1987 drama. This takes place in the late summer of 1963 focusing on teenage girl, Frances "Baby" Houseman (Grey) who comes to a New York country resort, "Kellerman's" with her family. Soon, she meets dance instructors, Johnny Castle (Swayze) and his partner, Penny Johnson (Rhodes). Baby decides to help Penny deal with an unwanted pregnancy by loaning her money and be her dance substitute. Baby and Johnny start to fall for each other after he teaches her how to dance. The late, Orbach (Law &amp; Order) plays Baby's father, Jake who is a doctor, Bishop plays Baby's mother, Marjorie, Brucker plays Baby's older sister, Lisa and the late, Weston plays Max Kellerman, the owner of Kellerman's. Grey and the late, Swayze are great in this and had good chemistry. I recommend this good romantic drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if you're not into chick flicks, DIRTY DANCING is worth the price of admission just for the two leads alone. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze (rest his soul) make for ideal casting. Their intensity smolders, and that kind of chemistry doesn't grow on trees. Oh, and Cynthia Rhodes' dancing scene - that was five kinds of steamy. Geez, that woman. And I was onboard with the '80s songs in an early '60s movie (it oddly works) until the kid put on the record and an '80s song actually starts playing. Nevermind that it was the extremely schmaltzy "The Time of My Life", that was just cheese overboard. Although in all fairness, this movie does not shy away from the cheese: "Nobody puts Baby in a corner"; really, she's just sitting there at the table, it's not like someone backs her into the margins literally. It's a really hammy metaphor. But this movie was surprisingly involving; and at the very least, the dancing scenes are worth it.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DIRTY DANCINGA romance film... Not my sort of movie, but there is no denying that this is a classic.The movie is about a girl who goes on holiday with her family. There she meets a group of dancers. She finds out that one of the dancers is in trouble and decides to help. To help she needs to learn to dance professionally. Whilst learning, she falls in love with her teacher and they have to hide their affair as he would get fired and she would be in a lot of trouble with her family.The film stars the late great Patrick Swayze. Patrick was such a good actor. He made so many great movies and even acted towards the end of his life in the TV show The Beast even though he was in a lot of pain. He is in my top 5 actors of all time and he is missed. Dirty Dancing is one of his biggest movies. The man knew how to dance well and he really shows it in this movie. Jennifer Grey played the girl in the movie. Jennifer is a good actress and she played this part well. She has been in a lot of movies and TV shows, but she will always mainly be famous for this film.The soundtrack to this movie is one of the strongest draws to this film. It is a near perfect soundtrack. It has a lot of great songs in it and it is made all the better by the song called She's Like The Wind which is sang by Patrick Swayze himself.The story itself is actually quite weak. It is a love story that has no deep meaning other than a holiday romance. Normally it would not be a good story for a film... But it works because of all the elements that work well together.I really like this film. I watched it a lot when I was younger as it was one of the first VHS I owned. It is a classic that I liked now as much as I did. But I can imagine that I wouldn't like it as much if it was the first time I saw it.I will give this film 8 out of 10."I carried a watermelon."For more reviews please like my Facebook page.Ordinary Person Movie Reviews</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing is a great movie with a good storyline and some really great performances.The story is nothing outstanding,it's very basic and easy to follow,but it sets the movie up for some great music and absolutely outstanding dancing from both Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze,the ending is certainly the best part as they dance extremely professionally to "I've Had the Time of My Life".Besides the dancing,the acting in this movie is also pretty solid,Grey and Swayze also deliver the best performances of course,and despite the fact that Jennifer Grey didn't want to work with Patrick Swayze,the two still seemed to have had great chemistry.Its storyline is nothing breathtaking but the dancing definitely is,so I would recommend Dirty Dancing to anyone looking for a good music or romance film. A 17 year old from a wealthy family learns a lot about life and falls in love with a hotels dance instructor during a family summer holiday.Best Performance: Jennifer Grey Worst Performance: Kelly Bishop</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it again - one of the best-written movies there is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a just, non-patriarchal society, this movie would have at least an 8 out of 10. All I can figure is that a bunch of guys who don't like "chick flicks" came through and downvoted this film without even watching it, or perhaps after half-watching it while trying to hook up with a girl. Because, quite frankly, this movie is just objectively great.It's perfectly written, directed and edited. There isn't one scene in this entire movie that doesn't belong, not one moment. The whole thing, from start to finish, is nearly a textbook example of how to write a good movie, without ever feeling formulaic or rushed. This movie has heart, and it was written by a woman who actually had a personal connection to the story. This movie wasn't written or made as a star vehicle or to become a big blockbuster. Its success, indeed, was entirely unexpected. It succeeded because of its quality, not because Patrick Swayze is hot - although he is very hot in this movie, despite never really doing anything for me in any of his other films. That's down to the quality of the writing and characterization. His other films never gave him as much to work with.Anyway, if you've never seen this movie, see it. ESPECIALLY if you are a woman or girl, but if you're a man, also see it. It's not a "chick flick" - a term which implies a movie churned out in a shallow attempt to make money off of a demographic. It's a good film made for humans. Humans who love, humans who feel, humans with complex family dynamics, humans who dance. Don't put this movie in a corner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had to make a list of top 10 favorite movies this would be in the list. This movie has a wonderful soundtrack. I love the chemistry between Johnny Castle &amp; Frances Houseman. They are my favorite movie couple! It was very sad that Patrick Swayze passed away. I think Dirty Dancing has a good message. I think the message is that people will stand up for you no matter what it costs you. Baby tried to stick up for Johnny. My all time favorite movie quote is "Nobody puts Baby in a corner." Hungry Eyes is my all time favorite song in this film. The soundtrack to Dirty Dancing is probably my all time favorite movie soundtrack. This is a movie everyone should see before they die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another iconic movie of the 80s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing is one of the most iconic movies of the 1980s, a story where Frances Houseman (Jennifer Grey) falls in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) while spending the summer at a holiday camp with her family.This is one of those movies I saw once when I was a kid. While I don't remember much of it, I do recall finding the chemistry between Frances and Johnny very endearing - one of the most cinematic couples in movie history. The dance scenes between the couple are well-choreographed and awe-inspiring, helped by a catchy soundtrack and breathtaking songs, including "Hungry Eyes" and "Time of your Life." Actor Jerry Orbach was one of the better supporting actors in the movie, doing a great job in playing the calm and stern, yet kind father to Frances. The script to the film isn't bad; found it quite entertaining. It is just a little sappy at times and the pacing is kind of slow in certain parts. Overall, it's a nice piece of romantic drama with memorable songs.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I'll stick my neck out, this is one of the top 500 or top 600 movies in American cinematography. The proof is that you recognize the title, and you know what it means?. My focus goes deeper than the "ugly duckling/Prince Charming/red hot final dance" story?for me, a couple highlights of the film are Baby's naiveté, and Baby's ingenuous embrace of the very hot Johnny, and her eager awareness of her rising woman's heat?. In 1987 many moviegoers would have been more than slightly discomfited by the matter-of-fact abortion episode, and perhaps nonplussed by Baby's casual deception to come up with the $250 to pay for it. Wowee. It's great to help out a friend of a friend and all, but that seems like an unbelievable and baffling stretch for a timorous young girl of Baby's obvious unworldliness. On the other hand, Baby's hormones are ready to pop. Alone with Johnny, in the prelude to intimacy scene, Baby suddenly opens up: "I'm scared of everything?I'm scared of who I am, and most of all I'm scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my whole life the way I feel when I'm with you." That's a heartbeat. You felt it, too. I hope you've had a moment, an embrace, a volcanic new feeling of desire that you feared you would never feel the rest of your whole life. I have. And now I know I didn't have to be afraid?. Hope it turned out the same way for Baby.More on my blogs: Barley Literate History: Bottom Lines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1987 hit -- Entertaining, but doesn't respect the intelligence of the viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dirty Dancing" was the hit romantic drama of 1987. The two main cast members are a highlight. Patrick Swayze is in his prime and Jennifer Grey is cute &amp; nimble, like a fawn. In reality Grey was 26 years-old during filming, although she passes for late teens pretty well. Swayze, however, was 34 and looks it, albeit fit and trim.THE PLOT: Patrick plays Johnny Castle, a working-class dance instructor at a mountain resort in the Catskills in 1963. Grey plays "Baby," a 17-year-old daughter of an affluent Jewish doctor vacationing at the resort. She takes the place of Johnny's dance partner after his partner gets pregnant, albeit not by Johnny. Baby naturally develops a crush.The story keeps your attention but you'll roll your eyes at the idiotic misunderstanding where Baby's father assumes Johnny's the one who got his partner pregnant and, for some strange reason, no one sets him straight. Not to mention, the characters always say the wrong thing at the wrong time, which perpetuates the misunderstanding. Also, the sexual union of Johnny &amp; Baby is both premature and unbelievable in light of the time period, Baby's age (17 years-old) and her upbringing. Frankie Avalon was once asked about his early 60s "Beach" movies if the male-female relationships were as "squeaky clean" as portrayed and he answered (paraphrasing): "As a teen back then 'going all the way' wasn't even considered an option." The obvious exception would be disreputable kids from the "other side of the tracks." Moreover, the fact that Johnny is having sex with the doctor's daughter, a minor at that, can't win any points in his favor. Hence, even without the misunderstanding there's little reason for the father to warm up to Johnny. So why does the doctor show respect for Johnny at the end -- a dude who's fornicating with his daughter and is clearly much older than her as well (at least five years). Such blatant flaws smack of lazy writing and are offensive to anyone with an ounce of intelligence. If you can ignore these stoo-pid elements, however, the film is entertaining. The dance sequences shown in the staff area are akin to vertical sex with clothes on. I guess that's why it's called "Dirty Dancing," huh? Yet this is another flaw of the movie -- these dance sequences are so amped-up and choreographed it shouts to the viewer via megaphone: "This is A MOVIE; it's NOT REAL." Nonetheless, Grey's a cutie, Swayze's The Man (like, say, Elvis) and the lush Appalachian locations are outstanding (filmed at Mountain Lake Resort, Pembroke, Virginia, and Lake Lure, NC).The film runs 105 minutes.

		<shortDescription>iconic memorable charming melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1963 in more innocent times. Baby (Jennifer Grey) is a daddy's girl who only wants to be in the Peace Corps. She and her family is spending the summer in Kellerman's Mountain House in upstate New York's Catskill Mountains. It's a vanilla existence until she starts to see the world behind the curtains. The waiters are all recruited from the ivy leagues in order to flirt with the daughters especially the dogs. The owner's son is a jerk that is pushed on Baby. Then she discovers the help's party. When Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes) needs an abortion, Baby agrees to take her place in a dance show with charismatic dancer Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Then Penny gets horribly ill, and her doctor father (Jerry Orbach) comes to the rescue discovering that Baby lied to get the money for the abortion. He forbids her to associate with those people, and Baby is forced to disobey his father for the first time in her life.This is an absolute charmer. It is very old school melodrama. Like the time period, this movie is a much more innocent fare. Of course, there are the iconic scenes, the memorable dance move, the fun, and the great song. On top of everything, there is the beautiful Jennifer Grey and the charming Patrick Swayze. The biggest complaint seems to be the clinches and the sentimentality. However that's most of its charm. It's an uncomplicated times gone by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not flawless, but when judged in the light of what is done today, "Dirty Dancing" is a definite classic ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To some extents, and regarding its respectable classic status, "Dirty Dancing" plays like the third opus of an unofficial "Summer 62-63" trilogy, a trilogy rhyming with eulogy to the magical American parenthesis preceding a tumultuous decade that started with Kennedy's assassination, followed by the Vietnam War, the flower power and concluding with the disillusioning departure of Richard Nixon.The first two films were "American Graffiti" and "Animal House", and it's interesting how each one embraced the feel of its time. George Lucas' sleeper hit was a nostalgic ode to the 60's and its two youth-defining elements: rock'n'roll and cars. "Animal House" was zany and anarchic, fitting the rebellious spirit from which 70's artists fueled their inspiration. And "Dirty Dancing" (two-word titled too) tries to reconcile between both approaches through an improbable love story between a timid teenager with a bourgeois background and a free- spirited punk who works in the same summer resort she spends her vacation with her rich family. The guy is an expert dancer, especially dances that consists on explicitly erotic moves but no matter how 'dirty' they feel, the film handles its material with less subversion you might expect, ending up being the most (unintentionally?) innocent of the three.But is that a criticism? In fact, "Dirty Dancing" is tailor-made for the 80's and the so-called dirty dancing needed to be sugar-coated for ratings reason, as it didn't try to be a musical version of "9? Weeks". So logically, such a nostalgic immersion into a two-decade old era at a time where high-budgeted action-driven blockbusters were the norm could only increase the chances to catch the viewers' eyes (and ears). And for all the pretension it ever had, the film's magic worked, since it ended up being one of the highest-grossing of the year, much more, it reached an iconic status forever immortalized by the timid Frances 'Baby' Levy finally jumping in Johnny Castle's arms. She's your typical not-so ugly duckling, he's the perfect mix of James Dean and John Travolta and it's the typical underdog / impossible romance / coming- to-age story, but when enjoying the immortal "I've Had the Time of My Life" finale, these considerations hardly matter.Still, I'm not denying there's no room for criticism: reading Roger Ebert's analysis, there's not one statement that doesn't ring true, and it's quite a delight to read how "Dirty Dancing" inspired a sort of delightfully sarcastic anger toward an overly formulaic plot. Do I need to list these overused devices? Yes, we know, the shy little girl will grow up and become a great dancer. We know that her father won't approve the romance. We know that some unfortunate misunderstanding will make him believe that Johnny is a bad guy, even if one bit of explanation would have cleared everything. And we know that they will finally dance together, the signal induced by the famous, or infamous line "Nobody puts Baby in a corner", uttered by Patrick Swayze, who by the way, hated that line. Indeed, some pieces of dialog were lacking and some others were too many. But no matter how irritating or predictable every single plot line was, in the context of the film, it didn't betray lousiness in the script but more of a naive straightforward way to get to its point.For instance, having struggled to learn the basic steps of rock and salsa before giving up, I couldn't believe Baby would learn that fast. But I assumed that the purpose of the dirty dancing is to let yourself (as a girl) be guided by your partner's luscious moves and maybe she just 'had it' inside her and had to have that little catalysis from falling in love with her partner. Sure the dirty dancers are obviously professionals, and the racial diversity in the dancing hall is not the most realistic touch of the film. Sure, the whole 'abortion' misunderstanding needed a more serious focus, that and the fact that Baby came from a Jewish background to insist on the family pressure element, ? la "West Side Story". Sure, the dances were not quite exactly dirty (Ebert admitted himself he was misled) but I guess it referred less to the moves than their earlier perceptions from Levy's perspective. But can we blame the film for having a good and catchy title? I guess it handled with confidence a basic material, the flaws are those of average movies, but for some exceptional reasons, they didn't ruin the enjoyment of "Dirty Dancing" because the focus was on the two lead performances, which were good. The role of Johnny was perfect for Patrick Swayze, and Jennifer Grey is absolutely convincing and endearing as the indeed baby-faced Baby. Sometimes, that's all you need to make a good film if it has enough confidence and sincerity about its material. Sure, this isn't "Grease", or "Saturday Night Fever" but the chemistry works between Grey and Swayze, and we like them. Why being so intellectual?Paraphrasing the Oscar-winning song, "I've had the time of life" to watch movies and if I didn't see the ending coming, I wouldn't call myself a movie lover. But I guess that's what the expression "guilty pleasure" was made for. But I respect the achievement of a film that stood the test of time and became such a phenomenon, still considered one of the defining films of the 80's. I also respect it because it's the film that made Patrick Swayze a movie star. And it also gave a one-hit success for Jennifer Grey, the actress who infamously made that rhino-plastic surgery to sink irremediably in anonymity, while it's precisely her 'girl next door' features that touched the public's heart when they came to see "Dirty Dancing". Sometimes, an actor should learn lessons from his own characters.And if only for having inspired one of Rogert Ebert's most irresistible reviews, I'm glad the film was done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dancing makes this movie the fabulous classic that it is. I could watch a million times, and still be in love with it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could be the summer atmosphere, or the time frame of simpler days, or maybe it's the forbidden love between the ultimate bad boy and daddy's little girl, and the music that perfectly sets the mood for each scene; but what I think what makes the movie, Dirty Dancing, so intriguing is simply the dancing itself. We've all seen those movies where we leave the theater thinking we can sing any song, or move to any beat that comes our way, and this is one of those movies. The dancing is different from any other movie, because although it takes place in the sixties, the dancing is so much more risqué than anything movie watchers were accustomed to seeing at that point in time. While using older songs combined with young, sensual dancing the movie is able to reach out to an audience with a variety of ages.The movie introduces its unique dancing early on, automatically intriguing the viewers to question things like "Did people really dance like that?" and "Could I learn how?" The movie is able to reach out to these common people by having the main character, Baby Houseman, witness the dancing for the very first time and shows her utter shock, but also her desire to know more. As the plot continues and the characters become more developed the dancing becomes not only a sight to see, but also it leaves a window for inferences to be made. As Baby is trained to dance by bad-boy Johnny the viewers begin to wonder if their sensual dancing will ever lead to something more? This movie is able to take the typical idea of "boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love" and completely make it new, unique, and fascinating all through the use of dance.As Baby and Johnny get to know each other better throughout their training process, the movement of their dancing goes from simply following the motions, and transitions to actually feeling the music and even expressing their inner feelings for one another. As their love affair grows so does the viewers love and desire to see more and more dancing. The movie does a great job creating the idea that the characters are their truest selves in dancing scenes more than any other.I think so many people enjoy the movie because it doesn't just tell a love story, but shows one. It is able to show a love story not by the characters words but by their choreography. Before Baby or Johnny even declares their feelings for one another it is seen in the way their dancing morphs over time, from impersonal to all consuming. To the characters in the movie, their raunchy dancing is a way to rebel against the expectations of the generations above them, and through this the movie gives the audience a sense of defiance and the idea that they should be proud to do what they love, no matter what society may think.Over all it is so difficult to pin-point what makes Dirty Dancing the wonderful, cliché classic that it is, but the dancing aspect I feel is what ties the intriguing plot, the charismatic characters, the music, and the beautiful setting all together to create something more than a romantic drama. Dirty Dancing is one of those movies I could watch time after time and only grow more in love with it. It has the perfect amount of drama, romance, conflict, and cheesy monologues to satisfy all my desires when watching a movie. Because of this movie the song Time of My Life will always strike a chord in my heart and dancing will never be quite as great unless it's Dirty Dancing.</fullReview>

When I finally did, i couldn't believe I had waited so long, and have since seen it about a dozen times!I had loved Patrick Swayze since I first saw Ghost, so knew he would be fantastic, but I had never seen Jennifer Grey in anything, and I admit when I first saw her I couldn't believe this plain Jane was going to steal Johnny's heart. But as the movie went on she grew on me, and by the end I was imagining the cute little babies they would make together.I read somewhere that the two leads hated each other all the way through filming, but I never would have guessed, their chemistry was great. Good girl falls for bad boy, always a story I can't tear myself away from. And the music, oh the music was what made the movie! I instantly went out and bought the soundtrack and had it on repeat in my car for about 2 years. Loved it! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lightning-in-a-bottle cult classic from the 80s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw DIRTY DANCING (1987) when it came out and it was just like any other 80s flick for me at that time, just basic entertainment. This is one of my Mom's favorite movies and I had to re-watch it to see why she loves it and it holds such a special place in the hearts of many cult fans. Some movies just WORK! And Dirty Dancing is one of those movies. It is an anomaly of a film, set in the early 60s at a summer resort, but with a definite 80s vibe hovering over it, since it came out in '87 and features several popular 80s songs on it's soundtrack, one of which is actually used in the film's concluding explosive dance sequence, the Oscar-winning tune "The Time of My Life".The film stars the electrifying duo of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, both general unknowns at the time, who seem to be perfectly cast for these roles. Ironically, it was well-publicized that the two immensely disliked each other prior to filming DD because of some troubles they had on a previous flick they had done 2 years prior Red Dawn. But, thankfully, they worked out their differences and, thus, this timeless cult dance-romance movie was born! In analyzing the acting, while Grey is wonderful as the innocent main character "Baby" (whose family is vacationing at the resort), it is truly Swayze who steals the show in an utterly convincing and brilliant performance as the very masculine and charismatic dance master Johnny! Swayze's Johnny is so authentic as an extremely gifted, hard-working and talented man (employed by the resort to give dance lessons), who is used, manipulated, and mistreated by the uppity summer residents, that it hurts to watch at times. Swayze truly conveys Johnny's pain and desire for a better existence. Grey's Baby provides that turning point in his life. Grey herself is pretty convincing as a 17-year old (even she was actually in her mid-20s at the time).I'm actually not a big fan of movies whose major plots are romance or love stories, but this one is probably my favorite one of all time! The Johnny-Baby romance feels natural and real, not contrived at all. Initially having a bumpy relationship and interactions, they slowly develop a mutual admiration, respect, and love for each other. They complement each other and bring out previously hidden and untapped qualities. Johnny unleashes Baby's underlying sex appeal (and dancing ability!), while Baby gives Johnny more confidence in himself and more trust that there are decent people in the world, not to mention the most important thing...TRUE LOVE!80s flicks had a tendency to use soundtracks a lot for montages, but DD does it better than any I can recall, underscoring several Baby-Johnny scenes where Johnny is teaching Baby to dance, my favorites being the "Hungry Eyes" montage and the "Lover Boy" scene of Baby teasing Johnny and Johnny playing along. These music-montage scenes actually propel the story as much as the purely dialog scenes.The supporting cast is good, including an effective Jerry Orbach as Baby's Dad, real-life dancer Cynthia Rhodes (from Staying Alive) as Johnny's former dance partner who has been impregnated by one of the other resort workers and Baby must take her place as Johnny's partner, a funny Jane Brucker as Baby's daffy older sister Lisa, and Jack Weston as the resort manager.DD is also an 80s flick that avoids the dreaded "dated" tag due to it being set in the 60s and capturing the vibe of that decade very well, and the film still looks very modern and vibrant, with crisp visuals, not cheap-looking like a lot of 80s flicks. A very breezy, entertaining, and romantic creation of the 80s, DIRTY DANCING is timeless!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the summer of '63 Frances 'Baby' Houseman takes a family holiday that will change her life forever. After meeting dance instructor Johnny Castle, Baby finds herself immersed in the world of dirty dancing.Its the chick flick that reviews itself, Dirty Dancing is timeless. Every generation of girl finds her heart pounding at Patrick Swayze's Johnny and identifying with Baby's romantic faux pas.But Dirty Dancing is more than just a rom-com, its a coming of age movie; charting Baby's progress from innocent girl to woman finishing in an iconic dance set. Swayze is at his best as brooding sexy heart throb Johnny Castle and Jennifer Gray is a refreshingly unsexualised female lead. Set against a stunning mountain backdrop with a cheesy sexy soundtrack its easy to see why this low budget film became such an unexpected hit. The most memorable, quotable girly film of all time. The ultimate chick flick.VerdictIts The Notebook of the 80's, a definite date night movie that can be watched over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All The Elements Of A Guilty Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What movie has all the elements of a guilty pleasure? I think that Dirty Dancing has all of it.The movie stars Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey in the lead roles as Johnny and Baby respectively.The cast also includes Cynthia Rhodes and Jerry Orbach. The story is a coming of age drama that documents a teenage girl's rebellion against her father by starting a relationship with a dance instructor during the family's summer vacation.The film was set in thee summer of 1963.A 17-year-old New Yorker Frances "Baby" Houseman is vacationing with her affluent family at Kellerman's,a resort in the Catskill Mountains. She is planning to attend Mount Holyoke College to study economics of underdeveloped countries and then enter the Peace Corps. Her father, Jake, is the personal physician of Max Kellerman, the owner of the resort.Baby develops a crush on the resort's dance instructor Johnny Castle, part of the working class entertainment staff. When she, while carrying a watermelon, is invited to one of their secret after-hour parties, she observes the "dirty dancing" for the first time. She is intrigued by the sexy dancing, and receives a brief, impromptu lesson from Johnny. Later, she discovers that his dance partner Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes) is distraught over being pregnant by Robbie Gould,the womanizing waiter who is dating and cheating on Baby's sister Lisa. In her efforts to help, Baby also becomes Penny's substitute dancer for a performance at the Sheldrake, a nearby resort where Johnny and Penny perform annually. The upcoming show requires Johnny to train Baby to become a better dancer and learn the required routine.As Baby becomes Johnny's pupil in dancing, tempers flare and a romance begins to develop in the process. Their performance at the Sheldrake goes reasonably well, though she is too nervous to accomplish the dance's climactic lift. When they return to Kellerman's, they learn that Penny's backstreet abortion was botched, leaving her in agonizing pain. Baby brings her father to help, but he assumes that the pregnancy was caused by Johnny, and he therefore forbids Baby to have anything to do with Johnny or his friends. Jake is furious at Baby for lying to him and betraying his trust. Baby, however, defies him and sneaks out to visit Johnny in his room that same night, where they consummate their blossoming romance.Johnny's and Baby's relationship is eventually revealed after Johnny is accused of stealing a wallet from one of the resort guests and is unable to provide a verifiable alibi. To save Johnny from being fired, Baby confesses that Johnny could not have been responsible as she was with him in his cabin that night. He is eventually cleared of the theft charge, but is still fired for having an affair with a guest. However, Baby's selfless act inspires Johnny to realize that "there are people willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them." Even after being fired, Johnny returns to the resort to perform the final dance of the season with Baby. The film ends with an iconic dance finale.Just like what I said in the first paragraph,I think that the 1987 movie,Dirty Dancing has ALL THE ELEMENTS OF GUILTY PLEASURE.It has drama,comedy,romance between two people of different backgrounds - rich and poor,cheese,predictability,teen-age lust,trying to find oneself and of course,dancing.The DANCE FINALE between Johnny and Baby remains ICONIC up to present.There is a lot more I can tell you that.That is why this movie has become a favorite of many people all throughout the years despite of its predictability and many plot holes.Of course,what makes is memorable is the Oscar Best Original Song winner,"(I've Had) The Time Of My Life" by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes.Added to that,the title of the movie,"Dirty Dancing" was not about dirty dancing at all BUT to catch the audience attention into watching the movie.Although a lot of people do enjoy this movie not due to the intelligence of the story BUT due to the pleasure,numerous formula found in other movies and entertainment it provides to the viewer.Honestly,I believe that this is a classic movie in the 1980's but not a timeless one due to just like what I said,"Dirty Dancing contains all the elements of guilty pleasure". A 7/10 rating is fair for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Each Dance is The Time of My Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite my high rating (5/5 Stars) for Dirty Dancing, I admit: it's a guilty pleasure.Sure it's not perfect. Sure, some lines could be considered "clichéd" and the movie's not that unpredictable. But, it's my life. Literally.No, no one calls me baby, or puts me in a corner ? I do that very well on my own. But, I grew up on this flick after my sister, who was the world to me growing up, introduced it to me. Since then, I've probably seen this roughly 34 times. And each time?it gets me.The songs ? oh, God, the fantastic soundtrack, the love ? proved very well by the wonderful acting of Jennifer Grey as Baby, and the comedy ? I still laugh at the jokes, comedic scenes and the silliness portrayed by the boss's son, Neil (Lonny Price) and Baby's sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker.)In my traveled opinion, this movie is an absolute timeless classic. No copy, including the (still unseen by me prequel) can touch it or move me like this movie does. And even the by-a-mile foreseen finale lifts me each time. Yeah, even with what some (not me) would consider the corny line to get Baby onto the stage and away from the judgmental father, Jake (Jerry Orbach.)Setting the movie back in the 1960s was clever. For one, it was a good way to make this movie timeless to avoid the typical 80s haircuts, outfits and attitudes. Also, it got to introduce black-jacketed Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), a (fairly decent) character. A new "Fonzi" (Henry Winkler in Happy Days) or "Danny Zuko" (John Travolta in Grease), if you will.Daddy's little girl (Baby) gets a little too curious at a summer retreat when she gets bored and meets the dance crew of the resort. All but immediately, "Miss Fixit" gets involved in trying to help Johnny's (the dreamboat of her affection) dance partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes), with getting an abortion. With a little hesitation, Penny accepts the help (cash from big daddy's wallet) but this sets off a chain of events.Number one: inexperienced dancer Baby must replace Penny in a gig at a local hotel ? enter in dance-instructor Johnny and let the sparks fly. Number two: the abortion from the backdoor doc nearly kills Penny and Daddy must intervene when he originally didn't know where his money went. And number three: Though Baby did nothing officially wrong, Daddy's trust in his #1 child (shhh, don't tell the idiot sister) has been waned.Will Baby set things right with Daddy? Will Baby grow up to be with Johnny? You'll just have to tune in?as if you haven't seen this movie before. If you ever wanted to, you have, at least a dozen times. Or if you're the football lovin', macho male who despises "chick-flicks" you really should put down your guard and see this one of a kind film.One of a kind is right. Aside from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and the more recent Dancing with the Stars, you can only really enjoy Jennifer Grey here. Her acting was spot on. Her subtle glances have me rolling, but deeper, they're very true to her character. It's what a lot of us go through.And too bad for two of the leads who are no longer with us. The extremely kind-hearted Patrick Swayze was very good for his roll, not to mention danced awesome (with a little help from the equally impressive Cynthia Rhodes.) Also, Jerry Orbach was perfect for what he needed to be as Baby's daddy.While the rest of the cast was great for comic relief or additional (and superb) dancing, the cinematography was wonderful, the editing great and as already mentioned: it had one of my favorite soundtracks. One song in particular ? She's Like the Wind was sung (and (co-)written!) professionally and beautifully by none other than Mr. Swayze, himself. The music was so abundant and fantastic, they needed to add a "More Dirty Dancing" soundtrack. Though, not as great as the original, it's a certainly necessary addition to any fan's collection.This movie should also be featured on the AMC's Movies That Shook the World collection/TV series. For, it had its share of controversy ? Ooohhh?they really are DIRTY dancing?PER SHAME! and check out Baby's age in comparison to Johnny's. Also, it spawned a completely unnecessary prequel ? again, I haven't seen, so I will try to keep my judgment out of it. However that turns out, this is a heartwarming and complete story. No need to go expand or see what happened beforehand. And finally, it should be labeled as influential for the spinoffs (as most movies don't get that far): the short-lived TV series and the stage version. If I remember correctly, they once toured here, in Phoenix, for the AZ State Fair in the 1980s.Dirty Dancing is a must see. Period. It won't change the Earth, it won't cure cancer and it's certainly a "leave your brain at the door"/guilty-pleasure film. But for film lovers, true movie connoisseurs, you have to watch all types of films and this 1980s classic absolutely should be on your list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 80's produced some excellent movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films you should have seen at least once in your life, but I realised part way in that I haven't actually seen this. Though of course this ultimate 'chick flick' is so very known, it's difficult not to feel you've seen it.I was surprised to see it set in the 60's, I presume it was a present day and was rather disappointed by what felt like a lack of recreation of the era, it just didn't feel very 60's. It's not really necessary to detail the plot, other than it really is boy meets girl. The story is quite standard, yet it's done quite nicely and even delves into darker territory with abortion and the perils of promiscuity being sub plots.The leads Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze work well together, with Swayze a handsome lead and amazing to think he was 36 when he made this. Grey is nice as the innocent discovering herself, but I did find her a little too plain. The film's main element for me were the dance scenes an there's plenty of dancing to be had. The leads are excellent dancers and the choreography and camera work are very good; there is also a good soundtrack.The film has legions of massive fans and it is perhaps easy to see, it's quite a classic story and over the years has spawned a bad sequel and a plethora of wannabe films as well as many skits, parodies and references; one of the films most massive lines, indeed moments is when at the hotel's end of season show, Johnny comes to get Frances and says 'Nobody puts Baby in a corner', but I was quite taken aback at the delivery of this, it seemed really abrupt and almost done so quickly that if you weren't paying attention you may have missed it. Still the ending is quite rousing by the time everyone is up and dancing and ultimately there's a lot of fun and a lot to enjoy in this light romantic drama.More of review at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's worth the dance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing is not a great movie. It's a good movie which could have been great. I'm looking at you Baby and the Lefties who wrote this.Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Grey) visits a holiday camp with her family, before embarking to college to study Economics of developing countries to make sure all is where everywhere. But unfortunately, not everything is well at the camp either. A female dancer Penny (Rhodes) becomes pregnant and ironically has no money to get an abortion, so Baby helps her out by loaning her a lot of money. Meanwhile, someone has to take Penny's place as a dancer in a nearby hotel, and Baby volunteers for the job. But she can't dance. Only if there was someone to teach her...And of course, that's what Patrick Swayze is therefore and plenty of scenes with the shirtless hunk ensue and sparks of love fire at every direction. But for the dismay of Swayze, Jennifer Gray can not act which flattens the experience from a great movie to a good movie. Naturally, the incredibly naive leftist ideology that penetrates the film thematically only help to achieve campy silliness, but the kind that isn't sweet or innocent enough to be charming.But really, Dirty Dancing is about dancing and and wearing skin-tight clothing and there is nothing bad about that. To the contrary, dancing has never seemed so passionate and innocent at the same time, and I would assume that is quite an achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Memorable Film, Timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1960s, during a family summer getaway, Frances "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) meets dancer Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) and falls hard for him... with his bad reputation and her father (Jerry Orbach) being a reputable doctor, what will become of this relationship? "Dirty Dancing" is one of the quintessential films of the 1980s. If you grew up in the 80s, you probably saw this film a dozen times. I know I did. I recall seeing it again and again in the summer of 1992, and have returned to it many times since.Patrick Swayze should not be underestimated, and this is one of the cornerstones of his career (along with "Ghost" and "Road House"). And Jennifer Grey is 1980s through and through -- aside from this and "Feris Bueller", what can you say for her? But the film has charm, is very quotable, and despite delving into some questionable territory (both ethical and political questions are hinted at) it is at its heart a family values film: daughter growing up and a father who loves and supports her maturity and independence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I have lost count of how many times i have watched this movie :) My dad threw it out when i was younger because he said i watched it too much! Patrick swayze wrote and sang some of the songs in this movie brilliantly. I have to say that i love the soundtrack as well. The time of my life track is my fave and i love it. My favourite part of this movie is when they are practising in the ocean. The cringiest and well known bit is where she announces she carries a water melon! :)Patrick swayze is awesome as Jhonny in this movie, he plays the character well and the chemistry between him and Jennifer grey is believable. I can watch this movie over and over again because it is great. I actually like her real name and the end when they all start "dirty dancing" is great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Burn the negative, and collect the insurance."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The traditional Hollywood musical, generally based upon a Broadway show, went into something of a decline in the late seventies and eighties, but this period also saw the rise of a new type of musical based upon dance and pop music; "Saturday Night Fever" and its sequel "Staying Alive", "Grease", "Fame" and "Flashdance" are all examples. Most of these films ("Grease" being an exception) differ from the traditional musical in that the characters do not normally sing except in situations where people would sing in real life."Dirty Dancing" is another film of this type. It is set during the summer of 1963, a date which here carries a certain significance. The late fifties and early sixties, the period immediately preceding the Kennedy assassination and the Vietnam war, are often seen as America's age of lost innocence, a view reflected in other nostalgic movies from the seventies and eighties such as "American Graffiti", "Grease" and "Diner".The film tells the story of the Housemans, an affluent Jewish family from New York, spending their summer vacation at a resort in the Catskill Mountains. In particular it tells the story of their 17-year-old daughter Baby and Johnny, a dance instructor working at the resort. (Baby's real name is Frances, although we don't find this out until well into the film). Much of the running time is taken up by dance scenes, and the film is sometimes dismissed as a "feelgood movie". Although much of the music is of a cheerful nature and the film has an optimistic ending, I feel that there is more to it than that. The word "feelgood" suggests something shallow, whereas "Dirty Dancing" treats some rather deeper themes than is normal in pop-and-dance musicals.One of these themes is that of social class. Here in Britain, we tend to analyse class differences in excruciating detail (not only in the cinema, but in the theatre, on television and in literature too), but in America Hollywood often glosses over the subject. Here, however, it is brought more to the fore. The Housemans are middle-class, Johnny and the rest of the entertainment staff are working-class. Even within the resort there are class differences; some of the staff are middle-class students working in the vacation to fund their university courses, and they are permitted to fraternise with the guests much more than the entertainers. Baby's family disapprove of her relationship with Johnny, but have no objection to her older sister Lisa dating Robbie, a waiter in the holidays but a medical student in term-time.A second theme is that of the relationship between the generations, specifically father-daughter relationships. (Baby's mother plays a less important role in the film). Baby's father Jake, a successful doctor, is a political liberal who supports all the right progressive causes. Baby is planning to study the economics of underdeveloped countries at university and then enter the Peace Corps, and there is a strong implication that this future is one that has been mapped out for her by her family, not chosen by herself. Even her name is taken from that of Frances Perkins, the first woman in the U.S. Cabinet. Despite his political liberalism, however, Jake is much more conservative when it comes to family matters and is a rather authoritarian father. The title of the film reflects the older generation's disapproval of the new styles of dancing popular among the young at this period.A third theme, and a controversial one, is that of abortion. There is a subplot involving Johnny's dance partner Penny, who gets pregnant and has an abortion at a time when it was still illegal. Jake's disapproval of his daughter's lover is based not solely on social class but on the mistaken belief that Johnny was responsible for Penny's pregnancy. It turns out, in fact, that the real culprit was Robbie, a serial womaniser and first class cad; when Jake realises this he does at least have the grace to apologise to Johnny."Dirty Dancing" was made on a low budget, and initially the studio (the recently formed Vestron Pictures) did not hold out much hope for it; according to one story the producer's reaction on first seeing the finished film was "Burn the negative, and collect the insurance." It had no major stars; Patrick Swayze did not count as such in 1987. Critical reaction was lukewarm, and in some cases much worse than lukewarm; Roger Ebert complained of its "idiot plot". Yet was a massive success at the box office, proving that critics can't be right all the time, and remains popular to this day.Part of the reason for its success was doubtless its nostalgic charm; nostalgia for the sixties has been an important part of American and European culture ever since 1970, or at least since 1973 when "American Graffiti" appeared. The film is, however, about more than just vintage pop music. It was the film that made a star of Swayze, although, strangely, its female lead Jennifer Grey never really had a comparable success in her later films. Perhaps she was a better dancer than she was an actress; although she is good at conveying emotion through gesture and facial expression, her lines are not always delivered clearly."Dirty Dancing" is also a sensitive coming of age drama about a young girl finding herself and discovering a strength of character she never knew she had. Certainly, part of its appeal is due to its straightforward morality of "be true to yourself" and "do the right thing". The final scene, where Johnny lifts Baby above his head at the climax of their dance, is one of the great finales of movie history. I am always surprised that it did not give rise to a sequel. (Unless you count the boring "Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights", essentially a remake in a more exotic setting). 7/10</fullReview>

I was one who during those years was kicked out of very many dances that I went to, for the type of close dancing the movie portrayed, mostly catholic school dances. I never dated the girl I danced with but we had a lot of fun. getting to the resorts: they were very popular back then. mostly rich folks used them. as the resort owner complains near the end of the movie how jet travel is changing all that, did happen. I like much of the music and the dancing. it will always be in my library. summer time was a time for kids to get jobs like those resorts....rich folks had no trouble getting their kids into one.....money talks. I rated this 10 out of 10. as I feel it does portray the early 60's to some extent. acting I thought was very good for the story given them.I wish the best for Patrick!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always loved the movie Dirty Dancing but just recently I saw the movie Girls Just Want to Have Fun and I see a lot of similarities. I looked up the release dates on IMDb and it turns out that Girls Just Want to Have Fun came out in 1985 while Dirty Dancing didn't come out till 1987. Does anyone else see the similarities? Both movies have: young people dancing, the main couple have to over come their problems and learning to get a long, the father of the main female character is overbearing and doesn't like what she is doing until the final dance, practicing the overhead lift, winning the hearts of everyone, the girls are stepping out, taking chances, and breaking the rules. Dirty Dancing is a lot more in depth of a movie than Girls Just Want to Have Fun but it looks a little like Dirty Dancing copied off of Girls Just Want to Have Fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Teenage Love Affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dirty Dancing" is a classic movie for any life filled audience. If you have been in love before, just smiled constantly, appeared nervously or just bashful; this is a movie for you. "Dirty Dancing" entails a teenage love story between a young girl and an older guy evolving around a lesson of dirty dancing. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Sawyze are the two main characters in this movie. Jennifer, plays the young girl "Baby" and Patrick plays the older guy, "Johnny". Jennifer comes from a wealthy family of 4, her mother and father are married in the movie. Patrick is an independent street guy who doesn't have any family. The only family he has is his dance partner. Baby and Johnny meet in an unusual manner, when she happens to help out a local guy carrying watermelons and he takes her to a party. Baby was well reserved young girl. She was shocked at what her eyes saw when the doors to the warehouse open, and so was Johnny. He was reluctant to welcoming Baby at that time. Johnny gazed into her eyes, multiple times until he could no longer turn away, he held his hand out and asked her to dance. Baby was very shy, she did not know how to dance in any manner. She followed Johnny and he led her into a summer of blissful love, passion and excitement. This movie is one of my favorite movies. It teaches young individual how to be mature and follow their hearts. The film proves the theory, not to judge a person before you get to know them. We are all made differently on the outside but that does not mean we are any different or less of a human being on the inside. This move gives me passion and warmth. Whenever I'm down, this is the film I turn to uplift my spirits. It is based on a pure innocent love between two individuals who genuinely care about each other. They would ultimately give their life for each other. This movie is more of a fairytale come true, and for this reason it has been my favorite for years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nobody puts Baby in a corner!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the decline of ballrooms as a popular night out, partner dance enjoyed a revival with the rise of mambo and various forms of salsa in the US. The Eighties also saw an upsurge of partner dance in Britain with the development of modern jive, a simple dance that anyone could learn. Tapping into this enthusiasm comes Dirty Dancing (1987), a well-constructed if cheesy love story that has partner dance at its core. Fronted by the charismatic Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it also contains a note of rebelliousness that appeals to its teenage target audience.The opening credits (in luminous pink) set the tone with sepia shots of sexy dance routines, slowed down to emphasise sensuousness. The Sixties Ronettes song, Be My Baby, hearkens back to an era before the Beatles, before the death of Kennedy.Baby - the insultingly diminutive name for the heroine (Grey) - is a young girl ahead of her time. She can't wait to join the Peace Corps. But for now, she is being whisked off to summer camp with her protective parents and her superficial sister, Lisa. "Baby's going to change the world," quips her father, whereas Lisa's going to decorate it...At the camp, glamorous female dance teacher Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) has the job of making staid dances, like line dancing, look appealing to the masses. Baby, however, chances upon the staff's private party, where a much raunchier dance is practiced. Johnny Castle (Swayze) is a downtrodden instructor from the streets. In contrast to the Harvard and Yale educated (and outwardly respectable) youngsters, he is labelled with an unfairly bad reputation and with strict instructions not to flirt with guests. As Castle and Baby follow their hearts, each striving towards a moral high ground forsaken by society, they are drawn inevitably together.Why such a formulaic and much copied movie has held such fascination is sometimes a mystery. Its strengths are the tightness of its construction and the first rate dancing abilities of its stars. With the gradual demise of studio based song-and-dance films, associated with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, came a shortage of stars who could both dance well and act. Swayze not only had considerable acting experience, but was born into a dance family and trained with the prestigious Joffrey Ballet School. As is evident from the companion (dance instruction) video, Swayze Dancing, he toned down his abilities as a dancer to play Castle, but still looks riveting.Mambo, which can be performed in a very erotic and sensual manner, is sometimes called "diabolo" - the devil's dance. Unlike many dance/romance movies that followed, this one features many actual dance sequences, augmented by a spontaneous style of acting, but with the dancing obviously performed for real, rather than produced as a result of extensive fast editing cuts, as was the case, for instance, in films like Chicago (2002).The dirty dancing in the film is ultimately a mix of styles, principally mambo and showcase, which provided momentum for many of the popular dance schools of the time and in the years that followed. The film is part of the wave of Eighties indie films that convinced the big studios to diversify and join forces with independents to capture teen audiences. Its sexiness combines with a James Dean style defiance, appealing to male fantasies.While Dirty Dancing lacks greatness, its enduring qualities are too easily overlooked. If nothing else, it provided a template for dozens of lacklustre movies that followed its song and storyline formula without emulating its strengths.Written by Alexandra D.</fullReview>

I think this is a romantic film of a girl and a boy that's love is blocked and they try to keep it together. If you are looking for a movie I would recommend Dirty Dancing in the blink of an eye. You would love the movie. It's romantic, exciting, and has so much perfect explanation of how what happened and why it happened. When I watch this movie it feels like I'm in it with them. I can watch this movie a million times and never not feel the way I did when I first watched it. I would see it more then a zillion times and love it every second. I love that it's almost like your in every persons mind and you know what they mean and everything.Future movies of Dirty Dancing with Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey I would like to see!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing (1987)'Nobody puts baby in the corner.'Dirty Dancing has been a cult classic, and I can see why; it is an inspiring, iconic, musically superb story about dancing and love amongst breathtaking locations.The film, which explores the progressing relationship between a wealthy but kind girl nicknamed Baby (Jennifer Gray) and a dance instructor(Patrick Swayze), develops in a luxurious holiday resort in America in 1963.The film above all has excellent moments of music (including the Oscar winning song 'Time of My Life') and dance (various iconic moments).While the film never delves deep, it has dramatic elements, most notably revolving around class divisions which is a barrier between Grey and Swayze's characters (Baby's father is not accepting of the dance instructor).Never dramatically intense, however the film manages to strike a few powerful and even emotional moments, which elevates it to a 7/10.Falls short of a masterpiece, but a minor classic.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty Dancing (1987)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summer of 1963 at Kellerman's summer resort changed Baby Houseman's (Jennifer Grey) life forever. The Houseman family traveled to New York for a family vacation, and came home with a well-matured daughter and a closer relationship as a family. Dirty Dancing opens with the family driving through the mountains to their vacation destination. Upon arriving at the resort, the owner, Jack Weston, tries to put his matchmaking skills into practice and attempts to set up Baby, an ambitious, daddy's little girl who wants to join the Peace Corps, with his selfish, cocky grandson. Fortunately, Baby sees right past Mr. Weston's plan and discovers how much of a spoiled brat his grandson really is. Plus, she has her eyes on someone else and that is Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), the best-looking and top dancer at the entire resort.In search of adventure and a fun vacation, Baby discovers one night in the staff's dormitories a whole different world in contrast to that of the structured, resort atmosphere. Rock'n'roll music is blaring from the stereo and the entire staff is inside dancing in a way Baby had never seen before. This is the first night Johnny saw her. Initially, he does not care about her in the least, but he soon starts falling for her when Baby fills in for Johnny's dance partner, Penny, after she becomes pregnant and cannot dance. Complications from Penny's abortion cause Baby to ask her medical doctor dad to help Penny and he assumes it was Johnny's baby. Her dad forbids Baby from seeing Johnny, but do teenage girls listen to their parents? That answer is a clear "No." Baby continues seeing him, learning how to dance and falling more and more in love with him. Inevitably, turmoil occurs on several fronts. For the much anticipated last dance of the season, Johnny chooses Baby to be his partner. After all, as Johnny so aptly puts it, "No one puts Baby in a corner." There are many cinematic, theatrical, and literary elements that enhance this movie. The director does a good job of casting Johnny as a "god-like" figure to Baby by using low angles when the camera is on him. This is especially noticeable at the beginning of the movie when Baby sees him as a powerful, strong, and untouchable being. In addition, Baby is cast in some high angles at the beginning of the movie, where she is portrayed to be an innocent, powerless daddy's girl. By the end of the movie, she breaks out of this role. In the dancing scenes, there are many close-up and medium shots that portray the emotion of the dancers about what they are doing and how they feel about each other. The set, at Kellerman's summer resort, is a perfect place. It is out away from the busy cities and allows the characters to interact with each other. The two main settings ? the dance floor and the rest of the resort ? allow the audience to see Baby's struggle of discovering herself. The dance floor can be a symbol of what Baby becomes at the end of the movie, a strong-willed, free-spirited young lady, while the rest of the resort can be the symbol of the life that Baby is leaving behind. The resort represents Baby's innocence and her sheltered life.The summer of 1963 changed Baby's life forever. She became a mature young lady in the setting of her former innocent, sheltered world. Dirty Dancing portrays the trials and tribulations that every girl faces while growing up and becoming her own person. Although this movie is predictable in its conclusion, I personally love watching it whenever possible. I highly suggest it for any young girl dreaming of what she will become as she grows up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proto Type For 1980's Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Orbach, Patrick Swayzee, &amp; a few others do pretty well with this movie. The soundtrack is terrific especially digging out old gems like Big Girls Don't Cry by Frankie Valli &amp; Wipe Out by the Safaris. The story itself is a typical 80's musical harmless plot. Can baby keep her virginity while learning to dance from the hot dirty dance teacher? The best part of this film is the fact it gives the viewer an early 60's feel for the suburbs outside of New York City. It is quite notable that it does this as this feel is what gets this film to a 7 in my analysis. Not a real serious film but a film which reflects the early 60's well. It has plenty going for it &amp; is the best of a terrible decade of Musicals known as the 1980's. This looks like a masterpiece when you compare it to 1980's Popeye. At least in this movie, I am what I am.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Empowers and Inspires</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies should awaken and invite viewers to focus attention on what transpires on the screen. Dirty Dancing does this very well. The story plot is easy to relate to for those in their teens and older. The cast seemed perfect for their roles, the music fit the scenes and told the story in sound to compliment the visual effects beautifully. A really good movie is watched over and over again with similar emotions being stirred up again again each time it is viewed; Dirty Dancing is such a movie. Not only did I enjoy watching this film over and over again with wishful thinking and dreaming, I actually made some of my thoughts and dreams develop into reality by dancing more often myself (which is great arobics, by the way). Dirty Dancing inspires a zest for living and empowers one to action. When a film grips you and motivates to make dreams come true, it is an excellent film that did it job of stirring your soul and mind to make fantasy a reality in your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty Dancing and early '60s American Mores</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in the era depicted in the film. I was about a year younger than the 17 of the character 'Baby'. My working-class family definitely moved in the same circles as the busboy 'Billy' and the dance instructor 'Johnny Castle'. The world of the Catskills resorts was not even within my awareness at the time.I must say that I did not see the film in its era of release. It is only somewhat by accident that I picked up the VHS tape on a flea market table with the thought that not much was lost if the film failed to hold my interest. What a revelation!! I have never gone in for dance films before, but I have changed my tune!I was mesmerized by Jennifer Grey from the instant the opening credits gave way to the actual narrative. She was so innocent and compelling in the character of 'Baby', I was stunned to learn she was actually 27 when the film was made!Two main points stick with me about the film:1. The rich, professional Jewish client?le of 'Kellermans' considered themselves the social betters of the mixture of the white working-class, Latinos, and Blacks that staffed the lower rungs of the employee pecking order. Here were the descendants of penniless Jewish immigrants from two or three generations back now lording it over less prosperous young people with a generally longer history in this country.2. The character 'Baby' was able to rise above this attitude and relate to the lives of the little people in a huge way. She was willing to jeopardize her whole future by providing an alibi for 'Johnny' when he was accused of theft.What man could fail to fall for a woman of such character combined with surpassing grace and beauty? No doubt there would be a rocky road ahead for the two lovers from such diverse backgrounds and values. But with their great love, their union would survive and prosper.Sadly, in reality Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey had major difficulty working together. It never came across in the film, but that is probably why no reuniting sequel was ever made.I have watched this film about 50 times in two weeks and always catch some new detail I missed or misunderstood in previous viewings. Definitely, the best film I have ever watched!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The little film that could! And boy, did it ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the obvious flaws, one can not deny there is a most definite magical quality in this film. Perhaps it is the nostalgic story line of innocent romance in an innocent time. Perhaps it is the feel good soundtrack and dancing. Whatever it is, it transcended many films of the genre and the decade. There is such a strong chemistry between and Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it outshines some clichéd moments in the script. The music works so well in the film. Even the juxtapositioning of the modern day hits, with the time period songs works.The stars aligned for this film, it came out at the right time and just exploded and even after 20 years, it is one of the few movies that is still enjoyable to watch every time. And Patrick Swayze was right! Nobody puts Baby in a corner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think, like many others on here, that the music was exceptional. Last week, one of the channels had a "dirty dancing marathon." Good thing the husband wasn't home, because I watched it all day. I kept wondering why, I love it so much. When he came home, he said that it's the music I like---he's right. And, maybe the fact that we live a 1/2 hour northwest of the Catskills? They did a good job with the movie, to look like Upstate NY. (We don't get that much sun tho.) And I think I noticed Pilot Mountain, NC in the movie? Or near there? Beautiful areas. Just like here. I never tire of watching this movie, tho some on here thought it was awful. Too bad. One thing I really love, is a particular song; "in the still of the night." Growing up in the 50's, my brother and I always had to listen to a neighbor's brother, rehearsing a song-- and they wanted to know, if we liked it. Yep--it was that song! So it was so good to hear it played in a movie! I have to get the soundtrack, and the movie! I agree, about the clothes. Especially that blouse Baby had on, after they go to the Sheldrake. I remember those coming out in the very late 60's. And when her father says; "when I say I'm wrong..." well, he didn't really apologize IMO. Just said he was wrong, but not to him? It should have been; "I'm sorry Johnny." The sister and waiter play good roles too. They all played good parts. "22 countries in 3 days." I've been to Europe 8 times, and to me, that's too much! Every time we drive on Route 17 thru the Catskills, and see the billboards, I laugh thinking about Dirty Dancing. Good bagels too, lol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Films Of The 80's: Dirty Dancing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing (1987): Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey, Jerry Orbach, Kelly Bishop, Jack Weston, Jane Brucker, Lonny Price, Bruce Morrow, Max Cantor, Wayne Knight, Charles Honi Coles, Neal Jones,Paula Trueman, Alvin Myerovich, Miranda Garrison, Garry Goodrow, Thomas Cannold, Heather Lea Gerdes, Karen Getz, Dorian Sanchez, Tom Drake, John Gotz, Karen Kaster...Director Emile Ardolino...Screenplay Eleanor Bergstein.What was the appeal in "Dirty Dancing" ? It was a popular and successful film when released in 1987, it made Patrick Swayze a star and the music for the film had young Americans doing their own "dirty dancing". The films of the mid to late 80's, much like TV programs, had "pop culture" written all over it. At first glance, Dirty Dancing appears to be like that. The soundtrack contains not only familiar and beloved oldies but 80's music, namely the theme song/duet "Now I've Had The Time Of My Life". But upon closer inspection of the film, one comes to realize it's a sort of American movie classic, a love story, a coming-of-age story and overall a terrific film the kind that just isn't made anymore. The film just turned 20 years old. Directed by Emile Ardolino and written by a woman (Eleanor Bergstein), "Dirty Dancing" is set in the summer of 1963. Born-to-money Frances "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is the plain, timid daughter of a wealthy Doctor and his wife who are vacationing in the Catskill Mountains, New York. By chance, she comes upon a "forbidden" dance club where a new, bold style of dancing has been invented. It's lusty, provocative and strongly sexual (thrusting hips, sexual simulations). Before long, Baby is lured into the dance and rebels against her parents and her well-brought-up ways. Trained by star dancer Johnny Castle (Swayze) she becomes his dance partner and dives into the world of competitive dancing. This leads to a series of incidents that ultimately shapes Baby into an entirely different woman. At the start of the film, Baby is plain and lacks confidence. Much like in "Grease" (another film likened to this one and also this was said to be the "Saturday Night Fever" of the 1980's) she blossoms into a beauty and becomes more assertive. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze carry the film with their chemistry, not only on the dance floor, but as actors. We are swept away in their passionate romance. In those days, couples on screen had to wait for a prolonged amount of time in which build-up is made before sexual intercourse took place, unlike today's tawdry films that have the couples doing it five seconds after meeting. The others in the cast hold their own. Jerry Orbach, no stranger to dance and song himself as a Broadway actor (in 1991 he portrayed Lumiere in Disney's Beauty and the Beast) as Doctor Houseman is a strong performance, a perfect foil to Swayze. The doctor is bourgeois, stuck-up, elitist and old fashioned. Other elements that make this a fine movie is the gorgeous locations - the Virginia countryside, where within sedate communities, youth of the early 60's begin the counter-culture. This is only partly true to real life at that time. While dancing was a form of expression and certain dances were a little risqué, the extremities of the dancing in this film are more at home in the 1980's dance clubs and make this film seem very anachronistic. The hairstyles, clothing/costumes and attitudes are too 1980's to be convincingly set in the last "innocence" summer before J.F.K. was shot and the wildness of the 60's set in. The setting only served to enhance the coming-of-age story. Baby loses her innocence and is no longer "Baby" but a grown woman who can think for herself. Cinematography is by Jeff Lur and it is a wonderful-looking film, whether we are seeing a dance in progress or a lake in the moonlight. This movie put Patrick Swayze on the map. He had done many films by this time but his true celebrity came from this film. He is an expert dancer (and more so at the time of this film) having studied jazz dance, modern dance and even ballet (Mikhail Borishnakoff was a friend of his). A Hollywood hottie at the time, his fame has waned somewhat nowadays but his acting powers have proved to be versatile over the years. He would make a cameo for the sequel to this film "Dirty Dancing Havanah Nights" as a dance instructor. This film is a classic of American cinema, a look back at the 1980's dance scene, a love story and a feel-good movie. It may be too long for some people's tastes but that only adds a quality of seriousness to the film. Highly recommended as a date movie, a movie you can watch with a romantic partner or spouse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen well over a thousand movies to date, yet I never gave Dirty Dancing a chance. It's a "click flick," right? On a quiet Sunday morning I watched this film and I'm really glad I did. It's a really great, inspiring firm that holds up well to time - 20 years later I found everything to be very compelling and pertinent.First of all, Jerry Orbach kicks ass. That just needed to be said. Jennifer Grey does a solid job, but Swayze carries the day. This character-driven plot line is relatable and wholly interesting. All in all, I found myself thoroughly engaged.Finally, it even prompted a bit of introspection - if I'm so reticent to dance, what makes me any different from the obstinate, prudish old man? I'll close with this line, one of the real 80's classics: "Nobody puts Baby in the corner." For what this film is: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute classic with this magic aura around it making it unmissable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing is one of my favorite movies of all time...I'm not afraid to admit it, watch it, LOVE IT...and I'm straight!! Dirty Dancing is one of the fastest growing classics of all time now twenty years after it's original release. It seems like almost everyone has seen it, quoted it, talked about it, know of it...it's quite simply magical. The film isn't really BRILLIANT, it's not breath taking in the traditional sense of the word, it's not feat of acting or story so what exactly makes it so incredible?? Magic. Chemistry. The sexiest movie of all time without even a hint of nudity, extreme language, or gratuitous sex. It's just like being dropped into your own summer of love so to speak. It's a coming of age story, a moralistic lesson in standing up, speaking your mind, and helping others against all costs and all the while learning about yourself and becoming an adult. It's simple to see that writer and co-producer Eleanor Bergstein passionately wrote on her own experiences and has a very passionate and romantic mind set when she writes. The characters are almost very shallow and yet you become completely entangled in their lives and you won't ever forget Baby and Johnny Castle.Jennifer Grey headlines the cast as seventeen year old Frances 'Baby' Houseman. Grey is beautiful and sexy but in this very withdrawn, quiet way. It's not overwhelming beauty or screen presence but something very subtle about her. (Grey was actually 27 when she portrayed this role.) This will be (somewhat unfortunately) Grey's greatest role that she will forever be immortalized for. And then Mr. Patrick Swayze. I am a huge Swayze fan and will forever be waiting for his come back to the big screen. He is multi-talented and a great presence and has had some great roles but I'm not sure any compare to the macho, steaming hot, rhythm dancer Johnny Castle. Swayze is just the exact definition of macho but a dancer which seems like an oxy-moron but it's not because he made dancing macho!! He looks incredible doing it, the man is a master on his feet and in the same breath can knock scum bag waiter Robby's block off. Swayze was brilliant. They could not have cast a better actor for this part. The two of them together is really the point of magic. Grey and Swayze are just jaw dropping in this love hate, intense passionate incredibly sexy affair that they have. When they dance together you just can't take your eyes off of them. The supporting cast are almost as important as the main cast because there is just something so incredible about this cast. First of all the late Jerry Orbach is really something as Dr. Jake Houseman, Baby's father. He really has a great role and is a significant player in the film. Cynthia Rhodes shines as dancer Penny Johnson who finds herself pregnant and alone and scared with only Johnny to turn to. Jack Weston as the caring but firm owner of the Kellerman's hideaway that they stay at is terrific, and Jane Brucker as the older sister of Baby far more concerned with menial things like her appearance and personality and her relationship with Robby the waiter. Max Cantor is downright slimy as the womanizer Robby who gets Penny in trouble and then moves on to Lisa Houseman. These are just a few of the really stand out supporting roles in Dirty Dancing.You just simply won't find choreography that stuns like Dirty Dancing whether it's the crazy kids alone in their compound Dirty Dancing or whether it's Baby and Johnny on stage, or the final scene dancing at Kellerman's...even if you're not a fan of dancing you can't help but stare in awe. Then you have the romance and the music...I could write an entire review on the music. Dirty Dancing has some of the best musical montages in history including my personal all time favorite and one of my all time favorite moments in movie history, the 'Hungry Eyes' sang by Eric Carmen montage where Baby learns to dance. I could watch that scene over and over and over again. Dirty Dancing is a hard film to explain because there isn't anything else like it. They've tried to repeat the success with a short lived TV Series (which I would kill to see) and a sequel: Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights which was average in every sense of the word. The only thing that can be said is that there was a magic where everything fell into place...the cast, the music, the setting, the story, the famous lines: "I carried a Watermelon?" "Nobody puts baby in a corner." "...most of all I'm afraid of walking out of here and never feeling again the way I feel when I'm with you." If you haven't seen this film...you're downright crazy because it's brilliant and an instant classic forever in my top 5 of all time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baby and Johnny start out on the wrong foot. She tries to learn how to dance, but she isn't good enough for Johnny. To him, she is a Daddy's girl who gets whatever she wants. She wants $200 without reason, she gets it. Later on after their performance at the Sheldrake, Baby and Johnny start warming up to each other. Baby only wants her Dad to approve of Johnny, but he holds a grudge against him for something he didn't do. He thinks Johnny got Penny pregnant and hired a quack to look in on her (not knowingly), but it was Robbie who got her pregnant. Baby has to earn her father's trust back. Her dad forbids her to spend anymore time with "those people" and she goes behind his back. Johnny ends up getting the girl and says those famous words, "Nobody puts Baby in a corner." I loved the movie because you could feel the passion deepening between Johnny and Baby. Jennifer was one lucky girl because she got to work with one awesome actor, Patrick, who goes above and beyond the call of duty. They couldn't have found a better person to play either of their parts, especially Patrick because he was definitely in shape for the role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing is a very emotional movie filled with suspense and romance. Throughout the movie there are many moral and self values turned inside out. The situations that occur throughout the movie cause the characters to think about their beliefs and the actions they should take. There are many instances where the characters judge each other based on what they do or how they act. This type of judgment is done all the time. There aren't many people who can honestly say that he or she hasn't just looked at a person and passed judgment.When Baby and her sister are introduced to Robbie and the manager's nephew it there are hellos exchanged followed by what they are currently enrolled in or planned to be enrolled in. This automatically sets the stage of how good people are and if they are worthy f certain people's company. The manager has a meeting with all the wait staff and tells them to make sure all the daughters have a good time. Then it is shown that the manger does not want to dance staff to do the same thing. That shows that the manager hasn't the same faith in all the people he hires.When Baby follows a worker back to the workers chambers she sees the life they live and at first she is incredibly shocked. She sees people acting as she had never seen before and the viewer can clearly see that she has no idea what to say or how to act in this environment. Baby is judging the workers in her head and the workers are doing the same to her. She knows that she shouldn't be back there with the workers but she goes anyway. Baby comes off as a 'goody-two-shoes', but in the end she is just a person who thinks of others and tries to do good by all.There isn't a lot of focus on Baby's decision to sleep with Johnny. However, when it comes to her sister sleeping with Robbie there is discussion and thought put into it. Baby automatically assumes that her sister doesn't love Robbie. Baby knows about the things Robbie has done and so she tries to talk her sister out of making a mistake.Baby also passes judgment on Johnny before she gets to know him. She assumes he is responsible for getting Penny pregnant. She assumes that they are together. She of course finds out that isn't true and she tries to help Penny out. She runs to her father and asks for the money for the abortion even though she knows it is wrong and against the law. She is forced to make a decision between what she knows is right and wrong and what she feels needs to be done to help an individual out. Baby makes a strong willed decision and knows that she can not tell her father because he wouldn't approve but she does it anyway.Baby not only questions her own beliefs but she also questions her father and the way he treats people. He passes judgment many times throughout the movie and in the end he is shown that many of his accusations were wrong. Baby tries to explain to him that he isn't being fair and that he needs to listen to his own words and think about the true meaning behind them.When Baby first arrives at the camp she tends to keep to herself and then by the end of the movie she is standing up for people and helping people out. She has changed. She becomes more involved in what she feels rather than what her father would like her to feel. She becomes her own self.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moral and Philosophical Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The blossoming time of adolescent life is exceptionally crucial. This is the time where the young adult must develop independent morals and values. Having to choose to adopt these standards in which they were previously educated by parents and other surrounding adults, or to change and create new ones. The film Dirty Dancing arises moral relativism on several different levels of age from young adolescents, mild age and seniority. Mainly, the youth is indisputably easier influenced and tested by the world because of their innocence. The conventional outlook set by our society as to view dance is quite often mistaken. The nature of dance is depicted to be explicit and sexual especially in this film. Character Frances 'Baby' Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, is at a vulnerable age. She is subject to moral relativism and placed in many situations where she has to use her own judgment to make the right decision. The problem at hand is that while the solution might be right for 'Baby' is not necessarily right in the eyes of her father Dr. Jake Houseman, played by Jerry Orbach. Originally she was not looking for excitement and because of her fear almost avoided any at all.A new sense of independence 'Baby' begins her individuation from her family. With this separation she is tempted by love interest and dance instructor Johnny Castle, played by Patrick Swayze. The dance lessons and intimate involvement are meticulously hidden because of her predicted disapproval from her family and mainly her father. 'Baby's' intimidation to her father can be noticed in her constant repetition of "daddy" and acceptance of her childish nickname. 'Baby's' first sign of separation is her acceptance and answer to her philosophical as well as physical needs. Johnny and 'Baby's' relationship quickly turned physical. She was now entering a new part of life having to debate about virginity and premarital sex. Not only does Johnny provide romantic interest he also introduces her to dance. Dance seemed to be a freedom land for 'Baby' where she could truly express her moods and feelings.A vitally important time in the film puts ' Baby' directly into moral relativism. Another dance instructor Penny Johnson, played by Cynthia Rhodes, is suddenly pregnant. Contemplating Penny's financial state 'Baby' asks her father for money but does not inform him that it will be used for an abortion. Because of his trust for his daughter he respects her deception. Though he at the time was unaware of it 'Baby' made the decision to protect Penny by not exploiting her situation by risking the bond she held with her father. The encouragement of delinquency in Dirty Dancing and the story about "Baby' and her individuation is accurate. By sacrificing her relationship with her father and family she was letting go of her innocence and a step closer to becoming a woman. Adopting her own opinions, morals and values she is able to make decisions. This does not mean she will always make the right ones but it is a process determining an individual's moral relativism. We can learn from our mistakes and use the new knowledge to further help decision making</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DIRTY DANCING was the surprise smash hit of 1987 which told the story of an irresistible romance that develops between a nubile teenager and a dance instructor at a Catskills resort when the girl's family arrives at the resort for the summer. This deceptively simple plot provides the backdrop for one of the most innovative and ingratiating musicals to hit the screen in years with dance sequences that redefined movie choreography forever. Jennifer Grey (daughter of Oscar Winner Joel Grey) turns in a star-making performance as Baby Houseman, the young idealistic teen who finds her head turned one magical summer by the flashy Johnny Castle, played with swiveling-hip sincerity by Patrick Swayze, who made it cool for guys to dance in the movies again. It is the undeniable chemistry between these two relatively unknown actors and some dazzling dance sequences that make this movie worth watching over and over again. Swayze and Grey are magic together and mention should be made of an outstanding supporting performance from the late Jerry Orbach as Baby's father. The film won the Oscar that year for Best Song "(I've Had)The Time of My Life" which is used in the film's spectacular finale. The film is irresistible and once you've experienced it for the first time, multiple viewings will follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A summer romance that blossoms into more than just a fling....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few words to describe this film are; magical, heart-warming, passionate and gripping!!!!!!! This film follows the transformation of one young, shy and naive girl into a strong, sexy and confident woman. It was the summer of 1963 when she met Johnny-the man that would change her life forever. He would show her all that she could be and in return she would teach him that he was just important as everyone else and to stand up for what he believed in 'no matter what it cost him'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Against all odds Baby and Johnny dance their way into a trusting and open relationship that ultimately forges an unbreakable bond between the lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dirty Dancing" from 1987 is an absolute classic of a movie. I don't see how anyone can NOT love this film. It is definitely one of the best 80s classic romantic comedies. Sure, it's typical, predictable, and has all the typical 80s dialogue, but it is so much fun to watch and highly enjoyable. Jennifer Grey plays Frances "Baby" Houseman, a shy young woman who dreams of joining the Peace Corps and goes on vacation with her parents and older sister to a spa/camp. There she meets Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), the sexy older dance instructor. She becomes his dancing partner when his usual partner has to drop out due to an unexpected pregnancy. And as he's teaching her the new dance moves, they fall in love. Of course you love the romance in the film, but it's the dancing that makes the film most enjoyable. Every scene where Johnny is teaching Baby the dance moves is great. They're funny, sweet, and romantic. Makes you want to learn to dance! And if you're a woman it sure makes you want to have Johnny as an instructor! And then of course the climax. The final, main dance scene at the end is the highlight of the film. If you don't love seeing Johnny and Baby dance right on key then you don't' love this film! It is so exciting to watch and makes you want to be her! I think it's amazing how, from watching this film, you would never guess that Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey hated each other during filming. Their chemistry is amazing in this film! I absolutely love "Dirty Dancing" and it is definitely a classic. Definitely one of my favorites. Thank you for reading my review!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Dirty About this Dancing ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fabulous film capturing life in the Catskills for Jewish people years ago.Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey were perfectly cast as the lovers who meet by chance in the summer of 1963. Jennifer's doctor father, played to the hilt by Jerry Orbach, takes the family on a summer vacation and Grey is immediately attracted to dancer Swayze along with his group of dancers.Besides the terrific dancing and music, the acting is terrific. Yes, there is plenty of stereotyping but it's well worth it.Max, the owner of the hotel, played to perfection by Jack Weston, conveys the spirit that existed at these hotels in the 1950s and beyond.There are certainly exceptions to the usual stereotyping. The prospective doctor, who is a summer waiter, gets a girl into trouble and it is immediately assumed that the swinger Swayze is the father. Wait to you see who has committed all those robberies at the hotel. You'll laugh out loud.This is a rare gem of a film since it so beautifully captured the period of time as we discovered and evaluated our youth.You will want to dance up a storm when you see this one. Hard to believe that 20 years has gone by since the film was made. Jennifer Grey, daughter of Oscar winner Joel Grey, had such talent and potential What became of her?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Growing up there was a movie I loved. Star Wars. I wanted to be Han Solo, I wanted the X-Wings and lightsaber. I wanted to live a dream. A little while later I became vaguely aware of something called girls. Now that I've learned to talk to them without pulling their hair and running away (generally) I've discovered that for many of them the reverence I hold for Star Wars they hold for Dirty Dancing. Why? I'll come back to that later.Dirty Dancing is a simple movie. Baby (Jennifer Grey) and her family go to an upper middle class holiday resort for the summer. She is only seventeen, naive and something of a Daddy's girl (Her nickname is Baby, this is not a subtle movie). Once we reach the resort we realise that amongst the staff there is a very distinct class system at work. It is acceptable, even encouraged that the waiters 'show the daughters a good time' but the dancers, led by Johnny (Patrick Swayze) are to keep well away from them. And why not I ask you, after all, he wears tight fitting t-shirts and a leather jacket. He's a wrong 'un and no mistake. Still, as is the nature of these things Baby and Johnny are thrust together due to circumstance, and decide to continue thrusting together due to them both being attractive and young. He teaches her how to dance and she teaches him that he can be anything he wants to be. Unfortunately their love is a forbidden love and Baby's father, Dr. Jake Houseman (Jerry Orbach), cannot see past Johnny's working class roots, assuming that he is the one who got his own dancing partner pregnant. Of course it wasn't, it was that no good, rich waiter who is now making moves on Baby's sister! Still, Baby continues to see Johnny, this is after all true love, but of course they are eventually discovered, Johnny is sacked and Baby is miserable. Luckily her father knows she'll get over it. However, Dr. Houseman had not counted on the big finish. Inspired by Baby's belief in both himself and her ideology in general, Johnny returns to the resort and dances the last dance of the season with Baby in front of all the guests. The evil waiter is discovered, Dr. Houseman accepts Johnny, and the classes are united through the medium of dance. Huzzah! The performances here are absolutely fine. Grey is suitably cute and sunshine-filled, and it is actually hard to believe that she is ten years older than her character is supposed to be. Swayze looks fantastic and I can absolutely see why every girl I knew growing up wanted to be Baby. Orbach is suitably fatherly, giving what is actually a very subtle and real performance. Many parts of the story are contrived, but if you are going to believe that the boy from the wrong side of the tracks and daddy's princess are going to end up together in the end, I think we can accept that.Like many people I really enjoy the soundtrack to this movie. Mixing fantastic early 60s rock'n'roll with mid-80s ballads it starts your toes tapping straight from the start and doesn't give up until the very end. Then of course there is the dancing. I remember at the tender age of nine being at a friends house and having a feeling of pure horror when it was suggested that I be Johnny while she danced as Baby to 'I Had The Time Of My Life'. For a start I didn't think I had a hope in pulling off the lift. I mean, we had never even set foot in a handy, nearby lake.So, back to my original question. Why is this movie so popular, especially with women? Apart from the fact that Baby has a pretty amazing life, I think it is because she is the knight in shining armour. In Star Wars Princess Leia is no slouch but lets be honest, it's up to Luke and Han to rescue her. In Dirty Dancing it is the princess who rescues the lovable rogue. There is no need for a blaster or a lightsaber, here she is able to do it through simply believing in other people and believing in love.This movie will never mean as much to me as Star Wars or Indiana Jones, but I don't think it's awful, I don't even think it's bad. In fact I think it's quite good. It is an unpretentious, feel-good romance movie. I may not have had the time of my life, but it was certainly a pleasant enough hour and a half.</fullReview>

I just wonder what happened to the gal's that played in this movie, seems like they all went away. What a shame. If you enjoy music that beings back memories of the 50's and 60's you will love the music in this movie. Seem like this movie just warms your heart for so many reasons. Take the time to watch it, you will see why it has become timeless. I had heard that this movie was a low budget movie but it does not seem like they cut corners. The resort where this was filmed brings back the days when families spent vacations together. Just a simpler time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i don't understand why so many people have to hate on this movie. it works as a pure fun summer movie, and at the same time addresses much deeper political and social issues. every time i watch it, i see something new. here's part of the new york times article that eleanor bergstein, the writer and co-producer, said really helped the movie get serious publicity:The New York Times 'DIRTY DANCING' ROCKS TO AN INNOCENT BEATBy SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN August 16, 1987KELLERMAN'S, THE FICTIVE Catskills hotel that provides the setting for the new film ''Dirty Dancing,'' is meant to be more than the sum of its parts, which are golf, gossip and gefilte fish. It stands as a metaphor for America in the summer of 1963 - orderly, prosperous, bursting with good intentions, a sort of Yiddish-inflected Camelot. So when Frances (Baby) Houseman, the doctor's daughter at the film's center, loses both her virginity and her political naivete to a street-smart dance teacher, the collision should shake the audience, too, out of a certain complacency.These, at least, are the intentions of Eleanor Bergstein, the novelist (''Advancing Paul Newman'') who both wrote and co-produced ''Dirty Dancing''. It will be up to critics and the public to decide how well Ms. Bergstein and the director, Emile Ardolino, have managed to embody such serious ideas in a movie that also aspires to be a summer divertissement - one part ''Flashdance,'' one part ''Baby, It's You.''To Ms. Bergstein, the two poles of the movie are consonant. Growing up in Brooklyn, she moved effortlessly from tutoring inner-city students in the afternoon to shimmying in ''dirty dancing'' contests at night. Similarly, she says, the rock-and-roll that subverts the dance floor etiquette at Kellerman's during the film anticipates a whole array of exciting and disquieting things to come later in the 1960's - the antiwar movement, the sexual revolution, the uprisings in cities and on campuses.''I meant 'Dirty Dancing' to be a celebration of the time of your life when you could believe that a kind of earnest, liberal action could remake the world in your own image,'' Ms. Bergstein said in a recent interview in her Upper West Side apartment. ''The film couldn't have been set a few months earlier or later. The summer of 1963 was the first one after the Cuban missile crisis, which everyone had been following on television. The effect on kids was to make them very scared, and, for the first time, very suspicious of their elders: maybe things wouldn't work out all right.''But the thing that kept the optimism going was John Kennedy himself - young and energetic and sexy. So maybe you could have it all. It was the summer of the Peace Corps and the summer of the 'I Have a Dream' speech. It was like the last summer of liberalism. Because two months after the movie is over, J.F.K. is assassinated. And two months after that the Beatles are on the 'Ed Sullivan Show.' And after that, it's radical action.''''Dirty Dancing'' had its genesis years ago in a more domestic image that fascinated Ms. Bergstein - two daughters in the same family, one raised to be beautiful, the other brainy.Gradually, the writer's notion of the sisters coalesced with her sense of how some people live through dance and popular music. These ideas, in turn, dovetailed with Ms. Bergstein's autobiographical recollections of Catskills summers, ''dirty dancing'' contests and 1960's activism, providing a narrative framework for the screenplay. And by co-producing her own film, Ms. Bergstein retained a rare degree of leverage over its final form.Unlike some recent films,''Dirty Dancing'' treats the idealism of the 1960's as a genuine expression of faith, not a passing fad.Baby Houseman plans to study the economics of the third world and to enter the Peace Corps. Neil Kellerman, the grandson of the hotel's owner, expects to join the Freedom Rides in the South. Almost everything about Kellerman's attests to the heyday of New York, Democratic Party liberalism. Ms. Bergstein based her characterization of Kellerman's on memories of childhood summers spent at Grossinger's. She evokes some of the more familiar elements of the Borscht Belt, but with the affection of one who had shared in them.''I didn't want to make it ugly and vulgar,'' Ms. Bergstein said of Kellerman's. ''It was a world of grace and elegance and - yes - liberal values. I remember that when my family went to the Catskills, you had busboys who were going to take a semester off from college to go on the Freedom Rides. When the three civil rights workers were killed in Mississippi, there was a candlelight vigil.''But as ''Dirty Dancing'' shows in some moments and suggests in others, places like Kellerman's (and, by extension, Kennedy-era America) could not sustain their placid, satisfied existence. When Baby Houseman (Jennifer Grey) follows a friendly bellboy to the staff quarters at Kellerman's, she wades into a blue-collar life of jacked-up cars, raunchy rock-and-roll, and sneers at the affluent, all of it personified by a dance instructor named Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). She gradually gains some acceptance in this world by substituting for Johnny's pregnant dance partner in a mambo show at a nearby resort, after having lied to her father to get $250 for the partner's back-room abortion. Baby's father, Jake (Jerry Orbach), ultimately learns of the ruse, the abortion and his daughter's burgeoning romance with Castle; and the favored child, ''Daddy's girl,'' has to stand on her own. Baby becomes Frances....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best girlie movie ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was only a baby when this film was released but I remember having watched it since about the age of 9 and absolutely loving it! There are the obvious likability factors...gorgeous male lead,fantastically cheesy ending and amazing soundtrack, but the film should also be appreciated on a deeper level. It is not a traditional chick flick, where there is not a lot to focus on other than the love story...there is definitely more to it. There's the conflict of class between the dancers and the waiters. The issue of abortion and the pain and anxiety it can cause. The film also follows a good and well respected mans realisation that he had misjudged people based on their profession and class and that he was wrong. 'When i'm wrong i say i'm wrong.' He deems Johnny the bad guy and Robbie the good,when in fact this couldn't be further from the truth. With all of these other subplots going on it would be unfair to deem Dirty Dancing as simply a light hearted chick flick. It is undeniably a girlie movie (and a fantastic one at that), but the other issues that it portrays ensures that the film can be taken much more seriously and watched again and again. They give the film much more substance,which means that men can enjoy it without feeling too embarrassed!! In conclusion, Dirty Dancing is my favourite film and I hope these comments can help you see why!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I normally don't watch romantic, sentimental movies, but Dirty Dancing is so much more.The story centers around characters who grow and learn, and who you really empathize with.Add to this the performances of Swayze and Grey. They both did an excellent job, as did the supporting cast. I read another review here which said that the two actors really didn't care much for each other. If this is indeed true, then double kudos for their on screen chemistry.Who would think that two people who didn't like each other could generate such chemistry. I guess that IS acting :-)Jennifer Grey was about 27 when this film was made, but she looked at least 10 years younger (braces and all), which I thought was fascinating. And her performance was heartfelt.Also, kudos for the writers and Patrick Swayze. It would've been so easy to have his character as a two dimensional "hunk/stud" with no brains, but instead he gives a a performance that's both macho and sensitive (which is probably the reason why women went "gaga "for him).Another plus is the storyline. It dealt with subjects like abortion, which was especially taboo back in the early 60's, and a young girl's coming of age, by seeing what life was like outside of her sheltered upper middle class upbringing.And, need I say, the ending dance sequence was DYNAMITE! I have no doubt, in a dance contest, Swayze could probably give John Travolta and Christopher Walken a run for their money.The signature song brings back memories for me.All in all, a very good movie.</fullReview>

The story line may get a bit weird at some points but it's all made up in the last scene. How can you not love the sight of all of the resort workers dancing up the isle toward her and then that final lift. And the water scene when they are practicing the lift. It's just a great movie. It has great actors in it to. Though I honestly don't get why Baby is supposed to be the ugly duckling while her sister is supposed to be the pretty one. It is completely the opposite. And if you really don't like to hear bad singing I would skip the scene where the sister is practicing for the talent show. OWW. But you really shouldn't go without seeing this movie so go rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly a great movie that never gets old! "Baby" Houseman is taken to Kellerman's resort with her parents where she is looking for an adventurous summer. Kellermans is a resort where many rich folks stay and find summer romances. This is not the case for Baby though. Not taken in with any of the activities provided, she stumbles upon the staff's headquarters one night and finds herself watching people dirty dancing. Taken in this, Baby is envious of those good dancers when the head of the dirty dancers, Johnny Castles,and there is instantly a spark between them. When Penny, Johnny's dance partner, finds out she is pregnant, she is unable to compete in the dance competition. Baby offers to do this, but she has no idea how to dance. She spends many days training with Johnny, and while he is not always too patient with her, the chemistry is definitely there. Johnny, the one who lives life spontaneously, and Baby embark on a romantic relationship and teach each other things they never knew.</fullReview>

It was a great family love story that I related to. My favorite part was when Johnny and Baby were playing around to the music of Mickey and Sylvia's "Love is Strange" which was one of the songs I loved when I was a teenager. But I think I loved all the movie, especially when I went out to buy the DVD which had a lot of background info on it. The cast was perfect. The song at the end by the camp staff reminded me of the summer camps I had been to. The music I didn't originally like that much, but it has grown on me and I think it was perfect for the film.

		<fullReview>It might have been groundbreaking in its day but watching this movie in this day and age, everything seems so predictable. Patrick Swayze plays a dance teacher who comes into the lives of a holiday camping family when their youngest daughter falls in love with him. The daughter (a young lady referred to as Baby) becomes a woman during this course of this trip, as well as discovers parts of herself that she never knew existed when she takes the place of the indisposed dancing partner of Swayze's character. It's not a musical although there are very many recognisable tunes and numbers within the film because of its heavy dancing. The film, which is centered around coming-of-age and dancing also deals with abortion and jealousy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone has a different set of morals. Some people base their morals on their religion while others base theirs on their own personal beliefs. Within the movie Dirty Dancing, directed by Emile Ardolino in 1987, there are a few different situations that can be considered morally wrong depending on the person watching it and their views.Within this movie one of the main characters, Penny Johnson, becomes pregnant with one of the other employees baby. This can bring up an argument about sex before marriage and if it is considered right or wrong. Religious people would argue that it goes against the church and their religion and is morally wrong. Other people might consider it a common thing that happens between young people and it isn't so bad. Penny decided that the only thing for her to do is to abort the baby. The idea of abortion is very controversial. You don't have to be religious to have a view on this. Many people argue that it is murder while others say that a woman as the right to do what she wants to her body. This is a very big moral debate that goes on. The dancing in general is also very controversial. The title of this movie contains the word "dirty." This is the description of how the two main characters, Baby and Johnny, are dancing as well as the other young kids. This dancing is very close and there are a lot of hands on activity taking place or groping. At times it is very sexual and this creates a lot of discussion between people about if it is moral correct of not to dance in this manner. Dirty Dancing is an amazing movie that tells a beautiful story about two kids dancing and falling in love. There are different situations that people argue about trying to decide is it is morally right to have in a movie. But this controversy doesn't take away from how enjoyable the movie is to all of its viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all have different believes, some on their religion and some on their personal contributions and their own opinions. The movie Dirty Dancing, directed by Emile Ardolino in 1987, shows how everyone had their morals and depending on the viewers point of view it showed their outstanding beliefs.One of the main characters Penny Johnson, becomes pregnant with one of the employees baby. This has a point if about sex before marriage and if it is right or wrong. Some might argue, specially the strong beliefs on sex before marriage, which their actions that are taken are definitely wrong. Others might believe it is a common thing around young people and that it might not be so bad, going against what others believe. Penny took only one option and she got an abortion. Abortion today some will argue that it is wrong and that it is against the catholic church. Others might argue that it is the choice of the mother, and she has the right to do what ever she wants with her body. This is a very issue that today people debate about.Also, another controversy is the dancing in the movie. The young people on the movie dance in a private house of the club, and as you know it is prohibited dancing like that. So all teen dance "dirty" in most of the movie. The dancing is very passionate and they dance very close to each other, and there is also a lot of touching and groping.Dirty Dancing is an amazing movie that shows how to young people fall in love, when they both decide to perform in an audience. They fall in love when they practice for the performance. To the viewers this movie might seem controversial, because of the "dirty" dancing that the young people perform. The controversy doesn't take about the fun that the love that the kids have the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty Dancing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The exceptionally controversial film Dirty Dancing is a fitting example of a movie which contains many religious and moral topics. This film tells the story of a young girl (Baby), who is pretty much a "goody goody" her whole life up until one summer when she encounters a group of people unlike any she has met before. At a resort in which she vacationed with her family, she was intrigued by dance instructor Johnny and his "bad boy" image. This is a summer in which Baby is faced with moralistic issues ranging from premarital sex, deception, adultery, theft and abortion (to name a few).Even the title of this film offers a sense of vulgarity which I connected with the type of dancing since it so close and the amount of body contact. They way the characters dressed were also very sexual with the frequent showing of flesh and the idea that this type of dancing hinted at sort of a foreplay act.On the more religious aspect of the film, Baby lies to her father about needing money to help out a friend, something that she never had done to her father before. The reason for her lie is to help out a less fortunate cause. As if lying wasn't bad enough, the money she lied to borrow from her father was to go towards Penny's abortion. Another immoral act in the film involved the old married couple who stole from the members of the resort, this contributed to the many morally wrong acts that occur in the movie as well.Although the film contains many religious and moral issues, it also tells a love story and shows the growth of a naive young woman as she is faced with the everyday problems that are a huge part of the world today. While she made some wrong choices herself, she learned from others mistakes and grew up throughout the whole process.Despite the fact that Dirty Dancing contains a lot of moral issues which I do not agree with, but contrary to those facts I still enjoy the film. I believe the character learns from her own mistakes and the mistakes of others around her which ultimately would help shape her into an exceptional individual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? Dirty Dancing rocks. Maybe it's the dancing. Or maybe the music. Heck, maybe it's all of them put together. Not to mention the romance, friendship, trust, and one really hot guy that make this movie nearly prefect. I bough the CD and the movie because I enjoyed it so much. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves music and dancing. The whole movie of course is great, but the ending is the best part. I strictly think there is nothing in this movie to dislike if you are set for a good time. Every time I watch this show, I end up hopping up and dancing along with Cynthia Rhodes and Patric Swayze as they do their magnificent dance moves on the floor and have a great time doing it. If your ready for a good time, watch this movie. You wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

"Nobody puts baby in the corner", it has you hooked straight away.Patrick Swayze is a dancing god, while Jennifer Grey is the sweet but not so innocent Baby.Good cast, excellent dancing and amazing ending.A real girlie movie and I promise you will love it.And the soundtrack is superb too...you've all heard 'I've had the time of my life' such a good track and it sums up the whole movie in that one song.I definitely recommended this movie...but be warned, watch it once and you'll watch it again and again and again.A magical movie to the tune of the tango.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By now, it seems that no one debates that "Dirty Dancing" is probably the best dance-related movie ever. The plot of course has pampered Jewish teenager Frances "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) feeling unfulfilled with the Catskill resort where her family stays in summer, 1963, and falling in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). The movie is good in many respects: aside from the ultra-cool soundtrack, it shows the disgusting-ness inherent in the resort, and the unpleasant - if not dorky - people who stay there.All in all, this is a movie not to be missed. You'll love both Baby and Johnny, and Baby's sister is sure to make your skin crawl. A great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of my favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I too thought this would be a fluff movie with no substance, but was proved wrong. Many people call it a 'girl' movie, but I think there's several messages hidden in it, not to mention some wonderful dance scenes. The best part of it is that it doesn't come across as a 'message movie', so it can be enjoyed by both people who prefer 'message' movies, and by people who just want entertainment. I think Patrick Swayze plays a wonderful sort of Romeo/bad boy, and Jennifer Grey is great as an upper middle class girl who stands up for what she believes in. Another message brought home by the late Jerry Orbach is not to judge a book by it's cover, to use a tired old cliché. In the end, he has to be proud of his daughter (Grey) for sticking with Johnny (Swayze) when everyone brands him as a thief and an irresponsible womanizer. Both Swayze and Grey do a fantastic job with the dancing, which was rather a surprise to me. It's one of those movies to watch on a rainy afternoon, all by yourself with a box of Kleenex. I seem to find it every time it's on TV, and never tire of watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baby Houseman, her parents, and sister take a summer vacation at a fictional place called Kellerman's Resort in New York. Baby quickly grows up when she falls in love with a dancer at the hotel named Johnny. Baby helps other at the resort face their fears such as the female dancer Penny who decides to end an unwanted pregnancy. Baby disappoints her doctor father by the type of people she befriends at the resort, but he fails to realize until the end of the movie that she is having a positive effect on these people rather than them having a negative effect on her. Each time I watch this movie I honestly have a hard time believing Johnny falls in love with Baby because Baby looks so young and naive. However, the casting really is well done because one of the movies themes is you sometimes have to take risks to find true happiness.The movie is enjoyable with the well choreographed dancing scenes and also nostalgic because many people today are glued to their television screens and computers and don't enjoy old fashioned fun anymore. "Dirty Dancing" was filmed about 10 miles away from Virginia Tech at Mountain Lake Hotel in Pembroke Virginia. This is a beautiful hotel that I recommend to everyone visiting Southwest Virginia. Some of the movie was also filmed in Lake Lure, North Carolina and this is also a gorgeous place well worth a visit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know any woman who doesn't like this film. When Baby goes on holiday with her family for the summer she thinks that she's going to have another boring summer with more of the same. Instead she meets Jonny and he teaches her how to live a bit more. Patrick Swayze is fantastic in this...the dancing, the acting and even the singing (they play one of his songs 'She's like the wind' in the later scenes). Even those of us younger ladies begin to find him strangely attractive. The music gets you up and dancing along every time and the cringe-worthy moments early on in the film will have you in stitches. A must-see for all- especially if you love a good chick-flick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally loved this movie! It had everything you could want in a light-hearted movie: romance, great songs, and dancing. It's a movie for all ages, even though it has the appearance of a teen movie. Almost all the songs are memorable and the romance between Baby and Johnny is heart-warming. I thought Jennifer Grey gave a somewhat flat performance as Baby but Patrick Swayze did a good job as Johnny. My favorite song appears only briefly, during the scene when Baby and Johnny are coming home from their first dance appearance and the car radio is on. The song is "Some Kind of Wonderful" by the Drifters. This became one of my favorite songs and it no doubt made a mark on my memory. My favorite scene is when Baby and Johnny are playing around in the dance studio, just before the grandson of the owner of Kellerman's comes in. This movie had a great plot line and beautiful scenery. This movie is as great as everyone says it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing one of my MOST favorite movies. I've only watched it two times on ABC because I haven't had the chance to buy it or rent it from Blockbuster. I had no idea Jennifer Grey was 27 at the time she made the movie, because she was very convincing as a teenager. Compared to some women in Hollywood she has a very flat chest, which is why I was fooled so easily about her age. So both physically and emotionally, Grey pulls off playing a teen very well. I also loved the dancing--who WOULDN'T? Both times I've watched Dirty Dancing, I keep wanting to look up dance classes. I also love the soundtrack, and I do recognize some of the songs from when I was eight or nine. I would LOVE to be able to watch this in my drama class, and I'm going to ask my teacher at some point if there's any part of the movie he can use for educational purposes. It's much better than the stuff he made us watch last year. And the ending was absolutely FANTASTIC. That's one of the best moments in the film.I can't believe I'm looking forward to the first day back to school because of Dirty Dancing! Who could ask for a better influence from a movie with that sort of title?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing - I think everyone has seen this movie at one time or another. I can remember as a kid I loved this movie and watched it over and over again without tiring of it.Now that I'm a little older, I bought the DVD recently and STILL wasn't disappointed with the performance.Swayze and Grey create the atmosphere for this movie, even though it's claimed they don't get along, the chemistry in the movie is unbelievable! As the movie proceeds, we are sucked into their relationship, and believe every single one of their actions. The soundtrack is amazing, the music only adds to the romantic mood of the movie and adds to the relationship between Baby &amp; Patrick.The last scene makes this movie, who can ever forget the famous line "Noboby puts Baby in the corner." The song is perfect and the dancing is amazing! I would recommend this movie to anyone, at any age, it's just a fun movie anyone can enjoy 8/10.</fullReview>

Anyway getting to the point she couldn't find her video so for Christmas I bought her the DVD, well she hasn't had a look in. It sat around for a while then one night I decided to take it upstairs to watch and I fell in love with it. This is a great film with lots of lovely scenes! I love the plot and enjoyed every moment of it! It's definitely not for everyone but if you love a love story then you will want to watch Dirty Dancing again and again!

		<fullReview>i have seen this movie about 50 times already and it doesn't look like i am ever going to get bored of it. i always watch it with my best friend and it has become sort of a tradition for us now to watch it almost every month. every single time we see this movie we both get really emotional and we laugh and cry in front of the TV together and sing all the songs in a loud voice and in the end we always dance.by now we practically know even the whole dialog by heart and watching the film feels like seeing our own old friends on TV.this film is perfect! even though i have to admit that the story itself is a bit cheesy but the characters, the dance, the music and even the place where it all takes place make you forget all about it and you start believing that things like that really do happen and that the song "all you need is love" actually has some kind of a meaning.i am really a normal person and not too serious about this comment of mine but i just cant wait until the next time we'll be able to see Dirty Dancing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard of this film from a friend. She loved it and always watched it. When she told me about it and said how old it was, I immediately decided that I wouldn't like it. I was so wrong. Dirty Dancing was such an amazing film! I love the music and the dancing. I bought the soundtrack and DVD immediately after watching it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey were brilliant in it. They captured the emotions and feelings of the characters so well. They were both such good dancers. After watching the film I wished I could dance like them and I'm hopefully going to take up ballroom and Latin dancing soon. I've become a fan of that sort of dancing and am now hooked on all films and programs about it. Dirty Dancing revealed my passion for dancing and music. My favorite parts of the film are when Baby goes into the Staff's headquarters and sees them dancing and obviously the last scene where Baby and Johnny dance together in front of everyone. I believe that everyone must watch Dirty Dancing at least once in their lifetime. If they don't, it's their loss!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When young Frances 'Baby' Houseman goes to summer camp with her family, she never expected to have so much fun! One night, after wandering away from a resort activity, she stumbles upon a all night dance party with Johnny Castle and other fellow dancers. Quickly enthralled by the raunchy dance moves, 'Baby' is eager to learn when she has to fill in for Penny just so she and Johnny don't lose their jobs at the resort. But young 'Baby' soon finds herself in a sticky situation; she has fallen in love with a man she knows her father will never approve of. However, when Johnny is accused of stealing wallets, it is up to 'Baby' to confirm his alibi by admitting that she was with him the night they were taken. Johnny is fired anyway for getting involved with a visitor, but quickly realises what a mistake it was leaving 'Baby'. He comes back with that famous line 'No one puts Baby in a corner' and they show the resort exactly what they're made of.An amazing film, perfect for a girly night in. With groovy tunes, inspiring dances and a story that will make you feel all warm inside, this has got to be the greatest film of all time! **********</fullReview>

With it's hot chemistry, sexy dance rountines and beaitiful songs, i mean timeless classic like (I've Had) The Time of My Life &amp; the wonderful She's Like The Wind makes this movie. I adore Patrick Swayze in this movie and he shows he can sing and dance it's so hot. He sings "She's Like The Wind" in the movie. The chemistry between Swayze and co-star Jennifer Grey is amazing. I love all the dancing and everything that goes with it. But saying this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great but Patrick Swayze scenes makes this. I love the songs, dancing and everything about it but it isn't Dirty Dancing. Like I said it's an amazing chick flick. Please let there be a 3rd because I love to see what happens with Patrick's character Johnny. Jennifer character could have been more sexy but hey Patrick makes up for that if you know what I mean!!! Great movie and I'm so pleased Billy Zane didn't win the movie role. I heard whispers he was meant for the role but they found out he couldn't dance.</fullReview>

I first saw it at my friends house when I was 13 (now I'm 17) and got hooked!! I saw it there at least 10 more times and soon after, I bought the DVD for myself. At this stage, I have memorized most of the script and can recite it whenever anyone asks me about it. ''I carried a watermelon?!'' It's gotten so bad that I bought the soundtrack and recorded Micky and Sylvia's song, and now it's the ringtone on my phone!! Most of my friends think it's a crap movie, but I don't care what they think of it, I know it's brill! I was reading the comments earlier and I have a few questions for you lot - 1. Why are you asking trivial questions like what ages Lisa and Baby are? I don't think it matters that much. They are teenagers in the 60's, isn't that enough? 2. Where did ye get this special edition that you're all talking about? It sounds VERY interesting... Please reply to this. I'd like to see other fans opinions...

		<shortDescription>The Movie Draws You In - and Back to 1963</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and each time I watch it I am drawn into the movie and back to 1963! The Movie takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time I watch it.I think the important thing to say here is I was 15 in 1963 and I can remember "before President Kennedy was shot and before the Beetles came." I can feel myself saying something like, "I carried a watermelon." and then realizing just how stupid that was! Jennifer Grey plays Frances "Baby" Houseman in Dirty Dancing. Baby is going to start college in the Fall. She goes to Kellerman's for vacation with her family (mom, Dad and sister Lisa).One of the staff dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes) gets pregnant by another staff person (one of the college boys played by Max Cantor) and has a chance to get an abortion but it is on a night that her and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) are scheduled to dance at a nearby hotel.Thus, the need for a fill-in dancer for Penny. Johnny is persuaded by Penny and his cousin Billy (Neal Jones) that he can teach Baby to do the dance in time for the show. Baby learning the dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes!Baby's father (Doctor Jake Houseman played by Jerry Orbach) comes to Penny's rescue when the abortion is done wrong. Dirty Dancing brought back to me this time in history when girls got pregnant and had abortions in back rooms by butchers. Around this time (1963) many girls actually died from this type of abortion - but there were not many choices for a girl then.Lonnie Price plays a great conceited grandson (Neil Kellerman) to Jack Weston's Max Kellerman. Jane Brucker does a great job as Baby's annoying sister Lisa Houseman.The music is great and the dancing is wonderful! The "dirty dancers" are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I can feel Baby's astonishment when she first sees them dancing and says, "Where'd they learn to do that?".Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze are just perfect together in their respective roles. Patrick's song, "She's Like The Wind" brings tears to my eyes each time I hear/watch it in this movie.The movie ends on an up note, but leaves you wanting to know what happens next in Baby's and Johnny's lives. Dirty Dancing gives something new each time it is watched - It mesmerizes the watcher with nostalgia, a feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again.</fullReview>

It's really good if u think about technology and movies back at that time, music is great, storyline is OK,choreography is great, must see it. I don't know why there's a prequel for this movie. Not many people like this movie, but i love classic love movies, they're so much better than movies now! This movie will make you smile, cry and make you start dancing. The music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful. I haven't seen Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights(prequel), prequel should have star the original actors, thats what i hate about prequels, they ruin the original. No one wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many people will agree that for a movie- the original, sequel and the 3rd one is enough. Beyond that, people wont be bothered to watch it. Who remembers the movie about the St Benard Beethoven? I think there's 5 movies altogether.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly think this is a classic. It just makes you want to get up and dance, makes you fell all energized. I remember my parents wouldn't allow me to watch it, but me and my sister would watch it anyways. I remember waiting every year for Channel 11 or the WB to play Dirty Dancing in their Sunday afternoon movies, right before spring started. I fell in love with it, and then dancing. I didn't stick with the dancing sorry to say. I did buy the DVD, and i can say it was good investment. I hope everyone sees this movie its a true romance, maybe a little to girlie fro many men but is a classic in my eyes. By the way i love Patrick Schwayze and if he wasn't 50 something, I would definitely try to date him :-). I just loved the whole movie. I have nothing else to say but they make you have 10 lines so here is 10 lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only saw the movie last weekend &amp; I totally fell in love with it! (SPOILER)I think that the way Baby &amp; Johnnie look into each others eyes it's just... you can just tell that they are in love. I also love the dancing in it! I love dancing &amp; singing &amp; stuff like that how they use their hips to keep balance is absolutely amazing!!! I think the acting is quite good but not great but I think that the movie itself is tops! I cant wait until I buy it because it's such a good movie that if you haven't seen it run out to the video store now &amp; hire it! Because thats what I did. Although there are a few close-minded people that I know that wouldn't know a good movie if it hit them in the face. (Oops sorry I think I just broke one of the guidelines). I hope that most people might think the same about Dirty Dancing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best chic flick ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, this is not a movie for guys, but it is the best chic flick ever. Ask any girl how many times they've seen it and I bet you it is like twenty times. It is about how a goody-two-shoes turns into a woman and her struggles with her family and her own conscience. And hey how can you not love seeing Patrick Swayze naked. DELICIOUS!!! The best scene is the water scene. It will make you laugh and cry, and annoyed with injustices in life. Not exactly a good date movie, but its great for a girls night. Jennifer Grey is in this movie, but I have never seen her in anything else. The best line is "Nobody puts Baby in the corner." by Swayze. The father is on Law &amp; Order. Watch and enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mother took me to see this movie in 1987, when I was all of 11 years old.I think the 'Dirty' part of the title was quite fitting for my age at the time. I was mesmerised then as i am still today of DD. The well known fact that Jennifer Grey &amp; Patrick Swazey didn't get along behind the scenes shows you what magnificent acting was portrayed. The sexual chemistry between these 2 characters was binding! I can still watch DD today and feel the same energy as there was in 1987. 17 years ago Eleanor Bergstein brought her beautifully written story to be directed by Emile Ardolino who unfortunately pass away 20 November 2003. Their vision unsurpasses any Dancing Film that has come since. The year was 1963, it was a time where all 'Baby' had in mind was that she wanted to join the 'Peace Core' and her father was the most important man in her life. The first time she sets her eyes on the rebellious dancer 'Johnny', was a moment to change her life forever. A timeless classic, Dirty Dancing will always be a coming of age movie for myself. Dirty Dancing is a film that will not be forgotten, and no other dancing film that has followed, and will follow (in my eyes) can match the intensity that it portrays. 10/10 in my eyes, because I had the 'time of my life'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dances into our Hearts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is "Dirty Dancing" is a classic movie? I think so. "Dirty Dancing" is a film that will never be dated. The movie is about a young woman named Baby (Jennifer Grey), who goes on a vacation with her family to a resort. While she is there, she meets a guy named Johnny (Patrick Swayze), a dance teacher along with his dance partner Penny (Cynthia Rhodes). Baby falls in love with Johnny and decides to fill in for Penny who is pregnant. Johnny falls in love with Baby, and they begin a relationship. Her father, however, does not approve and does his best to keep them apart. Johnny ends up getting fired because the owner of the resort thinks he steals from the guests. Johnny and Baby are torn apart. Does love conquer all? This movie was to made to show that we cannot judge people on how they look and that love can change anything. Director Emile Ardolino did a fantastic job. Baby's father believed that Johnny was a punk because he looked like one, but Baby sets out to probe him wrong and does so. This shows that we really cannot judge a book by its cover, or a movie by its trailer. This theme shines through in this movie, because their love withstands everything and nothing tears them apart. The movie is wonderful. It kept my attention while at the same time making me think about what may happen next. My favorite scene is when Johnny is teaching Baby how to dance and start to realize their feelings for one another. I can tell by the way they dance together and the look on their faces how much they care about each other. Nothing in this world can compare to that. The combination of dancing and sultry love pulls me in every time I watch it. If you are a guy, you may not like "Dirty Dancing," because it is a chick flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen a number of the "80s dance movies" (Flashdance, Dirty Dancing, Footloose, Fame), and I have to say I enjoyed Dirty Dancing most. It wasn't anything spectacular, but it was cute, funny and romantic. And the dancing and soundtrack were amazing.Jennifer Grey did a great job as the shy-turned-rebel Baby, Patrick Swayze also made the movie enjoyable with his performance as Johnny, and I especially liked Cynthia Rhodes as Penny. She added a serious level to the movie, and did it well.If you can overlook the obvious flaws (in my opinion, extreme cheesiness) that most 80s movies, especially the dance ones, have, you'll enjoy Dirty Dancing. I really did.Now Havana Nights, that another story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy this movie. I wouldn't call it "brilliant" as one user has but it's guilty pleasure I must admit. One thing about the movie (I won't go so far as to call it a film) that really annoyed me was the fact that is set in the summer of 1963 but a lot of the wardrobe and hairstyles were so 80's. This lack of attention to detail really annoys me. But aside from that, the story is cute. The dancing was well done, and the soundtrack is amazing. Patrick is a very talented man, and was involved in many aspects of this movie. Acting, Dancing, Singing, and Song writing. Jennifer did a great job as well. It's a good movie to rent. I don't know that I would buy it. Mostly I watch it when comes on television.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>dirty dancing focuses on the life of Baby - a 17 year old, focusing on her (or more so her fathers) ambition of joining a peace court and changing the world. her life and opinions of it are naive until she goes on a family holiday to Kellermans - where she meets an older, more popular dance teacher Johnny.Baby offers to stand in for Johnny's dance partner Penny when she gets into personal troubles, for a dance show which would conclusively save the pair their jobs - although dancing isn't all she learns; the two end up falling for each other and Baby opens her mind to the real meanings of life and love</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, the plot is thin and you do know what is going to happen several minutes out but one thing remains constant throughout the movie, great music and some fun dance scenes. Sometimes you simply have to watch a movie and ENJOY it without having suspenseful and dramatic twists. This is a very straight forward girl meets boy and "rescues" him from his jaded existence. The music is good, the chemistry is very good and if you just want to watch a movie that is fun to watch, select this one. It is unfortunate that Jennifer Grey went on to have plastic surgery on her face (and nose), she is virtually unrecognizable now. She has turned into a Hollywood clone. We have probably seen her in other films but is so different that we do not recognize her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you by any chance haven't seen this movie yet, DO IT! Today I saw it again, on a collector's dvd edition and loved it again. It has everything that a love story needs to make its viewers touched, amused, and entertained. Each dance scene is perfect. Every time I watch it I regret that I cannot dance.Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey look beautifully together even though neither of them is especially attractive. But as you continue watching you see them thriving with this great ,as if captured by accident, love on the screen.But this movie is not only about first true love. It's also about honesty, fidelity, and friendship. Of course it's done by simple means but thanks to it,we believe that such passionate story can happen to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a movie most women my age can say I have done this before. What woman did not fall in love or have a crush on an older guy in the 60's? I really think they need to make another movie with the same characters in a setting 20 years in the future. Jennifer returns for the summer camp with her parents. She is recently divorced and has two children and just needs to get away to regroup after experiencing what she considers a big set back in her life. She remembers the good-looking guy from years ago and little things triggers memories of him as she goes about settling in at the camp. Little does Jennifer know the guy (Johnny) has also returned as the choregopher with the new dance troupe that will also be there to perform and give lessons to the guest. I really think this would sell tickets just like the first and these two would be able to meet and rekindle the old flame and fall in everlasting love and marry. Sounds like a good movie to me. Wish I knew who to send this idea to and see if they think it would be a good one. I wish someone would come out with another movie similar to Dirty Dancing. I am not so excited about Havana Nights.</fullReview>

I have always been interested in learning to dance and never did so. I really am captivated by the music. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze really have good chemistry between them and everytime I watch the video, I cry. It is a very beautiful love story and it touches my heart. I have seen Dirty Dancing Havanna Nights, but I am still obsessed with Dirty Dancing. I watch it every chance I get. I like to think Johnny came back to get Baby and to work out a relationship with her, and to find out if it was really love they had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie a thousand times and still can't get enough of it. My husband just gets totally annoyed when it comes on. Not saying he doesn't like it. Patrick and Jennifer are the ultimate couple. My life in some ways has resembled this movie. I know I will watch it for many more years. Although some of the scenes are corny this movie shows how some rich people feel about the ones who are less fortunate. Although it is not right it is how it is done. I cry every time I see this movie. Of course my favorite line in the movie is "Nobody puts Baby in a corner". Who wouldn't like that line!! Especially since Patrick said it. As far as this movie being phony I don't think so. If you know what is going to happy just because of a scene then you have watched too many movies of the same things. Get over it and enjoy this movie for what it is a true love story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>compared to most people i got round to watching dirty dancing rather late. i only saw it for the first time in may 2003 with my then bf and his ex gf. even though all the through the film it was "isn't Patrick Swayze fit" but i really got into the movie. all through the summer i barely watched any other film and dirty dancing soon made it to number 1 in my favourite film list. it's a brilliant film, great for every occasion except for the time when i tried watching it when i split up with the bf i'd first seen it with, it made me cry so i had to turn it off. but as i got through that and it didn't effect how many times i watched the film it made me realise just how great a film dirty dancing really is. i do think it's a mistake though for Havana Nights to have been made because dirty dancing is one of those one time greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Dirty Dancing' is a movie most people have probably seen. It is a movie a lot of people at least know by name and today that is a little hard to understand. Not that the movie is really bad, but good is something else. And it probably was a little dirty in 1987 but really shocking it was not.The story about Baby (Jennifer Grey) who has to learn to dance to fill in for the Pregnant Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) and who falls in love with dance partner Johnny (Patrick Swayze) is very familiar. Of course she is from a rich family and Johnny is not so there are more problems on the road.Although it does sound I didn't like this movie I have to say I was entertained. The dance scenes look pretty good and the simplicity of other things make it very easy to watch. I think most female audiences will like this movie very much, if you are not female there is a chance you will enjoy it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing continues to sell massively on video and DVD - why? Because it appeals to women for whom dancing is safe sex: exotic, exciting and, as a bonus, a work-out. With hunky Partick Swayze as a sensitive yet slightly wild man. Guys only see the cliches, like gals yawning at yet another car chase movie, but that does not diminish its lasting appeal. I can see why they are remaking it but suspect that that kind of lightening only strikes once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And no, that one line wasn't, "No one puts Baby in a corner." (Incidentally, chosen one of AFI's "Ten Cheesiest Movie Lines," and deservedly so.) The line I thought made the whole movie worthwhile was Baby's tearful statement to her father, "I know I let you down, and I'm sorry. But you let me down, too." This one hit home really hard for me - maybe part emotion and part timing (going through an extremely rough phase with my own dad).As far as the rest of the movie went, Baby's sister was incredibly annoying (what was the deal with the eyebrows??!! They should have had a credit all to themselves!!). Penny's pose after she has the abortion, when Baby comes in to check on her and Penny's leg is "a'la dancer" with her toe pointed to show her calf to best effect always makes me laugh.The mother's character was not fleshed out very well. The only real insight you get into her character is right at the end of the movie, when she comments, "I think she gets it from my side of the family." Then you see where Baby's sister gets her self-absorption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film so very much. It is one of those films that takes you back to your childhood but really should not because it is a 15 for gods sake!!!!! It's so good that I am going to have 'Hungry Eyes' played at my wedding. Preferably my husband will know all the dances as well. This film, basically, is a classic. Almost every girl over the age of 9 knows this to be true. Just watch it now. Go on, you know you want to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is awesome. It has wonderful music and dancing. Patrick Swayze was terrific as was Jennifer Grey and Cynthia Rhodes. This movie reminds me of the era that it depicts. The last dance scene is the BEST where "Baby" finally blossoms into a truly wonderful dancer and can do the jump!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been reading all the other comments and had to smile, because so many of them don't seem to have liked the movie at all. When I first saw Dirty Dancing I was I think 15 years old and went to dance school, so the romantic background of the movie really touched me because which 15 year old girl, going to dance school would not like something like that happen to her. But that was not all. It gave me the strength to say what I was thinking and not to back off as soon as someone wanted me to. Baby and Johnny show a strength which should be contagious...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in the sixties,Dirty Dancing is set on a holiday resort were a young girl named Baby (Jennifer Grey) meets up with a slightly older man named Johnny.Johnny teach's her how to dance and the pair form a romance and then have to face the trouble with their families and friends.Dirty dancing is a very classical eighties movie with a moving and romantic soundtrack.The end dance is a very classy scene and very touching.If you're a fan and a lover of this type of movie I would strongly recomend Dirty dancing.On the other hand,if you're into action films and other genres,look elsewhere.I rate 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies that i have seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty dancing tells the story of a 17 year old girl on holiday with her family. Baby (Jennifer Grey) is set to chage the world, and has strong views on major events. Jonny Castle (Patrick Swayze) is a dance teacher that comes from a completely different background than Baby. A dance event occurs, and Jonny's dance partner can't do the dance so Baby steps in. The film shows Jonny teaching Baby, and as the film progresses it becomes clear that Baby is more than a dance partner!!Dirty Dancing is still one of the best films. Not only is the storyline great, but the music and acting is brilliant too! Not to be missed!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've enjoyed reading a lot of the comments on this film. Yes its cheesy - but so what? I love it!!My sister and I used to rent this every week and watch it over and over til it had to go back to the shop. Eventually we realised the economic folly of this, and we clubbed together to make it the first tape we ever bought.Maybe when you watch it as an adult it doesn't have the same magic, but I love every second of it, every quotable line (I carried a watermelon?), every thrilling dance move, and the deliciously evil look on Johnny's face when he beckons Baby to come and dance with him! Actually, as an adult, I can recommend the rehearsal scene, just to see those muscles rippling in Swayze's back!So my recommendation is to just let it wash over you, don't think about it too much and just enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dancing brought them together....the years haven't suceeded in tearing them apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The amazement that strikes me when I hear the words `Patrick Swayze can't dance' is indescribable; the day I can dance like that I will be dancing on air!At any rate, Dirty Dancing, otherwise known as `The Queen of the Chick Flicks', is one of the few movies from the 80's that has aged incredibly well. Although its story is light and predictable, it still has the ability to touch something in its viewers. It is the summer romance that every girl dreams of and never has, and portrays the conflicting emotions of the era and age of it's main character sensitively and marvellously well. In today's Hollywood it is difficult to find a movie that knows the difference between a `sex scene' and a love scene. There is only one flash of nudity in Dirty Dancing (despite the title the movie is probably one of the cleanest on the market), and it is most definitely a love scene, rather than one of the random sex scenes that so many movies throw in movies these days, in fact I hold that it is one of the most romantic and best love scenes ever put on film. All in all, Dirty Dancing is a rare find, a movie with a light, uplifting plot, GREAT dancing, and excellent music that is good for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memories!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film many times and I never tire of it. I don't know what it is that makes it so good. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that it came in a period of my life when this kind of movie says it all. In 1987 I was 12 years old and madly in love with Patrick Swayze. My friends and me dreamed about being told things like "Nobody puts Baby in a corner" or to dance the seduction dance with a guy like Swayze. Typical teenage dreams. So this movie might not be the best film ever but the memories it evokes are so lovely that I still watch it every time it appears on TV. It was a while now since I saw it. Perhaps I should rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only other Film that I have experienced that has done a more effective job of breaking down the socio-economic barriers that separate us all through dance would certainly be "Footloose". You take a good look at these kids and just remember that sometimes dancin aint so bad. If Jerry Orbach doesn't turn on your heart-light when he clutches Patrick Swayzes arm and eye-searingly admits that, "When i'm wrong, i say i'm wrong" - then you can go ahead and put baby in the corner. Strike up the band and put on your sunday best - because i've found the time of my life - and so will you! EVERYBODY DANCE!!!</fullReview>

Even though some of the characters where lame, i would still leave Jennifer Gray, because its like ones of those actresse that do a really good job on the movie when they do horrible in the rest of their movies. And seeing how she looks today (2001) she looks nothing like she did. So people still stay a little bit the same so u still reconize who they are but not Jennifer Gray. Patrick Swayze did a great job. The most best looking guy in the movie. This is a movie i can watch over and over again and again no matter how many times it comes on T.V or anything.</fullReview>

This summer sleeper hit is definately a must-see for anyone who enjoys such great 80's movies like "The Breakfast Club" and "Sixteen Candles."</fullReview>

The dancing is great, and not to mention, the music is really cool. This movie will leave you with a good feeling and you may even wish it never ended. I highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing is one of the best movies ever made. I enjoy it every time I watch it, have a cry, a laugh, and I do know basically the whole thing off by heart! Finally managed to track down my own copy which I love! It is a feel-good movie, makes you feel happy! Anyone who doesn't like it, well, each to their own. Wouldn't it be boring if we all liked the same thing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy Romance. . .It's Not Necessarily a Bad Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so no one ever accused this film of being artistic and critically acclaimed. But so what? It's one of those guilty little pleasures. It's the perfect slumber party flick whether you're 13 or 30. I literally think that the phrase "chic flick" was coined with this movie in mind. I don't expect guys to understand--unless said guys understand what it's like to be a pre (or just post) pubescent 14 year old girl enamored with the likes of Patrick Swayze, ready to swoon at the sight of him in a black tank top bumping and grinding his way across the floor. Sure it's juvenile and the acting is not Oscar quality, but there's something in it for every girl who has had a secret crush on an older guy or the "bad boy". Like much 80s music, it's not great--hell some of it's downright bad, but you love it anyway. So if you're feeling frivolous, in the mood for a totally improbable romance and some good old music, then this is a good choice. It was created for you, 4 or of your closest girlfriends, popcorn, and a pint or 10 of Haagen Dazs.</fullReview>

An awesome love story and the dancing is entertaining and So good! So many movies this and last year are using the idea of dancing and this started the whole trend years ago! I can watch this movie over and over and still be amazed at what I see... I give this a 10 star review for sure and it deserves it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie isn't Casablanca. It's not Romeo and Juliet, or any of those so-called "classics". But so what? It's a fantastic movie, and a great love story. It's got a good cast, good music, a wonderful ending...this is one of my favorite movies. It's not a guy movie by any means, it's definitely a chick flick. But all in all, even though maybe some of the dialogue is a little cheesy, and the basic plot - good girl falls for (semi) bad boy, daddy doesn't approve - has been used a million times, and will be used a million more, it still stands that Dirty Dancing is a sweet movie that never fails to make me smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sound Track Excellent! The Film Is Good But Not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are in your teens or 20s, this film will probably be one of your favorites. I know my daughter 17 and her friends, 18 and 24 literally loved it. The sound track appealed to me because I'm old enough to certainly remember some of the great tunes of that time period. The story is an old one but well acted. Some parts are humorous and others mildly touching. One thing I really could not understand is how a young girl, seemingly with no rhythm, learns complicated dance steps in a few days. The overall rating for this movie is poor but I would give it a 7 out of 10. Somehow it works despite its obvious flaws.</fullReview>

How 'bout I knock off this urine-poor food analogy and tell ya' what I think of the movie. The dancing's great, but some nakedness would have scored some extra points with me. And even if that ending song would have actually been released when the movie takes place, I don't think that people would have been dancing to it. The song's pretty lame, and so is the movie when the dancing's not goin' on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I CAN'T STOP SINGING OR DANCING OR SMILING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a purely romantic fantasy. A young girl meets young man. The music, the dancing, along with the overtones of the changes brought on in the mid sixties, all the ingrediants add up to a delightful movie that makes you want to laugh and cry, as well as sing and dance. The sixties were turbulent. but not the early sixties. People forget that there was a part of the sixties that was young and innocent. Dirty dancing shows us the end of that era. Before Viet Nam, the death of kennedy, and the riots and violence of the later years.A time when families, even those with older kids did do things together. I loved the movie. I watch it regularly with my children, ages six through thirteen. They ask me questions about the clothes, the cars, and even in the case of my older kids, the social ideals of the people involved. but mostly they love the dancing and the music.Their favorite travel music is the two soundtracks from the movie. Baby's parents are pretty typical of their social class of the era. Parents trusted their kids, and classes weren't supposed to cross over the lines that society had set up.There was still a very distinct two sides of "the tracks" attitude. So yes, in many ways Dirty Dancing is real. And the dreams of a young girl are always real to the young girl doing the dreaming. I loved the movie. I actually smile in awe at some of the scenes. the feelings seem to be so real that you forget you are watching a performance.I think that many people smile when they watch DIRTY DANCING.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film 4 years ago and after years of pleading someone finally bought it for me..it is my Favourite Movie Ever, for now at least. Romance and passion all trying to hide behind funky dance routines and possibly it works, I don't think it's the best work anyone could have done- the plot is a bit thin on the ground; ie boy meets girl somewhere vaguely original (is that a spoiler?) - but both the romantic leads, Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, I think do a terrific job and the supporting cast mostly do their job brilliantly, making just enough impact without stealing the show. It has all the elements- fantastic leading couple (Johnny and Baby) villains (Robbie, Vivian and nastyish slimeball Neil) plus brilliant dancing from everyone who does to amazing music. Some of the supporting acting is a little ropey but hey, it's all part of the fun. Electrifying stuff, and there's even a sort of moral there somewhere. love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I adored this movie. Let's face it, Patrick Swayze is a hottie. Jennifer Grey blossomed awesomely. And the crickets on the summer evenings sounded real. The only burst to my bubble of enjoyment was the scene in which Johnny and Baby balance on the log over the river. Swayze's hair looked too perfect, and they both looked too fresh to have just finished a wild ride in the rain. Most likely they just stepped out of make up trailers. BUT I digress -- Swayze's passionate monster moves and Grey's gutsy gracefulness made me swoon. All the actors were well cast. I'm glad they'll will be with me on celluloid for years to come. Maybe there's an Arthur Murray studio near me....</fullReview>

I think it encourages shy, unpopular girls to dream and to believe that their dreams can come true when it comes to romance.

Economic use of dialogue, superb lighting and camera work, buried in this film is a very sophisticated sense of myth and symbol which turns what should be a very tired story into an enjoyable ride. Every moment accomplishes what it's supposed to, the film's intelligence plays out in small gestures, movements, no film better illustrates the truism that film is a visual medium. Or one can forget all that and enjoy the chemistry between the two stars. Those who call this film a guilty pleasure, though, shouldn't be that guilty.

Many people say this movie is about the phenomenal dancing provided by Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze, but it isn't. This is the lesson that teaches us not to penalize those of lower stature in society-wealth, job, etc. This movie praises originality and sticking up for your beliefs, which is something few people due in our opinionated society. If you are looking for a movie with a lesson, fabulous soundtrack ("I've had the time of my life", "hungry eyes", "You don't own me", and more), and an allstar cast, then this is the perfect movie.

		<fullReview>This movie isn't deep nor is there anything that stands out as being technically astounding, but this movie is a fantastic, fast-paced feel-good movie. The mid 80's has some great films that have cult status today and this is one of them!It is the simple story of how Baby (Jennifer Grey - looking as great as ever)and her family vacation in the Catskills where the ultra-cool dance instructor's partner gets pregnant and he needs a new partner. Of course, the instructor is Patrick Swayze and you know where the movie is headed but it is such a joy to watch the story develop and the end is perfectly fitting for the film. Not to mention an excellent score that is a combination of 60s and 80s songs.And almost every character is memorable: Lisa - the skanky sister, Neil - the nerdy grandson, Tito Suarez who has the funniest look on his face when asked about sheet music, etc. Virtually every scene is memorable too, especially the 'Do You Love Me' scene, the log/water scene, and the final dance number. Perhaps my favorite moment is when Patrick Swayze bashes the car window and it is only raining on half of the screen when he picks up the post.The point is this: Watch this movie - alone, in a group, on a rainy day, on a Sunday afternoon. It is along with Ferris Bueller's Day Off, one of the best movies of the 80's!</fullReview>

The acting is wonderful and the characters are real. It shows how there are problems in life and sometimes our decisions aren't the best, but in the end we are always left off with things being alright. It shows how there can always be a happy ending and that we should keep on dreaming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Masterpiece. That's the only word I can find to describe a movie that has held true as my favorite since it's release in 1987 (when I was only 7 years old). Maybe it's the brilliant writing, maybe it's the tremendously talented cast, maybe it's the amazing music, the romance, the scandal, the bittersweet plot, maybe it was my massive crush on Patrick Swayze (which still holds true today). Whatever it was (and is), Dirty Dancing captured my heart and I'm not alone. Millions of people all over the world loved it. The same millions who watched it again and again, the same millions who bought the soundtrack and video, the same people who decided to pass up a trip to Europe out of curiosity to visit a summer vacation resort... Dirty Dancing is proof positive that you don't need special effects or big name stars (they were un-knowns at the time of the movie's release) to create a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming, wonderful movie about growing up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing is a movie that will touch your heart for the realism and drama that one can relate to regardless of age or background. It's a story about growing up, about living up to your ideals and standing up to them in hardest moments. The music and dancing in it are terrific and you can watch the movie over and over again and appreciate different aspects of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person in an intellectual field, stating that my favourite movie is Dirty Dancing does not come with kind looks. I, however, have never been more mesmerized and taken by a movie before or after this one. Everything is perfectly placed and the subtle details entwined in the major scenes are excellent: I will always consider the car scene after Baby and Johnny's dance at the Sheldrick to be one of the most masterful cinematic scenes in film history.But, alas, all Dirty Dancing fans know that the only reason they watch the movie is for the last scene. Everything building up to it is necessary and, consequently, moving . . . but that scene leaves me breathless and goosebumped to this day.Do not avoid this movie because it is seemingly a superficial teenage romance. It is not; on the contrary, it is a beautiful picture about life, hardships and of course, love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I could dance like that....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVED this movie; the music really made it, though. When Johnny and Baby danced to "Don't you feel like crying", I wanted to scream Yes, Patrick, I do! for two reasons: one, I never had sex like that with any body who looked or danced that way, and two, I can't dance like that( I'd look like I was seizing or possessed by demons with no rhythm; not that demons HAVE rhythm!) And the opening scene where they played Be my Baby, was the second sexiest scene on film, with the first being the one with "don't you feel like cryin?" Great movie for a bachelorette party(straight or gay) and a really good time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! I know it is not the most appropriate movie but I loved the dancing and the sound track. I have read a lot of reviews and most of them are poor. Most say they didn't like the way they handled love (i.e. sex) The point of the movie is that Baby breaks away from her father and follows her own path. The only thing I didn't like about this movie is they don't show them getting to know each other, as far as I can tell the only thing they know about each other is that Johnny is misunderstood and that Baby has a very positive outlook on life. This bothers me but it does not bother me enough to take away from the feeling I get every time I watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A favorite movie, guaranteed always to make one feel good. The scene, a Jewish summer resort of the last generation, is very familiar to me as I played piano and directed musicals in just such resorts in the 1950s. Dirty Dancing has the feel of such resorts just right and without the Borscht Circuit shtick which can be very distancing for many people. The story is moving, the acting is just fine (my father was a doctor just like the Jerry Orbach character), and the dancing is great. I've seen the movie dozens of time and never tire of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>finding the song in our soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an 7 or 8 year old, when this movie came out on video, I watched it every day with my next door neighbor (and best friend), literally. I will always remember that, through all the bad times, getting together to watch Dirty Dancing. Now that I'm a older, technically an "adult", I rented it to watch again, having forgotten the movie for the most part (except the dancing, me and my friend knew all the moves), even though I've seen it I don't know how many times. Now I understand what is so absolutely great about this movie. It's about a chick who knows how to stand up for herself. About a guy who's had some lucky breaks but is afraid to leave the line drawn for him because he feels that it could be all lost in one single step. About family relationships. About coming of age. About BEING WHO YOU REALLY ARE. Sometimes we disappoint people because we don't measure up to their expectations. This movie shows that its more important we follow our "soul's song". It's about "young love", the kind of love you can throw away your life for. And it's about making a stand. And it is DEFINITELY about terrific dancing. Egads, I wish I could move like that. This is definitely among my top ten favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that changed everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well i have to tell you for starters, this is my favourite film of all time. Yeah i know what you're thinking, how could some critically overlooked movie be regarded as something to regard in that way.Well all i know is , i have very fond memories of watching it, i've watched it over 10 times and it still gets better. What makes it a great film for me is the felling and emotion that's there. These educated film critics don't see that.Sometimes i feel that i'm Johnny Castle and that the whole thing is based on my life. The girl that he loves in the film is also extraordinary in that she's so like the girl that i've always liked too for a long time.I know exactly how Johnny feels, feeling disaffected from mainstream society, i feel like that sometimes.Johnny was in his 30's when he met his dream girl , i'm 24 now so i hope my chance to be with someone like that won't be too far around the corner. Anyway back to the film, i also liked how innocent baby was and how she developed throughout the film from an innocent girl to a mature woman, the soundtrack was just superb and the dancing first rate. I don't care what the critics say ,this film will one day be regarded as one of the all time great movies and i can say that i knew it was from the beginning.I would like to see a remake of the film with different actors to see how they fare.I haven't seen another film that has affected me so much since Dirty Dancing was first released. that's all i want to say.Believe me it's that good.</fullReview>

My favorite part is the last dance scene but you'll have to watch and find out for yourself how Great it is. The soundtrack is the best! You can just listen to it anytime and it'll make you smile. The songs just want to make you get up and starting dancing around. I'm listening to "(I've Had) The Time Of My Life" and I'm seeing the whole dance scene again. "Dirty Dancing" has the greatest dance moves and the best actors and actresses. I wish I could learn those dance moves. My eyes are glued to the TV whenever I watch this because it's very appealing and interesting. Get out there and watch this movie! It deserves a 10 on a 1-10 scale with 10 being the Best!

		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever made! Not only does it have great dancing and choreography, but it also has the infamous theme of "star-crossed lovers."

What more could a girl ask for? All I can say is that Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey did a wonderful job together! It was almost as if they were really in love.

		<fullReview>First, I don't care for 1980s or 1990s films, in general. There is way too emphasis on action, explosions, swearing, nudity, and violence for my liking. "Dirty Dancing," though it is not completely "innocent," is a lot better in these respects than most recent films. And it tells an old, old story very well. Watching Jennifer Grey's character development is a delight. Patrick Swayze's dancing doesn't hurt, either. From what I have observed, more so than with just about any other film I can recall, this is not a movie that men like. But my female friends just about all love it. This is not a great movie, but it IS a great experience.</fullReview>

Also, cannot forget Jennifer Greys work, I admit it, when I first saw the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off, I had a crush on her, she was beautiful then(She is not ugly now, just different to me.), and the 2 of them made a spark, between them, that turned into a nuclear explosion, by the end of the movie, which is why they became a great actor/actress, because they put their heart and soul into their characters, not their characters into them! I would be appalled, if they were to try and remake this movie, there will NEVER be the same intense magic in it, as there was in this one!

		<shortDescription>A Lovely Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Dirty Dancing" in the theater during its first release. I remember the hype surrounding the film--a kind of cautionary intrigue (not unlike that surrounding the release of "The Exorcist"). I waited with great anticipation and I remember how captivated I was by the opening credits, superimposed over the dramatic and nearly abstract images that resolved into couples dancing.Since then, I have seen the film many times. It is a wonderful love story about a young woman who stumbles upon a magical world of dance and sensuality and is drawn to it, and to a charismatic dancer from less fortunate circumstances.The theme of the film concerns appearances and preconceptions based upon class and social station.Jennifer Grey plays the part of Baby, the young woman who learns to dance and who falls in love with Johnny (Patrick Swayze). Set against the summer season of a Catskill Resort, the story is filled with music of the period (1963) and from other periods, recreating a time that was pivotal in the loss of America's "innocence" as well.This film deserves its huge following.</fullReview>

The love story between these two gives me chills even after my hundreds of times watching it. "Nobody puts baby in a corner" will forever be my favorite movie line. I love the emphasis placed on their love without there being too much drama. This love story is filled with passion, romance and strength. I wish there was a sequel! The love that Baby had for Johnny is no longer seen in recent movies. Current love movies only contain love that makes a girl lust over a man. However, Johnny's love for baby is so strong that he is willing to go against his job and her parents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually I used to despise this movie. Looking back I don't really know why. It wasn't until years later, maybe even around the time Patrick Swayze was dying of cancer, that I came to appreciate its worth. Since then I have become entirely enamored of Jennifer Grey - I am now absolutely in love with her. When she was on Dancing With The Stars I was rooting for her every week and think she deserved to win the season as much as anybody who has been on the show. I was born in the sixties and grew up in the seventies but this still brings back nostalgic feelings of a simpler time. A better time. It is a wonderful movie that I watch every time it is on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an all-time 80s feel-good classic by anyone's standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film that catapulted Patrick Swayze to be an international super-star and household name, and rightly so. He was awesome as Johnny Castle, dance teacher and entertainer in an American Holiday camp frequented by a doctor and his family; wife and two girls. One of the girls, Francis "Baby" Houseman, gets caught up with some of the entertainers at the camp and ends up learning to dance at the hands of Swayze. Of course he becomes her first love.Many of the scenes in the film are so iconic now, as is the music. The film produced two great soundtrack albums, and has been greatly imitated. Baby Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, found it hard to learn the dance moves, to comic effect. The film is laugh out loud in places by mainly gentle humour, heart, warmth and is about love, loyalty and friendship and with comment on society's differences in class and how you can't judge books by their cover. It's a lovely film, but despite the wonderful dance scenes and great performances by Swayze, Grey and Cynthia Rhodes - a fantastic dancer - but there is also some rather cheesy acting and it's not a perfect film, and hasn't aged that well (also considering that it's set in the early 60s) from the 80s. Despite the flaws, it's a fantastic, entertaining and uplifting film but definitely one for (predominantly) the ladies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done evocation of 1960s Catskill Kitsch and the Class Gap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess being old enough to remember the Catskills at their peak and the culture helps me write more favorably about the film. I think it captures the schlocky nature of much of the entertainment. I am talking about some of the lesser acts---of course there were some name entertainers at the top of the bill, but the fillers were on a par with the amateur talent show. My impressions of the Catskill "borscht belt" was from the 1950s, and this film represents the early 1960s, when as Max, the proprietor says, "It all seems to be slipping away". I didn't get a sense of the degree class snobbery (shown in the film) in the 1950s, but perhaps by the 1960s this factor was important. I worked as a waiter for a New Jersey hotel that was a sort of "Catskills South" and there was some condescension between wealthy guests and working stiff employees. The guests could be petty and demanding, and we were expected to cater to their every whim for low pay and no benefits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.When I got up the nerve to watch Dirty Dancing, I didn't really know what to expect. I knew the film was a big thing back in the 80's and that it had a lot of people who loved it, and since I love a lot of 80's classics I figured this is worth a shot, but at the same time I had my doubts because it seemed a little overrated, from what I'd heard. When I finished this movie all those doubts were left in the dust!Well, when it started up, I was thinking, "Oh no, this is going to be a predictable mess." While it was predictable, every single second of the film is sheer joy, had implausible pizazz and was lusciously alluring to where I couldn't take my eyes off of it for a second, which in the end, the material of the film prodigiously overcomes it's cliché level!This movie has got non-stop style, fun and wonderful performances! Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze were perfect for their roles! With scenes like the one where their mouthing the words to the song "Love Is Strange" by Mickey &amp; Sylvia and the final dance scene to the, now a classic, "I've Had the Time of My Life", which the dance deserved an Oscar all by itself and did win a handful of awards for the song choice, make this movie just so unforgettably magnificent!The characters, dances, romantic humor and intensity as you see Grey and Swayze slowly falling in love make this movie so easy to fall in love with itself and when it went off I was so pleasantly astonished at how spectacular it really was! This is an absolute gem, is certainly my favorite dance film of all time and by itself is one of the greatest movies ever! I love it and think it's unforgettable, as I've stated a couple of times, with magnificent performances, excellent character structure and unimaginably wonderful dances! Now I see what all the love is about! Classic; It's rating is an unappreciated crime!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Nobody puts Baby in a Corner"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing is a somewhat corny film. Patrick Swayze knew it also because of that retarded line."Nobody puts Baby in a corner" is a pretty stupid line. But it's not so stupid that it makes my skin crawl or ruin the movie. Dirty Dancing is the story of Baby(Jennifer Grey from Ferris Bueller). Her and her family are going up to Catskills for the week. While there, Baby's sister meets a real a-hole. This guy is a man-w*ore. Baby ends up meeting Johhny Castle (Patrick Swayze)and the entertainment staff. Johnny and his dancing partner get into a pickle. His partner gets knocked up by the guy that Baby's sister met. I told you he was a man-w*ore. The entertainment group is screwed unless... Unless they teach Baby how to dance and disguise her as the dancer. Johnny and Baby soon become very close and fall in love. Of course. Dirty Dancing is an all time classic. It really surprised me that it got a 6.1. I think Dirty Dancing is a fun film to watch. I prefer Jennifer Grey to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swoony-eyed boy-girl stuff, aided by the musical uplift...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although set in the 1950s, this popular, music-driven romantic drama is betrayed by its false sense of nostalgia; rarely have I seen a movie which looked so unlike what it is about. But, anachronisms aside, the casting of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey pays off: these two definitely have the charisma the story requires, and their union is nearly credible. Plot has a gawky young woman vacationing in the Catskills with her parents, learning to loosen up with help from a slightly-older man who works as a professional dancer. Two silly subplots, one about an unwanted pregnancy and the other involving a stolen wallet, just about render the melodramatics inherent in the scenario utterly superfluous. Who cares about some guy's wallet? It just chews up time until the inevitable finale--an enthusiastic, celebratory climax--and that's where the picture cannot go wrong. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty Dancing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many movies that define the 1980s, and chick flicks that everyone recommends, this is one of the best examples, and from the year I was born, directed by Emile Ardolino (Three Men and a Little Lady, Sister Act). Basically set in the 1960s, seventeen-year-old Frances "Baby" Houseman (Golden Globe nominated Jennifer Grey) is vacationing with her family at at Kellerman's resort in the Catskill Mountains, her doctor father Jake (Jerry Orbach) is the personal physician for resort proprietor Max Kellerman (Jack Weston). Baby befriends Max's grandson Neil (Lonny Price), and develops a crush on the resort's dance instructor Johnny Castle (Golden Globe nominated Patrick Swayze), she is also fascinated by his "dirty dancing". Baby discovers Johnny's dance partner Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes) is pregnant, womanising waiter Robbie Gould (Max Cantor) is the father, he is also dating and cheating on Baby's older sister Lisa (Jane Brucker). Baby borrows money from her father, she does not tell him it is for an illegal abortion for Penny, she accepts the money, but she and Johnny are due to perform a weekly dance at the nearby resort Sheldrake, she will miss the performance if she goes ahead with the abortion, and they will forfeit their season salary, Billy suggests Johnny to teach Baby to dance and take her place. Johnny begins to teach Baby, the two have many awkward practise sessions together, but she gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction develops between them, their performance at the Sheldrake Hotel is mostly successful, although Baby was too nervous to do the final lift. Johnny and Baby return to find Penny in agony, it turns out the doctor who performed the abortion was a back alley hack, Jake treats her, despite her anger with Baby using money to pay for the procedure, he forbids her to associate with Johnny or his friends. But Baby returns to Johnny to apologise for her father's behaviour, they dance together, and afterwards have sex, Jake tells his family they will be leaving early, but Lisa protests, wanting to sing at the end-of-season talent show, Jake gives in, and despite her father's warning, Baby continues to see Johnny. With his feelings for Baby, Johnny refuses payment to have sex with Vivian Pressman (Miranda Garrison), Vivian instead pays Robbie for sex, they are caught by Lisa, the following morning Vivian sees Baby leaving Johnny's cabin. Later, Max and Neil (Lonny Price) reveal to the Housemans that the wallet of Moe Pressman (Garry Goodrow) was stolen, Vivian accuses Johnny of the theft, in jealousy over his rejection, Johnny cannot give a verifiable alibi, but Baby saves him, confessing that she was him all night, so is not responsible. Johnny is cleared of the theft, it is revealed two elderly guests, Mr. and Mrs. Schumacher, are the culprits, but Max fires Johnny anyway for having a fraternising affair with Baby, Johnny and Baby embrace and bid farewell to each other, saying they have no regrets, despite the objections of her father. The end-of-season talent show is in progress, Jake takes back a recommendation letter for medical school for Robbie when he reveals he got Penny pregnant and insults and Baby, and Johnny walks in as staff and guests, including Lisa, are together on stage singing the closing song. Johnny leads Baby onstage to interrupt the show, he has returned to do the last dance of the season, he makes a brief speech about how "Frances" has made him a better man, Baby and Johnny perform a more provocative version of their Mambo duet, other "dirty dancers" join, Baby runs to Johnny and executes the lift they'd practised, all guests join the celebration, Jake apologises to Johnny and reconciles with Baby, the couple embrace and everyone dances joyously. Also starring Kelly Bishop as Marjorie Houseman, Charles 'Honi' Coles as Tito Suarez, 'Cousin Brucie' Morrow as Magician and Wayne Knight as Stan. Then unknown Swayze became a huge star following his great charismatic performance, Grey is equally great as the feisty middle-class teenager, they are a very convincing on screen couple. The story is nice and simple, the love story formed over dancing is sweet, the soundtrack is fantastic, with recognisable 60s songs, and original songs including "Hungry Eyes" by Eric Carmen and "She's Like the Wind" by Patrick Swayze, and the very erotic and raunchy dance sequences are superbly choreographed, it is a most enjoyable romantic drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 93 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, it was number 98 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("Nobody puts Baby in the corner."), and it was number 86 on 100 Years, 100 Songs for the Oscar and Golden Globe winning "(I've Had) The Time of My Life". Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies of its time, Dirty Dancing is something that you would not want to miss.I waited almost a year to see this and I must say, it was worth it. A must see for someone in Love both with His/Her partner and dancing as well. Patrick Swazye and Jennifer Grey excel in their roles and just see them move along. Although I enjoyed the pairing of Patrick and Cynthiya Rhodes more, but then overall the film is a masterpiece. A film that lets you enjoy the true magic of Mambo, a film that teaches you how to love, a film that makes you remember that you can make a difference, and a film that makes you fall in love all over again. The songs are beautiful and the music is excellent. Some of the scenes just make you say, "Wish I was there...". A special treat for that someone special. Enjoy it with your loved one because its worth it. My vote 10 out of 10 and I wouldn't miss it for any other film. Go ahead and experience the magic of Love, Dance and Music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, the movie has some great dancing but could have a little more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The part I liked the most was the scene where Jennifer Grey (acting as Frances Houseman) had to be a dance partner in a mambo dance exhibition with Patrick Swayze (acting as Johnny Castle)...in a matter of several days.Of course, Jennifer realized that this mambo dance exhibition mandated a lot of practice on her part. The first mambo rehearsal scene I liked was especially when they had to do an opening part on the mambo called the Right Intimate Shadow Pose to Very Slow Masseuse to Rolling Off The Arm to Right Open Side-By-Side Position, to the song "Hungry Eyes." This was perhaps the most boring part of the flick because there are several rewinds of that sequence showing how these dance partners had to get that opening dance sequence absolutely perfect!I also liked another mambo dance rehearsal scene--the ending sequence to the mambo, which included a lady's rocket lift, a lady's Derby throw (aerial step) into an X-line oversway (picture line), and a finishing men's and lady's layback lunge in open promenade. The final dance move was too grueling for Jennifer until Patrick showed her how to properly do the aerial steps--outside the dance floor. So with the help of Patrick, Jennifer was in the air on an open field, and then, the water.Regrettably, Patrick should have told Jennifer that he was an Arthur-Murray-certified instructor earlier in the flick....but the mistake was that he did so in the middle part of practicing their mambo routine.Yet even so, when Jennifer's and Patrick's "Mambo Magic" exhibition occurred to the old-time Mambo hit, "De Todo Un Poco", I had realized why I love dance movies so much. When Patrick and Jennifer danced this Latin exhibition, I saw a new inspiration for me to take up ballroom dancing again--although I had read a very old Fred Astaire dance book at that time. In addition, Jennifer was able to fake what would have been major mistakes in the mambo routine---turning, for instance, a botched lady's star lift into a sort of rooting cheer with bent arms along with leg pumps.Another scene in the flick was slightly less interesting but still intriguing, when one of the employees said to Patrick that because dance trends were changing in the Catskills area, he should dance the pachanga instead of the mambo. I knew at that point that this dance will be different from before.......After I saw that final dance exhibition in the flick, the pachanga they did was different---an eclectic mix of a little twist of lambada, theatrical arts dance, and a taste of the mambo dance they did earlier in the movie. I didn't know what pachanga came from at first, but I realized that one version of the pachanga took place in the heart of Colombia. It was a type of salsa dance which had the famous foot crossings and swivels that you can also see in the modern mambo in American Rhythm dancing. The Spanish word "pachanga" means "party", and it referred also to the resurgence of salsa dance parties in the U.S. during the 1990s, when salsa had its rebirth with the salsa hit "Cali Pachanguero" (by the group "Grupo Niche"), in another dance movie I liked---"Salsa: The Motion Picture."With the pachanga dance in "Dirty Dancing", I also correlate that dancing as much less racy than "The Forbidden Dance: Lambada", which was released in 1990.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>being a 17 year old single girl, I FLIPPING LOVED IT. from the first few minutes, you are instantly introduced to the main character, and though she does not say very much about herself at all, its enough. the beautiful innocence that is Baby (grey) is suddenly shaken up when she meets Johnny (swayze), a wild, seemingly untamable dancer (working at the summer camp she and her family are staying at) with the most incredible dancing talent, an apparently stinking attitude, and one seriously hot bod. the film shows the changes and effects they have on each other, the troubles they and their friends go through, and though the film is packed with moving moments when baby battles with her father to show she has done nothing really wrong, there are also funny moments (such as the really geeky grandson of the camp owner, and Baby's unbearable sister singing), and some lines you really need to look out for. the end is incredible, and so is the sound track.this film is also a GOLD mine of sexy moments, bare-torsoes, bulging biceps and one very nice lake scene.... no straight girl can watch it without moaning or grunting at some point, no matter how many times you have seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie over 5000 times and that is no lie. The first time that I seen it I was swept away with the dancing but most over all with the developing love of Johnny and Baby. The movie was amazing and now almost 20 years later I still make sure to have a Dirty Dancing Night once a week. The music fit the tone of the arrangement. I loved the Scene where Johnny says, I'll never be sorry. That is one of the most powerful scenes in the movie. The ending dance was probably one of my favorite parts. My only wish is that a movie was brought out to tell you what happened to Johnny and Baby. If anyone that wrote Dirty Dancing reads this. Please come out with something new..

I learned too... Now there are more then 14 years since we did that. I still watch this movie and still believe that this is one of the best movies ever made in the entire world. Many people said it's cheesy... I don't get this phrase, my English is not that good but, as I read, it is one o the most watched movie ever... so...back off. I love it. It's not about the dance, I still wonder why do they call it "Dirty dancing" cause I didn't see anything dirty in it. It's about a moments in our lives, moments that anyone experienced or... not. Or maybe we forgot that love, first kiss, first night of love are... are simple, honest and innocent.... and maybe we should make room in our life for love....and forget about...sex.I LOVE IT!</fullReview>

I found out later that Patrick Swayze won a GOLDEN GLOBE for his performance in Dirty Dancing. My record for one is 20 times( I seen the movie 20 times in a week). I also think that there was an great use of the music in this movie the way it was meant to fit with the scene makes it all the more fun to enjoy!

		<fullReview>"Dirty Dancing", a movie that I desperately wanted to see for a long time,due to the rave reviews it received. I Finally got around to seeing it a few days back and, boy, was i hooked. I truly had the time of my life watching this romantic musical almost two decades after it was released. The movie's sure to give me a hangover for the next few weeks. I'm trying to figure out what really made the late 80's flick that special to me? The factor that gave me an adrenaline rush? Was it the dance, the lucid [ but sometimes faulty] screenplay, or Patrick Swayze, sporting a cool, macho look. maybe the soundtrack wins hands down, a factor instrumental in its resounding success. Though everyone goes on about "I've had the time of my life", my favorites was "Hungry Eyes". Though a few critics dismissed the movie as cheesy and mushy, it's certainly become one of my favorites in the romantic/musical category. Watch this flick for its vibrates, energy, music, and last but not the least, its uncanny ability to have you dancing when it ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I adore this movie. When I was thirteen, I watched it an average of once a day, especially in the summer, because it's a very summer movie. It's also very simple, and almost infantile. For me, it's kind of a guilty pleasure. It's deeper than it looks, but it's still very idealistic, and although it's a '60s period piece, it's very '80s. The storyline is idealistic and kind of melodramatic, but the cast is brilliant. It's probably the raw acting ability that went into this movie that makes it a pretty good film, as opposed to forgettable crap. It's also extremely sexy. Laugh if you want, but it's one of the best movies for sweet romance that doesn't become sexless. It has a great soundtrack, and it actually examines social issues of the '60s and later very well. And the entire cast is brilliant, which is something I can't say enough. "Dirty Dancing" is so cheesy, but so joyous and heartfelt that you can't help but love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who thought it was cute when...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did anyone think it was cute when Johnny came into the hall on the last night and saw Baby sitting with her parents, and walked up to them, murmuring "Nobody puts Baby in a corner" before whisking her away? I thought that was adorable! I also found it cute that her dad tried to go after him, but the mother pulled him back. Personally, I thought that was one of the best endings to a movie I have ever seen, and the fact that Baby's father actually goes up to Johnny and say's "when I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong" and then tells his daughter how wonderful she looked on stage was a great thing to see. You don't get endings like that anymore for some reason. In my opinion, Dirty Dancing is one of the best musicals of all time, better than Saturday Night fever, and high up there with Grease.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just think it's a wonderful movie.The first time I saw it I was maybe 6 or 7 years old. and I loved it! today, being 22, (and after seeing it hundreds of times) I still do. And believe me, it doesn't has anything to do with Patrick Swayze being on it! I just think you can never get enough of this amazing dance scenes, those beautiful location and the best soundtrack ever. No matter how you are feeling, watching Dirty Dancing it's always a great experience. What I think it's so great about this movie is that you can see it whether in a superficial way ( like a classic love story) or in a deep way, and you will always love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie of the 80's...and other decades!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think there's always someone somewhere in the world, with some music of this movie in his head. That shows how remarkable it was this movie, for many generations, especially my own, the ones who born in the 70's. But what I never imagined was that my young kid would be one day sitting at the table, having breakfast and singing "I've had the time of my life, and I never felt like this before...". He's only 8, for God's sake! The performances are great, the dancing is amazing, the directing swelling and the musics just unforgettable. I must admit this is not a hell of picture, but I'll be damned if this is not a good show to look at and just enjoy for two hours. I guarantee that when the credits appear you'll be asking someone to shut the lights off and dance with the love of your life. Like any good movie, but not great, there's a sequel to ruin the business. So don't make any mistakes. The first one is the real thing, and the real thing sees no boundaries, no classes and no differences in all of us. That's love, and this show sure tell us that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, uh um.. This is the all time best girls movie!! Nobody really understands it, but it takes your breath away in a second. I was pretty young when I saw it the first time, 7 years. And Oh Boy! (I think that because I was so young it had some kind of extra extra influence on me) I could'nt stop talking about it. I would sit in my window with my radio on the top volume and just sit there and enjoy the late Swedish summer sun of ?94 and my wonderful music. Orh, I loved it so much!If there's anything that I really remember from my childhood is the love for this movie. It has unconsciously had a very positive influence on me ever since, Yes, It made me much more interested in life (Honestly). And it made me much much much more positive! Since then.. I've practically sung every day, maby not 'Be my baby' or 'The time of my life' but it made me fall in love with music and the magic of both life and love. I will always love it, always!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was seven. Ever since then I make it my duty to watch it at least once a month. Patrick Swayze is by far the most gorgeous actor and Jennifer Grey could not compliment him better. The most romantic line has to be when Johnny says, "Nobody puts Baby in the corner." Every time I see the movie I cry as Johnny leaves down the dirt road and comes back for the sake of true love. This movie gave me hope that anything is possible. Baby turns a rugged dance instructor into, "the kind of person he wants to be." This movie inspired me to be a better person and stand up for other people no matter what it costs. If you have not seen this movie yet, you are truly missing something wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching "Dirty Dancing" for the first time when I was only 7 years old. I was obsessed with the movie, especially the music, but was too young to fully understand the story. Mostly, I watched it for the music ("(I've Had) The Time of My Life", "Hungry Eyes", and "She's Like the Wind" are my favorites). Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey are wonderful on screen together. The supporting cast is good too, especially Jerry Orbach as Grey's father and Cynthia Rhodes as Swayze's dance partner Penny.The reason I believe so many people enjoy "Dirty Dancing" so much is for its music and dancing, but also its story. A story that is about real people dealing with real life issues is what people can relate to. I hope this film gets made into a Broadway musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The basic plot's been written up several times, so I'll not write it up again. This film has excellent music and dance - plain and simple! The relationship between Baby and Johnny is in there for the women, who demand some romance in every film. The film is mainly about how hung up everyone was in the early 60s and how kids used to "dirty dance" behind their parents' collective backs. I grew up in this time, although the dancing that my friends and I did wasn't quite as "dirty" as what was depicted in this film. But it was still "lewd" according to the older generation. Remember, these were the folks who wouldn't allow Elvis to be shown below the waist on TV for another couple of years. So I knew the whole mindset and the scene firsthand and it brought back a few memories! I loved this film and gave it a solid 8.</fullReview>

A bright and cheery "feel good" experience that's always fun to watch and enjoy during a date night or a party! You simply have to take it at face value and not too seriously! The soundtrack,the photography,the summer resort setting and of course the fabulous dance numbers all have managed to work together to make one of the 80s biggest and most memorable hits! But,you have to laugh at what the filmakers tried to pull off: a conglomeration of characters who act and dress and behave in ways UNHEARD OF in 1960s America! BUT...maybe that's what does it! Is it the summertime vacation experience that everyone (young or old) has secret dreams about? Does this far-fetched soap-opera/love story strike such a deep nerve in our American viewers that we love it because it lives-out our fantasies??? Who knows??

		<shortDescription>I no longer have spaghetti arms for this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once made an audio tape reviewing some of the movies I've seen, and I remember saying about this one, "good dancing, I like the dancing." Never did I mention if I liked the acting, the story, the setting, or the soundtrack, probably cause none of it is any good. It has limited entertainment worth, primarily for said dancing. One of the best dance scenes was the first one between the light-footed Patrick Swayze and Cynthia Rhodes; a dynamic and tightly choreographed feast for the eyes. However, pre-nose job Jennifer Grey as Baby doesn't look like she is pretending to have tough time keeping up with dancin' Swayze as Johhny Castle. As memorable as Baby is, she really should have stayed in the corner, cause I would've preferred to hear Penny's story. The reasons for my distaste and never-again-viewing of DD are as follows. 1)Since the first time I watched it I *always* had an underlying feeling that "Hey, this is not very good." 2) I read the Mad Magazine satire, of which every single panel bore a caption of each and every cliche' prominent in the movie. 3) Then Maxim magazine listed the 50 worst movies of all time, with Dirty Dancing at #11. Now I...had...the time of my life--but lots of it was wasted watching this corny-ass-chick-flick-disguised-as-a-musical.</fullReview>

When his partner gets pregnant, she has to get an abortion. Otherwise, they'll loose their jobs. But they also have a show, and if they don't do that, they'll loose their jobs. And the only appointment for the abortion is the night of the show. So, Baby volunteers to be Johnny's partner. And they fall for each other in the process of Baby learning how to dance.It's a cute story line. I was a little surprised at the rating, but you can't win 'em all.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still recall the moronic hype after this flick came out 15 years ago.Though I had suspected it was another of those unexplainable and ephemeral pop-cultural furors, when seeing it for the first time recently I was amazed at the actual cheapjackness, the flatulence. It must prove one of the worst teenybopper movies of all time.The plain Patrick Swayze blatantly wore yet more makeup than the plainer Jennifer Grey. Neither can act his or her way out of a spent condom, and they aren't much as dancers either. As Grey's father, Jerry Orbach, a skilled actor, looks profoundly pained throughout, and for good reason because his part is pitifully wimpish.Both the plot and the editing are infantile ... although I do admit the sound track has some great pop songs, but not in the ludicrous finale. Buy the record ... or cassette ... or CD ... or whatever music comes on nowadays. Unless you are sadomasochistic and want to see the movie.</fullReview>

Swayze prances and dances around on screen and wasted two hours of my life. When Swayze says "Nobody makes baby sit in the corner" I wish someone one had. This is the ultimate chick flick......and a man's nightmare. Swayze plays this guy who's all into his feelings and can leap off a stage to sweep baby off her feet as 100 extras rise with him and dance in unison.....yeah, my ass. This film however, is a fantasy romance so this sort of "tomfoolery" is acceptable. If you are a woman and you love pictures where the dream guy sashays out of nowhere and sweeps the girl off to happiness...this film is for you! If you are a straight male...go rent THE TERMINATOR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jennifer Grey seems the unlikeliest of romantic leads and that's probably the reason why this beloved film is such a sure-fire hit. It's all very well doing a version of Montagus and Capulets with sweeteners like dancing and schadenfreude-baiting Jewish society family tropes thrown in but there usually has to be an X Factor.Swayze probably makes this film safe with his rugged, post-Travolta moves and temperament but its being won over by this curly-mopped Penelope Pitstop teen that brings the dream in reach of the impressionable market. The super (dated? perhaps 'immortalised') soundtrack helps and of course the cunning conceit of setting the film in a resort away from day to day life altogether finesses the fantasy. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing (1987) *** (out of 4) In the summer of 1963, Frances "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) goes to the Catskills for a three week vacation with her father (Jerry Orbach), her mother (Cynthia Rhodes) and her older, most experienced sister Lisa (Jane Bruckner). Baby's name fits her just fine because she's the angel of the family and in her father's eyes, she will always be his little baby. At the summer resort the two sisters talk about boys and love but Baby doesn't see too much in the snotty group of rich people.One night she sneaks off from the resort and finds herself in a smaller club full of rock music and dirty dancing. Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), a dance instructor at the resort, catches Baby's eyes but she knows that she'd never be good enough for him. As fate would have it Johnny's dancing partner is unable to perform so Johnny decides to take Baby and teach her how to dance. Since this is dirty dancing Baby knows that her parents wouldn't approve so she must sneak out to meet Johnny and before long the two start falling in love but in that day and age the bad boy can't be seen with the good girl. All of this leads up to Baby being put in the corner.I had just turned seven years old when Dirty Dancing was released in theaters and I remember crying the entire drive to the theaters because my mother was forcing me to see a "chick" film with her. I'm somewhat embarrassed to say this but I left the theater thinking I had just seen the greatest film ever made. When the movie was released on video I was at the store each weekend renting out the video only to watch it countless times over the weekend. In other words, this film was always amongst my favorite films but I hadn't seen the film in over a decade so I wasn't sure how my childhood memories would hold up in 2003.Viewing Dirty Dancing as an adult I must say I'm embarrassed that I considered this one of the greatest films ever made but on the other hand I understand why this film is loved by many people. The movie, while nothing great, is still a lot of fun, although some of this fun enters the "so bad it's good" category. For starters, the performances from Swayze and Grey are rather weak but at the same time they are good enough to put a smile on the viewers face as the two fight and eventually fall in love. The chemistry between the two makes for a good time and adds to the little love story that's going on.Another thing that keeps the movie going is its #1 soundtrack, which features classic songs as well as new material including (I've Had) The Time of My Life, which was not only a big hit but an award winner. The ending of the film is without a doubt one of the most charming in film history as Baby gets out of the corner and dances the night away. The dance sequence is full of high energy that will have your feet moving along with the characters. All the dance sequences are quite impressive but that aside the film is still a character study.The film features all the typical stereotypes, which leads to many unintentional laughs but these laughs just add to the fun hidden in this minor classic. The films message of the rich and poor is also laughable but they always follow this up with some sexy dancing so the political undertones are pretty much forgotten. The movie is very fast paced and its heart is in the right place, which is why Dirty Dancing has survived the past sixteen years and I'm sure we'll have another DVD release within the next fifteen as more and more people are introduced to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty Dancing-A++++++++++++++</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am soon to be 58 yrs.old. I can't recall when I first saw this movie, but I do know that until I purchased it on Video, I watched every time it came on TV. Which, TV does not do the film justice, because it has to edit too many scenes to make time for commercials. Getting the DVD Ultimate Edition was the best thing I did. I recommend everyone who loves this movie, like me, to get it. There is so much more insight into the movie, the characters, the making of the movie etc. I can't count the number of times I have watched the movie with the commentaries of the writer/producer Eleanor Bergstein all the way through; and then Kenny Ortega and the other assistant choreographer Miranda Garrison, and others who are listed in the commentary section. I love watching the music video section of "She's Like the Wind", 'I've Had the Time of My Life" and "Hungry Eyes". It is a great way to enter a stress free time. I love this movie and I don't believe it would have been such a success with anyone else than Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. Music is terrific, story line is exceptional, all actors are wonderful and believable. For such a limited budget, it outshines many high cost popular movies of today. It is a classic and I'll never get tired of watching it. I pop in "Dirty Dancing" whenever I just want to shut the world out and go back to the 'Summer of '63'. It is a better substitute for antidepressants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of films from the 80's have stuck with me, even the t.v. programs(and there's a lot of them!) but "Dirty Dancing" has had the biggest impact. I have never forgotten this film , my family and I got free tickets from KFC so we saw this film a few times but what I have found is a good soundtrack + a great leading cast equals a hit movie. I was only 10 years old when this movie came out but even then I thought Patrick was good looking and wanted to look like him. I just wish I could have been there when this movie happened(time and place). I have always had a fascination with America, I think it's because I grew up with every American programme that has been but oneday I will travel that country and experience that great American hospitality. You can't go wrong with this movie, Enjoy!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original (&amp; best) girlie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time in many years on Channel Five and it didn't fail to make me shed a few tears of happiness during 'that' last dance. The chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey gives you goosebumps. It's such a shame that there are no movies made like this anymore.I know on one level it's a very corny movie and most definitely a chick click...but I have to finally admit to myself that it's one of my favourite films ever.Long live Dirty Dancing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That was the summer we went to Kellerman's..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delightful coming of age film featuring good acting, wonderful dancing, and a surprisingly well crafted story.It's the summer of 1963, and the Houseman family - father, Jake (Jerry Orbach), a successful doctor; mother, Marjorie (Kelly Bishop); and daughters Lisa (Jane Brucker), a shallow young woman, obsessed with fashion and finding the right guy to "go all the way with," and Frances (Jennifer Grey), better known as "Baby," a plain Jane, more interested in making the world a better place than in fashion - are off to Kellerman's resort in the mountains. Baby is just about to start college, and Lisa is a little older (although how much isn't specified). Once they arrive at Kellerman's, they are greeted by the owner Max (Jack Weston), and Lisa catches the eye of busboy/bellhop, Robbie (Max Cantor), a med student working there for the summer. Unfortunately for Baby, she is set up with Max's grandson, Neil (Lonny Price), a student at the Cornell School of Management with a higher opinion of himself than seems warranted. After spending her first evening there as an unwilling magician's assistant, Baby takes a walk to get some much needed solitude. She accidentally wanders down to the staff quarters, and ends up helping Billy (Neal Jones) carry watermelon to a staff party. At the party, she meets the dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), to whom she is instantly attracted. Over the next few days, she finds out that Johnny's partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) has gotten pregnant and Robbie is the father. When Baby confronts Robbie, he denies any responsibility for his deed, and shows absolutely no willingness to help out. Baby borrows money from her father to fund Penny's abortion (not telling him what it's for, of course), but when she goes to give it to Penny, she finds out that Penny can only see the doctor on the night that she and Johnny have a big gig at the Sheldrake, another hotel about twenty minutes away. And then Billy comes up with the idea of Baby taking Penny's place. As Baby learns Penny's dance routine, she starts to fall for Johnny. The performance goes well, but Baby and Johnny return to Kellerman's to find that Penny's "abortion" was not performed by a skilled practitioner, and she is in really bad shape. Baby gets her father to tend to Penny, revealing her dealings with the staff, Johnny in particular, to her father, who is understandably upset, and forbids her to have anything to do with them. Baby, of course, has her own ideas, and goes back to visit Johnny that night, intending to apologize for her father's behavior towards Johnny. She ends up spending the night with Johnny. Delighted as she is over her new romance, Baby still has a big problem - how can she tell her father that she loves the man he has forbidden her from seeing? Worse yet, how can she explain to Johnny her need for secrecy. The delicate balance is upset when an ex-lover (Miranda Garrison) of Johnny's accuses him of stealing a wallet, and only Baby can provide an alibi. Should she speak up and help Johnny? Or stay silent and protect herself? Her choice is her first adult decision. What will she choose? The story is beautifully written, using the resort as a backdrop for showing the disparity between guests and staff, which mimics the class struggle of society itself at the time. Almost all of the major characters grow in some appreciable way by the end of the film. Jake learns that by only observing the appearance of things he can miss the truth behind the appearance. Johnny learns that not all rich people are users, and that there are people who will stand up for him no matter what the personal cost. Baby perhaps learns the most, learning that hard work pays off, that you can find love in the most unexpected places, and that standing up for what - and who - you believe in sometimes requires painful choices, but that doing so is ultimately its own reward. Even Lisa appears to grow. The scene where she comforts Baby and Johnny has been sent away is one of the most touching in the movie. My only real complaints are that Jake's apology to Johnny is a little flat and the ending isn't really that believable, but given the rest of the film, I can forgive both of those things pretty easily.The dancing is phenomenal. Swayze's early training in dance is put to good use in this film. Rhodes and Grey are equally adept on the dance floor. The dance sequence at the end is amazing - especially the long awaited lift.The acting was also excellent. The chemistry among the cast creates believable relationships on the screen. Grey is wonderful as Baby, playing the part to perfection. Swayze does equally well with Johnny. Rhodes plays Penny with a complexity that brings her humanity to the forefront. Orbach's concerned father is good, if a little over the top at times. Brucker does a wonderful job of showing Lisa as a ditz who spends most of her time focusing on herself to the exclusion of others, but manages to make her support for her sister at the end both believable and touching. Weston is good as the stuffy, overbearing Max, and Price's Neil is wonderfully annoying. Jones' Billy is a likable, if not overly bright, young man. Even the bit parts were well done.All in all, a well put together movie that takes you back to the time before America lost its innocence. And a fun one to watch, be it the first time, or the hundred and first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure why this film is one of the most remembered of the eighties. It's the stereotypical teen flick, and to back it all up is Patrick Swayzee.... The film has decent moments, but most of it is just your typical tutor-mentor love story. Swayzee has proved he's a worthy actor, and he does good here, but the story is just so-so. If you like teen romance/comedy films, you'll like "Dirty Dancing," though it's not my cup-'o-tea.2.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great music, great dancing, a sexy star (Swayze) and actual sexual desire shown by a female character (a very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters who are motivated primarily by lust and it is a nice change. I also think the movie captures very well what it is like to be a teenager coping with issues of class and of having ideals suddenly come up against reality. Of course, it is sappy at moments - it is, after all, a movie musical - but all in all it is a real pleasure - a fun romance and also politically enlightened. This movie also has one of my favorite all time movie lines: "I carried the watermelon."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pro-Abortion Propaganda that I loved as a ignorant little girl.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie when I was growing up. I owned *both* sound tracks. Then I watched the movie as an adult. It loses it's charm when you realize a baby is being killed. The heroine/protagonist deceives her physician father into giving her 200 dollars (a lot of money in the early 60's) so she can pay for a dancer to have an abortion and thus break the law. The teenager lies to her family and in doing so finances the dismemberment of a child and the butchering of the baby's mother and is made out to be selfless. Add to it the sob story the mother gives about getting herself pregnant: " I don't sleep around. I thought he loved me. I thought I was special." That certainly justifies cutting your baby into pieces. I pity those who never grow up and accept this line of bull. I pity those who don't recognize this movie as the political propaganda it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently, you are dirty dancing when you are sweating excessively in your tightest pair of matador pants and vehemently, jaggedly, irregularly slamming your 35-year old package against gawky underage girls who seem to enjoy your hideous "white man's overbite." Moments like this make Dirty Dancing an extremely, albeit unintentionally, hilarious movie. It is especially funny when watching it immediately after reading the comments posted on this site, many of which describe the movie as a powerful, amazing, sensual, touching, romantic experience. I, for one, could not help but keep such comments in mind while I was LAID OUT laughing at Johnny's "free styling" with Penny and company in the scene when Baby "carried a watermelon" to their secret dirty dancing party. I'm sorry, I know you all think Patrick Swayze is pure sex incarnate, but he looks ridiculous. I'm not saying he can't lead a woman around a ballroom because he can. I mean, obviously, the man is a trained dancer. It's when he starts snapping off though, trying to appear spontaneous to the beat of tacky oldies like "Do You Love Me," that he exposes himself to be the rhythmless spaz he is. And for the record, the ensemble of extras scattered about in this scene are not really dancing so much as they are having a whole bunch of dry sex.Anyway, the thing that makes Dirty Dancing so priceless is that it takes itself dead seriously. Johnny isn't screwing around, for instance, when he explains that the vast number of rich, lonely housewives he's slept with under the guise of giving them dance lessons, were actually exploiting him: Baby - "You were just using them, that's all." Johnny - "No, no that's not it, that's the thing, you see baby it wasn't like that. They were using me." Then, instead of bursting into convulsive laughter like I do every time I hear the line, she falls for it and kisses him with all the passionate sympathy she can muster, trying very earnestly not to exploit him like the rich, lonely housewives did. Ha. Fool.So the movie should be no good at all, unless you are able to find the humor in Patrick Swayze's pained-looking danceface or his thrusting, perky butt or his weird "street" accent. Or in the frosted, fried, and leathern results of Cynthia Rhodes' time spent in the tanning bed with a bottle of peroxide. Or in Jennifer Grey's many shaky voiced monologues about blossoming into a woman and learning the ways of the world. In short, those who hate on Dirty Dancing because they cannot find the humor in these things are probably kind of stale. And those who adore Dirty Dancing because they cannot find the humor in these things are probably kind of daft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated Square Dance Crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing (1987): Dir: Emile Ardolino / Cast: Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey, Jerry Orbach, Cynthia Rhodes, Max Cantor: Overrated sleaze fest shading permissive sex dancing with secondary social themes. Its title references the forbidden. On a family vacation a young woman meets a male dance trainer and she replaces his pregnant partner. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey travel a predictable Romeo and Juliet formula. She will fall for him thus opening up arguments with her disapproving father. And he will, of course, prove himself worthy of this woman after hours of dance training. It is no surprise when she finally does the lift move that she faltered earlier. Supporting roles are a host of embarrassing stereotypes including Jerry Orbach as her strict father in a role rehearsed and performed a thousand times over and it is getting old. Cynthia Rhodes plays the pregnant dancer whom Grey will replace thus stealing the spotlight from. Max Cantor plays the ever familiar womanizing ass whom everyone will see through long after viewers do. Directed by Emile Ardolino with steamy dance numbers sidelining potential theme with a potential orgy. The soundtrack album is catchy with many memorable songs but the film itself is a cliché filled bore that is just an excuse to throw together a mindless erotic tease. In the end this film should be danced upon by a herd of elephants. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Film, Just Not My Cup Of Tea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that there is very little wrong with this film; it has a great cast, a charming story, strong dialogue and some excellent characters; not to mention a good soundtrack.I did enjoy this movie and i can understand why so many people hold it in such high regard, it's a fine film; the only thing that lets it down for me is the subject matter, dancing isn't really my thing. So my score of 6/10 is a testimony to how good a film this really is, for a film of this type to entertain me, even just a little surprised me completely. There is simply nothing to hate here, as it tells the story of a girls journey into womanhood, and the dancing is simply the catalyst for the change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relies on cliché, platitudes, easy sentiment and a great soundtrack but it sets out its stall, knows its audience and delivers well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the summer of 1963 when the Houseman's went to Kellerman's resort, where the wealthy enjoy dancing and light entertainment. The dancing is very safe and the Kellerman's youngest daughter "Baby" is more taken in by the more upbeat and wild dancing that takes place over in the staff quarters (much to the disapproval of Mr Kellerman). When one of the dancers gets "in trouble", Baby tries to help even though the dancers (particularly Johnny) distrust her motives and dislike her spoilt background. As she learns to dance with Johnny though, Baby wins them over while also growing up in several ways during the summer.A recent Orange "don't let a phone ruin your movie" skit at UGC featuring Patrick Swayze reminded me that I had never actually gotten round to seeing this film. Strange as it sounds I could tell you the plot and knew it from the music videos and general cultural knowledge but I'd not actually sat and watched it. Well, anyway, I did recently and found a basic but effective film that did just what I expected along fairly predictable lines. For those who hate sentiment this will be a big problem and they should not even bother but for viewers that love this sort of thing or can get caught up in it then it is pretty much spot on. The "learning to dance" device asks you to accept a bit of a stretch in credibility but generally it is well used to follow Baby as she goes from a teenager into a young woman. It isn't the deepest of affairs and is built on cliché and platitudes at times but generally it has the heart to make it work.Ardolino milks this sense of passion pretty well and delivers the film pretty straight. The cast don't have a lot of depth to work with but they do generally have what it takes to make this sort of material work. Grey was surprisingly subtle with her character and I was quite taken by her deepening ? it is not her fault that the script asks her to do a lot quickly. Swayze has a more obvious character but he is sexy and convincing in his character's strengths as well as his weaknesses. Below them nobody is actually that good (although Orbach is a solid presence) but this doesn't matter too much as the central chemistry is what carries the story.Overall then a fairly obvious but effective film that will easily win over fans of the genre. It relies on cliché, platitudes, easy sentiment and a great soundtrack to do this, which does prevent it being deep and realistic enough to win over the sceptics but it sets out its stall, knows its audience and delivers well.</fullReview>

But along the way helps another dance instructor, and risks the whole relationship...A truly heartwarming film, like no other.10/10</fullReview>

And I thought it was a really fun, great movie that makes you want to get up and dance. Alright, it was cheesy at times... but it's still a great movie. I can't believe Jennifer Grey was 27 in this movie - my friend and I thought she looked about 18 or 19 - 20 at the most. I guess this is attributed to her acting talent. And she did really look awkward at times. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can tell he is in his thirties and seems a bit old. Nevertheless, still very good. I love 80s songs so it really struck a chord with me, and the love story (yes, I'm a romantic) was so wonderfully done. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Exceeded my expectations!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Contains Spoilers* I rarely write comments. In my 20 years of viewing films and at times, over-analysing them to the despair of my partner, I have very rarely decided that a film in my eyes, is worth viewing 10+ times.Dirty Dancing - 1987 a low budget film was released, set in the summer of 1963 and focused on a teenager, Baby Houseman (Frances), her older sister Lisa and their parents visiting a Summer Camp, which was hosting it's final year. Baby was everything Lisa wasn't. Lisa loved fashion, dating and boys. Baby wanted to become a Peace Embassendor, enjoyed reading and didn't have many social interactions. She was the under the watchful eye of her father and did everything she could do to please him.This all changed in a matter of a few months for Baby Houseman. The prim and proper Daddy's Girl that never answered back found an outstanding hobby she excelled in, new friends and most importantly, her romance with Johnny Castle. Drafted in to take the place of Penny, Johnny's usual dance partner, the two struck a friendship up and within time, fell in love. The relationship was banished by Baby's father, and despite forbidding her to have anything to do with "them", Baby continued to see Johnny behind her fathers back. Her father is under the impression that Johnny is responsible for Penny's abortion - a child that was in fact fathered by Robbie, a med student doing a summer job in the resort and who was attached to Lisa. Jake Houseman refuses to talk to Johnny for this reason, and also is unaware of the fact Baby asked for money from him in order to fund the abortion.Johnny is then accused of stealing from one of the residences who he had a previous fling with, and who is jealous of his relationship with Baby after catching them unawares. Max, the owner of the resort approaches Jake and talks of sacking Johnny, which incites Baby who knows full well he is innocent as they were together. This is Baby's coming of age; admitting to herself she is love, and admitting to her father that she knows the man she loves is innocent because she was with him. In the end, as predicted, she announces his innocence to protect him and keep him in a job at the resort, which is his only income. She falls out with her father, her family, most of the resort and even then, Johnny is still fired for having a relationship with a resident (Baby). One of the most poignant moments of the film is Baby crying to her father, apologising for letting him down, as well as the moment Johnny leaves the camp.It is at this moment that you realise what is perhaps the most heart warming part of the film is. The way in which the characters all learn something from each other; Johnny realises that not everything is black and white, that people do not exist in this world to use him. Jake realises that his daughter is growing up, and learns to accept her choice. Even Lisa, the stuck up, spoilt sister of Baby learns that her sister needs her unconditional love and another moment in the film is when Lisa is comforting Baby after Johnny leaves. But Baby's plight is perhaps the most important - A girl who never stood up to her family; sheltered, spoilt and socially awkward. A girl who learnt to dance, learnt to embrace love and sociology, and a girl who learnt that sometimes no matter whether things are correct, they will always finish wrong. The two central characters rely on each other to figure these things out - Without each other they would have carried on for an undetermined time living a life where they knew no different. Some say this is a soppy, pathetic documentation of "love". I'm not sure if even the love story is the most significant factor here; I truly believe (or hope) the emotions run high for the viewers that enjoy this film is because of the massive change that happens to the characters personalities. The way they "grow" in just a few months. The way that they know whatever happens from this moment on, nothing will ever be the same again. This is why the film never fails to make me cry. The chemistry between Baby and Johnny (even if the actual actors themselves fought on set) is explosive - Even when they are practising and Baby frustrates Johnny with her ineptness. Everything clicks into place, and the ending moment is magical. What is worth noting in this film is for all those that bash it for being too "slushy" is that no "I love you" notion is utter during the film. When Johnny gets up on stage to announce his "return" and final dance, he is almost professional in his display of affection and love for Baby. He doesn't over-gush with sentimentality - Which I think is the same for the film.I admit I don't watch this every month like I know some fans do, but every time I do view this, I think it captures the innocence of Baby, the angst of Johnny and the acceptance of Jake perfectly. It shows a time before the Vietnam War, the downfall of the American Government after JFK's assassination and before the "swinging sixties" revolution brought on from the likes of Presley and the Beatles.A 9/10 from me - A timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cult milestone with substantial dance sequences elevating carefully delivered formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the decline of ballrooms as a popular night out, partner dance enjoyed a revival with the rise of mambo and various forms of salsa in the USA. The eighties also saw an upsurge of partner dance in Britain with the development of 'modern jive', a simple dance that anyone could learn. Tapping into this enthusiasm comes Dirty Dancing (1987), a well-constructed if cheesy love story that has partner dance at its core. Fronted by the charismatic Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it also contains a note of rebelliousness that appeals to its teenage target audience.The opening credits (in luminous pink) set the tone with sepia shots of sexy dance routines, slowed down to emphasise sensuousness. The 60s Ronettes' song, Be My Baby, hearkens back to an era before the Beatles, before the death of Kennedy.'Baby' - the insultingly diminutive name for the heroine (played by Jennifer Grey) is a young girl ahead of her time. She can't wait to join the peace core. But for now, she is being whisked off to summer camp with her protective parents and her superficial sister, Lisa. "Baby's going to change the world," quips her father, whereas Lisa's going to decorate it.At the camp, glamorous female dance teacher Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) has the job of making staid dances (like line-dancing) look appealing to the masses. Baby however, chances upon the dance staff's private party, where a much raunchier dance is practiced. Johnny Castle (Swayze) is a downtrodden dance instructor from the streets. In contrast to the Harvard and Yale educated (and outwardly respectable) youngsters, he is labelled with an unfairly bad reputation, and with strict instructions not to flirt with guests. As Castle and Baby follow their hearts, each striving towards a moral high ground forsaken by society, they are drawn inevitably together.Why such a formulaic and much-copied movie has held such fascination is sometimes a mystery. Its strengths are the tightness of its construction and the first rate dancing abilities. With the gradual demise of mass of studio-based song-and-dance films associated with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, came a shortage of stars who could both dance well and act. Swayze not only had considerable acting experience but was born into a dance family and trained with the prestigious Joffrey Ballet School. As is evident from the companion (dance instruction) video, Swayze Dancing, he toned down his abilities as a dancer to play Johnny Castle, but still looks riveting.Mambo - which can be performed in a very erotic and sensual manner - is sometimes called 'diabolo' - the devil's dance. Unlike many dance-romance movies that followed, this film features many actual dance sequences, augmented by a spontaneous style of acting, but with the dancing obviously performed 'for real' rather than produced as a result of extensive fast editing cuts - as was the case, for instance, in films like Chicago (2002).The dirty dancing in the film is ultimately a mix of styles, principally mambo and showcase, and provided momentum for many of the popular dance schools of the time and in the years that followed. The film is part of the wave of 80s indie films that convinced the big studios to diversify and join forces with independents to capture teen audiences. Its sexiness, combines with a James Dean style defiance, appeals to male fantasies The sugary love, of strong girl nevertheless rescued-by-dashing-handsome-man, woos young women. While Dirty Dancing lacks greatness, its enduring strengths are too easily overlooked. If nothing else, it provided a template for dozens of lacklustre movies that emulated its song and storyline formula without emulating its strengths.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing follows the story of Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Grey)and her family as they spend the summer at Kellerman's Family Summer Camp. We get to see her discover herself as she falls in love with the dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze).The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!) some great music, and terrific scenery. It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending! You know how it's going to end from the beginning, but that's really not the point here. The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A coming-of-age story sure to spark a love....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest movies to come out of the 80's, Dirty Dancing was a low-budget film with high-budget returns. With a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance, to a love story that all of us wish we could live (at least if you're female), this is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again.The music, which is what drives the movie, is upbeat and flows well with the emotions which are drawn from the viewer. From classic '60's hits like "Love Man" by Otis Redding and "Big Girls Don't Cry" by Frankie Valli to pure '80's hits like Eric Carmen's "Hungry Eyes" and Frank Zappacosta's "Overload", Dirty Dancing is a mix of fun and sensual, showing the transformation of a young girl from shy teenager into a blossoming womanhood, all against the beautiful backdrop of a summer romance that we all hope and wish turned into more.The dancing in "Dirty Dancing" is not to be forgotten. Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny, a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and lithe gymnasts. Patrick Swayze does more than a fantastic job and shows off more and more of his skills, not just as an actor, but dancer and singer as well. And Jennifer Grey shines as Baby, while her transformation in dancing portrays her transformation in status as well.All in all, Dirty Dancing is one of the best movies of all time, and well worth watching at least once. It's doubtful that the first beats of the Ronette's "Be My Baby" in the opening title won't snare your attention and draw you in to a magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just read a number of user reviews, and all I have to say is that "You're all sick!!!" This lamebrained, terribly scripted, terribly constructed, terribly acted movie is your "Favorite Movie of All Time?"This is the movie that made me avoid "Ghost" for over a year (definitely a mistake), because after seeing this, I incorrectly assumed that anything with Patrick Swayze in it was just going to be BAD.The story's been told before (repeatedly, I might add). Even if the story hadn't been told before, every aspect of the movie is completely predictable. Most of the dialogue is more laughable than most spoofs of "Star Trek" (at least when those people are spoofing Shatner as Kirk, they're "trying" to be funny). And the acting--ugh, even if the dialogue wasn't so bad, most of the principals are so wooden you could use them as surfboards.The dancing scenes--okay, they were pretty good. But unless you're Kelly, Astaire, or Rogers, dance scenes do not a good movie make.I can see people being entertained by this movie. I really can (just not me). But to call it your favorite movie of all time? AAAARRRRGGGHHHH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable romance which has become something of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is 1963 and the Houseman family are spending their summer at a resort on the Catskill Mountains; it is the sort of place well to do families go to holiday and boys get waiting jobs before heading off to Ivy League universities. It is quite clear that many of the families hope their daughters might meet a nice prospective husband there? they certainly aren't expected to get involved with the other staff; the professional dance instructors who are seen as being from the wrong side of the tracks. Frances "Baby" Houseman finds herself attracted to one of these 'bad boys', Johnny Castle, after she strays into the staff area and sees them 'dirty dancing'. Initially he sees her as just another rich girl who thinks she knows it all, but then she helps when his dance partner Penny needs money for an abortion. This means he needs a new dance partner for an event at another hotel and Baby volunteers; so begins her dancing lessons. After the event they return and learn that Penny's abortion was horribly botched; Baby takes control of the situation and gets her father, who is a doctor. This has an obvious effect on their relationship; he feels he can no longer trust her and he certainly doesn't want her seeing Johnny again.I first saw this film many years ago but had forgotten most of it so thought it might be worth watching again. The overall story is reasonably predictable but there are some surprises; the illegal abortion subplot is certainly darker than one might expect in a romantic story. This does add to the plot though; bringing Baby and Johnny closer together as well as driving a wedge between Baby and her father. In a film like this the music is obviously important and even though the music isn't of the period it is effective; this is especially true of the finale where Baby and Johnny dance to 'The Time of Your Life' which provides the film's most memorable moment. The leads do an impressive job; Jennifer Grey may not be conventionally sexy but she has plenty of attitude which makes her character and her relationship believable. Patrick Swayze also impresses as Johnny. These two have a good chemistry and their relationship develops nicely through the film? as does Baby's dancing ability. Overall I'd say this film is well worth watching even if you aren't a fan of romances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, entertaining romantic drama that even today someone can enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing is a movie that was made before my time, and seeing that i am going to the Broadway soon i figured, why not check out the original film first. This was a romantic drama that was actually pretty good, for someone who didn't grow up dreaming about Patrick Swayze i thought this was still a pretty entertaining film. Now the overall plot isn't the most original thing because everyone knows what is going to happen in these movies but it does enough to surprise you and keep you interested. The main way they do this is through the characters, the characters are all so different that right from the get go you know the type of character they are and can see them change over the course of the film. The character chemistry is also really well done especially between Swayze and Jennifer Grey. Their dialogue and the way their relationship evolves throughout the film really holds the film together. Some of the other characters aren't as well setup in the film and only show up when the plot needs them to but you forget about that as you realise they aren't the focus. They both play their respective roles really well and you are at all times convinced that their relationship could be very real.The dance sequences are also some of the highlights of the movie, they really bring a positive and uplifting feel to the film to counter some of the more emotional scenes. And what would be a dance sequence without some music, the soundtrack in this film was great, filled with classic songs that even i knew some of the words to and really get you in a good mood. Where i would say the film gets let down is with its pacing. The movie does move at a pretty steady pace but there are quite a few moments in the middle that kind of drag on a little too much, and although it is for the character development, some of the longer scenes could have been cut down. But in the end this was an enjoyable film, not the greatest romantic drama of its era but definitely a really good one to watch. - 7</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the dance scenes. the acting. the atmosphere. the script. each as part of magic film who seduce, again and again, the public. because the theme is not complicated, because the love, the freedom, the beauty of dance are elements who defines every period and becomes basis of a special form of entertainment. and Patrick Swayze does one of his memorable roles. it is not easy to describe the magic of this film. because it represents almost an experience. because it is one of that movies who lives in memory like a great moment of pure freedom. not the story itself, not the chemistry between the lead actors is the key but a sort of nostalgic perception and a lovely occasion to rediscover the pure romanticism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing is a movie that I literally did not watch until yesterday, many many years after I was born and many many years after it was first released.I always promised myself that I would never sit down and watch it because I knew what people said about it and the "best parts" to me all sounded pretty stupid, like the famous dance scene and "nobody puts baby in the corner"...But it turned out to be OK. The music is pretty stupid now but I have to admit as a child of the eighties who heard the soundtrack on the radios and when friends played it on -- GASP -- cassette tapes at each other's houses and at school, so of them were good songs. At least songs you can listen to without puking.Patrick Swayze looks so young in this and he's really good in his part, and so is Jennifer Gray. Not sure why she got surgery to change her nose, she looks great in this and Ferris Bueller. A very pretty girl who is good in this and could also do comedy.Have to say though the whole age difference thing is pretty creepy, what is she in this like 16? And he's in his thirties? Ewwwwwww! Why, Patrick Swayze, why?!?!?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is my dance space - your dance space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing, a low budgeted movie, shot in 44 days and based on screenwriter 'Babes' own childhood in the Catskills. Baby: "That was the summer of 1963 - when everybody called me Baby, and it didn't occur to me to mind. That was before President Kennedy was shot, before the Beatles came, when I couldn't wait to join the Peace Corps, and I thought I'd never find a guy as great as my dad. That was the summer we went to Kellerman's" (the Mountain Lake Hotel, Pembroke, Virginia). The last summer for this kind of resorts Max Kellerman thinks: "the young go to Europe, seeing 22 countries in three days". Regardless the not too good critics, the movie drew adult audiences instead of the expected teens, with viewers rating the film highly. Baby, seventeen and ready to cut the ties to Daddy, ready for Mount Holyoke College to study economics of underdeveloped countries and then the Peace Corps: "Our Baby's gonna change the world (and) Lisa's going to decorate it." The testing prelude are Kellerman's two worlds, divided by the sign Staff Quarters No Guests please. ... the guests world and the staff's. Baby passes the sign, warned by Johnny's cousin and Johnny asking: "What's she doing here? Taking time out from playing?" Is she worth it, can heart and soul really belong to the staff, the people, herself belonging to the (rich) guests? She helps Penny not only with the father money for the backstreet abortion, later calling for daddy when it went bad, not only a stand-in at the Sheldrake, before this the hard-work-rehearsal with the hostile Johnny. Not bothering Penny's: " Go back to your playpen, Baby" and Robbie Goulds "some people count, some people don't". The Kellerman's grandson tells Baby, seeing her sister with Robbie: "Sometimes in this world you see things you do not want to see." A minute later she sees the weeping Penny, something that is not meant for her eyes: and acts accordingly, worth her future at the Peace Corps. Not to recognize but see beyond Kellerman's peaceful playpen. Baby, named after Frances Perkins, the first woman in the U.S. Cabinet, knows what she wants. And Johnny Castle, the working class guy, both falling in love with each other. When he is accused for theft Baby frees him, admitting that she spent the night with him: followed by the father-daughter-confrontation. Johnny gets his summer bonus but has to leave by the back door. For the first time Johnny Castle experiences a persons courage. But Baby denies, pointing to the fact that she is nothing else but afraid of everything. Returning through the front door he pulls Frances out of the corner and up on stage: "Sorry for the interruption, folks, but I always do the last dance of the season. This year somebody told me not to. So I'm gonna do my kind of dancing' with a great partner, who's not only a terrific dancer, but somebody... who's taught me... that there are people willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them. Somebody who's taught me about the kind of person I wanna be. Miss Frances Houseman." Then the dance ? and: the lift. In the back the staff, the people. Suddenly everybody joins the whirl of Johnny's and Baby's dirty dancing, based on the rule: "This is my dance space ? your dance space. Keep our places and grip." Dirty Dancings core is, as the director sees it: "I think that Dirty Dancing is the most intimate communication outside the bedroom. It is not dirty at all. Two people looking at each other, looking into each others eyes and try to say: 'I love you.' Its beautiful." This is my dance space ? your dance space. The process from recognition to see each other: admitting in front of the audience love, able the lifts climax. Able and ready for the Peace Corpse. Beyond politics, religion: just the people, their needs. Inspired by JFK:s speech at 2:00 a.m. on October 14, 1960 addressed students on the steps of the University of Michigan Union. Possible. Summer 1963, 22 November the shot in Texas, Dallas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more positive view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider Dirty Dancing to be in the top 5 films of the 1980s. I don't agree with its politics, but I tip my hat to its honesty and artistry. It is a story of its time. Top Gun may have been more intense, from the male view, but both films connect to the soul in the same way. Jennifer Grey and Meg Ryan, as women, make profound connections in the two films. It matters not that they are so different. Different is what makes the connections so comfortable. It is a complete pleasure viewing Dirty Dancer and looking forward to watching Top Gun. Beautiful stories, beautiful women, set around the most beautiful photography ever. All that said, it doesn't even break my top 50. Mike</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing was an excellent flick. I enjoyed it the first time and every time since. Nonetheless I think it could have been better. The director should have noticed that every time Jennifer Grey was given a long line sincerity went down the toilet. She'd huff and puff and it came out badly. Otherwise she played her role well.For example, when she finally told Johnny that she had feelings for him. That was an ugly line for her and she was huffing and puffing. The line was too long for her. A good director would have broken it up for her. Something like: Johnny: "You fear nothing" Baby turns her face from him, and with tears dripping down her face says, "You have no idea what I've done and what I fear." Johnny: "But you are so good." Baby: "I'm not so good. I love Penny now, but I'm corrupt." Johnny: "How so?" Baby: "I did everything just to get close to you. I loved you since the first dance. Now my fear is that you don't feel anything for me." ??.I do not claim these would be the best lines, but I will assert that Jennifer Grey could have had better lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very exceptional movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's about breaking away from expectations and boundaries. It's about growing up and figuring out who you want to be. It's about the time in our lives that we've all experienced in which everything changes, and personalities and emotions clash, and the puzzle pieces finally begin to fit together! It's about taking chances and falling in love. It's about our last free summer after we graduate high school. The time when we begin to enter the real world and venture off into the next huge part in our lives.In my opinion, it's a wonderful movie. Very nice set design, excellent casting and choreography, great music, and very interesting cinematography. This is a movie I will own on DVD and treasure forever and have my children watch when they're old enough to appreciate it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impossible to dish dirt upon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there anyone out there who doesn't already know, or think they know, every scene from this movie? And yes, I mean other guys too. It's a tale of summer love set in a holiday resort with a girl (Jennifer Grey) learning to dance and a fine instructor (Patrick Swayze) who ends up teaching her. Their shared goal is simply to cover one gig that needs covering (thanks to a personal emergency that will see the main female lead out of action for that day) but things soon heat up as they both get their groove on. Meanwhile, there are family problems, misunderstandings, character assassinations and . . . . . . . . watermelons all due some screen time.Watching this again, for the first time in many years, made me realise that it's kind of beyond reproach. My gut instinct from the opening scenes was to give it a low rating and defend my position from my lofty and manly position. That soon started to change as the tunes kept coming though. Okay, so "The Time Of My Life" may be a bit grating nowadays in much the same way that similar hits by Celine Dion and Bryan Adams have become but it's really just the icing on the cake for a soundtrack chock full of great tunes. Girls may go all soppy for stuff like "Hungry Eyes" and "She's Like The Wind" but they're far from my favourites. However, throw in the likes of "Be My Baby", "Big Girls Don't Cry", "Do You Love Me", "Love Man" and "Stay", to name a selection, and you have a helluva good time.Acting-wise, it's quite impressive to see a female lead in this type of romantic cheese-fest who is so damn likable. Jennifer Grey is bubbly, endearing and a perfect heroine/underdog to root for as the movie plays out. Patrick Swayze, with the leather jacket and shades and greased hairdo, IS a typical "bad boy" who's actually pretty sweet. It's easy to see why so many women fell for him through the power of this movie and he even manages to deliver a number of ridiculous lines (including the classic "nobody puts Baby in the corner") without making you want to laugh at him. Then there's the rest of the cast, including Jerry Orbach and Cynthia Rhodes and even Wayne Knight - all doing well with material that may be sub-par but that gets by on sheer feelgood factor.It's a shame that director Emile Ardolino has done nothing else quite as good as this career high. I may have rated this a little bit higher than it deserves but it must have done something majorly right to get me to change my mind so much . . . . . and even practice some cha-cha steps.See this if you like: Strictly Ballroom, Grease, Step Up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly excellent with jaw-dropping dance routines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dirty Dancing is an excellent movie. No, it isn't perfect, but it is solid entertainment for those into dancing. There are two flaws with the film. The script is not the best script in the world, to be honest, there are some clichés. Also, as much as Cynthia Rhodes puts a lot of energy into the dance routines, her acting isn't as good unfortunately.However, putting those minor discrepancies aside, the highlights are the jaw-dropping if rather erotic dance routines and the ever-popular soundtrack. The famous lift in the best dance of the film is very hard to do properly, and as far as I'm aware, it was very well-done. The soundtrack isn't like Charlie's Angels or anything similar to that, where the songs get too much. If anything, they capture the feel-good nature of the film perfectly.Now for the performances. I have already mentioned Cynthia Rhodes, but I thought that Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey gave the roles of their careers in Dirty Dancing. Their partnership was like Torvill and Dean on ice, unquestionably brilliant. Jerry Orbach gives a wonderful performance also as the earnest Jake Housemann.In conclusion, with a couple of minor flaws, Dirty Dancing is a treat, for those into dancing.8/10.

		<shortDescription>Female friendly romantic flick with a killer soundtrack - 66%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a self-confessed hater of musicals, I always knew this movie would challenge me in the same way that "Grease" did. But this doesn't feel much like a musical, primarily because almost nobody sings in it but dances to the fantastic soundtrack instead. And while most women will wax lyrical about this movie until your ears bleed, I struggled to see what the fuss was about. Yes, it's cheesier than a Swiss soap opera but even with solid performances from the leads and that legendary soundtrack, this isn't really anything to get too excited about.Jennifer Grey plays Baby, a naive young girl holidaying with her family at Kellerman's Holiday Park in the Catskill mountains in the summer of 1963. After watching the ruggedly handsome dancer Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), she falls head-over-heels in love with the camp's resident bad-boy rebel. As she finds herself drawn into his world of dance, the angry reluctance of her father Jake (Jerry Orbach) threatens their budding romance.It would be foolish to claim that "Dirty Dancing" is an original piece of work because it covers so many clichés that I lost count. The dialogue is, at times, woefully clunky although the cast gamely give it their all. Swayze and Grey rightfully take the honours as the star-crossed dancers, although only Orbach as Baby's father really keeps up with them. But in truth, the film's real strength is the soundtrack and it is nothing short of incredible. But even here, there are one or two songs that have that Eighties gloss ("She's Like The Wind" springs to mind) that don't fit in with the early Sixties vibe of the film. But in spite of the dialogue and plot, there is this intangible essence that somehow lifts "Dirty Dancing" above the norm. Like "Grease", you still find yourself enjoying it despite the numerous faults at heart and the horrible cheesiness of it all.Not all films have to be original or serious and "Dirty Dancing" is one such example. Looking at it from a neutral point of view - which wasn't easy, given that this is one of my Better Half's favourite films - this is still an enjoyable musical movie that doesn't rely on its leads trying to sing during every other scene or mass Bollywood-style dance numbers. The dancing feels natural and organic, even though it is obviously rehearsed. Personally, I'd like to have seen more comedic moments but you can't have everything. I do slightly prefer "Grease", despite it being a proper musical as opposed to a dancing movie like this or "Saturday Night Fever" but in fairness, I can count on one hand the number of dance movies I would want to watch in my lifetime. So no classic then, despite the millions of fans across the world but then again, I do have one rather fundamental difference with these people. I'm not a woman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Recipe For How To Make "Dirty Dancing!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly, there is a finite number of truly original plot concepts. After awhile, active filmgoers may begin to have the feeling that they have seen what they are watching before.That feeling is not misplaced. "Dirty Dancing" is a good example of the "quilt" principle of storytelling in film. If you borrow enough good ideas from various sources and repackage them cleverly and slightly, some---perhaps many---people may be seduced by the sheer entertainment value of what they are taking in to ignore the fact that it's been done before-----usually better."Dirty Dancing" is a "quilt" film. It incorporates varying quantities of ingredients from such primary film sources as "Pygmalion," "Saturday Night Fever," "Forty Second Street," and even a little bit of "Abie's Irish Rose" (in reverse). As for all the misundertandings that help to propel the plot-----go no further than the inspired Astaire-Rogers RKO series of the 1930s. For adults who are out of touch with the younger generation, add a generous dash of "Rebel Without a Cause." And for the big "let's put on a show" finale, throw in a few shakes from the Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland films at M-G-M in the 1940s.Altogether, "Dirty Dancing" is a film about which it can be said that everything may appear to be new----but nothing is really new.For those who enjoy it-----sorry to rain on your parade. A quilt works better on a bed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dance knows no Class-Distinctions, it's for Everyone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has much more to offer than what the title suggests. It is a social commentary about early 1960s middle class "snobs" who would visit resorts run by shrewd business men, where all of the "help" is there to entertain and amuse the spoiled brats from the city.Johnny (very credibly played by Patrick Swayzee) is the 20-something veteran to this "scene", the leader of a pack of singers &amp; dancers at this "posh" resort. Enter another batch of "money folk", eager to have fun for a Summer Holiday. Everything would be as usual, only this year there are complications. The seemingly spoiled daughter of a Jewish doctor "Baby" (played by the newly discovered Jennifer Gray who was introduced the previous year in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off") and Johnny seem to be more than "dance partners". Unaware of the difficulties a relationship "between 2 different social classes" would bring, the couple continue seeing each other. There are a few "formula" situations built in to give a hint of a story line. The incredible sound track includes many big hits from the 60s (most noteworthy "Hey! Baby" by Bruce Channel and "Love Is Strange" by Mickey &amp; Sylvia), as well as original music sung by Patrick Swayzee ("She's Like The Wind") and the Oscar Winner by Bill Medley &amp; Jennifer Warnes ("I've Had The Time Of My Life").This was a surprise hit (like "La Bamba" was the year before), but all of the praise was justified. Although not quite 5-star material, I find this film very entertaining, especially due to its timeless message. No matter what, we will always have the memories of fantastic dancing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For this film I would give a 6 for the story and directing, because it has a lot of holes in the story and main role (Baby) was badly casted. But I give a 10+ for the music, because every time I watch the movie it gives me the chill. It has a great power to put you in that time and create the atmosphere. Although it is not an artistic film, it is a good film and I think the shallowness of the story and the characters is understandable and fits better in "the whole picture" than a more serious and deep would. So it is an 8, and I recommend it because it is an epic film in his genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Dirty Dancing for the first time last night. I had had a lot of chances to see the movie, but always didn't watch it. I guess I had some prejudice against any Patrick Swayze movie after his apperence on SNL or something. I finally sat down and watched it. I was extremely suprised at how well I liked it. It was no Brat Pack or anything, but I liked the actors chemistry, and was suprised at how good it was. After the "Time of My Life" scene, I found myself getting up out of my seat and just started dancing. I ran around dancing. I know its stupid, but I couldn't get it out of my system. This movie truly had that effect on me. And its not like I saw Natural Born Killers and went out and bought a gun, this was strange for me. The movie truly makes you want to get up and dance, even at 3 or 4 am.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is possibly one of those films that will remain popular with women who were teenagers when it first came out, but quickly become forgotten when, in another 40-50 years or so, those said women start falling off their perches. My 30-something partner barely moved for its duration, whisked back by its cheesy tunes and Patrick Swayze's finely toned body to her mid-teens for a couple of hours. Afterwards, she admitted that it's pretty stupid, but films that take us back to our youth usually are.The film briefly made a star of Swayze, and it's not difficult to see why he got the part of the beefcake dancing instructor who uses his looks and movements to seduce the wealthy wives who frequent the summer resort where he works (even though he was probably 10 years too old for the part). But it's Jennifer Grey as Baby who gives the performance of the film for my money, injecting an energetic enthusiasm into the scenes between those in which she is a nervous waif or put-upon younger sister. She's a pretty thing, but her looks are unconventional, and not designed for long-lasting stardom.The story is pure candy-floss, and not intended to be taken seriously, and there's little attempt at recapturing the fifties era in which the story takes place, but it all looks very handsome and the director captures some moments that even today, nearly a quarter of a century after it was made, remain in the collective movie-going consciousness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Skin Deep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in 1963, "Dirty Dancing" is the story of an ordinary American family--a doctor, his wife, and their two teenage daughters--on vacation at a ritzy lakeside resort. The drama begins when "Johnny," the resort's well-muscled dance instructor (played by a stunning Patrick Swayze), strides into the dining room where a bevy of waiters are setting tables, and is told by the hotel manager in no uncertain terms to keep his hands off the female guests. The rest of the film showcases Swayze's enormous sex appeal, both on the dance floor and off.And that's why I gave this film such a low rating--it's only skin deep. "Baby," the younger daughter in the family, and a fresh-faced idealist, is entranced by Johnny's raw sensuality when she stumbles onto the hotel staff in a distant cabin one evening, bumping and grinding in an orgiastic dance party.When Johnny's dance partner Penny realizes she is "knocked up" by one of the hotel waiters who dumps her when he knows she is pregnant, Baby borrows money from her father to help the dancer pay for an illegal abortion, which goes badly. Baby's father is then called in to attend the critically ill girl, and she pulls through, but the father, disgusted by the behavior which brought on the girl's condition, insists Baby sever all ties with her new friends.Baby, however, begins lying to her parents--and after days of intense dance sessions with Johnny, starts sleeping with him. Wait--isn't that how Penny got into such deep trouble? The film never asks the hard questions. It's all about titillating youthful sexual appetites through lascivious dance, and then indulging those passions under the guise of "young love." This stuff is not just skin deep--it's downright deceptive. Couldn't Baby get pregnant after having sex with Johnny? We are not encouraged to go there. Instead, Baby and Johnny keep on dancing...Watch this movie, and buy into it, at your own risk.</fullReview>

What a piece of American feelgood tosh! Unfortunately it keeps interrupting the excellent dancing. DD was made in 1987, so the heroine has to be a politically aware young woman who stands up for the underdog. American movies love teaching lessons, and the lessons of the 80s are made to sound like something from the Reader's Digest. You don't think that's all they were all along??? Plus Baby falls into bed with Johnny far too quickly and easily for a 17-year-old in 1963. We barely knew the facts of life back then. But the clothes are nice, and little details like Mr Kellerman dancing with Honi Coles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the biggest films of the 80's!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One rainy day, in the year 2000, 13 years after it's release, I sat and watched Dirty Dancing. I am upset that I didn't see it when it was in the cinema and in its popular run with the world. Baby's opening lines are a good place to start my review - "It was the summer of 1963, when everybody called me Baby, and it didn't occur to me to mind. That was before President Kennedy was shot, before the Beatles came, when I couldn't wait to join the Peace Corps, and I thought I'd never find a guy as great as my dad. That was the summer we went to Kellerman's."At a summer camp Baby meets Johnny Castle, who teaches interested vacationers how to dance, and in his off hours dirty dances with other dancers. When Johnny loses his regular dancing partner, Baby volunteers to learn his routine to help him out of a tight spot. As the summer winds down, the dancing pair must come to grips with responsibility, love and each others growing expectations. Undoubtedly, the greatest part of this film are the scenes where we get to see some great dancing. The very first scenes with it in my view where in some way erotic, yet had an infectious feel on me. The dancing is very intense and heavy. It is no wonder they call it 'dirty dancing'. It must have been hard to find the right dancers to perform in this movie, but I feel they did get it right. The main part of the cast must have been able to dance a little too, cause if they couldn't have it would have made the film very erratic, and nowhere near as good as it was. Plus the ending of the film is great, with the two main characters getting up and showing the audience what they do best.The cast of Dirty Dancing was pretty good. Patrick Swayze, who played Johnny proved to me how talented he really was. His on-air relations with Jennifer Grey, and his dancing parts of this film were great. His lead in this is also deserves much praise. Swayze has had an eventful career, starring in Ghost, one of the big films of the 90's, and Black Dog alongside music legend Meatloaf. However, Jennifer Grey is an actress who I had never heard of until this movie, yet I loved her role in this immensely. Her characters struggles in this film were well acted by her, yet by the end she really shows that she can dance too. I have recently seen one of her other films which i think the whole world liked, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and I must admit that wasn't a bad film. However, Grey did not cash in on her success as Baby in Dirty Dancing, because I believe the movie loving public did not get to see enough of her afterwards, which was very disappointing.The one thing I do remember vividly at the time this film was doing well was the main song on the soundtrack, 'I've had the time of my life'. When I heard this in the film itself last year, I really got into it. The musical version of it is great. Yet the soundtrack is full of other great hits like Hungry eyes, She's Like the Wind (performed by Patrick Swayze) and Overload just to name a few. Everyone I talk to about this movie says "Hey have you got the soundtrack to that?" It is amazing what effect a movie's soundtrack can have on people and Dirty Dancing's is great soundtrack to have.Finally, the movie's story is what I would call a bit 'mushy', but don't let that distract you from what a great film this is. The brilliant dancing and soundtrack is what I will remember most from this movie. I also like this movie for the fact that it shows some great dancing, which makes me a little jealous, considering that dancing is not one of my strong points. Lastly, let me leave you with this thought. I heard last year that an new version of Dirty Dancing was to be made, with people such as Ricky Martin and Sarah Michelle Gellar in the lead roles. I believe that a newer version of this sort of film won't be the same, cause Dirty Dancing, the original, has a certain historical look, that no new film could ever capture the same. Rating: 4 Stars or 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 60's are something to live by, and this movie brings some important nostalgia there. The cast of this movie are memorable. Patrick Swayze(The Outsiders, Steel Dawn, and Red Dawn) puts on a spectacular role as the cool Johnny Castle. Jennifer Grey(Joel's daughter) plays the naive Baby Houseman, who learns the ropes of dancing. These two main characters build a chemistry so hot, you wouldn't bother neutralizing the two elements. The musical soundtrack is really the bomb, several classics like Bruce Channel(Hey Baby!) I danced along to the song dozens of times. It's funny when Baby and Johnny keep splashing in the water when maintaining their balance. Solomon Burke's "Cry to Me" is memorable all the time. I always shudder when Johnny removed Baby's top in that scene. Gives me the rush every time. Not only does Swayze acts and dances, he sings. "She's like the Wind" blows your mind every time. At the dancing finale Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes "I've Had The Time of My Life" will leave everyone singing and dancing at the same time, and the lift is PERFECT! After seeing this movie I said to myself, "This movie really deserved 3 stars!" Now it gets 2 more because it's a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very adult-oriented flick that found a younger audience when it was released and was a legitimate block-buster. "Dirty Dancing" is one of those odd over-achievers that works in spite of itself. Young Jennifer Grey falls in love with the slightly older Patrick Swayze during one summer in the early-1960s and they enter a dance contest together and make the screen sizzle. One of the biggest hits from the 1980s, the film's pop culture appeal is truly uncanny. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a few positive things I can say about "Dirty Dancing": some of the dance sequences are indeed impressive, a few even have an undeniable erotic tension. The actors are generally convincing, the production values good and the film moves along at an agreeably fast pace - you're never bored. Still, this film is mostly AWFUL. There isn't ONE character that doesn't behave like a complete stereotype, there isn't ONE plot development that you can't predict about ten minutes before it appears onscreen. According to this film's naive, extremely corny vision, people can change and learn all the basic human values (and how to dance like professionals) within a few days. At the end, after the obligatory apologies, explanations and confessions, everybody is happy and everything is solved. Stuck with a predictable, by-the-numbers script, the director makes a watchable, even entertaining at times film, and Swayze with Grey have a genuine chemistry together, and the music is great, but this film is so sappy that only the most undemanding viewers can possibly like it. Really corny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filled to the brim with silly romantic fluff that really isn't all that compelling. To be fair, it could have been much worse. Nothing is really done really poorly, except developing the relationship between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray. Personally, I found their relationship quite shallow and not very interesting. I can see how it could be enjoyable in a cheesy kind of way. Acting, directing, editing, etc. is all very "whatever". None of it makes the film unwatchable, but none of it is particularly noteworthy either. The one thing I did enjoy was the soundtrack. I actually enjoyed it more than the movie itself. It's by no means good enough to warrant watching the movie, but it was admittedly nice to listen too. I can't say I liked this movie, but if all require from your movie watching experience is some cheesy romance, you'll be satisfied. You could watching a much worse movie, like a Nicholas Sparks movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to really try hard to get me to not like a movie whose main theme is dancing (especially, learning to dance). You have to really try hard to get me to not like a film with Patrick Swayze.., and/or Jennifer Grey in it. I liked Swayze in Donnie Darko, Roadhouse and Ghost. I liked Grey in F.B's Day Off and Wind.This film was not just mediocre in its dialogue, production and yes, it's dancing: It was actually obnoxious: (the ever-present, glowering, rich Jew who was the owner of the Jewish summer camp for Jewish families. Everything was askew in this film: Grey's embarrassingly-conventional garb, in contrast to the people she associated with, was hard to watch.Swayze's and Greys dancing was stiff, rehearsed and inexpressive. It was as though they knew the moves, but did not know how to express their lives through the dance. (A little smiling would have helped).The abortion reference and inclusion in the plot did not sit well with me. I did not find this entertaining, and when the young man said, "I could hear her screaming in the hall.", I pressed eject. What I find particularly appalling about this abortion content is one line, issued by the Jewish "father" of the child (the mother was gentile), in reference to the woman he impregnated: "some people matter.., and some don't."I could not help but think he may have meant gentiles (non-jews) in general. We see in Dirty Dancing how the other main gentile in the movie is cast as the "bad boy".What Dirty Dancing needed was a more dynamic character played by Jennifer Grey. She would have certainly been capable of it. If you are going to create tension: (a 30-something lady-killer with a younger woman), then bring it to a crescendo and "burn down the house". Complete the transformation of demure "Baby" (sic) to the defiant and autonomous Frances.Swayze needed to have a life outside of dancing, perhaps taking on the restrictive (and possibly elitist) management of the resort. We needed to see a "barn-burner" in Dirty Dancing with hotter, more expressive dancing and a much-greater development of the main characters' identities. Grey's character needed to complete and fulfill her transformation. Swayze needed to interact more forcefully and cleverly with his antagonists.Swayze's original partner, played by Cynthia Rhodes, may have been much-better played by fire-brand Demi Moore, his later beloved in Ghost. A professional salsa/meringue/ dancer may have been even better, because the acting was not especially difficult. Moore would have rectified this role.I object strongly to abortion being tossed into a picture to liven-up what is a still-dreary-and-now-morose film. It is cheap.., and it is disrespectful. I would have given a "5" to Dirty Dancing, appreciating some of the difficulties the couple went through and because of the fairly-good acting by Swayze and Grey, but the tactless inclusion of abortion (as excitement) caused me to detract one star. Choose life. Stand and fight.The full-fledged transformation we need from Dirty Dancing never happens, and we are left wondering who these people really are. Watch Bootmen, Center Stage, Flashdance or Shall We Dance, instead: Much-better movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "Grease" would probably have to be held responsible for the spate of teenage "musicals" which brought us the likes of "Flashdance", "Footloose" and then this over rated box office smash. Funny thing is, "Dirty Dancing" has little dancing in it, and even less dirt.The main gist of the story concerns a young girl who does a lot of growing up during a summer holiday with her family when she meets and falls in love with a rebellious young dancer. This melodramatic show covers quite a few controversial topics, but director Emile Ardolino shuns them in preference to a more appealing, superficial style."Dirty Dancing" was made to please hoards of teenage movie-goers, and it did thanks to Swayze's hunky looks and a very good pop soundtrack. Otherwise this movie fails to deliver solid entertainment in any way. Just as I expected.Tuesday, March 1, 1994 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For anyone with a heart - a soul - "Dirty Dancing" is a great film.Seeing the verve of the young people in the film - doing what they can to break from the conventional bonds of their parents - was stimulating. Not appearing to be "bad" in the traditional sense, they were merely trying to carve out their own place in the world.Patrick Swayze's acting - overshadowed only by superb dancing - was strong. Playing the "bad guy" with a misunderstood spirit was a fine example of casting.Jennifer Grey, as "Baby" Houseman, nearly stole the film. Her innocence - her overwhelming beauty - was exceedingly provocative. Her dancing, too, was wonderful. Watching her with Patrick Swayze was so sensuous, and watching them dance was a heart-warming experience.It is interesting to go to the IMDb site and check out the filmographies. Some actors who continued on in their careers - some who drifted into seeming oblivion.Every once in awhile, a film comes along that grabs us. For me, "Dirty Dancing" falls in line with other excellent films that are "grabbers," like "Six Days, Seven Nights," "You've Got Mail," "West Side Story," et al.I just finished watching "Dirty Dancing" for the umpteenth time, and NEVER tire of the story and the portrayal. Especially, the end-of-film dance at the end of season show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is set in the summer of 1964 when a 17 year old girl Frances "Baby" Houseman, (played by Jennifer Gray), goes on holiday with her older sister and parents to America's Catskill mountains. Her father is a doctor, who saved the resort owners life a few years ago, so the family receive top treatment throughout their visit. Baby takes no interest in the activities held at the resort but then when she offers to help carry some melons to the staff headquarters she finds a dance party on the go. Baby is eager to join in the festivity and even more so when she sees the sexy Johnny Castle (played by Patrick Swayze) who is the dance instructor of the resort. She then joins in the raunchy dancing and gets hooked so returns most nights, without her father knowing. Then her relationship with Johnny starts to develop, even though Johnny has specifically been told to not hold a relationship with any of the guests. Baby then enjoys the rest of her holiday with overwhelming consequences. The genre of the film is a romance/drama and is directed by Emile Ardolino. It's set in the 1960's but was actually made in the 1980's. I think the film would be most enjoyed by women, probably teenagers and above. I don't think men would appreciate the romance in the film (maybe some would) and I think younger children wouldn't be able to understand or relate to it as much as teenagers or older people would. The film is set in the Catskill Mountains and the film has some beautiful scenery. The opening scene focuses on the Houseman family in the car on the way to the resort and the surroundings around them are stunning: great big, fresh looking trees border the road they are driving on. Then comes a shot of the mountain, which looks superior, covered in these trees that seem to be all around. When they arrive at the Kellerman's the camera focuses on the actual resort and the camera shot is moving at the pace that the car would be, showing what the Houseman's see from the car window. Trees just like the rest of the area, surround the resort. It looks like a great place to stay: very high class and makes you think how lucky they are to be there. Many people are already out and about enjoying the activities held; it looks a lively fun place to be. Throughout the film the scenery is always full of fabulous greenery and even when it's raining it still doesn't make you feel dull. It's just like a typical, entertaining, holiday resort that looks like lots of fun. The actors in the film dance excellently all the way through and it contains some great modern jazz music. Including a very well known track "(I've had) the time of my life", which won an Oscar, "Be my Baby", and a song, which has been released again recently "Hey Baby". It almost wants to make me want to learn to dance but always certainly gets me up dancing. One of my favourite dance scenes is when Baby first discovers the art of "dirty dancing" and when she first walks into the room the shock on her face is a priceless picture she is truly shocked by what she can see. They're hot, raunchy dancers all in one room, and you can see the steam in the air and it makes me feel I can almost sense how sweaty and steamy the room is. The camera changes from different couples and you can see the great amount of passion between them. As Baby walks through the crowd carrying a melon she looks quite scared of what she's seeing. Then Johnny arrives with his dance partner and put on a fabulous performance in the middle of the floor while Baby watches in curiosity almost dancing herself. Johnny then comes over and asks Baby why she's here, and she replies, "I carried a watermelon". I find this line really amusing because how many times is it that the hunk you have a big crush on comes over and asks you a question and you reply with a silly, pathetic answer like that, it made me feel that I knew exactly how she felt. But then he drags her to dance with him and she relaxes and let's herself go, getting really into the dancing. The film deals with many important issues such as abortion, relationships and family. It covers them greatly in a way you can relate to them and understand what they are going through. When Johnny's dance partner ends up getting pregnant by one of the waiters that work at the resort (who is also going out with Baby's sister), you really feel for her and unless you've been in that exact situation couldn't begin to imagine what she's been through. It's such a touching subject to watch. At the start of the film Baby is a quiet teenage girl who wants to go into the Peace Corp and change the world. She doesn't really care that people call her Baby. But then when she meets Johnny and starts to really get into her dancing that's when she changes and becomes more adult: wearing make-up, which her father doesn't approve of, basically taking more care of her appearance. She loves her new passion for dancing and Johnny her dance instructor and has "the time of her life" on her break to the Catskill Mountains. Even though the story line is kind of predictable in places I love the whole film and the actors play it really well,adapting to their roles brilliantly. It's a movie I can watch over and over again without ever getting bored and gives out a great message ? Have the time of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie with some bad parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic movie was so popular when it came out and it still is. The acting is absolutely horrible, especially from Jennifer Grey, but what makes this movie great is the dancing and the music, which makes you forget all about the bad acting. The story line isn't that great, yet people (mostly women) loved it because it's the story where the girl who does not look like a model at all, manages to get the good looking guy who seems way out of her league. It represents the dream of many women of getting the unattainable guy and do some dirty dancing with him. It's easier for the average woman to identify with Baby. Speaking of Baby, I think they could find a much better nickname for her.The story appeals to the public, but the dancing also has a major part in attracting the audience. This movie may make you reconsider those dancing classes you gave up a long time ago. I say, forget the story, it's not that great, forget the acting, you'll be glad you did, and focus on the dancing, because it is great. And I gotta say I was pretty surprised by Patrick Swayze. He is one hell of a dancer. Can't say the same about Jennifer, but I guess she is not supposed to be a good dancer in the movie, since she is just learning. The bottom line is that despite its bad parts this is a good movie that is definitely worth your time. You may learn some moves along the way.</fullReview>

I went to Mountain Lake again a couple of weeks ago.And the original hotel is there !!I don't think another movie should be made unless Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze are the stars. I think it would ruin the original. I have collected the video,dvd, collector's sound track and other items connected to Dirty Dancing. I am a grandmother and this is still my favorite movie !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dumb teen movie, predictable sound track</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand the fuzz about this one, to me it is no more than just another teen movie, about relationships, Love, etc. OK, the dancing is nicely done, the period re-making is excellent, in style, props, comments, etc., but that's all. Compared to the great masterpieces of my life, like the Fellinis, the Viscontis, the Fassbinder's, even the Scorseses (now talk about good sound tracks, this guy really knows them....Like Gimme Shelter...and his superb time piece Mean streets opened with the Ronettes too!!) this is NOTHING. Just teen amusement for the drive-in, to get long times of kissing and hugging, as there is nothing to see anyway. Conclusion: mediocre, and only "great" when you're just 15, the market it was made for. (At that age I went to see A Hard Days Night at least, quite another teen movie). O by the way, that sound track, so what? I miss Louie Louie, Beach Boys, It s My Party, She Loves You, etcetera. Those were my hits in 63, besides the Ronettes and Crystals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife love this film, she thinks this relationship movie is great. I found it ok the first time, but second time its more soap operish. They do this big dance at the end of the summer for a bunch of campers, after both lead character live becomes messes big deal. The movie seem hopeless, and pointless. I might be wrong, but this movie will not age well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dorm room trauma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most horrible memories I have of college is that in our dorm they seemed to run this movie 24/7. I would go down to the TV lounge to watch something and it would be filled with my peers pajama clad and munching on popcorn and clutching their box of kleenex. It was a constant rotation of Pretty Woman, Dirty Dancing and Can't Buy Me Love. I have night terrors because of it. I hated the movie. I hate Patrick Swayze. I think it goes back to his promotion of the movie as having more substance than Footloose or Flashdance....like saying that cotton candy has more substance than marshmellows. I have to give this movie a 1 to counteract the average of a 5 on this film. I would normally had given it a 3, but the majority of you folks left me no choice. I don't know that this movie inspires anger in me but that time of your life song makes me cower and whimper curled up in a fetal position. The biggest clue that this movie lacked anything interesting, it wasn't in black and white.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goyim on the West Side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "Ice Castles" reminded me of this, so I revisited it.Two things: The first is the modern problem of how to incorporate dance in a story. In the 30s you could just pretend the movie was a stage show with the players doing their entertainment thing. Coming out of that was a long tradition of movies where the characters were in show business, so we'd have some usually trivial story wrapping the shows.Over time, the interplay between the inner show and the outer became important and nuanced. At one end is the play reflecting some larger insight into the "real" life that surrounds it. By merging the audience within with the audience in the movie theater, the story becomes more real.In modern times, the screenwriter's problem -- when they want to have dance -- is how to incorporate it into the story. It isn't easy at all, unless you turn it into a sports movie where the dance (or singing) sequences are part of some grand competition that is also a make it or break it life test. That's lazy. Just lazy.Dirty Dancing was a clever solution, since become something of a formula. Dancing is sex, pure and simple. Dance as a seduction, paired dancing that is. There is the slightest hint of a test here, where our little baby has to fill in for the regular partner. (She has to fill in because that partner is pregnant, as if we needed yet another reminder what it is all about.) But that event isn't so much a test as a gift, a gift of her body.All in all, seeing this again after 20 years, it doesn't seem all that dirty now even though the youth and plainness of our girl is still striking.The second interesting thing about this was remarked on when new. But it is so much more obvious when browsing the DVD extras. Baby is a Jew, as is her family and all the guests. The writer was trying to evoke her own memories of a lost era (the hotelier bemoans that loss at the end of the movie).The setting is a Jewish resort in the Catskills where the owner brings in the right kind of boys for waitstaff in order to screw the patron's daughters. There's a longstanding joke in the Jewish community about how tepid and joyless they are, and that's pinged often here.Meanwhile, some of the lower class staff, goyim, have a West Side Story sort of existence, endlessly rutting and dancing. Joy and whooping.Our Baby is the daughter of the doctor who saved the owner's life, so he has blessed her by providing his own blood to awaken her. This poor kid is played by someone who had a name for himself playing stereotypical Jews. Large noses play an embarrassing part here in identifying key characters and this kid has a comically prosthetic one.No surprise that she prefers the "other" class, and much is made of her father's disapproval. It is because he is not a Jew, like the boy designated for the other daughter (who dutifully plans her deflowering).No one doubts that Baby will never see Johnny again, will join the Peace corps, fix her nose (as Jennifer has) and be happy in some conventional future after having her two flings.Its a sad movie in many ways, but if you want an old dance movie, please choose this one over "Flashdance" and "Saturday Night Fever." Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tad mixed-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie appears to be shooting for 60s nostalgia, but comes off as dated-80s fare. Jennifer Grey is consistently dressed in 80s garb and many of the songs are the epitome of bad 80s-pop. Be prepared for a healthy supply of cardboard characters. The conservative parents are ultra-conservative (they ignorantly wornder which section of the world is experiencing hunger this year). And Jennifer's character (named Francis - but inanely called "Baby" - perhaps a nod to Judy Garland?) becomes so worldly-wise so quickly, that only moments after telling us she doesn't think she'll ever meet a man as great as her dad, she lies to him so that she can help a friend's friend that she only met days before. Right. My favorite continuity error: Swayze notes in one scene that just the year before he "was eating jujubes to stay alive". Later, he tells a croud that every year he has always done the last number at the talent contest. Which is it, Pat?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nadir of originality, but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been several years since I last saw Dirty Dancing, and I can still remember the plot pretty well. This is not because I read other reviews, or because it's one of my sister's favorite movies, nor is it because it's one of my girlfriend's favorite movies. I remember the plot because it's the same basic plot the world has seen in countless other films like "Cutting Edge" or "Strictly Ballroom" or even "The Karate Kid." Sure, there are some cosmetic differences, but scrape away the makeup and change a few locations and you've got the same flick, over and over and over again.Having said that, I will guiltily admit I enjoyed the film when I last saw it. It entertained and held my interest in a way that I cared enough about the characters to want to see them succeed in the final dance competition. Of course, I was about sixteen. You can draw your own conclusions from that last point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Symbolic Expressions Powerfully Reinforce Characters (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movement and color aid in the identification of character's personalities because warm colors and motion represent Frances 'Baby' Houseman's radiant energy and aspiration and because cool colors and stillness represent Lisa Houseman's insignificant, unsuccessful role. In addition, the physical appearance of each sister suits her character well. Contrary to the norm, I viewed the sequel, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, before I had ever seen the original film, Dirty Dancing. I am basing this information on two occasions that I watched Dirty Dancing. The first time was on November 15, and the second on November 17, 2005. Both viewings were during the evening, in my home.As Frances 'Baby' Houseman learned various dancing techniques, the upward motion of her body seemed soaring and free because it followed the natural tendency to move upward over a composition. Her movement in this direction indicated a strong sense of aspiration and joy as well as a position of power. During various dance routines, Baby often moved assertively toward the camera, reinforcing her confidence. This closeness also forced the audience to follow Baby on a more personal level throughout the film. The red, orange, yellow, and pink colored dresses that Baby wore were stimulating, attractive, and clearly portrayed her radiant energy. Cool colors, including blue, green, and gray, were worn predominantly by Lisa Houseman. Lisa played a much more subtle role than her sister, Baby. Her movements seemed to be choreographed with much less complexity that was hard to appreciate as opposed to the kinetic richness and beauty of Baby's dances. The relationship between the audience and Lisa was distant and rather impersonal because she often withdrew from the camera. Uncomfortable stillness upheld her role. In addition, the sisters' physical appearances suited their character well. Baby was a blue-eyed-blonde of medium height and had a bubbly personality. Stereotypically, this stood behind her successes in the dancing world, and her flamboyant relationships with the opposite sex. Even though she was beautiful, Lisa's pale skin, brown hair, and brown eyes, made her role much less memorable.Symbolic expressions powerfully reinforce each actor's character in the film Dirty Dancing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really isn't a regular love story about boy meets girl. It's a story about dancer meets girl, and they have the time of their life! Dirty Dancing has some fantastic senes of dancing and love. The best sene is we're "Baby" walks in for the dance place for the first time, and sees everybody doing dirty dances. Then she sees Patrick Swayze for the first time, and he dances..... OHHH!!!!! It's fantastic! SEE IT!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I *Still* Don't Get It...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time when I was still a pre-teen, because one of the girls I knew from school (an older teenager) was obsessed with it. I didn't get it back then. I saw this movie again in my late teens, and didn't get it then, either. Watched it again the other day, and I STILL don't get it! I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's unremarkable, boring, predictable, monotonous, and thoroughly mediocre. As if that wasn't enough, it also manages to be offensive to boot. The plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring; the dialogue - horrendous. There was ZERO chemistry between the lead actors. In fact, it was quite apparent that they can't stand each other. Speaking of characters, - they were all HIGHLY unlikeable. Johnny = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional a***hole.Baby = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional slag. And it's actually quite disgusting that Patrick Swayze, who seems to be in his mid-30s, is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior. Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers? Don't get me wrong, I did like "Lolita" (where the same was happening, but it's expected, and actually quite tastefully done), but this... was just creepy and disturbing. It's just my opinion, but I think one must be slightly retarded to refer to this utter disgrace as a "masterpiece".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>or as I call it "dreary dancing"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I regret that I actually sat through this yawnfest twice. The second time was only because some kid in my acting class told me he had a cameo, so I rented it again just to watch for him ...At any rate, I found it to be a major disappointment. The script was cheesy, the plot was bland, and the "Grand finale" dance scene was "just okay." Certain elements of the storyline were unbelievable...The "ugly duckling" goes to the Catskills with her family, and falls for a handsome dance teacher...who falls in love with her. BUT her dad believes this guy A) got his dance partner pregnant (just because he was helping the girl...) and B) Stole some stuff (because an envious Matron set him up...)Even if he wasn't a thief, WHY would she even like this guy?? I mean he's a good dancer, but would YOU want a guy who slept around with wealthy older women? you could catch something. I kept thinking, if everyone would just come out and say the truth in this movie, there wouldn't be 500 misunderstandings going on at once.THe parts of the story that could have been played up were played down, and vice versa. None of the characters were endearing. At all. I felt empathy for no one. Baby was bland, her sister was a brat, Johnny was a revamping of Swayze's "Outsiders" character except for the dancing, and the late great Jerry Orbach was reduced to a cardboard cut-out character of a domineering father. Such injustice!Avoid this one like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teen Pickle Nose Seduced by Pedophile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently, some time in the late 80's a casting call went out looking for a teenage girl with a pickle nose and a guy in his 30's who could dance fairly well and play the role of the pedophile who seduces her. And as a result we have this film, which is one of the worst I've ever seen. It's not just a chick flick train wreck, it's a sick twisted testament to pedophilia and really bad acting.I fail to see how anyone could find any aspect of this film appealing. Well, anyone except someone with a bizarre secret fetish to watch a half clad pedophile rubbing against an under age female. And if that's their thing, they'd be better served rubbing a page from teen undergarment section of the Sears catalog against the cover of Playgirl. At least they wouldn't be subject to the cheesy 80's pop music, bad acting and cliché plot. That, and as far as I know Sears models don't have a pickle noses.This is why I highly suspect anyone who raves about this film and would suggest they get some counseling. Pedophilia isn't entertainment, or great film making, it's a mental disorder and criminal offense. I could go on about the other elements of this movie that made me want to hurl, the bad script, bad directing and editing and especially the "music". But I'll wind it up with this: Unless you have a severe mental illness and sick fetish that enjoys seeing an ugly pickle nosed teenager being seduced and violated by a 30 year old to the worst music ever written, avoid this at all cost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well first off, I hate musicals, and dancing movies, so its a no- brainer that this movie is not for me. I can say nothing good about it, the acting is crap, plot is as cornball as one can get, and it doesn't appeal to me.I also cannot stand any Patrick Swayze movies to date, that weighs in heavily. The only reason I have seen this movie is because when I was young, there was only one T.V., so not much choice with an older sister and mother who love this movie. I wanted to bust the tape, I cannot ever sit through this movie. This definetly not for anyone who does not like musicals or dancing movies, trust me. Avoid at all costs.1/10 for this crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Possibly the Worst Movie Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should never have been made. Yuck. If you like this movie, you're probably twelve and female and have no sense of what art and film is or should be, and probably shouldn't be watching movies in the first place. Flat story based on even flatter subject-matter. I don't know what is worse, that this film ever got made or that Hollywood continues to find reasons to make films about *dancing*. Let's just pretend that the story was good, the dialog anything other than flat, the direction and photography somehow original...it wouldn't matter. *Dancing* has to be the least-compelling base subject matter for any story or film. But don't worry, if if the whole idea of dancing doesn't make you want to vomit, the flat acting, directing, and dialog will, I assure you. Unless you are literally a twelve-year old girl, or just have yet to mentally mature beyond that, I think you'll agree. And if you are, then you're opinion DOES NOT MATTER!</fullReview>
