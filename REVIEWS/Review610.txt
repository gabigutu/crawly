		<shortDescription>The Sound of Music rules because it has everything.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While many people agree that the Sound of Music is one of the best films of all time, some are at a loss to adequately explain why; they buckle under and admit that there are parts that are syrupy, etc. Well, I'll tell you why it's the best movie ever (and I DON'T agree that it's too syrupy). It simply has everything one could want in a movie. First of all, it has a REAL romance - one where you can watch the characters slowly fall in love. It's not like today's movies where two characters meet and the next scene is them waking up together. Secondly, it has humor. Not syrupy or corny humor, but very wry, dry tongue-in-cheek humor. For evidence, look at the quotes. Baronness Schraeder is especially well-done in this regard. Her comments simply drip with ice. "Good bye, Maria. I'm sure you'll make a fine nun." You want to smack her. Thirdly, it's got adventure. The Nazis are the ultimate villains in any movie - WWII was as clear a case of good vs. evil as you can find, making it great fodder for films - and so it's great to see Maria, the Captain and the kids outwit them. Fourthly, it's got great music. Fifthy, it's got great scenery. And the plot and dialogue are astounding. I find new things to admire each time I watch. Finally, is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen Nazi car parts??? "The Sound of Music" does not just succeed because it cheers people up with syrup or song. It succeeds because it is a wonderfully-constructed, wonderfully-written, wonderfully-acted, brilliant movie. For me, no other movie can compare. Not to be obsessed with it or anything. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching my Mother dancing and singing to the songs of "The Sound of Music" at the age of five was incredibly disturbing. It was seven years before anyone was able to sit me down in front of the T.V to the musical during the annual telecast in Sydney. Almost to my horror, I was falling in love with the musical. More than two years later, not a single movie has been able to pass it in my favourite movies stakes. I have made judgemental mistakes with great movies. Greats like "Casablanca", "The African Queen" and "The Wizard of Oz" have originally also been frowned upon. "The Sound of Music" expanded my horizons on the movie world. I eventually went on to view non-musical classics as a result of this single movie, and now old classic movies have become a genuine passion. Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote their greatest work in the form of their last musical, despite the fact it was "Carousel" that was their favourite. Although the changes made from the original stage production have now been evident in the arrival of the excellent musical currently playing in Sydney, much have been for the better. Throughout their career, the duo created immortal musicals, but in story, song and film, "The Sound of Music" surpasses "The King and I", "Oklahoma!", "Carousel" and "South Pacific" in all aspects. We all know the story. We know of at least one of the immortal songs from the musical, "The Sound of Music", "My Favourite Things", "Do-Re-Mi" or "Edelweiss". Julie Andrews was believable and unforgettable as the sweet, outspoken novice nun turned governess, who should have taken out the oscar that year. Christopher Plummer was dashing as the Captain, and the supporting cast was one of the best I have ever seen. Fond memories have been remembered from some of the unforgettable sequences of this film that deservedly made it the best picture of 1965.Yes, there are sugary elements in the movie that cannot be denied. But this movie has never been reliant upon sex, violence or drugs to make it one of the best things to come out of Hollywood. It can be appreciated truly for what it is, pure art, talent and spirit. It is not a real perception of the world nowadays, but for all the joy it brings, who cares?It was the last movie I expected to love as a fourteen year old. It was also the first movie I watched in seven years that could manage to make me shed tears, and view it in loving admiration which cannot be equalled."Singin' In the Rain" is the only other contender to the title of "The greatest movie ever made". Whatever its flaws, "The Sound of Music" is one of the worlds best loved treasures which keeps bringing generations of viewers to its attention.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect film musical......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a triumph in all departments. Every aspect, from the cinematography to the acting, the sets to the costumes, the music, choreography, script, is top notch. While the film is family friendly and has a sweet story, it is constantly amazing the way people attack it as saccharine and sugary. This can certainly be said of the stage show, but the movie version has been carefully produced to provide a more well-rounded vision. Ernest Lehman worked wonders with the underdeveloped and unremarkable dialogue of the play. He inserted so many moments of wit, humor, romance and poignancy that are nowhere in sight in the original. the art directors purposefully chose muted settings and colors. Each of the actors bent over backwards to provide a brilliant performance. Andrews is already down in history for the performance of a lifetime (and a voice to match), but Plummer is not to be forgotten. Not only is he regal and handsome, but his decision to play the Captain as a complex, sophisticated man with a sly dose of sarcasm was wonderful. His steely, stern persona is eventually melted down by the irrepressible Andrews to great effect. Every supporting performance is also delivered with the right amount of appeal, humor or menace as called for in the script. However, the one that takes the cake....that amazes each time, is the slinky, catty, toweringly glamorous Parker as Baroness Schraeder. Wisely, her songs were cut, further separating her from all the glee around her, so that she could whip out such zingers as "Why didn't you tell me....to bring along my harmonica?" or when she's told that Andrews may not make a great nun, "If you need anything, I'd be happy to help you." The character is given a much more polished and integral position in the film versus the stage and virtually every line of her dialogue (unlike in the play) is a howler. Though Wood was lovely in her role as the Mother Abbess, it was Parker who should have gotten an Oscar nod....and WON! Every expression, every syllable, every glance belies the decades of experience Parker gained as a leading lady during the 40's and 50's. Her clothes by Dorothy Jeakins are awe-inspiring. This type of film-making is GONE. The location photography, the simplicity of story and design, the sheer good-spiritedness of it all...they just can't do this anymore. Thankfully, there's this flawless gem to turn to when one just want to feel good. But saccharine? No..... Compare this to other beloved musicals with their garish colors and sugary story lines ("Seven Brides...", "Singin' in the Rain", "...Molly Brown", "The Music Man", to name just a few...) They are all highly enjoyable, but are hardly less sweet than this! Just one word.....Nazis!! Though virtually everyone knows the outcome, there is still genuine suspense at the climax of "The Sound of Music". The film has it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It just gains more and more fans every year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Happiest sound in all the world"? Quite possibly and easily the most famous musical film in Hollywood history. Most of us grown-ups still love it but at the same time we're also tired of seeing it over and over again (maybe that's why it's not rerun on NBC every single year anymore). Julie Andrews takes her MARY POPPINS success and adds even more to it with her delightful rendition of the role that Mary Martin originated on the Broadway stage in 1959 and ran even farther with it than Martin ever could. In my opinion, and I don't think I'm alone here, Martin was too old for the part (she was in her mid to late 40s in the stage version and Andrews was 30 when the transition came to film came around--a perfect age). As for the rest of the cast, it is just as talented: Christopher Plummer in the role he will be forever remembered for (even though he hated the part) is an achingly true Cap. Von Trapp with those "hidden talents" making subtle appearances throughout the film until blatantly bursting out into the open in the film's closing scenes; Richard Haydn makes for a comical and yet sincere "Uncle" Max, Peggy Wood is a starchy yet compassionate Reverand Mother and Charmian Carr as Liesl stands out as our perrenial favorite of the seven children. The locales are breathtaking as well (esp. the opening scenes which is probably the most beautiful aerial shot in all of film history and the cunning floral designs of the public Austrian gardens during the DO-RE-MI sequence). So let's all keep watching this most cherished of all musical films each year and never forget it's universal sentiment: to 'climb ev'ry mountain, ford ev'ry stream, follow ev'ry rainbow till you find your dream'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes saccharine can be a good substitute.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1965's "The Sound of Music" is everything a bad musical should be. Providing more sap than a forest full of Vermont maples, it has coy, silly songs, an inane, innocuous script, and unbelievably sugary characters. So why is it one of my favorite musicals? OK, go ahead. Shoot me at twenty paces. But after all this time, it still remains a guilty pleasure. I find myself going for a tub of rocky road ice cream and Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's immortal classic whenever the real world gets to be too much. I seem to play it a lot around tax time.And I'm not alone. Why is it still considered the most popular musical of all time? Well, first of all they spared no expense. The extremely well-produced blockbuster has gorgeous, eye-popping scenery. From the first moment Julie Andrews flails her arms and circles around on that beautiful sunny hillside singing the rousing title song, I know I'm being swept away to another world. I'm not in Kansas anymore...or L.A., anyway. The panoramic Salzburg background complements and never intimidates or takes away from the characters or their story (like the other R &amp; H extravaganza "South Pacific.") That in itself is an incredible feat.Now about those songs. Almost every one of them is absolute drivel. So what makes them work? Easy. The utter joy and sincerity of the cast who sings the infectious, hummable tunes, which are backed by extremely moving orchestrations and an exceptionally beautiful score. It's hard to resist Maria prancing about, pillow-fighting with a bunch of knee-highs and gushing about her most favorite things. Or the austere Captain Von Trapp (the meticulous Christopher Plummer) turning to butter after hearing his brood sing in perfect harmony for the first time (with no prior lessons even) and joining right in. Or the Mother Superior's soaring number that unknowingly forewarns Maria to head for the hills (I mean, mountains) before the Nazis escort them elsewhere. Or the 16-year-old going on 17 squealing with delight after receiving her first kiss. Or the kids working up a clever little ditty to leave their formal party guests when its time for bed. Or two people declaring their love in a moonlit gazebo. The songs work because they come straight from and aim for the heart, not the head, which is exactly the place the viewer should be coming from when watching this movie. If the songs don't transcend the script (which they didn't prior to the 70s), they certainly transcend the mood.The script is undeniably trite and probably the film's weakest link. But again, the characters play it straight all the way. Not one actor looks embarrassed. Every scene is done with total enthusiasm and total commitment, and the performers who are telling the story are pitch-perfect and picture perfect. And as for the characters. Try and think of anybody better than jubilant, crop-haired Julie Andrews as a postulant nun who has gorgeous pipes, can make play clothes out of curtains, can set up and operate marionette shows at the drop of a hat, and is confident enough to convince a man that a failed nun is ideal marriage material. I certainly can't. Thank heavens for her Oscar-winning "Mary Poppins" the year before or we might have gotten Julie LONDON instead! After all, Andrews did lose out on "My Fair Lady" the year before. But now certifiably bankable, she proved she could handle this dream role. Andrews is cutely silly, cutely stubborn, cutely astute, cutely shattered and cutely...well, cute. She gives the most wholesomely appealing musical perf since Judy Garland in "The Wizard of Oz." To actually make you forget Mary Martin in the Broadway role takes some doing and she does it effortlessly. Christopher Plummer is all seriousness, handsomely patrician, and quite a catch for anybody...much less a nun. I can't think of anyone more suitable for this role either. As for the Seven Little Foys, I mean the Von Trapp children, they are adorable and perfect in their own ways too, whether they are marching or singing, creating their own individual personalities by film's end.Richard Haydn as Max and Eleanor Parker as the flamboyant, haughty Baroness provide wonderful catty relief. Despite having their musical numbers snatched away from them, they make up for it with droll, sophisticated humor. The elegant, perfectly coiffed Parker is particularly delicious as Maria's chief romantic rival, getting some of the film's best zingers and delivering them with biting understatement. Parker developed a devout cult following after this role. Peggy Wood's Mother Superior is suitably reverent and inspiring.For those who tear "The Sound of Music" apart for its shameless, sugar-coated manipulations, well, I can respect that. But to attack it for its political and historical inaccuracies is like attacking "Peter Pan" for being a subversive plot that encourages young children to run away from home. It's ludicrous. Despite the fact that it's based on a true story, we're not watching "The Sound of Music" for stark realism. Like a sparkling and lavish Ernst Lubitsch operetta, we want a feel-good movie, with feel-good songs, with a feel-good story, and a feel-good ending. Nothing more. If you want a movie that presents a potent depiction of pre-war Austria or anti-Nazi sentiment, rent "Holocaust" or "Schindler's List." Here, we want to believe that a group of nuns can tear out an automobile carburetor and save the world! Period.I suppose the reality-based MTV generation cannot truly respect or relate to the relative innocence and pure escapism like "The Sound of Music." If this movie was made today I'm afraid the Von Trapp children would not be dangling out of trees for fear of drive-by shooters. It's a tough new world today, sad to say. The 50s and 60s are looking better all the time.Anyway, for what it's worth, "The Sound of Music" is indeed schmaltz, but its QUALITY schmaltz at its very, very best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If "West Side Story" was the best musical film of the sixties, then "The Sound of Music," adapted from the long-running Broadway musical play about Maria Von Trapp and her singing family, was certainly the most popular? With a story that includes the right amount of family sentiment (the Von Trapp children never quarrel among themselves), religion (in the Hollywood tradition of serene, kind nuns), romance (actually two romances, one adult, one adolescent), and anti-Nazi feeling (Captain Von Trapp refuses to surrender to the Nazi invaders)?and with director Robert Wise who is in fact a solid, conscientious craftsman and a fluent story-teller mercifully free of grandiose pretensions, "The Sound of Music" is perfect with its sumptuous location photography, immaculate, fluid editing, and splendid tones? The film does have a justifiably famous opening: the camera sweeps over the Austrian Alps to catch Julie Andrews, as mischievous, warmhearted Maria, exultantly singing the title song as she rushes through the bright green valley? It is an exhilarating moment that the film never really matches again, but there is plenty left in the remaining hours to please the legions of devotees...There are unquestionably some enjoyable songs and musical numbers specially when the eldest Von Trapp daughter (Charmian Carr) meets her shy beau (Daniel Truhitte) in the family garden, he sings "Sixteen Going on Seventeen" to her, and they do a charming little dance around the gazebo? Maria's music lesson to the children, "Do-Re-Mi," is beautifully staged, set over several days as they amble in and around Salzburg, changing their clothing through camera wizardry? And perhaps the best of the songs is the simplest, "Edelweiss," with a tender lyric and poignant melody that make a fitting last song for Rodgers and Hammerstein?Another of the film's virtues is Julie Andrew's performance as Maria... She cuts through the thick sentiment with her own sharply honed blade of authority and self-confidence, implying that at least she will get through all the high corn without damaging her self-esteem... It works to balance the tight-lipped stodginess of Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp, the "adorable" posturings of the children, and the artificial airs of Eleanor Parker as the haughty baroness...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In My Personal Top-Ten of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has Julie Andrews ever appeared on film more beautifully than in this film? Has she ever sung with such richness and gusto as is captured here? As a big fan of hers, I can watch this musical over and over and just sigh.Wise and his cinematographer have photographed Andrews in a manner that no other director has--even her husband. Watch the scene where Maria watches the Captain sing Edelweiss with the kids. Wise turns her into a gauzy angel. It is a fantastic moment among hundreds that this movie contains.I am firmly in a camp that says Julie Andrews was completely, utterly, and regrettably robbed when the 1965 Oscars were handed out. She embodied Maria Von Trapp, wholly and with every fiber of her being (just watch the scene in which she races the boys in a segment of "Do-Re-Mi"; she runs at the camera with utter abandon here, no holding back. Or consider the shot at the end of this song, where she places her hand atop her head--it's as if even SHE can't believe she's hitting that note).The Julie Christie performance that beat Andrews is now all but forgotton. "The Sound of Music," however, lives on and on."The Sound of Music" is a bit bittersweet for me, given that audiences tastes would soon turn away from big-budget musicals in general and Julie Andrews specifically. But what a legacy it (and she) have left!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sound Of Mucus: Inside The Head Of A Crazy Person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Would you like to spend three hours trapped inside the head of a crazy person who cannot tolerate one moment of reality without suffering a nervous breakdown? How about songs that are so dorky and gooey that you feel the strong urge to vomit? Usually, one has to visit an insane asylum to find people this severely disturbed. I was raised in Catholic schools; nuns whale on you with rulers and generally rough you up. Has anyone on earth met nuns like these? The lyrics to the songs are natural emetics. When I say slimy goo, I mean the lyrics are frighteningly disturbed. Make up your own lyrics it is the only way to maintain your sanity. I like: You are brain dead, I'm an idiot, how will we find our way?.., I suggest you try for your stomach's sake. The unrelenting sickly sweet goo that will be slimed all over you; musicals always have some idealization, this is a masterpiece of psychosis, not one scene in the movie is real. Robert Wise did the Motionless Picture which moves faster than this. He evidently suffered some kind of mental breakdown while making the film. Has he read a history book about the Nazis? See, they do not get out flashlights and spend three hours searching for the Von Craps. No, they line the nuns up and then start shooting them until either they run out of nuns or somebody points out where the Von Craps are hiding. I grew up in a family this large and it is a miracle I am still alive. Parents out there? Is this a realistic picture of raising six children? Are they all lovable, mischievous little angels like this? Please, OK? We are going to vomit. How about mother superior's eardrum shattering rendition of Climb Every Plot Hole? They should have used her on the Nazis. You know, hit high C again honey, just wait for us to get our headphones on first. The fillings in my teeth were rattling with her note. Please, that was not music; it was auditory assault. Did you enjoy seeing a grown man, dressed in lederhosen, crying like a baby over his favorite little white flower? Did you know that about 90% of Austrians were out there cheering Adolph when he took over their country without firing a shot? Please, stop with the revisionism. The whole audience would have grabbed strudel boy and beat the crap out of him. Read a history book, please. Young people, the movie is the length of your entire life up to this point. Your mind will be assaulted by a world that never has nor ever will exist except in the mind of a crazy or heavily sedated person. It is like being drowned in honey. One gooey, maudlin, lobotomized, insipid song after another. We have the historical insult of making an exception, Von Crap, depicted as typical of all Austrians. Gee, who were all those thousands of people throwing flowers at that crazy paper hanging mass murderer? If they had come into my neighborhood, on those sissy bikes, crooning Do Re I Got To Pee, they better have all their premiums paid up in full. Hey, the world can be a scary place, just one step at a time; it starts by throwing this piece of poop into the nearest garbage can. When you watch this, remember it could happen to you. A little too much sending the positive energy, thinking good thoughts and you will wind up drinking pink lemonade, strumming a guitar and sounding like you are completely insane.

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's Last Great Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sound of Music" is an impressive musical that stands above other films of the genre because of interesting characters, top-notch direction, and a truly inspired screenplay. Julie Andrews (Oscar-nominated) stars as the young nun who leaves the convent to become the governess to a large family. She is instantly at odds with the children's father (Christopher Plummer), but they soon fall in love and get married. However, evil forces lurk overhead as the Nazis invade their homeland of Austria. Somewhat based on a true story, "The Sound of Music" is one of those rare musicals that works because there is a sense of fear and drama in the film's final act. This makes the film believable and none of the musical numbers take away from the story or the film's direction. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sound of Music is one of the best musicals of all time displaying one of the greatest voices to ever be heard on the silver screen: Julie Andrews. What a wonderful movie that not only I grew up with but still treasure to this day. Sound of Music has everything you could ask for: romance, humor, singing, dancing and a wonderful cast that put their heart and soul into this film. All the songs are recognizable, although I admit that still hearing "Few Favorite Things" is strange during Christmas time. But moving on, Sound of Music is a classic film that is still incredible to watch and I always enjoy slipping into my DVD player to this day.Maria, a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing the title song. Deciding that Maria needs to learn something about the real world before she can take her vows, the Mother Superior sends her off to be governess for the children of the widowed Captain Von Trapp. Arriving at the Trapp home, Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and aloof, and his seven children virtual automatons-at least, whenever the Captain is around. Otherwise, the kids are holy terrors, as evidenced by the fact that Maria is the latest in a long line of governesses. But Maria soon ingratiates herself with the children, especially oldest daughter Liesl, who is in love with teenaged messenger boy Rolf. As Maria herself begins to fall in love with the Captain, she rushes back to the Abbey so as not to complicate his impending marriage to a glamorous baroness. But the children insist that Maria return, the Baroness steps out of the picture, and Maria and the Captain confirm their love in the song "Something Good." Unhappily, they return home from their honeymoon shortly after the Nazis march into Austria. Already, swastikas have been hung on the Von Trapp ancestral home, and Liesl's boyfriend Rolf has been indoctrinated in the "glories" of the Third Reich. The biggest blow occurs when Von Trapp is called back to active duty in the service of the Fuhrer. The Captain wants nothing to do with Nazism, and he begins making plans to take himself and his family out of Austria.Julie Andrews had come off fresh from Mary Poppins, which her character wasn't that far from being the nanny caring for children with a stuffy father. But the thing that made this film so special is that you honestly feel the love between Maria and Von Trapp, what a wonderful love story they had. The film is a bit long, but back in the day they had intermissions and oh, boy do I miss that. Come on, Lord of the Rings could have used one of those lol. Back onto Sound of Music, my favorite song is probably "Confidence in Me", such life to it due to Julie's beautiful voice and her dancing along the sidewalk could make anyone want to do the same thing. I love The Sound of Music, my boyfriend who hates musicals and said this was the crown of the worst, I asked him to watch it with me to see if he would give it another chance, I glanced over to see him singing a little to the songs! He finally admitted that the songs are very catchy, so see? You can find any little positive thing to say about this film, The Sound of Music brings you to life and you can't help but fall in love with this spectacular musical.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>re: don't get it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes there's a cultural institution about which you just don't see the big fuss, and for me, it's this film. I got dragged to it at least twice as an 8-year-old, didn't really like it then, and still don't get it. I don't think the lyrics come close to some of the Oscar Hammerstein classics, the score is not among Rodgers' best, to me at least, and having said all that, I think from what I've heard, the Broadway score is better. The film score is much heavier, less folksy. I particularly don't like the opening, the booming, over-orchestrated film version of the title song, compared to the understated stage version of the same song. I much prefer Julie Andrews overall in "Mary Poppins," and vocally, by far, in "My Fair Lady." If Christopher Plummer hated being in this movie, I think it shows. Having said all that, millions of people -- including my late mother, who rarely went to any movies, yet saw this at least three times, I think -- adore the film. So I guess I'm in the minority, but still, I have no desire to ever see this again.</fullReview>

His answer, "It was the first time in my life that I rooted for the Nazis!"I saw "The Sound of Music" on stage years ago, and it ran a little over 2 hours. This monstrosity of a film runs almost 3 hours. Talk about padding, and they even cut some of the songs from the stage version. While the stage presentation moved right along to keep your interest, this movie plods along at a snail's pace to bore you to tears. This show has great music, which is presented to much better effect on the Original Broadway Cast Recording with Mary Martin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dumbest movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most unbelievable, and stupid movie I've ever seen. A family of singers runs from the Nazi's, and every few minutes they stop to sing about their "Favorite things" or how "the hills are alive with the sound of music." If I were running from the Nazi's, I wouldn't stop to sing every two seconds about the stupid hills! If this is based on a true story, then I'm the Queen of England.Score: Not even 0, it doesn't deserve that many points. It owes us points, that's how bad it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was forced to sit through this by my wife's grandmother as it's one of her favourites. *Nothing* happens for the first 3/4 of the film, and the whole thing is so horrifically saccharine. It's like spending three hours being force-fed sugar. The film could have been saved if the von Trapp family had been strafed by Messerschmits as they climbed the mountain at the end, but sadly this was not to be. They say that films like American Psycho breed violence, but this film more than any other made me want to kill something. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the book - the movie is hogwash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>possible spoiler.I love old musicals, and I love the music in Sound of Music. And there's nothing wrong with the acting. But the movie is basically garbage. Maria Von Trapp wanted to sue the producers but found she had sold away this right. She loved the broadway play, but the movie completely distorted the facts of her life and her autobiography. Her husband was actually a gentle, loving father and husband, for starters. And the ending is a complete Hollywood fiction. The family actually left for America on a steamship with a contract for the family to tour the country giving performances. So much for dad Von Trapp despising singing. Christopher Plummer referred to it as "The Sound of Treacle." It's a great movie for children. But these adults who go gaga over it really should read Maria Von Trapp's autobiographies (in two volumes). The true story is much more interesting, and a much more inspiring testament to faith and fate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every bit the classic it is made out to be. I am not a fan of musicals, but this is great. The scenes flow into the music seamlessly and perfectly. Just about every song sticks pleasantly in your head. Plot is fairly basic, but good. Direction by Robert Wise is spot-on. Cinematography is spectacular. The Austrian mountainscapes are amazingly beautiful and provide the perfect backdrop.Performances by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are great. The kids are mostly unconvincing and overly sweet though.A movie everyone should watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Uplifting Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sound Of Music is a classic of the musical genre and is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. The plot concerns a young Austrian woman called Maria (Julie Andrews) who is studying to be a nun in a convent and is sent to be a governess of the Von Trapp family by the Mother Abbess who feels that Maria would be more happy if she left the convent. During her stay, the Von Trapp family's lives begin to change forever. The dialogue is brilliant as every sentence suits each character and really brings them to life making you identify with them. The musical numbers are well-written and are some of the catchiest I've ever heard in a musical with songs such as "Favourite Things" and "So Long, Farewell" staying in my head for days and a beautiful score along with it. I also have to point out the engaging cinematography of Robert Wise who provides us with magnificent views of landscapes of the hills and mountains which really is the icing on the cake. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend anyone who loves cinema to watch this movie.</fullReview>

I like Sixteen Going On Seventeen. This song is so cute and it is the best of songs in the movie. I watched this movie when I was a high school student at first time.

Christopher Plummer is beyond hateful and the whole shebang has these dreadful songs most of which Andrews sings as though presenting an elocution lesson. How it became the most watched and successful movie of its time is astonishing. Stories of numpties who have seen it 3,000,000 times at the cinema and love it more than life is really puzzling. I always wanted the Nazis to find them and incarcerate them somewhere dreadful and do terrible things to them because they were so sickeningly sweet.

		<shortDescription>Old Hollywood's swan song...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few panoramic shots on the Alps mountains (kudos to the helicopter pilot), a sound that feels like nature whispering to us, "beware, she's coming" and then she comes, breaking the majestic silence with a cheerful and joyful ode to music, turning like a dervish as to exhilarate the beauty the happiness inhabiting her heart. Julie Andrews is Maria Von Trapp, and because she's just so adorable and optimistic, I won't say anything about her. Now, to the film.It baffles me that Robert Wise's "The Sound of Music", out of all the musicals, is the one that was for five years, not one of the but THE most successful movie of all-time. "Singin' in the Rain" or Wise's more critically acclaimed "West Side Story" should have been given this honor, at least. But never mind these considerations; it is certain that the film is a classic and one of the most defining American movies. But one would be aware of it, if every classic or defining movie was enjoyable. "The Sound of Music" could be enjoyable, if it wasn't too much demanding in terms of patience. Three hours is just too long to take without feeling the need to listen to the sound of your TV, your microwave, your radio car or your bones.Some long musicals are exceptions though, but "West Side Story" was featuring extremely memorable songs and was about two rival gangs and a love story in the middle, there was conflict, passion, youth and blood. "The Sound of Music" is about a Nun apprentice who becomes a governess to the seven children of a rich widower, naturally, they don't go along first, but he starts to develop a liking when he sees children singing, then they marry, the Anshluss come and they must fleet Austria to Switzerland, all singing and dancing. It's just like a dramatic take on Mary Poppins with a realistic back-story, but does that make the film entertaining for all that? It could though with more efforts on the characterization.There are seven children, but none of them really tries to assert a personality, they actually form a one conglomerate character: the children (except for the older one), but there's no conflict, except for a few pranks that beg you to believe these kids, all as cute as buttons, were insufferable, it might as well try to convince you that Lassie is Cujo. Now, their father is so militarily strict and dour you know it's a matter of time before Julie Andrew' charming smile melts his iceberg façade. But as heart-warming as it is, the film has a unique power to leave me cold, and I guess it must be my fault. I just don't get the appeal, but why someone would decide to endure three hours of non-stop syrupy songs and kids acting like mechanical toys. Andrews is the only lively thing in the film, besides the Hills? if that's what she said.I know there's Plummer but he looked like someone trying so hard not to fart during a dinner and it was so distracting that I couldn't take him seriously. He should consider himself lucky to have Maria.. Anyway,, I saw the film, without actually seeing it, for the second time. I felt the need to check a few e-mails, I did it during the songs most of the time, I needed to do something. And yes, people went to see this film in all over the world and enjoyed it, I just saw someone complaining about the hatred on IMDb, stating that we live in a world that has became too cynical. I don't consider myself cynical, good sentiments are one thing, but there's a point where you can't take them without feeling bored. Besides, the film was panned by viewers at its release, many of whom had enjoyed previous musicals, so, I have an alibi.1965 wasn't perhaps the most appealing cinematic year, I can't even think of an acclaimed masterpiece ("Cat Ballou"? "Ship of Fools"?) so I guess there was room for a film like "The Sound of Music", the last agonizing sound of old-Hollywood before people would get tired of musicals, before the 'New Hollywood' era. Maybe it's because I'm such a sucker for this period that I can't enjoy all the likes of "My Fair Lady" or "Dr. Doolittle", but two years later, another film would begin with a song, not "The Sound of Music", but the sound of Silence, "The Graduate" paving the way to an era of creativity and originality.And I'd think silence over any music from "the sound of music".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sound of Music (1965)For all the liberties made to historical accuracy, I think it goes without saying, a movie is being made, and without certain poetic license, the bird of genius cannot fly, so leeway must be given... and in so doing here, a truly important and beautiful result is made. Captain Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) stone intensity as a disciplinarian who has forgotten how to love, who has lost his inner music after the death of his wife, is softened and freed through the inspiring lightness of Maria's (Julie Andrews) enchanting entrance into he and his seven children's life as the house's new Governess... While the leads balance each other, the sweetness of the music is equally balanced by the sobriety of the situation in which they find themselves, during the Nazi occupation of Austria. What intrigues me is that in the song "16 Going on 17" the young boy Rolf who appears to be in love with Leisl warns her of being seduced by men, but in the end it is he who is seduced, by the Nazis... and it is so often the case in life that while teaching others we grow cocky and forget that we too are still students, and capable of falling prey to our own folly... We also must understand though, even as the Von Trapp family escapes over the Alps to Freedom (the truth is they fled by train during the day to Italy), that those who helped them may not get off so lightly even though it is unshown in the film... the nuns who would obviously be recognized as having helped them by removing the car's carburetor, the man at the festival would likely be found complicit in helping them escape, and I mention them because it is impossible not to think of those who gave their lives to help so many escape the Nazis tyranny, and now it is our turn to help new refugees escape tyranny... the more that things change, the more they stay the same... I am an emotional person, and connecting emotionally with characters does help enjoyment, but also confirms bias and dilutes objectivity for sure... but ultimately, I believe The Sound of Music earns all five of its Oscars.The Amazon film ends with a one-hour behind the scenes look into the film and the Von Trapp family hosted by Julie Andrews. A perfect way to end the film.And like Maria, like Julie Andrews, my life is truly eased through singing my music, so perhaps as a singer, as a Jew, I relate quite intimately with the story.And it is true as is sung in the movie, and I leave you with that idea now... "My heart will be blessed with the sound of music. And I'll sing once more."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning of the movie shows beautiful scenery of lakes, hills and greenery, which creates a sense of peace and tranquility. The panoramic views of mountains and hills are done on purpose for the author to set a scene. The blues lead to feelings of tranquility and peace, whilst the greens give an enriching feeling of life. The opening scenes create such beauty, and the styles of houses that are shown clearly dictate the wealth of the area. This is quite a contrast to the modest girl, singing with such an angelic voice, whose clothing does not show wealth, but modesty and simplicity. She is on her own in these beautiful hills, leading the viewers to believe she may want to escape and that she may be a solitary person...this movie is an absolute must to watch, rich with history, emotion and social privilege.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the movie that made me a critic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, when I was a child I thought certain truths were immutable... in the passing of time I found that almost none were. One of these truths that bit the bullet rather early in life was that all movies were good movies. Especially those films that everybody simply loved. At nine years old, I was taken by my parents to see "The Sound of Music"... I wasn't crazy about it... but I figured I probably just didn't get it. When it was rereleased a few years later and I was 12 or so... I went to see it again with school. At that point I realized that the movie was just not that good! I couldn't wait to leave the theatre, I was bored to tears. I came to the conclusion that day that I was just never meant to be one of the "masses"... sheeple who have no real opinion of their own. So for that I am forever indebted to this film. I also must caution men not to read any women's reviews of this movie as something about it causes their brains to go completely dead. How else can one explain anyone wanting to see someone fall in love with Christopher Plummer's character? Not masculine in any way (except that he has fathered a number of children) I feel he has caused more women to enter into disfunctional relationships and lead lonely lives in search of an unattainable male (gay?)than any other character in film history. p.s. I have since, in the last few years attempted the Sound of Music again and now find it absolutely unwatchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea how I have gone 27 years without seeing The Sound of Music, yet simultaneously knew all the songs featured. I'm also glad that I know the origin of the popular internet meme of Julie Andrews dancing in a field; I enjoy knowing where things come from! This Rodgers and Hammerstein's collaboration directed by Robert Wise starring Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer has remained a classic long after its 1965 release. The film's message is clear and relatable; love will always exist, and only you can live your life. A pure tale told with exceptional acting and eye-catching cinematography; it is no wonder that The Sound of Music took home Oscar's top prize for Best Picture for 1965.In the middle of the 1930's Austria, Maria (Julie Andrews) is trying desperately to become a nun. When a letter is sent to the convent that a Captain in the Navy needs a governess to tend to his 7 rambunctious children, Maria is awarded the task. After getting initiated into the home with a frog in the pocket, and a pine cone in her chair, Maria understands that she has her work cut out for her caring for Captain Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) gaggle of children. Since his wife's death, Captain, as he wishes to be called, has run his home as tight as the ships he commands. After successfully warding off each of the previous governess's, Maria is thrown a bone by the youngest Von Trapp child who declares that she likes Maria immediately after her arrival. Maria's kind and joyful disposition brings happiness back to the bleak Von Trapp household. Maria's presence also gains the attention of the Captain, who is engaged to be married to a wealthy baroness. As the feelings grow between Maria and the Captain, the two begin to question the choices they have made in their lives and begin to accept the lives they were born to live.Opening with overhead shots of vast mountains, eternal sky, and majestic seas, it is more than worth mentioning that the cinematography in this film is beyond compare. There were amazing shots all throughout the film, culminating in a great shot of Maria and Captain professing their love for each other. The chemistry between Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews was convincing and endearing. They worked so well together on-screen that I teared up upon their reunion at the Von Trapp house. Chemistry had to be believable seeing as Maria was convincing Captain that he needed to foster relationships with his children when he believed the only relationship that needed to exist there was a dictatorial one. Christopher Plummer's progression to rigid authoritarian to affectionate music-playing dad was incredibly well-acted. I would recommend this film, really, to anyone. Even if you aren't a fan of love stories or musicals, I believe, you will enjoy this film. The message of the film is one that persists, and can resonate with any viewer; "You have to live the life you were born to live.".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of a classic status</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is indeed worthy to be called a classic. Yet it's in fact very much thanking the songs that are sung within it. The story feels flat and uninteresting for the first part, and predictable for the second part. Yet this is probably due to me watching this movie in 2015, fifty years after its original release, when everything had already developed, rendering the story within it to be quite obsolete. Thus when I imagine the conditions of the time when this movie was released, then this movie would've scored very high in terms of story background, development and flow. The thing is this movie has at least two of the most memorable songs in history; the very first song and the one about the musical notes (I didn't bother googling their titles). The acting overall feels flat for the standard of nowadays, but then again it must've been good at the time when it was released. Julie Andrews did quite well in maintaining her role's character. Christopher Plummer did also well in keeping the character's strictness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>unlike most of movies addicts, I didn't grow up with the melody of the sound of music around me. In fact, I watch it pretty recently because of it overwhelm reputation. once my eyes dropped on the movie the first impression was a very relaxing sensation and joyful adrenaline ran through my veins, especially with it's first amazing shout screenplay, and Marie singing "the mountain are alive" which to be honest reminded me instantaneously of Moulin Rouge which a very dear movie for me too. Stepping out of the first impression, It would be banal if I would spend lines describing the perfection of the Director, writers, and the composer of the music.instead I prefer to put down my one point of view right away. and as a modern movie watcher, I would say that Sound of music is an impressive classical American movie. and I totally agree with the Oscar not choosing the actors for the prize, because I think the movie had a some sort of deficiency on this specific aspect, the character were definitively well composed but we might figured that they would apply much better to a theatrical performance, of course I'm not saying that out of lack of classical movies interest, because i don't think that anyone can compare the characters of the sound of music with the ones in "a streetcar named desire" or "Casablanca" or "vertigo". that would be the only thing that sort of annoyed me in this movie. After all, the sound of music is a musical, and indeed a successful one, it's a cultural element that whole families grew up with, especially because the movie is very popular among kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the heart warming story of an Austrian nun (Julie Andrews) who enters the Von Trapp family as the governess of Georg Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) seven mischievous yet adorable children, and ends up entering their hearts with her warm personality and sugar coated music. At the risk of sounding cheesy, 'The Sound of Music' is regarded as one of the most loved cinematic treats of all times. Full of now- popular songs and laced with extravagant background score, the film has its own soul.The beautiful cinematography takes you to a trip of the magnificent land of Austria during the time of the Second World War. The hummable songs include the all time favorites like 'the Lonely Goatherd', 'So long, farewell' and many more. No matter how stone hearted you are, you get emotionally attached to the adorable children of the Von Trapp family.For more reviews visit: 'rohit mehta reviews. blogspot. com'Though, a few points cannot be overlooked. Julie Andrews' portrayal of Maria, the carefree and loving nun, comes out to be more artificial and over-the-top than realistic. Based on the hit musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein II on the memoirs of Maria Von Trapp, the film is naive in characterization as almost all the characters displayed are one dimensional. The only character balancing the cheese being oozed by almost everyone is Christopher Plummer's Cpt. Georg Von Trapp.All throughout the film, Plummer seems detached from the surroundings which helps his character. No matter how popular, hummable or adorable the songs are; some of them just catch you defenseless. Unlike the hit musicals like 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'The Wizard of Oz', some of the famous songs in the film are out of context at times. It is always hard to explain in a musical why a song is relevant, but some of the inappropriate situations for the songs make them just unacceptable. The children singing in the festival or in a party sounds reasonable, but a senior mother of the church singing valuable lessons of life to her confused nun, is just too unrealistic for me to stomach.Some other characters like The Baroness and the postman have sudden change of values at the appropriate points in the film. There is a 70% chance that you will like this highly entertaining and lovable family film. But if you are a fan of more realistic and easy to digest stories, even if it is about a computer program controlling the world, this is not your cup of tea. For a musical enthusiast too, this is not one of the best musicals you'll see.</fullReview>

Oh, the film starts out strong, on one of the biggest shots in movies, and it has some beautiful camera work to go along with some nice if somewhat simplistic songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But if Julie Andrews' other best-known musical, from 1964, involved a spoonful of sugar, this 1965 release feels more like a truckful of treacle, especially in the second half when the story gets ropier, the songs dodgier, and the acting too staged by half.Except for her singing where she shines, Andrews gives a distressingly one-note performance as a postulant nun, Maria, sent on sabbatical to look after the seven rambunctious children of a stern naval captain in Salzburg, Austria. In time, a remarkably condensed time, she has converted the children into a happy singing group and Captain von Trapp into a sappy velveteen Romeo. But will they find freedom as one big happy family, or else be crushed by the Nazi jackboot?I guess that's supposed to be the drama in this piece, but it's pushed together so haphazardly and drawn out so over the course of three hours that it never feels the least real, with or without the fruity singing. Maria sings about bluebirds and sleigh bells and whiskers on kittens, the kids perform ornate puppet shows and sing their way to bed before a party of admiring guests, and even Capt. von Trapp joins in, singing "Edelweiss" to an audience of Nazis so solemnly he puts them all to sleep so his family can escape.Even Ernest Lehman, who wrote the screenplays for "North By Northwest" and "Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?", pushes the trite meter past 11. The boys and girls all cry in unison when Maria guilts them over a frog trick or hide under her covers when thunder cracks overhead. I guess Lehman figured with a score that has them singing "So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodnight...I flit/I float/I fleetly flee and flyyyy..." these kids were on something stronger than schnitzel and noodles. The poor captain might have noticed this, except he's played by Christopher Plummer in such a tight-mouthed fog much of the time, you wonder if he's not hitting that wine cellar of his a bit too much.There are good numbers, namely the opening one with Andrews performing the title song on a mountain top in a nicely low-key hands-in-pockets way, and the best song in the score which follows that, "How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?" well-staged in an abbey courtyard as a dialogue amongst several nuns. One, Sister Sophia, brings an Audrey Hepburn-like quality to her singing. With director Robert Wise's steady hand and cinematographer Ted McCord's nice attention to the stained-glass and groined-ceiling decor, the sequence really sticks with you and is enjoyable to see over again.But Wise makes some odd decisions with other numbers that follow, especially the icky "Edelweiss" and "16 Going On 17," a nice song undone by campy staging. "Climb Ev'ry Mountain," a showstopper on stage, is performed by the Mother Abbess with a terribly trilly overdub and in such dark shadow you'd think she was a mob informant for the FBI. Actually, Wise says in his director's commentary that he was put off by the bombastic way he felt the song came off on stage, but his solution only makes things worse.Finally, the movie needed to end with the wedding, which while saccharine, is at least a pretty high note in keeping with what came before. The Nazi chase that follows is just silly, an attempt to add some movie drama that comes off as sour bubble gum.Two things to say in this movie's favor. One is lots and lots of people don't agree with me and have made "The Sound Of Music" a cultural touchstone. The other is the 40th anniversary of the film's release came with a DVD that is a very nice and generous package, chockful of generous add-ons like candid commentaries from Andrews and Wise, a delightful reminiscence by the now-grown actors who played the kids, and even a karaoke feature for those deluded souls who not only enjoy the movie, but sing along to it. If you like the movie, even a little, you probably owe it to yourself to get this DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best ever musical about an Austrian folk singing nun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A spirited nun leaves her convent and becomes a governess in pre-war Austria. Here she teaches the six children about love, life and music against the growing threat of Nazism.Your fingers hesitate on the keyboard before making comment on a film that is more a phenomena than a stretch of celluloid. This wasn't just a smash hit in the normal western markets - it also went huge everywhere and has stayed huge. The whole Indian film industry is descended from the template set down here.While this was a well regarded stage musical, this wasn't seen as a natural box office smash (a musical based on the life of a nun!) and was probably thrown to Robert Wise (more an action - than a music - man) because he was known for being able to operate well on a budget (all those B pics!)It was just as well, production was hellish: They had forgotten (didn't know?) how moody the European weather could be (even in Summer) and the genuine Austrian period folk songs didn't shine (new ones were quickly written); and beyond that many of the children had no real film acting experience.The success of the film is nothing but a bag of paradoxes, the must striking being that is was old fashioned even when it was released. Beat based pop music was dominating the sales charts and the sixties were beginning to swing. Hem lines were going up hair lines were going down and James Bond had already introduced casual sex and violence to the screen.This may have been made in 1965 - but it could easily have been made 20 years earlier and is the (off-screen) product of people that probably were coming to the end of their best creative period. Oscar and Hammerstein had already penned most of their famous musicals and must have been amazed that they struck their largest gold reserve so late in the day.As Noel Coward once observed, the one thing that critics overlook is that the public are looking for simple minded entertainment, not messages or meaning. And this is both simple minded and entertaining (if you can live with heavy schmaltz). There are certainly no messages, unless you need to be told that love and music are good and Nazi take-overs are bad!The songs don't so much act as light relief, but provide the film with a life support machine. As drama the whole thing can't get out of second gear - even the Nazi threat doesn't raise the drama level beyond village theatre. I also guess we are supposed to know what these people really represent from other sources?Julie Andrews performance is massively underrated. Here is someone that has to sing, dance and act with children (sometimes all at the same time!) and yet makes it look easy, natural and spontaneous. When has, say, Robert De Niro ever done anything as technically difficult as this?In many ways SOM is bullet proof (can you imagine Mel Brooks/Jerry Zucker doing a spoof?) family entertainment. A plot everyone can follow, charming children, excellent score, pretty scenery, perfect lead and a happy ending - if not for the rest of war torn Europe!As a footnote. Twentieth Century Fox lost all the profits they made on this film on musical follow ups that included Hello Dolly, Star and Dr Dolittle - which makes clear that the whole thing was, indeed, just a giant happy accident and musicals were not what the audience secretly wanted all along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>400th review here.... and this movie still reeks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A better title for this stink would be 'The Sound of Farts'.Maria is a nun, but not for long after Mother Inferior sends her to a mansion in the country to help mind a pack of over-privileged brats. Everything's cool for awhile until the kids' father brings home a hot rich lady who tells Maria to beat it or else. Maria scampers back to the nunnery where Mother Inferior jerks her around by sending her right back to the country estate so she can find the true meaning of her feelings.... or something like that.This noisy chick flick made a lot of money at the box office, but it's really not that good. Most of the songs suck and it gets real tiresome waiting for the father and the nun to finally do each other.When the singing starts, fast forward so your dog won't howl in pain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sights &amp; Sounds of The Sound Of Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** This review may contain spoilers ***A few days ago I was thinking,"What BEst Picutre winner should I choose for a review?" Many to choose from of course The answer came to me Sunday,the day after Christmas 2010. NBC replayed this wonderful film and I watched it, since it had been a few years since seeing it.I recall on The Oprah Winfrey Show ,she had Julie Andrews,Christopher Plummer and all 7 of the,now grown,child actors who played the Von Trapp children. It was the first time they'd all been together in one place since 1965 and it was a very touching reunion. Growing up in the 1970s and 1980s,The Sound Of Music was on TV every year and when you're a kid,it usually is the first "Best Picture" Oscar winner that you ever see in your life. When you see it the first time,the moment you see Andrews in the hills and that sweeping camera shot,you know it's going to be something great.Like a lot kids,it was only natural I'd like songs like "Do-Re-Mi","My Favorite Things,"So Long,Farewell" and "The Lonely Goatherd"(or "The Yodeling Song" as some call it) and more. I liked "Edelweiss" and "Climb Every Mountain" when I was older. It was on every year in our house.Julie Andrews' singing voice is no longer of this caliber but it's great that we have her in this and "Mary Poppins" and other movies,where we can marvel at her vocal abilities back then. Plummer turns in a somewhat serious but enjoyable performance. Going from stern and inflexible,then back to the father the children knew when their mother was alive,fair and loving and (of course) singing. Every kid has their own memorable moments as well The family's togetherness and fun is disrupted by the infiltration of the wretched Nazi party. They know they have to escape their own country now or live under the rule of a cruel &amp; heartless dictatorship. That leads to the most exciting part of the movie. The clever departure after the concert,chase through the city and eventual escape over the mountains.The Sound Of Music,as we know,was a phenomenal success when it was released in March of 1965. It deservedly won for Best Picture and it's other categories. That success came about because it's simply a movie that the whole family and even those without families can enjoy. Which is why it's still so highly acclaimed even 45 years later.Lastly,because the people behind the scenes,as well as Andrews &amp; Plummer themselves,made sure the film had an equal balance of fun and that of the serious as well. A job and movie,well done! Ten stars,for all time.(END)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an awful movie... how do people watch this sellout trash?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has nothing going for it. Even Andrews cant save it. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are unlikable, and the music is generic and tedious. This is no Mary Poppins or My Fair Lady. It is a cheap and lazy rip off written over a couple of bathroom breaks for the sake of capitalizing on musicals that were popularized by the former mentioned titles which came out a year prior.On top of the benign writing and non-existent character development, some scenes were a laugh. The love interest between the eldest daughter and the 17 year old twit made my stomach turn, never mind the father who is basically a partially retarded copy of Mr. Banks from Mary Poppins. There is nothing original in this film. Its not even historically accurate, not that this was a consideration in my review. But how this came to become so popular is a travesty. The music was especially bad, and mind numbing when listened to. I'd rather listen to modern rap than the soundtrack to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corn never gets any better than this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some critics have labelled it corn, but if it is, you'll never find a better variety. What more can you want? A beautiful cast, pleasant music, and fabulous scenery in the Austrian alps. Oh, sure, the camera is mostly very static, not much better than the Italian 1913 version of THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII. Perhaps the Todd AO process camera was unwieldy,or perhaps the director just liked it that way. As for Julie Andrews, what other actress can all at the same time project vulnerability, strength, and emotional fire? There cannot be too many such. Eleanor Parker has a thankless role as a possible wife for the von Trapp paterfamilias, but we know from the start that she hasn't a prayer up against Maria, the postulant sent out from a nearby convent as governess for the von Trapp family seven kids. Just the same, Eleanor displays her usual talent and is an ornament to the film. At the end, as the family flees the Nazi anschluss into Austria, we finally get some action and a little camera movement, with tracking shots. Whatever cavils one may rake up, this is Julie Andrews' film, no question.</fullReview>

I finally watched the film on video and found that what they show every year on television is not the real movie! Significant scenes have been cut and significant lines of dialog have been removed from many scenes that they did include. At least three of these cuts actually changed the plot of the movie. I think the original makes MUCH more sense and is really a good movie. Don't waste your time with the tv version anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's STILL "The Happiest Sound in All the World!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is about as classic as it gets when it comes to movie-musicals. Sound of Music is absolutely an "American classic". Julie Andrews is great, and the rest of the von Trapps are just so good. The songs--just like the trailers said they were: Immortal. Especially "My Favorite Things". I still have yet to see it on the big screen or on stage. The cinematography on here, especially the scenic views, are just AMAZING. So sad that it didn't get an Oscar for that.The fact that this is STILL the most successful movie-musical ever out ($163 million worldwide, and it replaced Gone with the Wind as the biggest-grossing movie of all time) really says something about it. "Dreamgirls" came pretty close, though. Sound of Music is EVEN the 3rd biggest moneymaker of all time adjusted for inflation (according to Wikipedia)!Not much to say about the way Robert Wise directed it, and he got a much-deserved Oscar for the direction and Best Picture of the Year.I don't really understand why it was such a GIANT hit with audiences (literally) and the critics hated it. They panned the songs on here big-time callin' them "sick" and "goody-goody". Anyway, it's a classic, and it's just a great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pollyanna Personified</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most beloved films of all time, "The Sound Of Music" conveys optimism and beauty, much needed in a real world that too often sinks into pessimism and ugliness. It is this underlying theme, the heart and soul of the film, that explains its enduring popularity. And rightly so.That theme is attractively wrapped in a cinematic package consisting of, among other things, topnotch direction, cinematography, editing, and dialogue. The bow on top is the music, which exudes enough inspiration to warm the coldest of cold, cold hearts. It's as if "Edelweiss", "Climb Every Mountain", and "The Sound Of Music" were written to be hymns for the next thousand years.These towering cinematic achievements make the film a classic among classics, in the abstract. But, in practical terms, they do not offset the film's downside which, for me, keeps the film at arms length."The Sound Of Music" is sugary. The sappy story has "cute" Julie Andrews playing a Miss-Goody-Two-Shoes character preoccupied in some euphoric fantasy, oblivious to reality. Maria (who curiously has no last name) thus seems as lost on her side of the rainbow as Oz's Dorothy is on her side.And so, my thoughts and feelings are ambivalent. I admire the film for its uplifting theme and for its technical quality. But it is not a film that I would watch often for fear that I might choke on all that sugar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's a really happy-to-watch musical. The songs are timeless classics. The children are regular charmers. Julie Andrews has the comic element and Plummer has the enchanting eyes. Some events may be too good to be true, but it really makes one very happy when watching it, not that it's silly or slapstick, but that it's very simple and finds its way to the child in your heart.There are biblical and historical backgrounds too, though not the primary elements in the film, which may be why people see it as a weak storyline. I feel that it could have been better if the political details were introduced right in the first place, not until the very last part. However that would have made the film somewhat heavy at first. If the German troops marched into the opening, I guess I wouldn't have stayed to watch it when I was a child.The Sound of Music is a timeless classic for the whole family. Learn the songs and sing to brighten your day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sound of Music has been, and probably always will be, one of my favorite films. While the historical discrepancies throughout the film are noticeable, and it does not correctly portray aspects of Austria during the time - that cannot be held accountable in the movie, because that is in fact what it is. A fictional movie based off of a Broadway musical. One cannot help but love the amiable and family-oriented film. Julie Andrews has a wonderful voice, and portrays the role of Maria as the optimistic nun who become nanny and then mother to the Von Trapp family well. Plummer, is not particularly my favorite character but he also portrays the captain in a decent manner.Wise is a experienced director and his experience is seen through the popularity and wonderful clips and action of the film. The songs of the movie are playful and fun to sing along with, and easily get stuck in your head. Overall I like the film and would definitely consider it well deserving of all is Awards and nominations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie made in a time when directors like Robert Wise who knew how to craft a musical were still around. Suffers terribly when viewed on a small screen since the brilliant cinematography is such an integral factor of the movie. Get the newer THX widescreen video version and you will see a glimpse of what the film would be like on a big screen. The movie still holds up well to nineties standards but may be a little sugary for hardened modern moviegoers, used to a diet of violence and profanity. Wise manages to make Julie Andrews look both virginal and alluring at the same time, which is essential for the plot to work. It is hard to imagine the movie with any other actress than Andrews playing Maria's part. Some may criticize Roger and Hammerstein as not being in the same league as other noted movie composers, but here the combination of composers/director/actors all comes together in a way seldom matched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tuneful Score; Honest Emotions; Great Fun and a Flawless Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Sound of Music" is set in the mountainous hills and the city of Salzburg, Austria. There is to my eye at least, something about its spacious alpine countryside which dominates and informs the entire production. The air, the light, the music, the styles of dress, the activities--everything is "elevated", with hardly anything being sea-level about it. And the film has a very good "engagement sequence" at the opening, when we learn about the central ethical character and experience her leaving the abbey where she has served along with her, and begin to care about her purposes. The story-line is simple and relatively direct: A young nun, unsuited to the profession, takes a job as a governess to the children of a difficult client--a captain in the Austrian navy who runs the household like a ship's company of sailors, complete with a bosun's whistle and a lineup of the children in matching uniforms. The body of the piece is then concerned with Maria, the governess, subverting the household and winning over the Captain until he gives up his present lady friend, a Baroness; then when Maria, who has been falling in love with him, goes away and comes back, he has to tell her he is in love with her also. They marry, to the children's delight in a great ceremony in a rebuilt replica of Salzburg's cathedral; but a Nazi Parrty official has words with the Captain. The family, against the Captain's former feeling, then enters the Sazlburg musical festival as the Von Trapp Family singers, something he had earlier opposed; and, winning the contest, they flee and are helped at her old abbey by Maria's Prioress and her friends there. The nuns sabotage the Nazis' cars by stealing parts, and Captain Von Trapp leads his family up over the mountain pass to freedom as the film ends. This happy film is filled with tuneful songs ranging from the ultra-simple "Eidelweiss" ballad to "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria" , "Do Re Mi", "My Favorite Things", "The Sound of Music", "I Have Confidence", "The Lonely Goatherd", "Something Good", "Sixteen Going on Seventeen" and the voice-challenging "Climb Every Mountain". Robert Wise directed this complex film, which features many sorts of scenes. Everything to me looks clean, bright and, frequently, even Austrian. Ernerst Lehman wrote the screenplay from the Broadway "book" by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse that borrowed its fictionalized biography from Maria Augusta Trapp's autobiographical work; Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II supplied the music and lyrics. Ted McCord provided lucid cinematography, with the production being designed by Boris Leven. Ruby R. Leavitt and Walter M. Scott did the complex set decorations while famous Dorothy Jeakins created the many vivid costumes. In the large cast, Julie Andrews was a charming Maria, though she was not particularly Austrian. Christopher Plummer had some very good moments as the Captain, Eleanor Parker played the Baroness with great skill and Richard Haydn was the Captain's impresario friend, Max. Ben Wright was the Nazu gauleiter, Peggy Wood the Mother Superior, and among the nuns were Anna Lee, voice-dubbing soprano Marni Nixon, Evadne Baker and Portia Nelson., In the cast also were Daniel Truhitte, Norma Varden, Gilchrist Stuart as Franz the butler, with the children Charmian Carr, Nicholas Hammond, Angela Cartwright, Heather Menzies, Duane Chase, Debbie Turner, and Kym Karath. It is a bit difficult for me as a writer to account for the highly-positive qualities of the film, since in my judgment they exceed the sum of the film's parts. The characters and relationships seem real to the viewer, I suggest, because we discover them along with Maria; her personal dilemmas are interesting, and the use of the Nazi Anschluss as a threat, a problem for the Captain, and a dark cloud hanging over the sunlit lives of the folk in the film works very well. The contrast for instance between the nuns' early disagreement over Maria's character and their helping to thwart the Nazis pursuing the family at the film's climax becomes a highly-symbolic movement; and like the growing love between Maria and the Captain and the children's being won over by their new governess, because the movement again is allowed to develop by slow stages, the satire-level comedy with its touch of drama works powerfully on an audience. There is much to be admired in the simplicity and the beautiful imagery of this film; if it is not an artistic masterpiece, it is frequently absorbing, moving and unaffected all at the same time.</fullReview>

Like in Mary Poppins, Julie Andrews stars as a nanny who comes to look after naughty children and heps them bring music into their lives. She eventually falls for their father. Together, they make the Von Trapp family singers.It's not my favourite film, but it's good.

I really like the dance where Liesl &amp; Rolf are in the gazebo during the rainfall, singing "Sixteen Going On Seventeen".

		<shortDescription>An innocence that is lost in the present day world...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that there are actually very negative reviews of this movie shows that this world is really too far gone..."Classic" cannot even begin to describe something this magical. The simple fact that most people can remember it coming on television only once or twice a year throughout most of the 70's and 80's only served to make it that much more treasured. I'm sure like many others, it was a family event to sit down and watch this film on those occasions on a Sunday afternoon - those were the days... Guess I'm biased having loved the movie since early childhood, but how anyone can hate it is BEYOND me. You truly must have a heart of solid rock not to be effected by the gut-wrenching storyline, timeless music, and breathtaking cinematography. A real masterpiece.Yet for some strange reason, it has escaped most movie reviewers top ten lists - why? I guess some dont want to "admit" to liking it because it's a musical...oh well. You could do far worse for a guilty pleasure. But No.55 on AFI's top 100 list? - What's up with that? Films like this should be required viewing for Generations X through Z, if you enjoyed it as others have, pass it on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A one-off that can never happen again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many things came together in this film whether by fate or intent, that it transcends now even its own legend. It is the ultimate feel-good movie with at its core, decency, beauty, youth, dignity, happiness, femininity, love, unshakeable family values and a childlike quality wherein there is no place for corruption or evil. Its complete moral integrity brings tears to so many people realising where we are all going so wrong!THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a reaffirmation of all the goodness which exists inside the human condition. The perfect family, perfect father, perfect children and in an impossibly idyllic setting (well putting aside the NAZIS who were never a chance anyway) Like Peter Pan, they can never grow up, Liesl is every father's most beautiful young daughter on the threshhold of adulthood and to whom romance is that most magical of experiences. Even today, and probably because I have beautiful daughters about her age, her radiance and innocence brings tears to my eyes. If only they could stay forever as Liesl has!Another reason for the film's staggering universal appeal is that it remains the ONLY musical that offered such simple, but enduring and well loved songs. There isn't a loser amongst them! Kindly name another film that can make this claim? If every film in the world was by necessity destroyed, leaving only one, I would hope it would be THE SOUND OF MUSIC. A reminder to future generations of the potential for beauty that we all have, but rarely acknowledge, inside of us!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Totally glamorous and nothing lower for another Roger and Hammerstein musical. The Sound of Music is no exception. Everyone should get a chance to see this film.Julie Andrews clearly has the best voice of anyone in this show. It's hard not to sing along with "Sound of Music," "My Favorite Things," "Do-Re-Mi," "I Have Confidence," "Maria," "Lonely Goatherd," "Sixteen Going on Seventeen," and "So Long Farewell." The plot is based on the real life conflict of the Von Tropp family of Austria. They refused to let the German Nazis control their lives.The movie backgrounds were actually shot in Austria as well as the Von Tropp family's home. The striking views of the fields and mountains will actually make your heart sing with the sound of music. If I could give it a rating of 11 out of 10 I would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Increases in relevance with passing years...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...due to the way the songs are framed. This, I formerly thought, was the last musical of its kind (post-1920's Hollywood standard) but later realized it's a transitional point in the change from past standards to a more stark and spare approach, be it the stylized method of "Yentl" to the MTV-oid manner of the di Caprio Romeo/Juliet redo. In "Sound Of Music", the story is a frame for the songs in higher relief than previous film, but in lesser relief than in Streisand's work, where the character lines meld with the songs. The film, of course, has value above technique, showing an earlier, less crass approach to dating than today's, and in a modern, accessible language. It manages as well to note the potential terrors of wars past, along with the almost nineteenth-century lack of moroseness and pessimism that probably explains Europe's survival through that period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless musical is a sheer joy...a Julie Andrews triumph!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not even the overwhelmingly gorgeous scenery of the Alps can dwarf Julie Andrews' contribution to 'The Sound of Music'. She outshines the scenery and delivers what is probably the best performance by an actress in a screen musical--ever!! This fact is made even more impressive by the fact that the role was originally played on Broadway by Mary Martin--no slouch herself when it comes to musical stardom.Fortunately, under Robert Wise's magnificent direction, she is surrounded by top talent, all shown to great advantage in highly suitable roles. Richard Haydn as the Von Trapp manager almost steals every scene he's in; Christopher Plummer does a sly job as the tough as nails patriarch whose heart is melted by the charming governess; and Eleanor Parker does a magnificent job as the Countess, who, during one of the children's spontaneous home concerts, observes wryly: "Why didn't you tell me to bring my harmonica?"And the children, of course, are all scene stealers. The final concert is staged for dramatic effect and pushes the movie toward its suspense-filled climax before the successful exit over the Alps. All of the numbers, in fact, are brilliantly staged--whether indoors or outdoors--and the movie spins along at a fast and merry clip.Sugar-coated? Sure. But given all the plus factors--including that brilliant Rodgers and Hammerstein score--how can anyone complain? A film of undeniable charm and beauty--visually and vocally--a treat for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Personal Recollection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The winter of 1967 I was 9 years old. My 4th grade teacher, Mrs. Newby packed up our class and headed to San Francisco to see a movie: The Sound of Music. We drove through the hippies and the sleazy theaters of North Beach 'til we came to the movie house where the S.O.M. was still in its initial release. I sat next to my teacher.(I was her pet I guess).The lights dimmed, the overture started and then the most beautiful girl I had seen started singing. I sat in my seat transfixed by the show. Here was something rare and special. Music and words and kids my age on screen. Magic happened that day to me. I didn't know what a Nazi was, nor where Austria was but it was important to my teacher that I learn. Mrs. Newby sat silent during the film until the last reel. She wept as the von Trapps crossed into freedom. I didn't know what that was either. I do now. When the Iron Curtain fell in Europe my teacher was on the other side. Like Maria she and her family escaped East Germany to come to the west. Perhaps as Matlin says this is a bit of corn...but not for me, not for my teacher, and certainly not for those who never made it out. This was the LAST great musical made. It was made entertaining and suffers from closer examination of historical truths, but it is AN IMPORTANT FILM. You do not have to be a victim of the Holocaust or escape from a totalitarian state to appreciate why. I could go on but others have said what I would have. I easily give it 10 for 10. Only Casablanca and Citizen Kane rank higher on MY all time list. See this film and show it to your children...and their children. Charles</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catholic girls love it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The nuns took us fifth graders on a long bus ride into downtown D.C. to see this film when it first came out. The movie was so popular it stayed at that theater (The Ontario) for at least a year, so they took us again as sixth graders. While other posters on this site have complained about a lack of conflict until the Nazis show up, we Catholic girls completely understood the conflict in wanting to be a nun, but not passing muster. So the first minutes of the film, where we discover as she almost forgets to pick up her veil from the mountaintop that she is a nun and is late for chapel, we Catholic girls were entranced. I think I paid to see this movie 30 times before it came out on videotape and I immediately bought it. My kids were raised on it, watched it a dozen times, and we used the songs as lullabies. I'm pretty sated on it now, and a few things I find irritating, like the obviously pasted on wig the baroness wore and the silhouetted kissing scene between the captain and Maria that makes their mouths look like trumpets. And some of the incredibly bad acting by the children who appropriately ended up as real estate agents and small business owners. Nonetheless, it's an experience all people should have. It is a fine musical. I'd watch it again any day over the Rocky Horror Picture Show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The MOTHER of all musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The musical by which ALL others are judged. This tale is set on the eve of WW 2 and is the tale of the VON TRAPP family singers and their flight from the regime of ADOLF HITLER. What can i say, i like this movie. I like good Musicals. Julie Andrews is very attractive in this film which made her a superstar, and was a tough act to upstage. The music by the standards of later musicals was hard to follow (except for era pieces like GREASE and SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER). This musical was not all singing but substance as well. The strength of the film is something for everyone...a love story ala "the opposites attract storyline", political intrigue, danger and narrow escape from the gestapo and the songs and the happier moments in the movie. This film also marks the talents of CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER, who could handle the musical format well. Of note is the best selling soundtrack by RODGES and HAMMERSTEIN. My mom has an original LP from that printing. The film was made in a era that is different from the hollywood of today, back when film was still a craft..it is still today but more so back then. Movies weren't cranked out like MCDONALDS cheese burgers as often as they are today....or were they???? First rate family film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sound Of Music has aged fairly well. Yes, the story is corny and the movie has to be one of the most sentimental of all but it has the truly magnificent songs of Rogers and Hammerstein to compensate. The photography is truly breathtaking at times with superb production values throughout. This and Doctor Zhivago were my favourite films when I was growing up in the sixties and I have seen it countless times.Eventually I grew up and became into adult movies like The Godfather etc. but The Sound of Music brings back many pleasant memories. It was a world of colour and adventure. Sheer escapism for a kid growing-up in rainy industrial Scotland. One thing I know for sure is that Julie Andrews, while not quite a babe,was certainly far too good-looking to be a nun.Also the fact that the hills were alive with the sound of music remains equally valid in our own present times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one film that everyone should see. It's a colorful musical, a beautiful love story, and, above all, a testimony in support of standing up for your convictions and to the ability of music to move the soul and change lives. Julie Andrews is at her best, both as an actress and a singer. To think that if she had gotten the lead in My Fair Lady, like she deserved, she probably would have never played Maria! Christopher Plummer is wonderful as the stern, but big-hearted Captain von Trapp. There's no one I love to hate more than Eleanor Parker's scheming, snobbish Baroness. Plus, the talent of Mother Abbess and all the children never fail to amaze me: "Climb Every Mountain" gives me goose bumps and I always love watching the children perform "Do-re-mi". Finally, the two main Sisters and their "sin" brings a clever touch of humor to a serious scene. All in all, this film has rightly become a cherished part of American cinema. A true feel-good movie that no household should be without.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Surprising--Every Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most people my age (late twenties), I grew up watching this film year after year on television. As I grew older, however, I became increasingly reluctant to see it again, since I always seemed to remember it as sentimental and sickenly sweet. I suppose I was swayed by public opinion. Every time I knuckle down and actually see this movie again, however, I am struck by how honest and *truly* sweet it is--there is nothing sickening or overly sentimental about it (aside from the dreadful "Sixteen Going On Seventeen", which I always fast-forward through on the tape).The acting is wonderful. Julie Andrews actually seems to allow the audience to read her mind several times during the film, such as in the delightful "Edelweiss" scene. Christopher Plummer is also very good as a man who is extremely confident in his old love (for his country) while at the same time being insecure in his growing new one (for Maria). The children are genuine and endearing without being cutesy, and the serious plot turn, involving the escape from the Nazis, is handled very well. Yes, I know this is not how it happened in real life, but it does play well on screen. Most (if not all) "true story" movies take dramatic liberties, and as long as the viewer realizes this fact, everything is fine.In conclusion, my advice to anyone who hasn't seen this movie in a while is to see it again (on video, not TV--the network cuts too much out) and realize how genuine and non-syrupy it actually is. It is well-filmed, well-acted, and it contains some of the best music Rodgers and Hammerstein ever wrote (although I will admit I'm not too fond of Rodgers's addition, "Something Good"). It also contains, as far as I have seen, the very best film performance of one of the greatest singer-actresses of all time, Julie Andrews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The once and future ultimate feel-good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading some of my fellow correspondents' comments on what a musical sugar plum "The Sound of Music" was and what inferior songwriting talents Rodgers and Hammerstein were. And my reply is simple: C'mon, nay-sayers! Whistle me, without having to think about it, any three Andrew Lloyd Weber or Stephen Sondheim songs. Ha! I thought you couldn't!It's true that, as musicians, Rodgers and Hammerstein may not have been in the same league with Gershwin, Berlin, or Bernstein. But none of those worthies had the consistent knack for honest sentiment that Rodgers and Hammerstein did. That's why all of their shows, including "Sound of Music," remain constantly popular and constantly revived, by both professional and non-professional groups. And that's especially why the movie version of their last show together, "The Sound of Music" remains a favorite of so many people after so many years, including yours truly.Because this is where all the elements come together. Gentle humor, love, honest sentiment, hope in the face of adversity. They're all here, and then some. And that marvelous cast is what made these qualities come alive. Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Peggy Wood, Eleanor Parker, and Richard Haydn were never better then they are here. And the actors playing the children were natural, effortless charmers, one and all. Add to this the beautiful on-location photography in Austria, Robert Wise's dead-on direction, and Ted McCord's beautiful camera work. I ask you: How could anyone NOT like this movie?!?!?Take that, nay-sayers!</fullReview>

One of the reasons I watch this movie again and again is because I simply adore seeing the love between Maria and Captain Von Trapp unfold. From the stern, cold way he addresses her in the beginning to his deep sincerity when he tells Maria that he loves her, the whole development is nothing short of magical. The children are all wonderful, considering (and I checked up on this!) that each of them were really about 3-5 years older than the ages they portrayed! Since I've seen the movie so many times, I've noticed a few picky little editing mistakes, but that hardly matters considering the great feeling one experiences while watching this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sound of Music is a favorite childhood movie, teenage movie, young adult movie, and adult movie. It was basically my reference for love throughout my life. It's how I made sure I was in love at 23 and then thereafter, was the beginning of a huge database of potential love songs that I made up for me and my new-found love ever after life. I learnt at the young age of 9 that love could be that exciting, I even learnt all the metaphors and became from there a young lady in waiting I should say except that I would have to consider it a shoulder but I can't. I feel that this movie is a good reference. One with all the details you would need t move on with life and love, one that you could reference later in case you were confused and then you can start all over again.</fullReview>

The Story is about a would be nun named Maria who is living in a convent with nuns(played by Julie Andrews) who becomes a governess,as the nuns wanted her to mind the Von Trapp family(led by Christopher Plummer who plays Captian Gaynor Von Trapp,who is a widowed father of 7 children). At first the Von Trapp children aren't too keen on Maria but once she teaches them how to sing and enjoy life they start to like her more including Captian Von Trapp himself. Of course the Capitan has to leave to Vienna (since the film is set in Austria)and Maria has to look after his children,but when the Capitan comes back he announces his engagement to the baroness(who in my opinion is a gold-digger). But when the Capitan later falls for Maria,things get complicated. So will the Captian change his mind on marrying the baroness and marry Maria instead and avoid the Nazzi's who are after the Von Trapp's.Bottom line I highly recommend this gem to everyone who loves musical's and let me say that this is way better than Into The Woods hands down. Also my favorite songs include The Sound Of Music,Do Ra Me,You are 16 going on 17,and that love ballad Maria and the Captian sing when they kiss for the first time as well as Climb Every Mountain.If you ever seen Vin Diesel's film The Pacifier they actually reference this movie which I thought was cool.Overall they just don't make movies like these anymore and if there was ever a remake of this movie to come out down the line I would love Lily James and Richard Madden to play Maria and Captian Von Trapp. I dunno why but I seen these guys in Cinderella and parts of the movie reminded me of that film. Also may I just add before I finish this review that Christopher Plummer was very handsome in this film.Thumbs up for The Sound Of Music.'The hills are alive,with the sound of music'.10/10 A+Lady Gaga also did a melody of this at the Oscars this year to celebrate the movie for being 50 years old(yes ladies and gentlemen this movie marked 50 years this year as the film came out in March 1965).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sound of Julie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sound of Music (1965): Dir: Robert Wise / Cast: Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker, Richard Haydn, Peggy Wood: Wondrous expression of peace within darkness. Set in 1938 with the Nazis closing in on Austria, the story centres on free spirited Maria whom the nuns fear doesn't quite fit in. She is sent to oversee the seven children of former Naval officer Captain von Trapp. He is a widow who uses strict military discipline on the children, who respond by rebelling against every nanny hired. Maria holds strong allowing her friendly patient demeanor to win the children over. Eventually von Trapp is also won over when he overhears her influence through his children singing a song she taught them. They are soon sought after to sing at an event that has Nazis in attendance. Wonderful music full of life and joy, flawed only by the underdeveloped personalities of the children. Robert Wise previously had musical success with West Side Story but goes beyond that here. As in Mary Poppins, Julie Andrews shines as a nanny but of a different nature here. Christopher Plummer as von Trapp learns the importance of family. Eleanor Parker plays a wealthy potential wife to von Trapp. Richard Haydn plays an uncle arranging a play, and Peggy Wood plays the head nun. Theme demonstrates the ability to prevail through harsh times when the sound of music conquers opposing factors. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For 50 years, the hills are still alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never saw this movie, when it first came out back in the mid- 60s but I know my mother has a VHS copy of the movie as its part of the "Family Feature" release. Did I watch it as a kid? No. I didn't bother to watch it, and wouldn't think if this was a good movie. Of course as I became a teenager, I saw that Vin Diesel movie "The Pacifier" from Disney as Diesel's character has to direct "The Sound of Music" play as he still keeping eyes out on the children. Also, I didn't know that "Family Guy" was making fun of the movie as I now realize as an adult that Seth Macfarlane is fan of it. Of course, the movie does have fans. So I pop in the old VHS into the VCR as I was looking at some old movies as I was into filmmaking, and after watching it I personally fell in love with this movie from beginning to end. During Christmas, my mother now has a copy of the movie for the first time on DVD for its 40th anniversary with the picture quality being upgraded. Never have the 45th anniversary edition as it was release on Blu-Ray for the first time, because I wonder if 20th Century Fox was ever going to release this movie again on Blu-Ray for its 50th anniversary, and what do you know it, they did. I got it as a birthday present, but I only watch the special features first. Haven't watch the movie yet. However, I did see the movie being reissue on the big screen by Turner Classic Movies and Fathom Events with Robert Osborne being the host for the introduction and its closure. It was my first time seeing it at a movie theater, and had an amazing experience. The opening scene Maria sings the first opening musical number brought a smile to my face, and as the movie ended I was the first one to clap as the other audiences joined in. It wasn't a huge crowd, but it was nice for others to see it. The movie is about a young Austrian woman name Maria as she is wanting to be a nun in Salzburg at the abbey. So the Reverend Mother gives her a task to be a governess as she is suppose to take care of Captain Von Trapp's seven children. While she takes care of the children by teaching them how to sing, she also brings love to the family as the Captain fells in love in Maria as they got marry and leave their home behind as the Nazis take over Austria. The movie is based on not only the musical Broadway, but it is also based on a German movie "Die Trapp-Familie" and the true story of Maria and her family. There are not much words to say about this movie, because everyone has already love this movie and already know what is so great about it. I really love the story as it is told brilliantly. The direction by Robert Wise is outstanding as he knows how to tell a good story, and bringing characters to life. The cast in this movie are wonderful. The children all did well on their own as Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews are both wonderful for their performances as well as the chemistry they made. The songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein are a whole lot of fun to listen to as well as Irwin Kostal's take on the score. The movie does have its beautiful cinematography as I indeed love the look of Salzburg, Austria. The movie does have its funny moments, while its other moments are touching and heartwarming. The movie is almost three hour long, but I never got bored with it as the pacing of the movie keeps me going. Lastly, it does have great message as the movie tells where you have the Reverend Mother tell Maria not to be afraid, but must face her own destiny by faith and courage. That is what the spirit is for the movie as like myself, I must face my own choice of destiny by courage as well as my faith in God. I know anyone may identify for where the message of the movie comes from. So that is how much I love this movie, and I am glad that for 50 years, the hills are still alive. "The Sound of Music" continues to be a beloved classic, and it will always be a beloved classic. I give it a perfect powerhouse 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in 1965, fifty short years ago. I liked it, but what with me being a twelve year old male, it did not rate very highly with me among the Jame Bond features, action films, and numerous World War Two films being shown at the time. It DID resonate with me at least a little bit due to my knowledge of and hatred for all things related to Nazi Germany. My father, and the fathers of all my friends had fought in World War II, and when my friends and I wanted to play Army, we had to play Civil War, as no one wanted to be either the Germans or the Japanese. Compared to them, the Union army, and the Confederate army were lovable or at least not hated by my friends and I.I recently was fortunate enough to see The Sound of Music again on the Big Screen. I again liked it, no- this time LOVED IT. As a huge fan of films, I have a very large collection of films on DVD, and I regularly attend my local theaters. Of ALL the films I have ever seen, IN MY OPINION, this is the only film I have ever seen which I deem to be both TECHNICALLY PERFECT and ARTISTICALLY PERFECT. I would have said only that one line, but reviews are required to be ten lines long. ;-]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie musical of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an unabashed fan of the movie musical. I have all the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rodgers films; Three Penny Opera; Cabaret; anything by Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, Jerome Kern &amp; Hammerstein. And yet this is by far the worst movie musical of all time.We all like a happy ending, and this gives a happy ending to "The rape of Europe" by the Nazi maw. For six million, there was no happy ending; for each of those six million evil triumphed.Never mind that there is nothing but the slimmest connection to the real incidents of the von Trapp family escape from Europe--in reality stroll across the border into Italy.The Nazi maw ends up being a minuscule backdrop to the von Trapp saga; it is not really integral to the story line as it is in 'Cabaret.' So the songs are really love songs between Maria and the children and Maria and the Captain. And love songs, as insults, to the audience.For all the adulation Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein receive, there is something troubling about their saccharine songs oftentimes hiding a dark and portentous event. 'Carousal' about a new father being irresponsible and getting himself killed. And this musical pours on the saccharine and in that singularity, they produce a musical that trivializes the Nazi maw.It's very catchy tunes seemingly mocking the audience in a fifth column kind of way--to sabotage our understanding, our grasp, of the horrors of the Nazi maw. Horrors hinted at by 1938 and realized as the war progressed. When we see the movie, we are more than educated in the implications of Nazism and what it did to Europe; none come to this movie uniformed; and yet the movie seems to mock the audience's knowledge with their songs.And yet, I gave the move a ten, and would want others to see it--for precisely what it is. A love story, with soul stirring music, in defiance of the horrors of the Nazi maw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Beloved Family Film of All Time Turns 50!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 50th Anniversary Edition of Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music is a must-have for every family. This 5-disc DVD set includes the movie in HD and standard definition, a new 60 minute documentary called The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg and lots of other special features. The Sound of Music is the best family film of all time because it brings everyone together with its great, true-life story of the Von Trapp family. The songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein are all wonderful and unforgettable. Each song is a masterpiece. Some might think Frozen is an amazing movie musical, but Rodger and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music is a million times better! The quality of the song writing just cannot be compared with anything else. The Sound of Music stars Julie Andrews as Maria, a young Austrian woman who is training to be a nun at a monastery. Christopher Plummer stars as Captain Von Trapp, a wealthy Austrian naval captain who hires Maria as governess to his seven children. It was directed by Robert Wise. It won five Academy Awards including Best Picture.The documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg, which is included in this 50th anniversary DVD edition, is informative and revealing. We go behind-the-scenes to visit the original locations in the film: the monastery, the Cathedral, the Von Trapp estate (which is really a classical music school) and a 100-year-old marionette theater which was the inspiration for the puppet scene in the film. It is wonderful to see Julie Andrews so excited about coming back and visiting the film's locations after 50 years. For those who love the songs, the 50th Anniversary DVD Edition also includes the original soundtrack from the film. And there are lots of other bonus material, such as Music Machine Sing-Along; Audio Commentaries with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, and Director Robert Wise; A City of Song?Virtual Map of Filming Locations in Salzburg, Austria; Vintage Rodgers and Hammerstein and The Sound of Music programs; and more. The Sound of Music is appropriate for all ages. The documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg is appropriate for those ages 10 to 18. I rate this new DVD set 5 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Clayron P, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Iconic sing-a-long musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In pre-WWII Salzburg, Austria, the Mother Abbess doesn't know what to do with the flighty Maria (Julie Andrews). How do you solve a problem like Maria? Maria fearfully accepts being the governess to Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer)'s seven children. The kids don't like her at first. She is the 12th in a long line of governesses. She eventually wins them over. The Captain is a widower who runs a cold strict household. The Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) accompanies him back from Vienna with singing producer Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn). However he starts to fall for the lovely governess and she for him. The jealous Baroness pushes her out of the way and the Captain asks the Baroness to marry him.Everybody is entitled to their opinion but I can't imagine anybody not appreciating the simple joy of this musical. The main objections seem to be the movie's departure from the real story. I don't know how much Nazism these critics want but it is a musical after all. Nobody is watching this for its authenticity. The songs are simply innocent fun. They are endlessly singable and Julie Andrews is the perfect Broadway ingénue with great screen presence. Christopher Plummer provides the compelling leading man. This is probably one of the best romantic musicals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sound Of Music Is Enduring Musical All Throughout The Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sound Of Music is a musical film that was adapted on screen from the Broadway musical of the same name with the songs written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II.It stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer as Maria and Captain Georg von Trapp respectively together with Eleanor Parker as Baroness Elsa von Schraeder who was the Captain's lady friend and a competition for Maria;Richard Haydn as Max Detweiler, a good friend of both the Baroness and the Captain; as well as Charmian Carr,Nicholas Hammond,Heather Menzies,Duane Chase,Angela Cartwright,Debbie Turner and Kym Karath as the Von Trapp children.Robert Wise directed this classic musical film.It is about the story of the von Trapp family singers.Maria is a young woman who gets into the consternation of the nuns in an Austrian convent.This prompted Mother Abbess to send her to become a governess for the seven children of a naval officer and widower,Captain Georg von Trapp.It later leads a romance between Maria and the captain that leads to marriage.The children who happen to be talented singers also joins the Salzburg Music Festival during their honeymoon.It contains several popular songs, including "Edelweiss", "My Favorite Things", "Climb Ev'ry Mountain", "Do-Re- Mi", "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", "The Lonely Goatherd", and the title song, "The Sound of Music".It concludes when the von Trapp family escapes from Austria to Switzerland before the Germans annexes the country.It has been close to 50 years since the musical was released.Throughout all these years,it has remained popular.The songs would still provide delight to the viewers today and remains byword to many.The acting is obviously far from natural as it was clichéd and contrived as the characters were obviously are either singing or delivering their lines unnaturally instead of showing emotion which will definitely turn off many viewers and critics at present.But in the end,one watches this film not to see how talented the actors and actresses involved in it in showing real emotion but rather to hear the popular songs that have been close to our heart.The songs definitely provided a lot of joy and entertainment for they are definitely Rodgers and Hammerstein's best scores.But it is great to note how wonderful Julie Andrews was in it as Maria for she lights up the screen all throughout.She definitely can warm a lot of hearts throughout the generation when watching it.Aside from the songs,it also has everything that one wants to see in a movie like love;a love triangle between Maria,the Captain and the Baroness;children;great cinematography;great European locations;religion;comedy;war and intrigue. Overall,there is no question that this is one of the most enduring musical of all-time and it has timeless charm written over it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is One of My Favorite Things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, what more can I say about it? I don't know what made this musical such a hit, but I love it! It's about a nun, Maria (and I'm guessing they got the realities wrong) who goes to babysit seven children for Captain Von Trapp, and the rest goes from there. I'm guessing that what most people find the most memorable about the entire movie are the songs, which are great! I'll go into the ones most people get invested into (sorry if I miss any). For Sound of Music (song) I think that not only was it Julie Andrew's singing that made the song feel welcoming, but the melody and the environment she was in and the fact that it was the opening number rather than the second song of the musical (I think that's what the original play did). It made me feel excited, calm, and ready for her adventure. Sixteen Going on Seventeen thrills me to death! It's a boyfriend and girlfriend hanging out (though it probably didn't really happen), and he's telling her the dangers of being naive, while at the same time adoring her! My Favorite Things, try singing it during a thunder storm! That's what happens in this song and it's so charming. Do I need to say what it is about Do-Re-Mi that makes singing contagious? Even though it is singing notes over and over, any time one person starts singing that song it makes lots of people want to join in! It doesn't make sense, but I think that it was once again Julie Andrews' singing, playing guitar, and in the multiple environments that she and the children were hanging out in that made that song a hit. I may not know why I love it, but aside from getting the life of Maria Von Trapp inaccurate it makes a great story - musical standing on it's own merits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sound of Greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sound of Music was my choice this year to replace the boring super bowl game.Every year I pick one movie (or sometimes a couple) to watch while everyone else on planet Earth watches the super bowl. I thought, after previously buying this on BluRay and having it for some time without having watched it on BluRay, I thought it just perfect for that Sunday, February 2nd. (Oh, and in case you were wondering, my other yearly tradition was fulfilled earlier in the day when I watched Groundhog Day on BluRay.)Despite my intentions, i.e. replacing the "manly man" sports programme with a musical, this movie was an absolute JOY to watch. Every second, every frame, every scene, every song?from beginning to end had be on the edge of my seat. (And yeah, I did sing out loud the songs.) Now, this is only my second time ever seeing this and I'll get into my first time many, many years ago later. So, it was almost like me seeing it for the first time, again.It did help that the BluRay transfer was nothing short of a miracle. It made it look pristine, brand new and possibly even better than its initial release nearly 50 years ago. (I say possibly since I wasn't around for its first run.) Every inch of the screen (and mind you, I don't even have a TV that can give me the best BluRay offers ? 720dpi) was immaculate.But, then again, so was the movie. I am not one to look for flaws in this movie, but an hour in, I had to pause myself and think: this movie has no flaws. Everything worked. To put it in 2014 terms: Everything *was* awesome.That said, I will say this, despite me granting this 5/5 stars (or 10/10 on IMDb's scale) and calling it nothing short of a masterpiece, I guess there was one tiny bit where it slowed down, towards the end, when it got serious. It had to, so it's not necessarily a flaw, per se, but it also didn't necessarily mesh with the previous nearly 3 hours.Honestly, it pains me to say one word against this fine piece of art. It was so magical, so wonderful, even the thoughts going through my head as I write this are filled with joy. I loved this movie. The music, the acting, the surprises and the humor ? and amazingly, there was a lot more than you would expect, especially jokes that hold up today.If you haven't heard the story by now, it was a story of a nun that didn't belong until she was assigned the status of governess of seven children of a widowed father pre-WWII in Austria. There, she warms their hearts, unfreezes the father's and discovers herself. We're just blessed to go along with her journey.I hope you've seen this movie before. If you have, see it again. If you haven't, you must see it. Above all else, to either group of individuals, go out and buy a BluRay player (assuming you haven't already) and then buy this movie. Even cold. Buy it on BluRay and relish in the beauty and wonder of The Sound of Music.* * * Final thoughts: I was born 9 years after this movie's release. Hard for me to believe that as I now think about it. I grew up, or at least into mid-teens, listening or hearing the songs from the soundtrack which I loved. I didn't necessarily associate the songs from the movie, until?I cannot remember when, but our local movie theatre chain here in Phoenix, AZ, Harkins, played this movie for twenty-five cents as some kind of anniversary of the movie theatre chain. (Prices from when both the movie and chain opened.) I thought: well, I've never seen it, it's considered a masterpiece and why not view it on the big screen for the first time?Almost immediately in the movie, during the opening credits, they play an instrumental medley of multiple of the movie's songs. I sat up instantly thinking "Oh! I know that song! I didn't know it was in this!" and repeated that thought a couple more times. It was then I was thoroughly excited to see the rest of the movie.While the movie, songs, etc, didn't disappoint, the print did. It was an original print filled with scratches, a pink tint ? many discolored scenes and cuts. There was an unintentionally laugh out loud scene for me when Julie Andrews was on one side of the room and suddenly the movie jumped to her on the other side. I remember thinking: "I didn't know they could teleport way back then!"I gave the movie the strong benefit of the doubt (of the original print in the projection booth.) I really did like it a lot.Fast-forward maaaybeee two decades to two months ago today. I watched it for the second time. I don't want to say it was the perfect quality of the BluRay disc, but I fell in deep love with this movie more than I can express in these words above.The gorgeous disc did help, that is. And not every BluRay comes out half as good as this one did.So, please, if you're even remotely interested in this, or want to reclaim that initial feeling you got from your childhood seeing this, BUY THIS ON BLURAY. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One more goof that only makes me love it more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of the charm of one of my favorite movies are the little "goofs" most of which are listed already on IMDb. However, if Georg's youngest daughter is five and his wife died seven years ago, how does that work? Anyway, I first saw this movie with my aging mom in 1965, and as the theater was almost sold out we had to sit in the front row. Imagine my feelings as the camera zoomed in on the top of the hill and Maria started singing. I was spellbound. Not until Les Miserables have I had such an experience! In most movies there are both strong and weak characters. In Sound of Music I found every actor and actress believable. Julie Andrews as Maria was marvelous, but the best performance in my view was Christopher Plummer as the Captain. How he changed from the stiff formal unforgiving and aloof parent to a warm and caring father in a few brief scenes was great. I have seen the stage productions many times and no one else has pulled it off believably. Most stage musicals have failed in their transitions to film for example " Annie", but Sound of Music set the standard for future musicals to try and achieve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Classic Musical, You'll remember no matter how old it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sound of Music in my opinion is the best family movie of all time. About a nun name Maria, who is sent to become a governess to 7 kids of the Von Trapp family who only has a father who has lost his wife. This is one movie I can still remember watching in my young days. Watching it over again with the family, you will remember those old tunes you might have sung back when you were still a young boy/girl. The Sound of Music is a really enjoyable movie which I highly recommend to watch with family or friends. I think young adults who have watched The Sound of Music before in their young days, and now have kids and family, they will watch the movie and will remember all the lovely and wonderful songs they use to listen or sing along to. Julie Andrews was just really perfect for the role of Maria, especially Christopher Plummers as Captain Von. Trapp, and also the children. This movie has family, music and love. Even though the movie has been around ever since 1965, the movie is still really popular and well known and its nearly 50 years ago when it was made. The movie gets known every year as young kids watch it while growing up and then they show it to their kids when they have a family, which makes the movie more popular. Overall the Best movie of all time, which will never get old and will never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hills are still alive with "The Sound of Music"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have thought that the most popular and beloved movie musical ever made turned out to be based on a true story? And not just any true story, a true story that is in some way related to the events of World War II. On paper, taking such a story and transitioning it into musical form would sound like a recipe for disaster. But in the case of director Robert Wise's Oscar-winning "The Sound of Music" (1965), it somehow miraculously comes together very well. It helps that the story itself is a credible one to be put to music seeing that it involves singers. Also, if there's terrific scenery, cinematography, and music to accompany a plot like this, it's all the more reason to celebrate its triumphant success. After her Oscar-winning turn in "Mary Poppins" (1964), Julie Andrews delivers two enjoyable performances in a row as Maria, a free-spirited Austrian nun who seems out of place alongside her fellow nuns. She is sent by Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) to become the governess of seven children for the widowed Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). His strict disciplinary order in his house becomes a bit excessive for Maria, especially when it comes to the children. After she takes the children out to play and teaches them how to sing, the Captain reluctantly lets down his defenses and eventually becomes enamored with her. However, he's already set to be engaged with a wealthy socialite from Vienna by the name of Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Eleanor Parker). Furthermore, Austria is being taken over by the Third Reich and the Captain is being forced to fight in the German Navy. How will everything pan out for Maria, the Captain and his children? To reveal anything else regarding the main narrative would involve major spoilers for those who have yet to see it. I've heard that this film doesn't accurately follow the true events it was based on particularly that the Captain wasn't that strict, some of the names were changed, their property wasn't that massive, one of the characters is fictional, etc. I've also heard complaints from critics saying that the film is "too sweet" as if implying that there's hardly anything at stake for our main characters save for the Nazi invasion in the final act. And frankly, I'd be lying if I said I didn't see or understand where they might be coming from. But at the same time, I have to be honest and say that I didn't mind. First of all, you have to realize that this is a difficult kind of film to make. We're talking about a movie musical that is based on a true story, two separate things that shouldn't really be combined. Imagine a musical centered on the Boston Tea Party. Sounds impractical on paper, doesn't it? In the case of "The Sound of Music" which centers on Austrian singers escaping their Nazi-occupied country, it actually works. It helps that it's about singers since it warrants these songs being incorporated into this narrative as the children make progress on their singing skills for the music festival in the climax. Second of all, I felt like the way they handled the love triangle between Maria, the Captain and the Baroness was actually pretty subtle. Instead of being as over-dramatic as a soap opera, it feels as plausible and elegant as something like "Downton Abbey". When it comes to the film's music, all I can say is that it's Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. No matter what Rodgers and Hammerstein musical you see, whether it's "Oklahoma!" or "Carousel", you can bet that the best part is going to be the music. With songs like the immortal opening title tune, the charming "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", the inspiring "Do Re Mi" (inspiring in that finds a way to basically teach people how to sing), and the epic "Climb Every Mountain", we see this dynamic duo at the peak of their power. There's a good reason why these famous songs have been around for such a long time. They're catchy, well-written, executed perfectly by the singers singing them, and are simply filled with joy and passion all around. If the reprise of "Climb Every Mountain" in the film's final scene doesn't move you, I'm not sure what else will. The cinematography in "The Sound of Music" is some of the best you'll ever see in film history. Remember in my review of "Bambi" (1942) when I mentioned that forests remind me of that film since it had that deep an impact on me? Well, I experienced an identical reaction with "The Sound of Music" in that mountains and lakes remind me of the Trapp family climbing up the mountain together in the end as well as the mountain, lake, and gardens in the back of the Trapp estate. When the epic scale and grand beauty of the landscapes in Austria are captured as excellent as they are here, these heavenly images will stay with you for as long as you live. To be completely honest, I'm rather surprised by how well "The Sound of Music" holds up many years after its release. We all know how outstanding the music is, how scenic the images on screen are, and how good the performances and singing by Andrews, Plummer, and the child and teenage actors are. But the story and the way it's told is very surprising mainly because of how much it grew on me. As I better understood the risks of taking a story that happened in real life and translating it into a palatable musical, the more I appreciated what the filmmakers accomplished. It was a treat and a pleasure to revisit "The Sound of Music" again, and I'm fairly certain that it won't be my last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Great Classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most-loved (along with The Wizard Of Oz) films ever made. I saw it when it was originally released at one of the big downtown Chicago movie palaces which sadly, do not exist anymore. I remember still, the excitement of the justly-famous opening sequence, with that gorgeous Austrian scenery, exploding on the big screen with beautiful color and sound. The cast of this joyous musical was letter-perfect, and the film is timeless. I last saw this on a big screen a few years ago at one of the Grant Park "Movies In The Park", where an appreciative audience sang along with the songs (although this was NOT the sing-along version) and applauded at the conclusion of various songs and scenes. It always astonishes me when I hear that some critics dislike this film. I love it, and have also had the privilege of seeing the live stage show back in 1962, as well as the recent live television adaptation. The Sound Of Music is a story which should appeal to old and young alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie for the whole family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a family (Von Trapp) living in Salzburg, Austria just before WW2. Maria wants to be a nun, but this is clearly not the type of life that she's meant to live. Captain Von Trapp is a widower with 7 children and is having difficulty finding a governess who wants to stay (the kids run everyone else off). At first, the kids try to make Maria leave by playing pranks on her, but they quickly find that she's different and like being with her as she finds fun things for them to do (something their father has not done), and the Captain also considers her special. To everyone's surprise, Maria disappears during a party. I won't say anything else about the plot (that's for you to find out).The movie is great for the whole family if you like the older movies, especially musicals. You wouldn't find a new movie like this classic (entertainment has changed a lot, and many people living today were born after WW2 ended). The music and storyline make it more re-watchable than many movies I've seen, some of which I don't care to see more than once or twice (but I might become tired of this movie if I watched it every week or every month, as a few people say they do).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Film worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite films. It is a classic. Even after all these years when I watch this film I think it is well done. The music is of course the biggest plus of this great film. Filmed on location, they do a great job of bringing you into the story. Julie Andrews gives in my opinion her best performance out of any movie I have seen her in. You can feel the love that that the main characters have for each other. I would highly recommend taking the time to watch this film if you have not seen it before. I also found out that this story is based on a real life story. it is a bit sad to see how people were treated by the Germans. I think it would be hard to leave everything you have, but they did it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a confession to make. I helped torpedo this film's rep in the late 90s on a couple of other BBSes in the late 90s by making fun of it in a light hearted sort of way. After that I remember every one getting on the band wagon and stating how silly they thought the movie was. My poking-fun had "gone viral" so to speak. Well, I won't say what I did, but it was one of the last major cultural influences my posts would have for a very long time. Now that the net is a bit more democratized I don't have to worry about my words hitting major network outlets like they used to. Fortunately "The Sound of Music" was resilient enough to endure a little ridicule.But I digress. To the film.This is essentially a musical remake of a German film entitled "The Family Von Trapp", which tells the same story with less music and more drama. The Rogers and Hammerstein version was another Hollywood take on Nazi Germany, but keeps the fair light as it is understood when the deplorable political situation was in Germany, ergo the focus is on the Von Trapps and their escapade to form into a family and leave Austria which is under the German sphere of influence.I've always loved this film as a film. I'm a guy who's comfortable enough with his masculinity to say that I liked the song and dance numbers in this film, and have always done so. So, when I "paid homage" to the songs in this film in the late 90s, I wasn't trying to ridicule the film, nor create the social tidal wave of "that musical movie is silly and stupid" (which, again thankfully retreated into obscurity), but I was honestly trying to just use some well know references in the film in other forums. I think the songs, the story, and just over all production values are first class. And one could expect no less from one of Hollywood's first class directors, Robert Wise. The man who brought us "West Side Story", "Run Silent, Run Deep", "The Desert Rats" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to name but a few of his landmark films.Julie Andrews gives us a free spirited novice who is trying desperately to become a nun by showing her devotion to what she loves most about living; the great outdoors and the music that it inspires within her. Christopher Plummer is in his prime when he portrays Captain Von Trapp, formerly of the Austrian Navy, and we can see his serious side as an actor come forth, along with an underscoring of tenderness.The supporting cast all do their parts to help sustain and suspend both the film's reality and the reality we are trying to escape when we watch the "Sound of Music". No one misses a cue here in terms of performance, and performances carry this film from frame one.Technical notes; on the DVD documentary it is mentioned that Captain Von Trapp did not like the Nazi regime for a variety of reasons, but this is only every touched on in one dramatic scene, and the emotional thrust of the captain's position is given, but we are not privy to the more real and pragmatic reasons of why and what makes him and us not like the Nazis in the first place. But, the film works regardless, because it is a musical and not a political diatribe. The cinematography is basic, but also breathtaking, particularly in the opening sequences. We are given some very inviting panoramic vistas of settled regions within the Alps-incredible stuff. The musical numbers are well crafted and help suspend reality outside the film to make the fantasy we are watching more inviting and enjoyable. If I had one critique, it's the same critique that I have with all films prior to 1970; studio rear-screen projection car shots. I remember the hack tour guide at Universal telling us how "realisitic" this process was when shooting a scene that required the actors/characters be inside a moving vehicle. My reaction then is as it is now; give me a break. If you need characters in a car, then put them in a car and have a grip truck tow them with a camera mounted on the back, or mount a camera on the car itself, and let the actors drive for goodness sake.Otherwise the film is marvelous. If you're in the mood for some light entertainment, something with familial appeal, that has some seriousness to it, but is not weighed down by political overtones, then give "The Sound of Music" a chance.Until then; so long, fare well, alveterzane, good bye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Cute, emotional, engaging, inspirational."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people like music and some hate, at least in films. It is highly unlikely that one does not like the format of the film. There is no doubt about the fact that it does not offer anything new, but the it is presented in such a style of music, and the emotions which develop and look genuine. From the starting I knew the end, but there is a lot more to cinema than babbling about stereotypes. The story is about a girl named Maria, who loves singing. She lives in a church and is then sent to a house belonging to the Von Trapp family to be the governess. At first things weren't too simple for her, to get along with the family especially children. Things started to change with a predictable story but the way it is presented in the musical format and the energy present on the screen all the time is something you are likely to remember forever. First 12 minutes into the film and I started regretting why I was avoiding it. You will enjoy scenes where the dialogs are in the poem or a musical format. The film should not be missed.PROS: I am not sure whether a movie in such a format had previously been made, but this is certainly an inspiration to a lot others. Chicago (2002) seems to be on the same lines, and I enjoyed that also. This film has given me an unforgettable acting by Julie Andrews as Maria. Her character is inspirational and cheerful all the time. The cinematography, locations esp. when they are singing and running are all an eye candy. I'll always remember the sequence in which the seven children stood in line for the first time. All were looking so good with appropriate heights that you will praise the casting for sure. The movie explores ideas of how to tackle situations and especially when all are against you. It is the belief in you that plays a role to handle them. When you face a problem, go and face them. May be they are not explored in a very deep way but you have the topics to think on. Another dialog when the children give the reason for the mischiefs as the way to get the attention of their father is an eye opener. Children doing mischief on a regular basis is an eye-opener and cannot be ignored but to think about carefully. The acting by all is satisfactory with Maria taking most of the credit. The art direction and choreography in many dance sequences is again cute and commendable. Christopher Plummer as the strict navy officer performs well and his strict monotonous tone with least movement of the lips is great. The film provides no depressing moments and for most of the times you will happy because you know what will happen next because of the general nice ambiance. There are a few instances when you are at the edge. The film is a good option to pull you out of your depressing moments.CONS: The only thing that looked odd was the very less time in which the children got along with their new governess. That particular part was too short and should have taken time to develop the mutual feelings. But then the film was meant to show a lot of other things too.MESSAGE: "Be cheerful" VERDICT: "Most Recommended."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hills really are alive with the sound of music when Julie Andrews takes the screen in this beautiful film adaption of the original Broadway musical. Andrews gives a dazzling performance as the spirited Maria who warms our hearts and takes us away into a lovely world of song and connects the viewers into the cinematic family. Her costar who was well chosen for the role of the stern, stoic and dashing Captain Van Trapp is Christopher Plummer who lights up the screen when he comes on. He seems cold and unlikable, but we soon grow to love him as Maria does. The film is full of wonderful and memorable songs like "Do-Re-Mi", "My Favorite Things" and "Climb Every Mountain." Any musical fan should see this terrific film and fall in love with the majestic beauty this picture presents as you journey into those hills.</fullReview>

Movies today....C.G.I. and Romantic Comedies in particular....are not in the least entertaining. This movie is also called cheesy (parts of it are), but its Danish Blue cheese ...not the mild Cheddar of todays garbage. Hollywood now...churns out a good movie...about every few years. This was made in 1965...it made an absolute fortune. It was made in a time when "musicals" were very popular. This period ushered in a great 70s ...when brilliant movies were common place.

		<shortDescription>Probably the last of the great Hollywood musicals - 87%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're reading my reviews in chronological order then you'll probably laugh at the contrast between this and the last movie I talked about! But sometimes, you have to let the Better Half dictate the viewing and so it was here. Given that it is a widely adored piece of cinema and that it is a musical (which is one of my least favourite genres) then there is a good chance that my views won't sit too well with some of you. But bear in mind that I went into this trying to ignore my prejudices and forgetting that it is almost fifty years old.Salzberg in Austria in the dying days of the 1930s. Rebellious trainee nun Maria (Julie Andrews) has stepped on the toes of the Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) one too many times and she finds herself shipped off to be the governess of one Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children (Charmian Carr, Heather Menzies, Nicholas Hammond, Duane Chase, Angela Cartwright, Debbie Turner and Kym Karath). At first, she struggles to fit in to the fabric of the family which is strict and joyless but Maria's zest of life, love and song soon melts the heart of the Von Trapps as the gathering storm of the Nazi threat swirls at the fringes of the story.Camp and colourful it may be but only the most stone-heartened of viewers would argue that "The Sound of Music" is all gloss and no substance. The story, while clearly nonsense, is a winner and performed with enthusiasm and gusto from the cast. Andrews is a revelation, being both a glorious singer as well as an emotive actress. Plummer is equal to the task and the scenes between them are simply magical, full of chemistry that you rarely see on screen these days. The soundtrack is also a winner - each song is memorable and even if you've seen it before (as my Better Half has), you'll be helpless to join in with them. But it is also surprisingly evocative. Even I struggled to suppress the lump in my throat at times and as the Nazi element grows, the film takes a dark twist towards a genuinely tense finale. The other thing I loved was the cinematography - it is a wonderfully pretty picture with sweeping panoramas of the Alps and the lakes between them.Assuming that this hasn't passed you by completely then the chances are that you would have had some exposure to "The Sound of Music", whether you record it at Christmas or go to the Singalong showing dressed as a nun. To be honest, I struggled to keep my cynical comments to myself when I watched it as it is impossible to take it seriously. But even I, who was ready to hate this, can't deny that this is a wonderful feel-good movie that allows you to let your hair down and just enjoy yourself. It won't be to everyones tastes and I personally would have liked more songs rather than the same six or seven repeated over the course of the film. But those that are there are like the rest of the film, joyous and youthful and completely deserving of your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"How do you solve a problem like Maria"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid, maybe ten or eleven years old, I was tapped to be a stagehand in an amateur teen production of "The Sound of Music". This would have been a few years before the movie came out. It was a cool gig, getting to hang out with and watch the older kids. My main job was to help raise and lower the stage curtain, too much for somebody my size so I was teamed up with someone else. There was even a bit part for me in the play in some dance scene where I had to actually touch some yucky girl. I'm glad I outgrew that foolish tendency.That was when I was first introduced to the music of Rodgers and Hammerstein, and it didn't take long to learn the words to now popular standards like Do Re Mi, Favorite Things and Edelweiss, not to mention the title song. Curiously, I was never moved to watch the film version of "The Sound of Music" until recently. My loss, as this is a wonderful family film for all ages, even if part of it it deals with the largely unspoken terror of Nazi occupation in Austria. That theme is jarringly brought home with the first utterance of 'Heil Hitler' by the bureaucratic Herr Zeller, and sets the backdrop for the film's finale as the Von Trapp family flees their homeland.For all of that, the film serves quite well as an entertaining musical, with elements of comedy mixed in as student nun Maria (Julie Andrews) becomes governess for a widower naval captain (Christopher Plummer) with seven children. By dint of common sense and humility, Maria gains the respect and love of the entire family, eventually falling in love herself, with a man she probably would not have sought out under normal circumstances. In a touching scene, the Reverend Mother helps Maria sort out her conflicted feelings and return to the Von Trapp household. For my part, I thought the Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) was way too gracious in her understanding of the Captain's true feelings, and in her case, discretion was truly the better part of valor.Fans of movie musicals will certainly find "The Sound of Music" at or near the top of their favorite films list. Filling it's nearly three hour run time are a host of wonderful songs, many to my surprise which were done more than once. I predict you'll come away from the picture singing or humming your own particular favorite, as the film has a way of working that kind of magic as it tells it's timeless story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Using Sound of Music for teaching English</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like using movies for teaching English in Asia. I show them as an adjunct to English class, so that students get an extended chance to hear English in use.The Sound of Music is too fast for my lower level students at the beginning of the year, but by the end of their first year, it's good. The accent is very clear, and the subtitles on the DVD are fairly accurate but not exact at all. However, since it is very long, it has to be shown in three to five sessions. If you try to show it in one long session your students will fall asleep. (Remember how difficult it is to listen for extended periods to a language that you struggle in). I didn't find an accurate script online so I downloaded one, corrected it roughly, and made a vocabulary list. I'm sure many English teachers would appreciate suggestions from other ESL teachers about how to use this movie for teaching English, or specific activities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply one of the best ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few films, and few musicals, that can touch the excellence of "The Sound of Music." Not only is it an extremely well-written musical in itself, but this film adaptation is absolutely perfect, easily the Best Picture of 1965, and one of the very best ever made. It's hard to know where to start when a film simply has so many great elements to it. These are some of the best musical songs ever written, some of my favorites being "My Favorite Things" and the one in which she teaches the children how to sing. The musical is based on the touching and amazing true story that has managed to inspire so many. Julie Andrews is perfectly cast (being one of my favorite actresses) and was robbed not to receive an Oscar for this role, in addition to the one she earned the previous year for "Mary Poppins." Christopher Plummer is also an excellent choice as the tough military father in the film. I love the tiny humorous moments, such as Plummer seeing his children in the tree or all the children falling out of the boat after seeing their father. Excellent from beginning to end. For me, it's between this and "Singin' in the Rain" for the all-time greatest movie musical, and it's truly impossible for me to make that call. If you have never seen this, you've missed a real treat. It is a must-see for fans of musicals and movies alike. Perfect.**** out of ****</fullReview>

Maria also eventually wins the heart of the strict and reserved Captain. A major obstacle to their happiness comes in the form of the beautiful and elegant Baroness(Eleanor Parker)who is a friend of the Captain and is also in love with him. The entire cast are superb with standout performances from Christopher Plummer, Julie Andrews and Eleanor Parker as the Baroness. Richard Haydn is also superb as Max a friend of the Captain and the Baroness, Max is the one who has the idea for the family to become singers. The child cast all also do a fine job, especially Charmian Carr as the Captains eldest daughter Lisel.This is a well made and enchanting film that never fails to delight audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mother of all Musicals!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I was a kid, I saw "The Sound of Music" and considered as the best musical and one of my favorite movies. Now as a young adult, it still remains as one of my favorites. First of all, it has Julia Andrews's best performance. I enjoyed her role as Mary Poppins, but she flourishes and illuminates the screen as Maria, the cheerful, witty, and funny want-to-be nun. She brings to life some of the most memorable songs that drown out all others such as: "Do-Rei-Mei" and "The Sound of Music." Second, the magnificent score of Irwin Kostal adds to beauty of the music. It uplifts my soul to levels that hardly any other music can surpass. Third, the wonderful shots of the landscape (on location) add to the authenticity to the film's story that not even Terrence Malick could dream up. Fourth, the supporting casts (particularly the seven children) make believable performances. Even the serious Christopher Plummer shines a new light on his character as the widower Captain.Fifth, the story itself makes a great film. It's not elongated or filled with plot holes, but unique with many individual subplots at hand such as the romances between Liesl and Ralph, and later Maria and The Captain. Sixth, for a movie in the 1960s covering events in the 1930s such as: the lighting, sets, art direction, and costume designs make it all feel real.There are some people that I know says this movie is too "sugar-coated" or even unrealistic to the time period. That's a load of manure. This is the perfect feel-good musical ever made. There's only six other musicals that I have seen that I consider grand, but this beats them all. 10/10 If you have not seen this movie, even if you don't like musicals, you're missing a whole lot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sound of Music is one of those films that you can probably recall the words to the songs and memorable lines. Dame Julie Andrews is brilliant as the postulate aspiring nun, Sister Maria, who is sent to help a local military man, Captain Von Trap, played by the brilliant Christopher Plummer to raise his seven children. At first, the children are resistant to Maria's unconventional ways. She makes an attempt to become the friend despite the oldest daughter who doesn't need a mother but does after all. Maria eases her way with the Von Trap children by teaching them how to sing and be children again. She gives them the play clothes made out of curtains or drapes from her bedroom quarters. They sing, play, and have picnics in the beautiful Salzburg mountains. Of course, Maria causes discourse in the Von Trapp family household but she manages to stay on and wins over the Captain Von Trap who was seeing a very beautiful Fraulein Schraeder from Vienna who is not crazy about children. Of course, this story takes place before the rise of Hitler and World War II. When Maria and the Captain come back from their honeymoon, they must face separation with Captain being ordered to serve the Third Reich despite his obvious disdain. The scenes at the Convent are also memorable especially with the late and wonderful Anna Lee MBE as one of the nuns. Again, the scenery, the art direction, the costumes, the music, the writing, and acting are all first rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This will go down in history as Mrs. Jackson's all-time favorite movie."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today, the seventh of February, my teacher, Mrs. Jackson, played two scenes out of The Sound Of Music - "The Sound Of Music" (musical number) and "Do-Re-Mi" - for our new unit, "Beyond The Notes". She played these two scenes because they really have to do with "Beyond The Notes"."The Sound Of Music" is definitely on my op ten all-time favorite movies, like Mrs. Jackson. It's right in-between Harry Potter and TOOTP and HSMII (which are seven and nine). The Sound Of Music is a wonderful drama about Count Van Trapp and his seven children. One day, a nun named Maria comes into their lives and teaches them about scales, notes, and in general, music. Then suddenly Count Van Trapp is forced to go into service (actually I'm not sure; I've only seen PARTS of The Sound Of Music).This is a classic you will always treasure and love forever and ever. I recommend this to everyone, even those not on this website. If you have a TV, then this comes on at least once a year on ABC Family. Also, you can get it in a Roger And Hammerstein's set (like Mrs. Jackson did for Christmas). I think this is also on VHS and Blue-Ray. If you can't find it, look up parts on YouTube. They're bound to have at least parts.Thank you for reading about this extravagant movie. It's a sure-fire classic. This has to be one of the best movies ever made. WATCH IT THE NEXT CHANCE YOU GET!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite musical of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maria is a young lady studying to be a nun, but is unsure of convent life, as her whole personality, her whole way of living is very different from every other nun in the Abbey. She is sent away to be a governess to seven children, of the Von Trapp family. Their father, Captain Georg Von Trapp, is a widower and very harsh on his children, treating them like he would do to his naval army. When Maria arrives she changes this, and brings music and laughter into the household, but not even Maria can change all the events that are about to come...Many have grown up with this movie, and I am one of them. As a child I loved The Sound Of Music, and I still do. A timeless classic, The Sound Of Music can be watched again and again. It is a universal movie, and there is a squeaky clean plot. No sex, no drugs, and no violence. Perfect for family audiences.This was the second film I saw with Julie Andrews, and I loved her more in this movie than I have with any of her other films. This is my favourite role of hers. She was the perfect Maria - her smile, her kindness, her attitude and confidence, and her angelic and enchanting voice. She looked beautiful, and her chemistry with Christopher Plummer was indeed wonderful. He was a good Captain Von Trapp, though he started off a bit rocky in my opinion. But his performance greatly improved throughout and by the end I could not imagine anyone else in his role. The children, every single one of them, delivered fine performances. They had exceptional singing voices, considering their age, and kudos to their choreographer for their dance sequences, especially in "Do-Re-Mi" and "So Long Farewell", which they were brilliant in.I strongly believe the popularity of The Sound Of Music is mainly to the outstanding musical score by Roger and Hammerstein, but there are more factors to consider. For example, the gorgeous scenery, the acting (Julie Andrews owns this film), the universal family appeal, or maybe even the values that the film embraces. They are so decent. The popularity factor could be due of any one of these, however I believe it was the music. Each song is so wonderfully crafted. I cannot choose a favourite out of the songs, but I have always had a soft spot for "Do-Re-Mi". I never really liked the song "Edelweiss" as a child, but now when I listen to it, I love it. It is highly underrated. "My Favourite Things" is a great song, very catchy, and really exposes Andrews' beautiful singing voice. "The Lonely Goatherd" also did that, but this time with...brace yourselves...PUPPETS! I remember watching that song over and over again and giggling with my family at the puppets and the yodeling - a lovely memory. I also think "Something Good", and "I Have Confidence" are nice songs, and the same goes for "So Long Farewell", with the children. And I cannot forget the outstanding choreography and singing in "Sixteen Going On Seventeen", Liesl and Rolf's chemistry in that song was cuter than a cocker spaniel. There are many subplots in The Sound Of Music, like the romance with Liesl and Rolf, the war and escaping, the Baroness's entry into the lives of the Von Trapps, the singing competition, Maria's trouble in the convent...but the main story would be of the family, and their story together. Definitely one of my 'favourite things'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has to be in my top 5 all-time favorite movies. The singing, the spirituality, the scenery - there is something amazing in this film for everyone. Yes, Hollywood, films without violence and bad language can be wildly popular (even though I am a firm believer in free speech and that there are times for which an expletive (sp?) is certainly called). This film also recalls a time when it was made quite clear that if you didn't stand for something, that you may be in mortal danger of falling for anything, i.e. Hitler's insanity. Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrew's performances here are without equal. This is the perfect family film!</fullReview>

The cast is all so attractive and perfectly chosen. The movie keeps moving...there are no dull or slow spots. It seems Julie Andrews worked well with children because she was so good in both Mary Poppins and Sound of Music. I find my own children love to watch her because of how well she interacts with the stage children on the TV.Great for kids and adults alike!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply all the best! From scenes, scripts (line per line), music, and story.This movie has a excellent blend on everything. Good romance movie for general ages.You can learn a lot from this movie. I love the twist on the story, I'm sure you gonna love it too. It a kind of movie to watch over and over again, where no time can make it obsolete. It's like a classical song that has no season, where you can play anytime and anywhere.As you watch the movie, it is not just about romance, or about music, or about running a big family, but somehow you will see how a well known family can be displaced from a war. The point is there are lots of aspect for your point of view.Highly Recommended to watch! I think A must have DVD copy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and I'm only 21. I've been told that when I was less than 1 year old, I watched The Sound of Music almost every day for about a year straight. I still watch it all the time. Julie Andrews has an amazing voice and stage presence. Plus, she can act. I recently saw some clips from some Broadway shows she was in and she's amazing in that too. She plays the roles so well that I almost forget it's Julie Andrews playing a character, because she is such a skilled actress. Christopher Plumber is also great. My favorite song from the movie is probably Something Good, but I also really like Edelweiss. I'll continue to watch Sound of Music until I die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to watch this movie all the time when I was kid. It remains one of my favorite movies, and what I think is one of the greatest movies in cinema history. This movie is fulled with wonderful and nostalgic music, superb acting and character depth, beautiful sceneries depicting the Austrian landscapes and towns and a brilliant story based on survival, music, love, sacrifice, family and lessons.It is based on the true story of Maria Von Trapp (Julie Andrews). She is sent to the house of a retired naval captain, Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), to care for his seven children. Through the teachings of music, Maria won the hearts of the children and brought love in the Von Trapp family. Maria and Captain Von Trapp soon fall in love, despite the fact that the Captain is engaged to Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) and Maria is a nun. These events also take place when the Nazi Germany takes control of Austria, and demands that Captain von Trapp assume a position in the German Navy. Their true events are beautifully depicted in this film. The most memorable scenes, I think, are the puppet show, Maria leaving the Von Trapp family for the first time and returning to the convent. There is also good dose of comedy, including the parts of Maria sitting on a pine cone and a boat capsizing with Maria and the kids in it. The memorable and unforgettable songs including "My Favorite Things," "Female Deer," "Confidence in Me" and the powerful "Climb Every Mountain" will send chills down your body and forever etch in your minds. I am glad this movie won the Oscar for Best Picture. The cinematography was fantastic and the directing by the great Robert Wise was brilliant. Overall, this movie is filled with great memories and will bring you nostalgia after each watch. Grade A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie about 15 years ago and have loved it since. My favourite songs are 'The Sound Of Music', 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen', 'Do-Re-Mi' and 'Something Good'. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer were perfect as Maria and Captain Von Trapp. Eleanor Parker, Daniel Truhitte, Peggy Wood, Ben Wright and Richard Haydn were great supporting cast. This has to be one of Robert Wise's greatest films. I remember watching a documentary where Heather Menzies (Louisa), Charmian Carr (Liesl), Duane Chase (Kurt), Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich), Kym Karath (Gretl), Angela Cartwright (Brigitta) and Debbie Turner (Marta) returned to Austria 35 years after the film was released. The funniest scene in the movie was when Maria sat on the pine cone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, The Sound of Music is indeed one of the greatest movies of all time. It is easily a classic movie, that all people should see at least once.When I was younger I thought this movie was very boring. But when I was a little older, my parents had me watch it, and now it is one of my favorites. Julie Andrews is a phenomenal actress and wonderfully portrays the character of Maria Von Trapp. Her performance moves your soul, and touches your heart like no other actress. The story is unforgettable, as are the wonderful songs such as Do Re Mi, Maria, and Climb Every Mountain. Although the movie is 3 hours long, it gets your attention at the beginning, and keeps you involved until the spectacular ending.I highly recommend that you watch this movie. If you love musicals, then I guarantee you will adore this film. And if you don't like musicals, overlook the songs, and pay attention to the story. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sound of Music is AMAZING! I don't know what it was that made me love the movie after hating it for so many years, but something definitely happened! I'm 14 and I never thought that I could like older movies such as this one. Well, I thought wrong! I adore this movie!! Anyway...the whole movie is beautiful. The places, the actors, the songs, etc. It's one of those good romance movies. Actually, it's the way a romance movie should be. In movies today, they show two people who are obviously interested in each other, then the next morning they're in bed together. That's horrible!! But in the Sound of Music, you can watch the love slowly unfold. You'd never really know it until a little later in the movie, but it gets obvious after a while.I was lucky enough to go on the Sound of Music tour in Austria when I went on vacation in Germany. It was a 4 hour tour, but well worth my time. Although at the time I hated it and wanted nothing to do with it. I actually have my picture in front of the pavilion type thing where Liesl and Rolfe sang "Sixteen Going on Seventeen" and where the Captain and Maria sing "Something Good". =]I highly recommend this movie to every single age group out there! Such a good musical and it's even got a little humor. So if you like romance, music, and comedy, then you're gonna love this movie! And let me tell you a little secret...if you're emotional ((like me)) and you get into this movie enough, you just might cry at the end. Or maybe intermission. Ha.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My very favourite film - the songs are lovely and so are the characters! :) :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This famous film is about a failing nun who has to become a governess. Why? Because one of the nuns thinks it will help her do something important rather than failing to be a nun. Anyway, Maria (the failing nun) goes to a very wealthy captain to look after his seven children. Maria finds that they have been bossed around by their father since their mother's death. Can Maria find a way to let them play and be free? Why do I love this film so much? Read the following reasons.Reason 1: I love all the children. They are misbehaving, though underneath they have their own lovely characters. Gretl is my favourite! Reason 2: The Austrian scenery is spectacular, especially the first two to five minutes at the beginning. The scenery on the hill and just before Do Re Mi is good as well! Reason 3: Julie Andrews is SO good as Maria, better than as Mary Poppins in my opinion anyway. Christopher Plummer is good too, although I can't really compare him because this is the only film I've seen him in. The actors and actresses who did the children were really good as well. Reason 4: The songs! The songs! SOME PEOPLE ON IMDb GIVE BAD COMMENTS ON THE SONGS! I adore them, come on other people, please give them more credit. "Do Re Mi", "How do you solve a problem like Maria", "The Sound Of Music", "Edelweiss (I think that's how you spell it)", love them all please! Reason 5: The plot is lovely throughout the film until it comes to the end. There are many more reasons than these which I can't remember. So, what are you waiting for? Those who haven't, PLEASE WATCH THIS DARLING MOTION PICTURE! Advertised by ME. :) ;) :()</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was brought up on this film. My mum, my grandma and her mum all loved this film. It should be on the national curriculum! It's just a wonderful escapist film with no offensive language, no violence and no prejudice. It is a light hearted and lovely film set in beautiful surroundings with songs to fill your heart. People berate it everywhere and that is because they have not bothered to watch it and understand it. It's not realistic in the sense that people don't burst into song in the streets no, but it is quite lovely to watch with your family.It is no coincidence that this film has transcended all generations and boundaries and will never die. Long may it go on and my daughter already loves it too :-)I would urge all families to show it to their children. You can take from it whatever you wish. those who berate it are usually the ones who would rather watch Terminator or get pleasure from watching people having their heads mashed to a pulp by a tattooed Neanderthal in a string vest...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The opening shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, the opening shot is magnificent: aerially gliding over snow-capped mountains, through valleys and streams, and finally setting on an extended forward rush toward Julie Andrews twirling about the hills. It strikes a triumphant opening chord as a marriage of form to content, as we are being granted witness to a person's burgeoning awareness of the world around her. How can she and the camera help but sing? Her first moments and interactions with the Von Trapp family seem staid by comparison, but Wise's typically astute craftsmanship and the contrasting approaches of Andrews and Plummer to their roles proves quite fascinating. And I must mention the subplot of encroaching Nazism, which yields some brilliantly executed suspense sequences?it doesn't get much more nerve-wracking than squatting behind a tombstone with the Von Trapp family as they're being tracked by the dogs and searchlights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Readers,Probably the first musical I ever watched was Roger and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music, the sweeping epic musical love story about a young woman governess to seven children and their strict father and how she changes their lives completely. Even though I'm no longer a kid, this film still is fantastic and powerful yet beautiful and charming.Maria is a young woman trying to become a Nun at the local abbey is Salzburg, Austria. She, however, keeps getting into trouble because of her wild and rambunctious spirit. The Mother Supierior decides that Maria should be a governess, or nanny, to the Von Trapp children. Maria soon discovers how strict things are in the Von Trapp household and how desperately the children want to love their cold-hearted father. When Captain von Trapp leaves to meet a baroness that he's been romancing and his brother Max, Maria begins to teach the children how to sing and how to have fun. When he returns and discovers what his children have been doing, Captain von Trapp is furious but once he hears the music his cold heart melts and he makes his home happy once more. Romance begins to increase between Maria and Von Trapp until they finally marry. Unfortunately, WWII is beginning and Austria is occupied by the Nazi army, who are to force Captain von Trapp to serve in the Nazi Navy.The Sound of Music is Roger and Hammerstein's best musical, just like The Phantom of the Opera is the best of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Julie Andrews is beautiful as Maria and Christopher Plummer is unrecognizable as Captain Georg von Trapp. The children play their parts perfectly, albeit a little naively, and the rest of the cast do a great job also. The Songs and music are beautiful and stunning and will have you humming or even singing along with the actors.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sound of Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when saying you had enjoyed "The Sound of Music" was considered un-hip. It is still considered corny by many, but at least, compared to the stage version, it is a masterpiece. I finally saw a theater production, and could not believe how poor the text by Russel Crouse and Howard Lindsay is. Ernest Lehman really did a genial screen adaptation, eliminating songs (can you imagine Baroness Elsa singing about a marriage proposal?), relocating "My Favorite Things" to the storm scene, turning "The Lonely Goatherd" into a puppet show, or taking "Do Re Mi" out to the Alps and the streets of Salzburg. Not much was added concerning the social and political aspects of Austria during the years of the Nazi regime (which probably would have given a greater resonance to this tale of personal struggle against totalitarianism), and very little was taken from the real Georg von Trapp, a ruined aristocrat, or Maria, who was the real stern, rigid parent that turned the family into a musical act for survival. Nevertheless, other aspects of the production augmented its entertainment value. After making the horror classic "The Haunting", director Robert Wise surpassed his talent for transferring musicals to film, making the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein play less stage-bound than his work on "West Side Story". Both are industrial films, done under Hollywood's zero-degree style of film-making, but Wise did give a fresh visual treatment to the musical, airing an old property, and guiding Julie Andrews to give the best performance of her career. Finally, what I find more interesting about "The Sound of Music" is its sociological value. When it was released, it had a sedative effect on the hearts and minds of almost the entire world population, who was witnessing new cracks in the U.S. empire: the questionable presence of American troops in Vietnam with a generation of young Americans killed for expansionism and not democracy, the violent deaths of major figures of its political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the raise of violence and death on the streets... Solidarity, love, basic family values, and especially music, were sort of rediscovered in "The Sound of Music", turning it into a mega hit, and its soundtrack into a best seller.</fullReview>

She is rather mischievous and playful. The sisters at the convent get tired of her childish behavior and send her as a governess to the children of an ex-naval officer. The children are very naughty and they keep on playing pranks on everyone. Their father is a very strict person and likes the children to be disciplined. He is does not like light and playful behavior with the children. So the children become adamant and rebellious. Maria interacts with children as their friend. she plays with them , teaches them new things like music and dancing. she helps them with their problems and even covers up their mistakes from their father. She then brings them close to him for which he is grateful to her. This results in a bond between them. and during the war they flee together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sound of Heavenly Music ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite its historical inaccuracies, "The Sound of Music" is an outstanding film.I never forgave Rex Harrison for opening up the best actress envelope and quickly saying the winner is Julie...and then pausing. He looked right into the eyes of Julie Andrews and said...Christie for "Darling."Note that I said inaccuracy. As an historian, I would be remiss if I neglected to mention that Maria did not marry Georg Von Trapp in 1938 as the film suggests. They wed in the 1920s. In fact, by '38, as the anschluss engulfed Austria, the Von Trapp children were mostly grown. One son had just graduated from medical school.With this inaccuracy, we still have a glorious film about a singing family and a woman who came one summer as their governess and wound up marrying the widower.Julie Andrews is just picture perfect as Maria, the woman, who was not destined to become a nun. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Georg, who loved his children, but whose love had to be brought out by Maria. Eleanor Parker was quite effective as the baroness. She saw Maria as a rival and attempted to get rid of her. When Maria returns, she bowed out gracefully.The cinematography is breathtaking. Austria was never lovelier. The songs are staged beautifully. Who can forget I Have Confidence, Going on 16,and My Favorite Things? It's all glorious. The dancing throughout Austria was marvelously staged by great choreography.The children are just adorable and so memorable. Charmaine Carr, portrays the eldest, Lisle, at age 16. Actually, Miss Carr was 21 when the film was made and Julie Andrews was 28!Too little credit is given to Marnie Nixon, who portrayed Sister Sophia. Few people knew that she did all the singing for the nuns in the rendition of How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? She even sang for Peggy Wood in the latter's rendition of Climb Every Mountain. Miss Nixon, who sang for so many of the stars in films, was never given the credit she so aptly deserved.Norma Varden, known for playing erudite women in smaller roles, played Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper. Few people know that Miss Varden was set to play the Peggy Wood role of Mother Superior. At the last moment, Miss Varden was replaced by Wood.Go see this film over and over. The chemistry between Andrews and Plummer is terrific.Richard Haydn, as the music impresario is great. His line of "how many men that you know confer with their children on their honeymoon" was memorable. Ben Wright made for a wonderful villain who later becomes the town's gauleiter after the anschluss takes place.A film for all occasions, never to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Films Of The 60's: The Sound Of Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sound Of Music (1965): Starring Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker, Charmian Carr, Nicholas Hammond, Heather Menzes, Duanne Chase, Angela Cartwright, Debbie Turner, Kym Karath, Daniel Truhite, Richrd Haydn, Peggy Wood, Ben Wright.. Director Robert Wise, Music And Lyrics By Richard Rodgers The fist half of the 60's saw a great number of cinematic musicals, usually because the stage musicals had garnered immense popularity and because film directors and producers noted that film versions of the musicals would already have a target audience. Richard Roger's The Sound Of Music, together with "My Fair Lady", represent the height of that period in 60's cinema. The Sound Of Music is based on the true story of the Von Trapp family singers, who escaped Nazi Austria and made a living entertaining Americans and Europeans with their musical style. Naturally, the real story was fictionalized for the musical. Novitiate nun Fraulein Maria (Julie Andrews in her signature role) learns that she is not cut out for the life of a nun and her Mother Superior (Peggy Wood) quickly sends her away to work as a governess for the many children of Captain Georg Von Trapp, a retired and widowed naval captain. After the death of his first wife, he became bitter and shut out happiness, music and laughter in his home, which he runs like a ship. He is engaged to the glamorous but haughty, self-centered and un-motherly Baroness Schreider (Eleanor Parker). Maria provides the children with music lessons and liberates them from the repressive environment they've grown up with and soon they become attached to her. One thing leads to another, the Captain dumps the Baroness and marries Maria. Hitler takes over Germany and Austria and establishes his Third Reich, and the Nazis demand the Captain return to his post. But the Captain is anti-Nazi, making it clear he wants nothing to do with them, which sets off a chase. His life on the line, he escapes with Maria and the children to neutral Switzerland. This musical is bubbly and heart-warming, overly sentimental by today's standards(what family puts on puppet shows and sings acapella together along with a guitar ?) but represents a long-ago time when life was sweet and simple, and one in which family values was prioritized. This is a film the whole family can enjoy, and makes a regular appearance on ABC 7 around Christmas. British Broadway star Julie Andrews as Maria is in her element, providing the character with sweetness and girlish charm and truly this is her greatest role and one she will always be remembered for. The music is catchy, and the movie even manages to move us especially toward the end, when we sense the danger these people face when threatened by the Nazis. A good film, with strong performances, beautiful music and songs and a certain kind of nostalgic magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best musical I've ever seen - and it always will be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I was truly enchanted. It was a musical unlike any other I had ever seen. My Nanny Varnish and my Grandad Varnish, my mum's parents, bought it for me in 2001 and it really does remind me of them and it also reminds me of that very year. I was quite unhappy in that time but I also liked it and I did have some good times as well. It tells the story of Maria (Julie Andrews), a bright young woman who doesn't fit in at the abbey where she is supposed to be working like all the other nuns. Mother Superior tells her that it would be respectful to god to leave the abbey and the very thing that'd be useful for her is going to become the governess of seven children - who she finds are all very naughty. Their behaviour improves with Maria's lighthearted passion for music after all they all are very unhappy underneath it all. Maria and the seven children get to know each other better while their father Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) is away seeing his girlfriend who is slightly older than he is, I think. Their friendship grows and it is decided he'd bring her back to the Von Trapp villa and her close friend, Uncle Max played by (Richard Haydn). The Baroness wants to get to know the people of Salzberg and so a party is planned. When Maria and the captain dance and start to fall in love the Baroness secretly gets jealous and is determined to win back her man - and does. What Maria must accept is that he really loves the baroness and only likes her as a friend - but will he change his mind? The best way is to watch this fantastic movie and find out then. There is absolutely everything you would want to see in a great film; there's wonderful songs you would want to listen to again and again, romance, sentiment, beautiful real-life Austrian scenery, lavishly rich sets, outstanding performances from every actor and actress, perfectly cast and even scenes about the Nazis and just how the Von Trapp Family Singers manage to set a plan to become free of their evil reign. Well, there you have it! A film of every glorious wonder you could possibly think of. I hope that'll still remain in at least the next hundred years from now because every generation should experience the golden qualities of "The Sound of Music" - it's a film I am proud to give the full-star vote and I'll love it forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sound Of Cash In The Bank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Cleopatra" with Liz and Dicky Boy hit the movie theaters, the film almost drove 20th Century Fox into Bankruptcy and even their law suits against one another just added fuel to the bankruptcy fiasco of all time. So, in the meantime, while figuring out what to do to save Fox, Walt Disney had seen Julie Andrews in the stage version of "Camelot" on Broadway and decided that she was his "Mary Poppins" and the rest is movie history. Back at Fox, looking through their unfilmed scripts they came across "The sound of Music"; so, William Wyler, the original director who was casting the film, asked Julie Andrews to play Maria Von Trapp, and she said, "Of course! But what can you do with a Nun, a Captain, 7 children, and a bunch of Nuns?" So, Wyler cast the film, but he preferred to do something else, and Robert Wise took over. Wyler stated that he knew that the film would be a hit, but he didn't think that it would be THAT big a hit! In the meantime, at the Acamady Awards, Julie Anderews, the original Eliza Doolittle in "My Fair Lady" wins the Oscar for best actress in Mary Popp;ins, and Rex Harrision, the original 'Enry 'Iggins, wins an Oscar for "My Fair Lady", and Audrey Hepburn is overlooked for her excellent performance with too many excuses for why she didn't win! So, what made "The Sound of Music" such a hit? Good question! Not an easy answer! All the critics hated it; said it wouldn't last, but something happened, and not only did it last but became one of the great money makers of all time to the point that it played in reserved seat first run theaters for at least 3 years, and no movie had done that up to that time, but I think I have the answer: It was just right timing. There was a lot of violence on the movie screen, no musicals, no good-feel movies to leave the theater with your toes tapping with a song in your heart! Today, it would have probably flopped on its nose! So, when Julie Andrews won the Oscar for "Mary Poppins" she stated, "I've heard that you Americans are known for your hospitality, but this is ridiculous!" Next year when she was nominated for "Soound of Music", the rumor is that the Acadamy was told not to vote for her because it was unheard of for an actress to win the years in running for a musical! So, be the powers of Hollywood in those days! And in case you aren't aware of this, Marni Nixon, who dubbed singing for Deborah Kerr in "An Affair To Remember" and "The King and I", and who also dubbed partial-singing for Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady" can, for once, not only be heard, but can be seen as well singing for herself as Sister Sophia as one of the Nuns in the number "How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?" So, the cash flow saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy; but it took many years for the movie public to get over that their virginal Julie Andrews was human beings, and it too many years for Jack Warner to wipe the egg off his face for making such a boo-boo about the possibility of becoming a movie star, and Julie Anderews never, but never, worked on a film for Jack Warner! But, many have made the same mistake. There were those who said that Liza Minelli would never make it in the big-time because she was the daughter of Judy Garland! Boy! Did those know-it-alls, like Jack Warner, eat crow for many years to come!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer star in this classic musical. Andrews plays a woman who wants to be a nun, but circumstances lead her to be a governess of a widower, Captain von Trapp (Plummer) and his seven children. The young children are very cute, but it's Andrew's performance that really got my attention. (Why didn't she get a Best Actress Award???????) Capt. von Trapp is a very stern man, and will not allow his children to have any fun of any kind. That is, until Maria shows up. They eventually fall in love, get married, and you just have to watch it again and again to really enjoy it. It's nearly three hours long, but it's worth every minute. I don't see how anyone with a brain could not like this movie. Watch it! You WON'T regret it!</fullReview>

Although it's 3 hour length may put you off, these three hours are filled with the most magic this world has ever seen.This romantic movie just makes you quiver inside with happiness. The music is excellent especially because of Julie Andrews EXCEllent voice. This music gets into your head and for the next five years your stuck humming ALONG to ''These are a few of my favourite things'' The dialogue pulls you in by your feet and your sat there for 3 hours in a magical world of love,hate and adventure. The best part of this movie is definitely the actors they chose. Christopher plumber is just excellent for playing captain Von trapp and the children all fit in nicely.The lovely sunny salzburg also adds to the movie .Definitely a movie to sit down and watch with your kidsRating 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be my all time favorite movie- i am not normally a huge movie fan, but this is just a timeless classic. Who couldn't fall in love with everything about this movie. Julie Andrews has an incredible voice, all the songs are not only great but have meaning behind them too. I am the same age as the daughter "Marta" so I grew up with this movie and have seen it at least 50 times and could watch it again and again. Its one of those movies that makes you forget all your troubles and just an all around feel good movie. How many of us don't know practically all the words to the songs? I bet we can all sing them. (and were talking 40years here). By far, a movie that will live in our hearts(or at least mine) forever.</fullReview>

Why don't movies like this exist anymore? :-( "Nothing comes from nothing; nothing ever could, so somewhere in my youth I must have done something good." I will also add that Captain van Trap looks strikingly like the Kevin Kline. I suppose that it's sad, but true, that life does not exist like this, and that no hills are alive with the sound of music, but when the Captain has a moment of self knowledge about music being brought back into their lives everything starts changing, and for the better. This proves we do need music in our lives, good music. (And a good looking Naval Captain wouldn't hurt either.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unquestioned Champion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt the best movie ever made (second is 'From Here to Eternity'). Julie Andrews lights up the screen as Maria, the freewheeling nun from Nonnberg Abbey who is hired as a governess to look after Captain von Trapp's seven children. After winning the hearts of the children through song and freedom from the oppressive life their autocratic widower father (Christopher Plummer) has made them lead, she proceeds to win the heart of the Captain himself. The love story in this masterpiece is probably one of the best in cinematic history~ there are several moments when you feel that ripping each other's clothes off would be less romantic than the raw sexual tension that charges the air, particularly during their fight right after the Captain comes home and the incredibly romantic Laendler. All I can say is that if you haven't seen this movie, you must have been living under a rock for the past fifty years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, as an avid non-fan of musicals, what can I say? This just has it all - the beautiful scenery, the plot and the way the music is interwoven into it. And WHAT music, at that! Never is the music out of place (apart from, perhaps, in the gazebo as the young lovers perform "I Am 16 Going On 17" or when the Matron Nun delivers her piece of advise to "Mary"... or when...) OK OK OK So, it's not 100% water-proof, but the longevity of the piece and the brilliant performance of each and every one (the Countess's withdrawal from the marriage to the Captain must be one of the most graceful ones ever - especially considering the era!) surely makes up for any possible flaws. The anti-Nazi theme has been done a squillion times, but to manage to base a musical on the every-day chaos that ensued the Anschluss (especially with such an "obedient" perspective such as the Austrian, rather than - let's say Russian, Polish etc.), with such panache, has got to be applauded. I don't know about you guys out there, but I would rather watch this one over and over, than watching the - obviously - more realistic Saving Private Ryan or similar even a second time. Just to hear "Do-Re-Mi" makes me believe I actually was a kid around the time. And although I may be just that now (a kid), I certainly wasn't back then...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feel good and mushy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favourite things for sure. The Sound of Music has an excellent cast of annoying and funny children - as kids would be at that age - all 7 of them. I love Julie Andrews in this one, not only for her singing but also for her portrayal of the motherly Maria Von Trapp.Of course this is a timeless classic which all homes should have.. especially if you have kids. I remember my mum sitting me down in front of it when I was 3. I've watched it so many times I can write the script.The narrative is quite simple but the film's cast, the music, and the scenery of Salzburg make it extra special, albeit the backdrop of the movie is the Anchlus before (and soon after) the Nazis take over Austria. There is something in it for all the family - fun, music, romance and even a little villainry.A slight warning though, if you're not in the mood for sugary sweet lovey dovey stuff with music on top - don't bother with this one.Also, the movie is only loosely based on the Maria Von Trapp story - besides the name of the Captain, Maria and some of the places, all others are fictional - characters like Uncle Max and Baroness Shroeder didn't exist in real life. To have a clearer picture of how the Von Trapps lived their lives through this period, read Maria's (not Julie Andrews') book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers This has been my favorite movie for, gosh, about 10 years now. (Considering I'm 19 going on 20, that's an accomplishment.) I always thought it was great-it made me fall in love with Julie Andrews' talents and taught me about chemistry between romantic leads. ("Mommy, the Baroness and the Captain don't GO together-he goes better with Maria.") My roommate was in the chorus of the play at her hometown civic theater over the summer, and we watched the video of one of her performances. Their play, taken almost directly from the original Broadway version, was obviously different than the film, including a few different songs and a totally different way of Maria and George falling in love. Seeing the play, aside from giving me new ways to lovingly torture my roommie ("1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3 step together! now step-hop..."), has only made me appreciate the movie even more. I never gave Ernest Lehman, the film's screenwriter, enough credit. The play dialogue really wasn't that good-VERY schmaltzy (if you think the movie's bad, you haven't heard anything yet). The love scene came across very differently-not as playful or subtle as the movie. It just wasn't as good, let's just put it that way. The movie has great actors and a fantastic writer doing what they do best, and though the score helps, I now see that a great score doesn't a great musical make. That and the scenary-thank you to whoever made that cast and crew go to Austria-brilliant move on your part. This movie will remain my favorite, and my mother's, for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start?! This is my favorite movie of all time. The acting and directing is sensational. The music and scenery is beautiful. Movies are truly not made like this anymore! I first saw this movie in 1990 when it was re-released on video for the 25th anniversary. I was 6 years old and I immediately fell in love with it when my parents bought it. My favorite character was Marta, the second youngest, because I looked exactly like her as a child. Plus she was my age! My favorites of the children were Marta, Gretl, Liesl, and Brigitta. My favorite scenes are 16 going on 17, Do-Re-Mi, when the Captain finds the children singing to the Baroness, Liesl and the Captain singing Edelweiss, The party for the Baroness, singing at the festival, hiding in the abbey, and finally climbing over the mountain to freedom. Christopher Plummer does a fantastic job of playing the Captain. He is handsome and very charismatic. Julie Andrews, of course, was the star of the movie and also was fantastic...but we already knew that! I think that Eleanor Parker's acting as Baroness Elsa Schraeder was underrated. She played her character perfectly. I actually liked her character, although she was called the "villianess." Richard Haydn was very good as Uncle Max, he made me laugh. I only wish that Charmian Carr, Angela Cartwright, Debbie Turner, and Kym Karath had done more acting as they got older. With the exception of Angela, the other three stopped acting to raise a family.This is one of the greatest family films ever made! 10/10</fullReview>

That said I enjoyed The Sound of Music immensely. The songs were very moving and fit the storyline perfectly. Speaking of the story, unlike the case in a lot of musicals, the plot in The Sound of Music does not exist simply to move the film from one musical number to another. It is a truly memorable romance story that will stay with viewer long after the viewing experience. The entire cast is superb (the kids are adorable!). This was Julie Andrew's coup de grace. It deserves all the accolades (including multiple Oscars) it has received. Strongly recommended, 9/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful story, cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sound of Music had such a powerful impact on people because it was a film of such great beauty--the beauty of innocence and wholesomeness (the latter perhaps a bit overdone), of the Austrian Alps and Salzburg, of wonderful music, of the Catholic Church from the best light, of idealization of family and children, and of incorruptibility, which it seems we need more of these days.The screenplay is imaginative, well-executed and well-paced, set in a broad, elaborate scenic backdrop combined with the elegance of more immediate surroundings (and I had the great pleasure of visiting Salzburg and the mansion when I was nine years old, after having seen the movie three times already). So wonderful was the cinematography!! Oh, well, Dr. Zhivago won it that year. The acting is also excellent, fittingly led by Julie Andrews as Fraulein Maria, and Christopher Plummer as the stern but virtuous captain who she lightens up and marries. The Baroness (Eleanor Parker) is Maria's rival for the captain's affections, while the Captain is foiled by "Uncle Max" (Richard Haydn), who wants to get along with everyone, even the Nazis, and antagonist Herr Zeller (Ben Wright). Certainly, The Sound of Music far outdoes Maria's book, which was often quite boring. And hey, if the Captain's sturdiness of character is overdone in the film, it's also true he was the only one in the area without a swastika on his home. The music, catchy and lively, left a lasting imprint (and isn't Edelweiss ever so pretty). My Favorite Things even moves on to John Coltrane, and The Doors in Light My Fire. If you have not seen The Sound of Music, do so by all means. Aside from the film's being so uplifting, I suspect you'll agree with me that it demonstrates cinematographers should be capable of producing more than today's cheap special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I vividly remember going to the mall with my dad when I was about 7, shopping for my mom's birthday present. When my dad came across the 25th-anniversary edition video of The Sound of Music, he knew it was the perfect gift. I was less sure, until she opened the present and was incredibly stunned and happy. However, it didn't get watched until about two years later, when I was 10 and wanted to watch a movie one night. Mom suggested Sound of Music, and she began singing along with Julie Andrews right off the bat. Her friend came over that night, took one look at the screen, and burst into "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?", which was playing at the moment. Right then, I knew I was watching something unique, something wonderful. By the end of the movie, I knew I was right.I've now seen The Sound of Music over 35 times and know it ver batum, dialogue and lyrics. This movie is the ultimate feel-good film-a delightful story that provides a great escape from the drudgery of real life. The love story is so very sweet, and you're hard-pressed to find a scene that is more heart-warming than the dance Maria shares with the Captain. Yes, I'm a hopeless romantic, so I tend to like things like this anyway, but this film is different. It deals with romance, yes, but also the love of siblings and parents, the love for one's country, and the love of God all at once. I recommend it extremely highly for anyone, anytime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Beautiful Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie I ever saw in the theatre, the year was 1967.Upon reviewing it the first time it was shown on TV, I have to say this is a movie that must be viewed on the big screen, for TV greatly diminishes the effect.I remember it from a child's point of view, but this is largely a film about children for children by the child-at-heart. The plot is religious, the songs uplifting to heaven, the scenery heaven on earth. Robert Wise, the screenwriters, Rogers and Hammerstein, all the performers ? all geniuses.Then ? political reality. The pristine Salzburg is besieged by the most compelling evil humanity has ever spawned.The obvious critiques of "The Sound of Music" are its unwavering sentiment, and many viewers are repelled by its depiction of wealth, happiness and saccharin love. Any hardened adult should recall the basic message of this movie: You Find the Beauty in Life and Yourself and Those Around You.Cheers: It's a Musical. Some of the greatest songs ever committed to the stage. Wonderful ensemble cast. Exquisitely set and filmed. The best family movie ever made. The finest movie ever filmed.Caveats: Long. Religious. Sentimental, to the point of repulsion in a few of us ( not me ).Rating: A Solid, Well Deserved Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Oscar race for Best Picture of 1965 two of the year's biggest productions ran neck and neck to vie for the prized gold-plated statuette. In the end, both films won 5 Academy Awards but Robert Wise's family oriented songfest THE SOUND OF MUSIC triumphed over David Lean's somber Russian epic DOCTOR ZHIVAGO to pick up the top picture prize. The odds makers in Hollywood had predicted a certain win for MUSIC , and it did seem that the Hollywood establishment preferred the joyous strains of Maria Von Trapp's guitar to Yuri Zhivago's plaintive balalaika. There were some disgruntled movie fans who felt that the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical was an awfully lightweight choice for such a prestigious honor. Surely ZHIVAGO had more dramatic heft (granted the Trapp family had to deal with the Nazis but the song and dance element diminished the reality quotient). The only other serious contender for the year's best was John Schlesinger's contemporary British comedy of manners DARLING starring the stunning (Best Actress) Julie Christie as an amoral model living among the jet set. The less popular SHIP OF FOOLS ( a rather ugly soap opera aboard a cruise liner ) and A THOUSAND CLOWNS ( a cute, at times acerbic little comedy) were pretty much "also-rans" from the start. With the passage of nearly 40 years the reputations of both 1965's big Oscar winners have grown in stature. ZHIVAGO is the model of panoramic, epic storytelling ; as for THE SOUND OF MUSIC , it is by far the most technically proficient of all the Rodgers and Hammerstein film adaptations.Veteran director Robert Wise is the genius behind the movie's success. Although the sticky sentimentality of the original Broadway show remains intact, Wise, along with his topflight crew of film technicians ( cinematographer Ted McCord, production designer Boris Levin and film editor William Reynolds ) truly make this a motion picture experience. The story of a rebellious novice who takes a temporary leave from convent life to care for the seven "incorrigible" children of a stern widower and army captain was perilously close to being a dusty museum piece on the stage.Wise and company changed all that by making a movie that really moved, from the stunning overhead shots of the Austrian alps, lakes and countryside to the thrilling introduction of Maria as the TODD-AO camera in all its glory swoops down to meet the outstretched arms of the glorious Julie Andrews as she begins her unforgettable rendition of the title song . No other score of Rodgers and Hammerstein had the care and attention lavished on it as this one did. Irwin Kostal's orchestrations are sublime, perhaps the most beautiful ever heard in a movie musical ; it's one of those rare instances where the motion picture soundtrack outshines the original Broadway Cast album. THE SOUND OF MUSIC will always have its detractors. The plot creaks and the dialog doesn't run very deep. It's not MY FAIR LADY. But it is the work of a major film craftsman at the height of his powers , giving the audience a larger -than-life experience. They don't make them like this anymore. THE SOUND OF MUSIC is an enduring entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest musicals of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My parents rarely let me stay up late when I was a child, except for when "The Sound of Music" was playing on television. My brothers and I thrilled to the music, singing along, and enjoying late night treats.These were happy, nostalgic days, days which I remember happily as I now watch this in DVD format along with my own children, hopefully providing them with good memories of staying in on rainy days.We all know the story: Young flighty nun Maria (Julie Andrews, with a zest for life, has trouble fitting in the abbey, so she's sent to be a governess for the children Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer).Maria is the first governess who treats the children with love, and lets them learn lessons in a more natural way, and encourages them to sing and play and be children, in contrast to the strict, regimented way their father had taken to raising them since the death of his wife.This wonderful nature causes Captain to fall in love with Maria, and break off his engagement to Baroness Schraeder. As a family, they must struggle to escape, as Capt. Von Trapp has been ordered to join the third reich.While the story is loosely based on the true story of the von Trapp family, what I enjoy most of this is the musical numbers. I find some of the actual artistic license to be a bit corny, but it is a musical, so just sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sound Of Music is a simple movie. Its plot and how it was laid out is simple in a way that it makes you wonder why it gives out such a great impact on the audience. I found myself greatly inspired by this film. After I watched it, I seem to love life a little bit more. The Sound Of Music truly proves that simplicity is beauty.The songs performed in this film are all timeless classics. The Sound Of Music is a delightful movie for all ages. Everyone in the family of today could relate to the characters in the film even though this movie was made almost 4 decades ago.I couldn't think of a better artist to play Maria than Julie Andrews. Her voice is ever so captivating and her acting is excellent. She's perfect for the role and she gives a performance of a lifetime.The whole cast is amazing, especially Captain Von Trapp (played by Christopher Plummer) and all the adorable 7 children.It's amazing how this movie can touch you. It's one of those movies that you just can't get enough if you loved it the first time you saw it, undoubtedly you'll watch it over and over again! It deserves every award it got especially being the Best Picture in the Oscars during its time, or even more. This movie/musical will remain one of the few best classics ever. And everyone in the world should see it!</fullReview>

In a span of almost three hours, you get to see a short tour of Austria and learn a great deal about the Von Trapp Family.

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Movie **spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of my favorites. Though it is long, the scenery is captivating, and the characters are engaging. Maria, the nun turned governess, is played by the lovely Julie Andrews. Andrews is remarkable in her role as the governess of the seven von Trapp children. She has never looked more beautiful, or sounded more wonderful, than in this musical classic. She presents her emotions with great feeling, especially in the sequence (part 2) by the gazebo with the Captain. "I must've done something good..."The Captain, played by stage actor Christopher Plummer, is a stern man who appears to have no heart. Plummer presents this facade perfectly, and displays his range between stony to sincere when the Captain hears the children singing and begins to sing along with them. You can see the Captain's love for his children in this scene, and when he sings "Edelweiss" with his oldest daughter, Liesl.The children are a pack of wonderful, talented, good-looking individuals (Charmian, Nicholas, Heather, Duane, Angela, Debbie, and Kym). I was so interested to find out what these people are doing today, so I bought Charmian Carr's book, "Forever Liesl". It was a very good book, and worthwhile read. I learned so much about what went on in the movie when i read it. This movie...I don't know...it seems like the type of movie that people would make fun of, yet no one dares to. Maybe that is because we can all relate to this movie in one way or another. I sure can. It has changed my life in the most positive way. A beautiful, beautiful movie that will live in all of our hearts for years to come. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Always makes me weep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far my favorite movie of all times. I'm a sucker for all Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musicals, and this one is the best one of all. Perhaps because I was 8 years old when it came out in 1965. My uncle played viola for musicals and I saw it before, but I always loved this movie especially. Boy, did I have a crush on Julie Andrews! Then there's the fact that I come from a musical family, so the film's theme of music overcoming Nazi Germany was a very moving point.This is a children's, or "family" movie. I am a believer that children need music education and a respect for traditional European music culture. There are many factors that work against children receiving such cultural exposure today: elimination of traditional music education in public schools, the synthesizer revolution taking over the music world causing kids to mess with danceable synth drum tracks instead of learning an orchestral instrument (which is more difficult), emergence of non-European cultures in America creating a resentment toward white-based traditional music education, Modern (atonal) artistic music asserting itself causing more resentment of traditional (usually Romantic based) European music education, the constant emergence of new styles of popular and artistic music causing less &amp; less room for traditional music to hold its ground, etc. etc.I believe that this is a shame because there is a certain subtle appreciation for music that is instilled in people who are allowed exposure to Romantic Classical music. Of course, classic Broadway music owes much to such Romantic music. Nowhere is this more evident than in this film, which theme essentially asserts the importance of European classical music for children's education, and does so in a manner that makes such music education FUN! Julie Andrews style. Indeed, traditional music education techniques were being challenged at the time of the making of this musical (the emergence of 50s rock &amp; roll). This appears to have been R &amp; H's nostalgic statement for the cause of retaining the old musical values by way of revealing just how fun learning Solfege (Do-re-mi etc.) can be! That is, if you have a really cool governess to play games with in the gardens while you learn the tunes.God! I wish I could go back to those days!Read it &amp; weep, baby.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so perfectly made, that most of its critics point to its "sweet" story, as a problem. That, of course, is a matter of taste. The film itself, is flawless. Every aspect of the Broadway show has been improved upon for the film version. Julie Andrews, who was was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, and should have won, is more than the foundation for the film's perfection. She is simply without peer. There isn't anyone who could have played the role better. Her performance is so overwhelming, that during its initial theatrical run, she became an international obsession. Of course, the film doesn't end with Julie. The direction, screenplay, cinematography, orchestrations, scenic design and the entire cast, are excellent. This film was meant to be seen in a theater, on a super wide screen (that most cities don't even have anymore). As it is, on home video, you must see it in its widescreen (letterbox) version. The current DVD edition is about as good as you can hope to see it. A 40th Anniversary Edition DVD is soon to be released. Avoid the sing-a-long theatrical version, at all costs! When it's said that "they don't make 'em like that anymore", they're talking about "The Sound of Music". It is perhaps the best film ever made!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just bought the new DVD version of "The Sound of Music" and I am just as in love with this musical as I was when I saw it for the first time as a third grader some 10-15 years ago. And I still get teased for liking this movie!I can understand why some people might be turned off. This movie has been called "corny." And while some of the dialogue is questionable at times, the songs more than make up for it. They are all very delightful and catchy, from "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?" to "Do-Re-Mi." If you see this movie, don't be surprised if you find yourself singing the songs to yourself days afterwards. They are simply infectious!The actors also transcend the occasional shortcomings of the dialogue. The von Trapp children are energetic and likeable. I especially liked Liesl, played by Charmian Carr. The scene where she sings "16 Going on 17" with Rolf is unforgettable. It is a shame that "The Sound of Music" is Carr's only film. She really has great talent.Julie Andrews will always be remembered for this film. You just fall in love with her from the moment she opens her mouth to sing the opening song. Christopher Plummer is also terrific as Captain von Trapp. Every time I watch the scene where he sings "Edelweiss" to his children, I am genuinely moved. I also loved the sexual tension between Maria and Captain von Trapp. I know that this movie is a "family film", but even as a child I found it strangely erotic, particularly the party scene where Maria and Captain von Trapp dance together in the courtyard. The tender love scene between Maria and the Captain after he breaks up with the Baroness is also very erotically charged.This movie is definitely one of the most sentimental films I have seen. To some people, this is a bad thing. But I bet if they gave this movie half a chance, it wouldn't take long for them to be enchanted. It is such a great, moving story. The photography is breathtaking, the actors are wonderful, and the songs and choreography are not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hills *cough* are alive *swallow* with the *splutter*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has had an indelible impact on popular culture. How do I know this? Because recently I sat through an end of term school musical featuring my cousins which drew heavily from it, although it was called 'my favourite things' to avoid any copyright complications. This startling production interpreted the material in a way that made Robert Wise look like a no-talent. The opening "What are we going to do about Maria?" song was sung by both nuns and Nazis. Was this a political critique on the alleged cooperation between the catholic church and National Socialism sadly left out of Wise's shallow version? And do you remember a black Nazi in the original? It would have been a better film if it had one, I'm sure. Rad to the highest degree, I think is the parlance. On the stage, our Maria dwarfed Captain Von Trapp who was in danger of being trodden on and looked about six. Actually, I think he WAS six. Was Christopher Plummer dressed like a restaurant Maitre De? Perhaps if he had been his performance would have seen a bit less, well, wooden. Or stiff. Idle vice, idle vice.However, all doubts were dispelled when the headmaster insisted we join in a rousing rendition of 'Climb every mountain'. Great! I always loved that song. It always filled me with a profound motivation to go and make a cup of tea. The Rogers and Hammerstein score, I thought, was so complex that only top notch talent could pull it off. I was wrong. Four year olds can do it. Providing you confiscate their mobile phones as a motivating tool. This film is so sacharine that I can only watch bits and pieces of it. Behind a re-inforced concrete pillbox with goggles. Ear muffs optional, but recommended. Fantastic romantic scene 'You are sixteen' has not been bettered since. The school play tried, but "You are ten, going on eleven" didn't have the same resonance (and sounds a bit suspect too!)But where the two versions come together is the triumph of evil by good. Sadly, Robert Wise missed out on the inspired idea of having the Nazis chase each other in circles everytime they are given an order like in the school play, but Hollywood never did get satire. But who cares? The music lives on long after our teeth have rotted. And if our Julie can no longer sing "The hills are alive", then there are plenty of toddlers who can take her place. As long as a percentage of the box office take can be negotiated with their agents, of course. And I can do it too."CLIIIIIIIMB EVERY MOUNTAAAAYENNNN....CROSS EVERY STUREEEEEEEEAM!I'm parol....I mean, I'm free from next thursday onwards.</fullReview>

I have viewed this film in it's entirety many times and never fail to be impressed with the wonderful acting abilities of Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. The children and the music have also contributed greatly to ensure that this movie will never lose it's appeal to all age groups. Number one on the "family movie" hit parade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie! Well, yeah, I'm a sucker for musicals, but this one's the best in film that I've ever seen.First and foremost, the casting was great. Julie Andrews did perfectly well as Maria. Her interpretation was more than appropriate. Christopher Plummer did well, too, only he would have been better if he was the one who sang (or was he?) The kids really looked alike! I especially liked that cute little Gretl.The songs blew me away. Julie Andrews' voice gives me goose bumps! I just love her singing voice.The choreography was a blast, too. It was very similar to theater choreography: lively, unshamefully exaggerated, and graceful.Hands down: this is a can't miss classic.</fullReview>

Julie Andrews was born to play Maria, the novitiate too much in love with the world. The story is rescued from the cloying by the subplot of opposing and escaping the encroaching Nazi stranglehold on Austria: love, beauty, and harmony survive as witnesses to the right and the good, in a real world run suddenly amok.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last year I was at a movie conference in LA and the panel/audience were lamenting the lack of action heroine roles in movies. I commented that the action heroine may not be a likely role (as there are in reality few action heroes). I pointed out that a female heroine might take a different role, ie, she might be a nun, use singing as a weapon, and outmaneuver the Nazi regime while saving her family and husband. The "Sound of Music" probably doesn't make many of the action movie lists; yet it certainly has an active, female lead who is a heroine.</fullReview>

It was a pity that Christopher Plumber was not allowed to do his own singing but instead had a voice over. Julie Andrews acting certainly deserved the Oscar that it was denied. My favorite scene was of Julie Andrews leaning against the wall in that beautiful blue dress, watching as The Captain sang to the children in the lounge. What more can I say, I have seen it so many times and never tire of it, each time I see it I realize that I have missed something before, each time is a new revelation to me.

		<shortDescription>Pure Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw The Sound of Music, I was with 50 other 14-year-olds in a tour bus. We watched the movie because that day we were arriving in Salsburg, Austria, where it was filmed. The chaperones figured the cultural enrichment would be good for us. That was some time ago, and then I didn't really appreciate the real beauty of Music--understandable, I suppose, since some kid kept kicking my seat and yelling "Where's the beef?" But the movie is so well-known and revered all over the world, it's become a basic cinematic staple. In Salsburg, tours feature landmarks made famous in the movie. You can buy music boxes in any souvenier store that play "Eidelweiss." They're still nuts about Music over there. And in a way, I suppose everyone is. The movie is a double romance. The obvious one is between Maria and the Captain. The other, just as powerful, is the love of music. The only character I really didn't like was Liesel--pretty as she was, she seemed a textbook musical actress--fake and perfectly rehearsed. But the famous gazebo scene with Maria and the Captain is still my favorite, as is their lovely dance at the party. Incidentally, it was Julie Andrews who was originally slated to play Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady (the role went to Audrey Hepburn.) Hepburn's singing was dubbed by Marnie Nixon, Sister Sophia in Music. She appears in the "How Do You Solve a Problem..." number before Maria rushes in.If you haven't seen it, why not? Even if you're the kind that just mocks musicals for their cheesiness, watch it and do that. It's a great movie experience, even after forty-some years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie at the Queen's Cinerama in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. I was 8 or 9. I fell in love with a)Julie Andrews b) Angela Cartwright c) Cinerama d) Rogers &amp; Hammerstein and e) Chris Plummer "Ham"ming it up in great style. So many things to love. Particularly the orchestrations. How I wish the classic soundtrack included healthy measures of the incidental music, for example from Do-Re-Mi. That wonderful scherzando "toy piano"-sound version of Favorite Things as the family teem out of the Von Trapp estate's gates. Such a shame there were never enough good projects for Julie Andrews. I remember when she used to appear on shows after TSOM and sort of tried to shrug it off like a ghost, and yet it has turned out to be the defining performance of her career, and rightfully so. She has such a deft touch with humor, in fact that is one of the aspects of TSOM people overlook, in many areas it is done with great lightness-of-touch. As noted by others: Richard Haydn's "Heil Hitler" and countless others. And the scene in the Abbey graveyard with the torches is made truly eerie, especially on wide screen as the torch beams play and the shadows deepen and the Trapps huddle. In my opinion it is these little "homey" touches (the runners-up at the Music Festival) of humor which make the whole so infectious.And the script is superb. "You have to look for your life. You have to lead the life you were born to lead." plain and powerful. To "Your face is all red" in my favorite scene in the whole movie: The Landler sequence. When Julie and the Captain suddenly spark high voltage. And then the wonderful line "I can't remember the rest" seems so true to life. It's the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, without question, one of the best movies ever made. OK, it's sweet and simple, but what's wrong with that, anyway? I'll take that over the mindless, loud, trashy, computer-generated drivel being made today. The Sound of Music never fails to lift and inspire the best that is in me and I believe that is a large part of its tremendous appeal. It speaks to our noblest ambitions and most dearly-held beliefs--freedom, family, God, country, love and the beauties of the world--the things that no one can ever really take away; the things that matter most. Combine that with how beautifully crafted every element of the film is and you've got a classic, worthy of repeated viewings and of passing on to successive generations as an example of a well-made film that is truly a credit to all who participated in its production. Beautiful music, outstanding performances, exquisite scenery, strong themes, humor, adventure and romance--it's got it all. If I knew I was going to be stranded on a desert island with my VCR and only one movie, this is the one I would choose. We need a little more innocence today and a whole lot of cheering up. Thank heaven for the Sound of Music--long may it endure!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will always have a soft spot for this film, as I presume many others will too. A film that is the definition of 'classic', and will remain forever in the hearts of the audience.The acting is amazing, evoking many emotions from the audience. Andrews is just phenomenal and fits her character so well; a strong minded and outspoken personality who does as she sees fit. Her character is just so likable and the characters of the children so lovable. The chemistry between all of them is just spot on and you can tell that they have actually gotten close to each other. The acting brings out the sincerity of the characters which may well be why this film is able to transcend time. Though there are some little awkward/cheesy moments in some scenes, but those are easily forgettable.The songs and the way they were sung and executed is just perfect. Disney is phenomenal at making songs to match the lively moods of films and the lyrics are so catchy. I hadn't really known the lyrics to 'Do Re Mi' before, but after paying attention to it again, it's pretty clever.The landscapes are so beautiful and the cinematography does it justice with great panning, aerial shots and the full use of spacing.It is truly amazing how this film has transcended decades and just celebrated it's fiftieth anniversary. A film that gains new fans every year and I hope it will never run out of popularity. With an emphasis on family and love, this is truly a majestic film.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hills are still alive with the Sound of Music! This movie is amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is an adaptation of the 1959 Broadway musical of the same name, with songs written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, which in return is based off, the memoir of Maria von Trapp, 'The Story of the Trapp Family Singers' in which two previous movies were made. 1956's the Von Trapp-Family &amp; 1958's Von Trapp in America. This movie is very loosely based on true events, but it didn't stop from this beloved musical directed and written by Robert Wise to become a huge hit. The film tells the fictionalized love story of Maria Kutschera (Julie Andrews), a young Austrian postulant turn governess whom job is it, to tend to the seven children of the stern widower, Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). The children are uncooperative and the captain isn't much help, until Maria wins them over, sharing her love of music, but soon Nazi sympathizers, became to undermine her work, by moving into her beloved Austria and preparing to take over. Can the Von Trapp's family escape or will the Nazis destroy everything, she has work for? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film. The movie seem like it was trying really hard to mirror, the same success as Julie Andrew's previous film, 1964's Mary Poppins by having a similar plot-line. Both movies have a stern disciplinarian father figure that was turned around by a musician gifted nanny. In my opinion, I don't felt like it was a rip-off, because Mary Poppins goes into a more magical journey; while the Sound of Music is a bit more grounded and realistic. While, I like both films, I think the Sound of Music is way better than Poppins. While, the movie is set in the 1930s, Julie Andrew's character is an example of the ever changing woman of the 1960s. She's more open in challenging the standards gender expectations of a woman and how mother should acted. While she's acts like a mother figure, unharness, liberate mindsets and attitudes of the emotionally neglected children. Unlike Julie Andrew's character in Mary Poppins, Maria is more careless and youthful in her actions. She means well, but she tend to become troublesome, due to her challenging the brooding, dignified lifestyle of the times. She willing to challenge the narrow-thinking parenting approach on how the children, should be raise and be more fun-like when doing it. Julie Andrews's character holds this film together. She's convincing, as both the free spirited wild child and semi-authority figure in this film. It's easy to see why so many moviegoers find her as a good mother figure, lover or friend all rolled into one. Meanwhile, Christopher Plummer is spectacular as Captain von Trapp. He played the character who proves to be the film's hard rock. He keeps it solid and grounded between saccharine romance and compelling drama. While, he dislike making the film, his riveting performance feels so believable that you can see him, turn the hardened captain to loving husband and father. He was never too mean, that you couldn't find him likable. While, the movie makes him, mean. Georg von Trapp in real life was pretty outgoing and was the one whom taught the children music. Both parents depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living and why both really got married. Despite that, it kinda work. The children were pretty good in their acting and very cute, but there were too many of them to remember. The only one that had a sub-plot story, was Liesl (Charmian Carr). I enjoys the romantic duet "Sixteen Going on Seventeen" about her. Without spoiling it, her love affect with the post-boy was very shocking and heart breaking. The music in the film are some of the best ever from a musical. The movie is filled with memorable glorious songs like "Do-Re-Mi," "Climb Every Mountain", "Maria", "Lonely Goatherd", "My Favorite Things," "Edelweiss, "So Long, Farewell" and others. I love the way, each song was reused in different ways in reprises. Other songs like "Something Good," needed some more work. Glad, they eliminated, the not so good songs, "How Can Love Survive" and "No Way to Stop It. The way, the movie is shot is beautiful to watch. The opening shot of the movie of the ALPS mountain range is breath-taking. The movie makes great use of the locations in Austria. It's really hard to find faults in this film. Some critics say the movie is a bit off putting cheery and dated, even in its darkness moments, but in my opinion, I think it does a good job bringing heavy realism. A lot of people might hate its pacing. After all, it's nearly 3 hours. Did we really need the 3rd act? Controversy surrounded the film's release in Germany &amp; Austria, where the film's Nazi overtones brought about the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act due to the laws. The American studio forced the third act to be restored to the German release, which kinda anger people. In my opinion, the whole 3rd act with the Nazis wasn't needed. It really didn't play out like that in real life, nor did it had much music. Most of it was there to offset the general joviality of the first 2 acts. I don't mind, that it's there, but I can see why some people think it's seem out of place, even with the foreshadowing in the first two acts. After all, if you take it, away, you still have a pretty good film. Despite that, I really didn't see much to hate about the film. After all, the film went on to win Academy Awards. It even got selected for film preservation in the National Film Registry. It's also nice to see the movie get newly restored DVDs every ten years. Overall: It's engaging, inspirational and cute. It's a must watch. The ultimate family movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sound of Music 50th anniversary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1960s were an era of haunting Bollywood musicals with Dev Anand-Shammi Kapoor- Dilip Kumar-starrers giving us some unforgettable songs. Their melody set to extraordinary lines were on just about every pair of lips.It was in such a scenario that The Sound of Music opened in Calcutta's famed Globe theatre, and its gripping story and innumerable songs caught on - giving a run for their money to the likes of Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar, Anands and Kapoors. Incredible as it may sound, the man on street - bhadrolok or otherwise - was heard singing Edelweiss and Do Re Mi.Fifty years later, The Sound of Music - helmed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer - is all set for a huge celebration. This will begin on March 2 in Britain and March 10 in the US with the release of a five-disc blu-ray DVD digital HD collector's treasure. The blu-ray disc will include 13 hours of additional content with a brand new documentary - - The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg - telling us all about her recent visit to that city of magic and music where she was once Maria, a young woman in a secluded abbey training to be a nun. As the film opens with a zoom shot of Maria -she grows from a tiny speck on a marvelously undulating patch of greenery with the Alps behind her - singing 'The Hills are alive with the sound of music', the movie pans across to the abbey. The sisters there are wondering what to do with Maria as she rushes in - late as ever for the prayer. "How do you solve a problem like Maria", they burst into a song - smiling and good natured though, a reflection of times perhaps when kindness and compassion ruled our lives. The golden jubilee commemoration will continue on March 26, when Turner Classic Movies (TCM) will pay a tribute to Andrews and Plummer with an opening night screening of The Sound of Music at the sixth TCM Classic Film Festival, running from March 26 to 29. Movie historian Robert Osborne will introduce the brilliantly restored film, and moderate a Q&amp;A with Andrews and Plummer (who played Captain Von Trapp).This meeting of Maria and Von Trapp will be sheer nostalgia for two of the greatest actors we have known. In fact, no scene in the history of cinema has had such intense sexual tension as the dance number in the movie where the two are doing the Landler, an Austrian- German folk form, which was forbidden in parts of Europe for about 50 years in the 18th century.The Sound of Music, which won five Academy Awards - displaced Gone With The Wind (which was already 26 years old in 1965) as the highest box office grosser of all time.And why was it such a big hit? The answer is simple. It had a fascinating story that moved seamlessly through some of the sweetest songs one has heard. Top this with Andrews' excellent performance against the superbly scenic Salzburg.In fact, Andrews was the first choice of Wise, although his list included Grace Kelly and Shirley Jones. Kelly and Jones might not have been quite suitable for the Maria we saw on the screen -- bubbly, mischievous, innocent, sincere and utterly lovable. Otherwise, how could a widower like Von Trapp - so strict that he used the whistle to call each of his seven children - fall so deeply in love with this simple girl who is not chic or polished. Remember that scene when she rings the bell at the Captain's villa. When a man opens the door, she announces: "Captain, I am your new governess". To which he answers: "I am your butler".Wise had seen Andrews in Mary Poppins, which was yet to be released then. A few minutes into a special show of the film, Wise told the producer, "Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this movie and grabs her!"The Sound of Music was inspired by the Von Trapp family singers. Many things were changed in the film. The Von Trapp family had ten children; seven were from the Captain's first marriage, and three more children came after Maria and Georg Von Trapp were married. In the movie, the children's names, ages and genders were also changed.The real Captain Von Trapp was a warm and good-humoured man, not the hard and cynical character seen in the film. This inaccurate portrayal distressed the Von Trapp family greatly.Another major deviation in the movie was that the real Maria did not fall in love with the Captain at first sight - as the move shows us. Maria once said: "I fell in love with the children and married their father; I got used to the father, and we were very happy."Even the climax has been tweaked. The Von Trapps did not flee to Switzerland walking over the Alps, an escape made possible by the nuns at the abbey who pull out a wire in the car used by the Nazis to chase the family. The Von Trapps left by train to Italy in clear daylight. Eventually, they made their way to the US mostly with the money they made singing. Once in America, they settled in Stowe, Vermont.Despite these so-called inaccuracies, The Sound of Music was adored by generations of cinema buffs. And when it opens again, it will probably be a grand hit.</fullReview>

Anyone who doesn't rate it 10 out of 10 is probably not someone worth knowing, because they clearly don't enjoy anything. I'm really not sure what else here is to say. I have no idea why there is a minimum length for a review. What is this, a junior high school book report? I've said what I wanted to say about the performance, the story (didn't want to reveal any spoilers as it is best enjoyed without prejudice), the actors, the songs, and everything else. If it's going to be an onerous task to write a review, I won't bother in future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly deep and thorough creation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did you know Sound of Music is partly about Austrian nationalism against Nazis? How about that it is based on a real family? Besides the quality of cinematography and acting, there are two things that set this musical apart from other films: one is its iconic catchy songs and two is its surprising depth.As for the songs, you may find yourself humming just moments after they are finished, before the movie is even over. They do not overpower your brain but there are definitely some musical hooks involved in the melodies. The songs are quite different from one another, in style and rhythm. Perhaps one weakness is that all the songs are happy songs and the movie struggles adapting its happy music to the more serious moments in the film.The movie does this trick where the characters sing the same song twice (at least) but the second time they sing it in a different situation, modifying the meaning of the song or adding more meaning. While the effect of this is quite good, the change is only a minor one in the meaning and not the mood, because most of the songs are too happy to make any change to the mood made. And even to change the meaning, the creators end up needing to modify the song. Only one song, Edelweiss, ends up sounding completely different when played the second time and without any modification to it.As for the depth of the film, it is felt in a number of spots: in the slowly emerging nationalistic sub-story, in the psychological situation of the main male character, in the subtle humour and children's commentary.If you have only seen little bits of this movie and its title you can be forgiven for thinking that it is just a sappy love story in a form of a musical, and for the first half of the film it is kind of heading that way, but it turns out to be much more than that.??I don't like musicals, but even I cannot deny the greatness and quality of the Sound of Music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Music is certainly divine. It brings order in chaos and peace in life.Music is what Maria brings into lives of the children of Georg Von Trapp. They in turn become loving, sincere and disciplined kids.This film is certainly about music, the impact of music and how music can be used as a tool of inspiration to children. From the song "How do you solve a problem like Maria?" to the inspirational "Do Re Mi" to the title song "The Sound of Music" and the other wonderful song "My Favorite Things", these are exceptional songs that are tailor-made to the script and carry the narrative forward. Even the final song "So Long" is done wonderfully by everyone. Credit to the composers Richard Rogers and his team for this. Also, the director Robert Wise who had a vision and let the songs flow into the narrative fluidly and let the songs speak for the movie, is a wonderful thing.this is certainly one of the great musicals that will be there for as long as movies exist. The well placed nuances, the theme, the characterization blended with the glorious style and the grandeur set in the alps. It makes this a great movie. Yet, I have only one thing against this and it's the plot. The plot is predictable and thus making me lose fun in between the film itself. The climax is pretty simplistic and comes in haste. barring these, the rest is mellifluous and poetic.No wonder why many musicians have loved this film. Even I love this, wish it was more unpredictable. A 4/5 for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very romanticized telling of a virtuous female's coming of age story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People like this movie because of the ideals it represents. Now a days it's a rarity to see such ideas being put forth in cinematic form. No Way! It was nearly in rare form when it came out. The Story is about Maria, a faithful believer in God. It starts with her trying to do her best at being a nun and failing. Thus, moving her into the story line of her finding her life. The music and the production are the backdrop to this.The production has nothing to do with real life Austria except that it's filmed on location there and the scenery is breathtaking. If you're from Europe or are German/Austrian you probably going to find the whole thing to be laughable if not offensively American. But it's a Hollywood film and the story and musical were written in America.In spite that, the production and direction of movie are very, very Well Done. Robert Wise new what he wanted from this movie and he stylized the whole thing to create a very nice pastel hues atmosphere to go along with the very Idealistic story. I read one reviewer who said that Andrews deserved an Oscar for her part. Blah! The parts were not that hard to act...the characters aren't dramatic. That being said, the actors in the movie were very fine actors and played their parts very well...Eleanor Parker, Chris plummer. If you watch the movie enough times, and you start paying attention to the faces of each character throughout the movie you realize everyone of them stays in character through out all of their scenes. especially Parker and Andrews. their faces are always reacting to exactly what's being said. It's just actors who know their craft and very good and superb direction.However, I don't know if anyone could have played the part as iconic-ally as Andrews did. I also don't think this movie would've been as popular had she not been the female actress to play the part. her sweet persona and voice just do the virtuous, honest Maria Von Trapp role so succinctly. She's truly beautiful in this movie.it's by no means a mind blowing drama. It's a very romantic movie (Happy Ideals being hyperbole-ed). It's the wholesomeness of this movie, the archetype "Mother" figure who comes in and saves the day that people really enjoy. They like the fantasy of it all very much to the point that I believe it gives them hope. Other critics laugh at it or are disgusted by it's over use of saccharin, but the movie's cultural following speaks for itself. The lyrics of the songs are Great. Climb Every Mountain is a beautiful song..if you really feel the message of that song, it will get you every time. I saw another reviewer complain about how ridiculous the scene between Maria and the Mother Superior was.."could not take anymore". I was like "What?!" that's like the best part of the whole movie. Such a wonderful scene of a nun in modern culture opening up and being vulnerable to a student..Leading by Example. The song is perfect in taking the place of the dialogue. Such a powerful moment in the movie. The one song in the entirety of the movie I don't like and wish they would have written differently is the "somewhere" song that the Captain and Maria use as a duet. I don't think the lyrics have anything to do with the movie and it's clear they created it to add to the kissing seen for the romance. I don't mind them singing together and enjoy the intimate romance of the moment but the song sucks. It needed different lyrics.In the end, I believe this movie deserved the best picture Oscar in 64...I do not think the actress needed any nods. their parts weren't that difficult. But putting everything together, it all made for quite a very well done movie. Especially for a musical. One of the most mature and professionally made musicals ever to be produced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never liked this movie much as a kid during my first 2 viewings of it. Probably because I was made to watch it with my family and it took ages to come to an end. As I got older I really began to appreciate it. Surprisingly, because it reminds me of my family and watching movies with them in the living room during my childhood. Go figure.Can this film be somewhat sappy? Yes. So what? Buddy Holly love songs like "Dearest" are sappy and they are brilliant. Is this film anywhere near the real story that actually took place? No. However, as a story for the screen, it holds its own separate life. People say the songs suck. I dig them all.I think I like this movie cause I love music. I also think this film hearkens back to a more innocent time. Or maybe thats being a slight bit nostalgic. Either way, I suppose i long for the kinda innocence displayed here while i live in this day and age. I like this movie a great deal despite its flaws and inaccuracies. Actually, I love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saccharine? Yes... but also wonderfully entertaining and supremely well put-together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Already a successful Broadway musical, it was inevitable that The Sound Of Music would eventually be turned into a film. Not so inevitable was the extraordinary level of critical and commercial success that greeted the film ? it scooped numerous nominations and awards at the Oscars and Golden Globes (winning Best Picture at both), and usurped Gone With The Wind as the highest grossing movie of all-time up to that point. A colossal hit with critics and the public alike.The deceptively simple story charts the experiences of Sister Maria (Julie Andrews), a postulant nun at a convent in the foothills of the Austrian Alps. Maria is a constant nuisance to the other nuns with her happy-go-lucky attitude and terrible record for punctuality. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) questions whether Maria truly has what it takes to be a nun, and suggests that she goes out into the world to experience more of life and see what she truly wants from it. To aid her to this end, the Mother Abbess arranges for Maria to take up a post as the new governess at a nearby mansion, where the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs assistance bringing up his seven children. Maria is initially shocked to discover that the Captain treats his children like a military unit, whistling them to order and expecting exemplary behaviour and time-keeping of them. A long line of governesses have come and gone, either fired by the Captain for failing to meet his impossibly strict standards or driven out by the mischievous antics of the children. Soon, however, Maria brings a sense of fun and freedom into their world and the youngsters quickly come to love her. The Captain himself is mellowed by Maria ? she brings music and joy back into his life long after it had faded away. Two things threaten the happiness of Maria and the Von Trapps ? firstly, the Captain is engaged to a wealthy baroness (Eleanor Parker) from Vienna, even though it's plain as day that they're not meant to be together; secondly, the Nazis are slowly increasing their stranglehold over Austria and expect the Captain to join their navy as it gears up for war, despite him expressing devoutly anti-Nazi beliefs. Ultimately, the Von Trapps' only choice is to flee from Austria and seek safety in neutral Switzerland if they are to live out their days in peace.From the opening aerial shots of Alpine Austria through to the closing view of the Von Trapps marching over the mountain-tops into Switzerland, the film is a visual treat. Ted D. McCord's cinematography is fabulous (indeed in most years it would have been showered with accolades? but 1965 was dominated by Freddie Young for his sterling work on Doctor Zhivago). Scene for scene, however, The Sound Of Music is majestically shot, a real feast for the eyes. The performances are uniformly excellent ? Andrews is incredible as Maria, Plummer excellent as Captain Von Trapp, and Parker very convincing as the jealous baroness. Even the child actors ? so often the weak link in otherwise well-acted films ? are superb in this one. The Sound Of Music has often been criticised for being saccharine in the extreme, a claim that even the film's most ardent admirers would struggle to deny, but there are enough pleasures to be had from viewing it to forgive such shortcomings. Certainly few musicals can claim to contain as many classic songs under one roof (How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria, Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going On 17, Edelweiss, My Favourite Things, Climb Every Mountain to name only some) while many of the more celebrated scenes are so iconic they're instantly recognisable even to people who've never seen the film. The Sound Of Music is a feel-good classic and a thoroughly watchable (and rewatchable) film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sound of Music opens with stunning aerial shots of the Austrian natural landscape. The camera then sweeps down and moves forward toward a speck that grows larger and larger to reveal?Maria (Julie Andrews), the lead character, running with unbridled joy on a grassy hilltop, and breaking into the title song with such gracefulness and confidence that it is impossible not to fall in love with her at once. This famous opening sequence sets the tone for the entire film, one of hopeful optimism, as director Robert Wise creates a near-perfect motion picture adaptation of the Broadway musical, together with original songs by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein II.Written by Ernest Lehman (West Side Story, 1961; Hello, Dolly!, 1969), who adapts the material from Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse's book of the same name, The Sound of Music tells the inspiring story of Maria, an assertive nun-to-be who is forced to leave her convent temporarily to become a governess to the seven children of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a Naval officer and widower whose strict authoritarian rule has caused his children to lose their freedom and childhood. Maria's arrival brings change to the lives of the children, and slowly thaws Von Trapp's cold and cynical heart, mending his heartbreak of the last few years, and giving him a newfound purpose in life.Winning five Oscars including one for Best Picture, The Sound of Music is set during the pre-Hitler years in Austria, and features some of the world's best loved songs such as "Do Re Mi", "My Favorite Things", and "Edelweiss". In fact, one of the most unforgettable moments in the film shows Plummer strumming on the guitar and singing "Edelweiss" to his eager children. Many of the songs are catchy and fun to sing along. More crucially, they are well-linked to the narrative, and with every repetition, they add a new layer of meaning to the emotions the characters face in the different stages of the film.Andrews' energetic performance is the heartbeat of this film. Without her, The Sound of Music would not have been half as successful. She acts and sings as if she was born for the role of Maria. Despite the long runtime, Wise's picture is never at any point lackluster. Andrews' likable screen persona and strong screen presence bring forth a high degree of engagement with the viewer. It is difficult to take your eyes off her whenever she appears on screen, and this is especially so when she is together with Plummer, who shares with her an intentionally awkward chemistry that provides the film with most of its humor and drama.One may drown in the wonderful music and songs, but at its thematic core, The Sound of Music is a film that teaches us to stay true to ourselves, to know our identity, and to share the meaning of joy and living with others. If there ever was a great motion picture that everyone in the family could enjoy, you are looking at it. Perhaps the most memorable of dramatic musicals, The Sound of Music promises an entertaining, satisfying, and heartwarming three hours of cinematic goodness that year after year still remains thoroughly rewatchable.GRADE: A+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hills are alive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year (2010) marks the 45th Anniversary of the release of one of the world's most successful movie musicals.'The Sound of Music' started out as a Broadway stage musical with Mary Martin as Maria and Theodore Bikel as the Captain. It was the smash hit of its day. This is a movie that has dominated the Bank Holiday TV listings for many a year, but the reason they keep showing it is because people will always sit down and watch it. Now, for a film with a duration of 174 minutes to grab a large audience with every repeat viewing, it must have something really special going for it. There aren't many films that have such great repeatability. It may not be 'cool' to admit to liking 'The Sound of Music' but those of us who are not repressed are unafraid to express pleasure openly and proudly, when it suits us.The audience has been waiting for this moment, having sat through several minutes of beautifully shot 70mm aerial footage of the mountains and lakes ? but it's that moment when the shot cuts from wide to close up on Julie's wide armed spin that causes a rising feeling in the chest.This film is absolutely great! The acting is great, the music is great, the direction is great. This is truly one of the best movies of all time.By far, the best musical ever.</fullReview>

I realize that there is a lot of 'sugar' in this film, however, it remains to be one of my all time favorites. Unlike so many movies these days, this movie is filled with joy and happiness. My Mother took my 5 siblings and I too see this when it was re-released into theaters years after it came out in 1965(they used to do that with the bigger movies - before the days of VHS and DVDs). When we left the theater and walked home that evening, we talked about the movie the whoooole way, and sung the songs in it. It made such a wonderful &amp; powerful impact on us, and to this day it is a family favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hills are alive...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is one of the most famous opening scenes in film history. Shot after beautiful shot of the Austrian hills, one after the other, until in the final shot we notice a tiny little figure off in the distance. The camera moves in closer to reveal that the figure is of course Julie Andrews who does a little twirl, spreads her arms and bursts into that oh so famous song. And immediately you get the sense that this movie is going to be something rather special. Critics will say that The Sound of Music is overly sweet and sugary. Well, what's so bad about that? We can use a little sugar now and again. This may well be the ultimate feel-good movie. There are so many reasons why this film is, for so many people, absolutely one of their favorite things.The film's story is so familiar that a recap of the plot seems rather pointless. Suffice to say that it is a great story which provides a worthy foundation for the moments, the songs, the beauty and, above all else, the performances which make the film so memorable. Of course as great as the cast as a whole are there is one performance which stands above the rest. Has any performer in any role in any film ever been as perfect as Julie Andrews as Maria in The Sound of Music? The perfect look matched with the perfect voice. Her acting is superb. Her singing is the stuff of legend. How do you solve a problem like Maria? Don't even try, just allow yourself to be charmed by her. And she can work her charm on anyone, even the toughest nut to crack, Captain Von Trapp. In the film's other starring role Christopher Plummer's Captain provides the perfect complement to the unrelenting sweetness of Andrews as Maria. But of course it will turn out that he's not really as deadly serious as he initially seems. At least he won't be after Maria brings some desperately needed joy back into his family's life.Yes it seems Maria is too good to be true. She's absolutely bursting with life and everyone around her gets swept along for the ride. And the audience gets swept along too. There are so many moments here to bring a smile to your face. Everyone remembers the songs of course. And well they should, they're spectacular, with "Do-Re-Mi" in particular being just about as fine an example of film-making as you'll ever see. Brilliantly choreographed, beautifully photographed, exquisitely edited...that sequence is pure genius. But this movie is so much more than its wonderful songs. There's the engaging story and the beautiful scenery. There's the tremendous cast, headed of course by the wondrous Andrews but with plenty of opportunities for so many others to shine including the young performers portraying the wonderfully precocious Von Trapp children. If there is any real quibble with the film it's that the third act seems a little tacked on. There's a natural high point in the story which would seemingly have made for the perfect, happy conclusion. But with the Nazis lurking in the background of the film's story throughout you knew they eventually had to rear their ugly head. So right after that natural high point it's Nazi time and the third act takes on a very different tone from all that has preceded it. Deep down you know the third act is important, that this is how the story really has to play itself out. But with all the dark, foreboding drama at the end you can't help but think you'd just rather be watching Julie Andrews get in another pillow fight with a bunch of children. But the film's conclusion, while certainly not all raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, does allow for its own moments of triumph. Ultimately the film gets the rousing conclusion it so richly deserves. The Sound of Music is an absolute treasure, a film which will be beloved for all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still entertaining and a little bit moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not see The Sound of Music until maybe 15 years after its initial release. For some reason, my mother and father did not feel I should see the film. Did my parents think it too long and too slow for someone my age (nine years in 1965)? Did they consider the story and the film's style more suitable to girls and women than to boys and men? Did they fear that a situation or two might upset me? Maybe my parents recognized that while the movie did not include any scene truly scandalous or controversial, they did not think the subject matter would interest me. Whatever their thinking, I recall that this movie that I was discouraged from seeing had apparently created something of a craze across the nation. I remember clearly that in the town where I grew up elementary school teachers, during the 45 minutes devoted 3 times a week to chorus, led their students in singing songs from the Sound of Music's soundtrack, just as high school music instructors included elements of The Sound of Music in the annual On-Broadway production that 17 and 18 year-olds performed for any and all members of the community to attend.Julie Andrews, herself, had an impact on me, as she did on many other people, who seemed rather enamored of her. In addition to her cute looks, she projected a wholesomeness and innocence -- qualities embodied, not coincidentally, by both her Mary Poppins and Sister Maria characters -- which caused audiences to treat her more as a role model than as a movie star.Because of its powerful theme song and various other catchy tunes, awe inspiring cinematography, fine acting and an inoffensive script, light humor, and plot involving a significant historical event, The Sound of Music can give the impression of having been made during an earlier era. Despite all the straight-laced characters, however, The Sound of Music may have reflected the culture of the 1960's more than viewers realize.Sister Maria may not behave like a rebel, but she does show herself to be an individual, who recognizes her inner conflict and comes to realize that a life of devotion to God and many hours in meditation within the confines of a convent don't suit her. More notably, her mother superior, rather than reproach Sister Maria for feeling pulled by both the natural and human activity beyond the walls of the convent, encourages Sister Maria to heed her inner voice and to pursue the interests that fulfill her, even if that means forsaking a higher calling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maria, living in Salzburg, Austria, is studying to become a nun.But the convent life is not meant for he, for she's a free spirit who rather sings on the mountains.So the Reverend Mother sends her to the residence of naval officer, Captain Georg Ritter von Trapp to be the governess to his seven children.He's a widower whose raising methods are strict.And his household used to be filled with music.But now Maria brings the music back in the house.The baroness Elsa is about to be the new mother to the children.She's the total opposite of Maria.Eventually Georg finds the beauty of Maria, and finds the music.At the same time some dark clouds are hanging over the von Trapp family.It's 1939 and the Nazis are in power.Mr. von Trapp is not a supporter of Hitler's Third Reich.But now the Reich wants him, but he rather wants to be free.So they all sing at the Salzburg Music Festival.They are the winners of the first prize, but they do not appear on the stage.They run away, and in the end we see them all free hiking over the Alps to Switzerland.The Sound of Music (1965) is directed by Robert Wise.It's written by Howard Lindsay and Russel Couse.The story is based on the true story of the actual Maria von Trapp.It's based on the Broadway musical, with songs written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II.The song list is numerous, and most of those songs are timeless classics.I really loved My favorite Things and Do-Re-Mi.This movie represents some perfect entertainment.And it is a movie of a darker tone as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hills are alive with the sound of music! The timeless classic seems to always capture hearts everywhere and take a hold of audiences and their emotions. Sound Of Music is a sweet romantic movie with variety and a beautiful storyline. The story takes place in Austria around the 1930's.A young woman by the name of Maria(Julie Andrews) is trying to become a nun but miserably failing at each attempt, that is when the convent receives a letter from Navy captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), asking for a governess that can take care of his 7 children. Maria is given the job in hope to do better..The captain's wife is dead and he is often away. The children keep managing to run off the former governesses and have resentment towards Maria at first, but her kindness, understanding and fun loving nature win the children's approval and the captain's. The home is run by a strict hand; much like the captain runs the ship he sails on, but as Maria spends time with the family, the home soon changes into a happier household and music is brought back into the family's life.As time goes on, the captain and the governess both fall in love with each other and end up getting married. The whole family now must escape Austria, so that the captain won't be forced to fight for Germany. The decision tears the family because of their strong nationalism, but gets them closer to one another.The movie is based on a real story and a real family, who escaped Austria during Nazi control. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer really portrayed the essence of the family and their situation. The movie overall was very heart warming and a classic to watch. I found the cinematography to be outstanding and breath-taking, showing off Austria's beauty in many frames and a joy to watch.I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie. It has everything you want from a movie, tragedy, comedy, romance, and a message. The film is very moving and hard to forget.</fullReview>

I always make him play them so I can sing along with them. We all know the story. We know of at least one of the immortal songs from the musical, "The Sound of Music", "Do-Re-Mi" or "Edelweiss"(which is my favorite) . Julie Andrews was believable and unforgettable as the sweet, outspoken nun turned governess. Christopher Plummer was dashing as the Captain, and the supporting cast was one of the best I have ever seen. Fond memories have been remembered from some of the unforgettable sequences of this film that deservedly made it the best picture of 1965. The Sound of Music" is one of the worlds best loved treasures which keeps bringing generations of viewers to its attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>is it just me, or does Julie Andrews look sexy in an apron?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time, which is strange, because as a rule I avoid musicals. Happy, peppy people singing and dancing and clicking their heels with joy--give me a break! However, there are exceptions. I must be the only straight man with both this movie and "The Wizard of Oz" in his video library. There is a reason: Julie Andrews. She had that knack (rare these days) of being sexy in a wholesome way. "The Sound of Music" plays like an English-language version of the popular German/Swiss/Austrian genre the "Heimatfilm" (homeland film), generally wholesome family dramas set in the Alpine region full of blond, blue-eyed Frauleins, lonely goatherds, and lots of yodeling. Since Salzburg is the home town of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, it seems more plausible for people to spontaneously break into song and dance here than it does in a New York ghetto ("West Side Story") or an oppressed Jewish village in czarist Russia ("Fiddler on the Roof.") There are dark clouds on the horizon, however, and as the Anschluss approaches, Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) of the defunct Austrian Navy (Austria is landlocked now, but until World War I their empire included coastal regions of Italy and Croatia) must decide where to take his stand. He makes his sentiments clear by ripping in half a Swastika flag and flees with his family. This is an immensely enjoyable film filled with beautiful music and great choreography. It's corny, sappy, and shamefully manipulative--but what's wrong with that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you solve a problem like Maria?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this movie is long, but it is a timeless musical nonetheless. The thing i loved most was the songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason why I love it is the magnificent performance of Julie Andrews as Maria, a young woman who wishes for a better life, I suppose. Maria is pretty, with a beautiful voice, mixed with brashness and sadness, all the qualities that Andrews gives to her performances. The only film she disappoints slightly in is Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as well as the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. i can't pick a favourite scene, but who can forget the opening and the "Do ah Dear" sequence? i also thought the children were sweet and the film had a number of clever subplots, like Liesels's secret love. 10/10 for a musical, that should be in the top 250. It was number 2 on the Greatest Musicals, losing out to Grease. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic, in every sense of the word.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie more than any other movie. It has been a personal favourite since I was 3 and I have never become sick of it. The movie is so charming, enjoyable and utterly watchable.Julie Andrews is divine in the role of the outspoken wannabe-nun, Maria, who becomes a governess for 7 children in a slightly dysfunctional household. She has one of the most beautiful singing voices you will ever hear and her singing appears utterly effortless. She is a lovely actress and has so much screen presence.Christopher Plummer is wonderful as the seemingly cruel (but actually just desperately sad and overwhelmed following the death of his wife) Captain who relearns how to love, laugh, appreciate his children and sing with the help of Maria. According to some reports, he hated making the film, but you would certainly not be able to tell - his performance is sincere and heartwarming.Each of the seven children is lovely and sweet. They are all capable singers, dancers and actors. It is great how they are so featured in the film, and don't just disappear when they are not 'important to the story' as happens in so many films! This is such a heartwarming, tender and compassionate story, based on the life of the Von Trapp family. I was thrilled to be able to go to the Sing-along-Sound-of-Music and see how many people - old, young and in between - are still enjoying the magic that Robert Weiss created so many years ago.Even if you do not like the idea of this film, or do not enjoy it, I believe that it is a film that should be seen by all. It is a piece of motion picture history. A true classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>View it as a great fictional movie based very loosely on a real family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will always be a favorite of mine for the holidays, even though I know the facts where drastically changed from that of the real Von Trap family and their story. But even with that it is a very well done and charming story. I don't usually like musicals but this one has had my attention since I was a child and has become an annual event in my family, even if I have to watch it alone I have it on every year. I even put up with the teasing I get from my friends over liking it.Back in the 90's a saw an interview with the real Maria Von Trap and she was talking about how different the movie was from her book. I never believe Hollywood when they say based on a true story that usually means they kept some of the names and none of the facts, so I decided to get her book and get the facts behind the Hollywood facts of the movie. I found the book very well written and of course very different from the movie but it never dimmed my enjoyment of the movie. I just look at the movie as a nice piece of fiction and enjoy it separately for the real story.Besides, we all know there hasn't been an original thought in Hollywood in decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The string between bona fide sweetness and sappy over-romanticizing in movies is very difficult to describe, but Robert Wise's masterful and infinitely entertaining musical epic The Sound of Music is not a minor instance. The depiction of that meager good, true purity, is so superbly played by the supreme cast. There is not one moment where I feel like I'm watching plaster-smiled caricatures that come along with so many musicals. What I cherish so much about this film is its happiness and its meaning, its characters' feet being relatively close to the ground and yet their heads up in the clouds.The music of Rodgers and Hammerstein has been overlooked for being beneath the benchmark of their generation like George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Leonard Bernstein and others, but it is also unquestionable that their work on this, the perfect musical, have endured the trial of decades for the utter aptness of point in time and situation of the infectious songs that support the dramatic course, that are actually a part of the stream of the story, rather than interrupting it in its path like Singin' In the Rain. And their intrinsic catchiness carries on with both school and professional musical theater in innumerable revivals.The musical numbers work magic visually, as the choreography is sometimes almost logistically impossible, but not in that it uses any special effects. Many musicals would either be much better without the music or much better without the story. The Sound of Music's fun and energizing music is inborn. I would not have the story any other way. It would hardly work.Taking place in Austria's beautiful countryside, Maria, played by Julie Andrews, is studying to become a nun but is not sure if convent life is right for her. She's just too musical and spontaneous. Can you blame her? So she is sent to be the governess to seven children, ranging in age from sixteen to five, of an overzealous widower naval commander, Captain von Trapp, played with seamlessly masked resentment by the great Christopher Plummer. Maria and the Captain right away conflict on the way the children are cared for. The Captain has been raising them in keeping with the ethics of military authority, whereas Maria wants them to take pleasure in life as children. In spite of the children being initially naughty and unwelcoming to Maria, in spite of Plummer's overwhelming rigidity, we love them all immediately.Would a Captain whose wife has passed away not find the naval discipline that he'd been living with for so long to be his first mechanism against the pain and heartbreak of his wife's death? And is that not an indirect manner of showing love to his children, by making their lives so strict and systematic that they cannot take the time to reflect on what life is like without a mother? The Von Trapp family is lovingly developed and, as should be the perogative of any story by no means excluding musicals, are the footing for the rest of the story.The reason The Sound of Music works so wonderfully well is because we are lost in the same perfect world with this unique but natural little family in which love, music and beauty are one, and then when the outside world doesn't slow down for them, we are there with them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is indeed one of my most beloved films, ever! Yes, yes, yes. It may be somewhat saccahrine and a wee bit trite, but who cares! It's good clean family fun, which is what the world is seriously lacking when it comes to the cinema these days.I first saw this film when I was 7 yrs. old on television. My 2nd grade teacher recommended that my class watch it and that we would discuss it the following week. I instantly fell in love with this film. The scenery. The children. The puppet show. The songs. The music. Oooh, the music!! Unforgettable til this day.I was one of the 18,000 fans at the Hollywood Bowl Sound of Music Sing-a-long Festival back in 2005, and seeing this wonderful film with so many people who also really love this movie, was an incredible experience that I will never, ever forget. All of the actors were there at the event, except of course Ms. Andrews and Mr. Plummer. I got to meet most of the actors and took pictures with them, which was a thrill of a lifetime, I assure you.In any case, this movie means so much to me. It is and forever will be a classic for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie of Childlike Hearts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in my childhood I heard an interesting proverb: "words hold a power but if they are supplied with tunes, they are twice as powerful." I had not realized how true it was until I first saw THE SOUND OF MUSIC, seemingly the most appreciated musical ever made, the action of which is set in Salzburg, Austria in the last happy days of the 1930s.Most probably, it is meaningless to present the content of the movie since a lot has been said about it by other reviewers. I'd rather focus on something that requires more analysis and I apologize if it seems too subjective for you. Yet, I feel an undeniable need to share those thoughts with people who read my comment. I'd like to discuss the powerful message of THE SOUND OF MUSIC. This movie, being loved but also despised by various viewers, is not as easy as its story. Perhaps a fairy tale good to be seen on Sunday afternoon with a family, but perhaps a thought provoking film that, besides all its colorful message conveys a profound message that addresses both human heart and human mind. After all, the movie does not have friends only but raises contradictory reactions too. Why?THE SOUND OF MUSIC constitutes a sort of catharsis. Everyone who feels lost in materialism of today's lifestyle, in vanity of today's consumption and in brutality of today's rat race faces another world here: similarly to Von Trapp's family when Maria enters their home. Like her entrance supplied the whole family with forgotten music, the film supplies a viewer with forgotten treasures of humanity: simplicity, pure love, joy, respect for nature and, most importantly, admiration of music... the treasures which are not so unavailable and vague but which lie hidden deep within one's heart. Robert Wise did a terrific job showing a combination of sweetness and profoundity, of humor and sentimentality. Consider, for instance, very gentle love scenes of Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As a result, this film is purely a movie of childlike hearts and sublime emotions compared to a blissful moment of spiritual climax. One of the song says: "(...) A dream that will need all the love you can give, everyday of your life for as long as you live." How can you ignore that profoundity as a viewer? Isn't that a short "definition" of what greatness is all about?As for the cast, the performances are very good, especially from the seven children and Julie Andrews who portrays her character with vitality and enthusiasm. A lovely sequence in the picturesque landscape when she teaches the children the notes will long remain in your memory. Christopher Plummer has a more difficult role of Captain Von Trapp who is reluctant to the new governess and her methods at first but, in the long run, gets through a sort of rebirth and the rise of true Love. This "rebirth" is caused by facing pure joy that leads him to admiration and cleans him within. The moment they sing "Edelweiss" on the stage is absolutely sublime and Plummer does the top job as someone who deeply desires to express the love and compassion for his nation. I also liked Peggy Wood as Mother Abbess who constitutes a very positive image of a nun giving profound wise advice.As for other artistic features, the film has a wonderful cinematography with absolutely stunning pictures filmed in the picturesque landscape of Austria. Indeed, the hills seem to be alive with the sound of music. It also has brilliant moments that constitute a real burst of vitality. Yet, it is important not to put this aspect as the key one when analyzing the film since THE SOUND OF MUSIC cannot be limited into a nice picture, melodious songs, fine moments and adorable faces of children only. It is much more...THE SOUND OF MUSIC is an oasis of human treasures for today's viewers, its charm will bloom and grow as long as there are people who can notice a wonder in the simplicity and sublimity of a child's smiling face. Yes, Maria with Von Trapp children and all childlike hearts round the world, go on singing because the world needs your song...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A short review of The Sound of the Music. The good and then the bad. Here are the good ones: 1) Julie Andrews is bumbly, sweet and lovable. Here acting is par excellence. Her comic timings are great.2) The supporting actress too has done a great job. Her emotions are juggled well.3) The music: Too good. Even Opera music is delightful to hear. I adored the title song ' The sound of the Music'. Even other songs were great. Some were slow but the combination of fast paced happy and slow songs didn't lower the movie's spirits.4) No vulgarity. Even the kissing scenes were marred in the dark.5) The movie is lovable and heart warming. Can be seen many times.6) One of the few classics that doesn't have the actor and the actress talking about love and crying all the time.The bad, though there are only two points: 1) The main actor wasn't really good. He looked comical rather than stern and he seemed a bit fake in acting.2) Though the movie was great, I wish that it was a bit shorter. Even cutting about ten to fifteen minutes would have improved it greatly.Whatever cons might be, it still is a great movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been a musicals kind of guy. I thought The Rocky Horror Picture Show was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've avoided most others like the plague.The three hour runtime of this movie always put me off, but I finally saw it with my girlfriend a few weeks ago and was astonished at how likable the film was.The fact that it was good wasn't a shocker since it's an all time classic that won half a dozen Oscars, but the fact that it could pull me in amazed me.The story is compelling because of Julie Andrews' performance. She pulls you into her plight, which seems a bit one dimensional at the start but fills up with more emotional depth as the story presses on and becomes more wrapped up in everyone's lives.It discusses formerly taboo subjects like the Nazi occupation of Austria and what it felt like to be an appeaser versus a renegade in a time where people's true patriotism was tested.I couldn't think of this movie being more fulfilling and well-done. See it. It's a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie when I was about 5 or 6 years old and didn't think anything of it but now that I am 14 years old and am old enough to appreciate and understand the storyline I am in love with everything about it: the breathtaking scenery of Austria, the exciting storyline and most of all, the classic songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein.Has Julie Andrews ever been captured more beautifully? As a huge fan of hers I love the way she captivates the audience with her natural beauty and sparkle. She absolutely lights up the screen as Maria von Trapp and is fantastic in her role. She truly deserved the best actress Oscar for her performance. Her voice is incredible, one of the best I have ever heard and the last note of the "do re mi" sequence proves that. Her acting is just as good as her singing and I believe that this picture shows that she is not only a brilliant stage actress but is also a legend on the screen.Christopher Plummer gives a slight darkness to the film as the stern Captain von Trapp which is great because it gives variety to the characters in the film and shows that not all of them are sweet and sugary.Eleanor Parker (Baroness Shoerader), Richard Haydn (Max), Peggy Wood (Mother Abbess) and all 7 children form a great supporting cast and add to the success of the movie.The Sound of Music is truly a classic movie and will be around for many more years to come. If you haven't seen this movie then I strongly recommend you do because I guarantee you that you will love it. It is unique in that it does not rely on drugs, violence, sex or bad language for its success and is just simply a brilliant masterpiece suitable for all ages.Exquisite!! 10/10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sound of Music is a film that I find to be cloying, too cute, sugary and overlong. Miss Andrews seems to be doing another Mary Poppinesque role here, yet for some reason, I absolutely LOVE this film. I don't know if its the story, the magnificent photography, the high quality of the acting, the first class production values, or the songs{all of them are excellent}that do it for me. Prehaps I'm just a sucker for it, or prehaps it contains something that is lacking from today's hard sell high concept films. It takes me back to a more innocent age when the so-called family films were made with heart, class and intelligence. This one can make me feel good when I'm down and no matter how many times I've seen it, it always works.After all, isn't that what movie-going is supposed to be about? Highly recommended on all levels, they will never make 'em like this anymore. Thats a shame, but thats a fact of life in contemporary Hollywood these days.A genuine classic that seems to get better every time you watch it. Grand entertainment and the best musical film ever made, it is truly one of my favorite things!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Background story more compelling than the musical comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sound of Music is an almost universal favorite, even with he-men or liberal sophisticates who "don't like musicals." I'm not wild about musicals either, especially since popular culture began a whispering campaign that said all guys who like musicals are gay. The splashy, funny story about a postulate Catholic nun who leaves her convent for a trial-run at being a regular adult, and then finds love with a suitable leading man who happens to have 8 very talented children is a good adaptation of boy meets girl, and there's lots of hilarious lines and situations to carry a lesser story to box-office success. What really makes this movie compelling is the background drama showing a definite conflict between good and evil. The anti-nazi stand that Capt. Von Trapp takes against the forces arrayed against Christian decency in 1930's Europe is both admirable and dangerous. The Capt. has lots to lose: he's very rich, socially prominent and he's courting a sexy Countess who's wealthy too. His friends council to be politically-correct, go with the flow and just bend a little to the new National Socialist overlords who've just seized control of his country; "compromise and be wise." Von Trapp is outraged that his inner-circle is both so greedy and so cowardly. The background plot is serious like West Side Story is serious, but has enough of a frivo- lous front story in it that you may not notice the moral that Sound of Music teaches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a film which made me and other Indians of my generation actually listen to and love English songs. Earlier, to us English songs were unintelligible 'hooo' and 'haaaa', opera style. Now, 40 years after I first saw it (saw it in the cinema 5 times between 1967 and 1982)it remains sheer magic, the songs exquisite in the simplicity of the words and melodies. It is a film which has been rubbished both for its music and everything else, and yet it is perhaps my 2nd favorite film, English, Bengali and Hindi combined.The title is perhaps one of the most appropriate ones. The film is all about what music is and what it can do to one's life, and also what its absence can do.</fullReview>

But knowing the general public they will be fickle and go and watch it and see what the film is like. Its bad enough Andrew Lloyd Webber is doing a stage production and looking for a Maria on TV. I think he thinks he cant do no wrong but I think he will get his comeuppance with this one hopefully.

Andrews and Plummer are quite good in the leads and the children are all adorable (awww!). The cinematography beautifully captures the Austrian countryside. It is all masterfully guided by Wise, an under-rated director who also made the other great musical of the 1960s, "West Side Story." Despite its great length, it manages to stay engaging, thanks to a fine script. Most of all, there is the wonderful music of Rodgers and Hammerstein, including "My Favorite Things," "Do Re Mi," and the title tune, starting with that memorable aerial shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was feeling bad and listening to "the sound of music". My heart got touched and many tears came out. Then I went to the internet to find out who wrote that musical. It was someone that was raised Christian. We got the same salvator the same big brotherheart! No musical ever touched me before like that! The music is a little old for me cause it's from the 60's but soooo touching! F.ex. when the children sing "the sound of music" and their father is fading in with his voice, or "edelweiss", or the energetising "do-re-mi"-song where the children learn notes...followed me for weeks!It made me clear (once) again: The way you look to life is what decides if your heart is happy or not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sound of Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been hailed as the greatest musical of all time, it has been on TV every year (especially at Christmas), and it is still one of the most seen films in cinema, from Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still). The film begins with the spinning and singing "The Hills Are Alive" from Maria (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Dame Julie Andrews). She is the nun sent by Mother Abbess (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Peggy Wood) to the Von Trapp family to become the new governess, mainly to look after the seven children of Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). As the story goes, Maria falls in love with the wonderful children, Georg turns from grouchy to cheerful, and of course, he and Maria get married. The film is not all happy though, it is after the wedding that you are reminded of the time period the film is based in, World War II, where Georg refuses to be part of the war, and the concluding scenes have the family escaping the Nazis through the monastery. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Irwin Kostal, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. "Do Re Mi" was number 88, number 64 for "My Favourite Things" was number 64, and "The Sound of Music" was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, other songs include "(How Do You Solve a Problem Like) Maria", "Sixteen Going On Seventeen", "The Lonely Goatherd", "So Long, Farewell" and "Climb Ev'ry Mountain". Dame Julie Andrews was number 6 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, the film was number 4 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, it was number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 2 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 55 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Films, and number 2 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Sound of Music" is the best movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was one movie that stood out from all other movies it would have to be "The Sound of Music." From the beautiful acting to the amazing singing it has that "wow" factor. Maria played by the hugely talented Julie Andrews and Captain von Trapp played by the wonderful Christopher Plummer. This is one movie I can see why people call it a timeless classic because that was it is.The story is so beautifully written with Maria and the gorgeous Captain slowly falling in love. It's so wonderful to watch. In one scene a dance scene at the end you can see the sexually chemimstry between Captain and Maria just wanting to come out. In another scene just before the Captain tells Maria he loves her, the Barnoss has come out onto the balcony and you can see that the Captain doesn't want her there. I also love the gazebo &amp; the wedding scene - the church is amazing.This is a beaitiful movie and a timeless classic and anyone who says it isn't well can you show me why?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes you wish the Germans had won.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People are moved to watch films like this for the same reason they slowdown to gawp at road accidents. There's a sickly fascination to be had. A there-but-for-the-grace-of-fate-go-I-ism. It is so overblown, so saccharine-sweet, so bloody-goody-two-shoes, that you can't believe it's happening. That's why it's usually shown at Christmas, the only time appetites and sensibilities are robust enough to prevail. It's like an over-stuffed turkey, a great pile of mince pies dusted with icing-sugar, a portion of pudding too big to eat never mind digest. Seem-splitting, constitution-challenging, hernia-inducing, gut-busting feelgoodness. Nobody swears, nobody farts, nobody has a run of snot, or halitosis, or spits crumbs at others while they're talking. Nobody leaves a floater in the toilet. None of these are her favourite things.They're all so practically perfect in every way, Mary Poppins wouldn't get a look in. Which is just as well, because she was shot down by ack-ack over Dresden and died from a perforated brolly.People like this only ever existed in the imagination of Rogers and Hammerstein. They're not real. They're a cartoon exaggeration, a benign behavioural tumour grown monstrous with self-delight. You know it. Yet something inside you still wants to believe it is possible. It could never happen to you, though - only others. Like a road accident. Better drive on quick; Christmas arrives earlier every year.More sherry trifle, anyone?(BURP)'Scuse me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sign of contradiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the sound of music is, if you excuse the term, a sign of contradiction. Just reading here a few pages of commentaries one can see how different people's reactions are to it, some people loathe it with a passion that is fascinating to me, I, who love it with delirium.Going over some reviews and comments from the sixties, you can find people who have seen the movie hundreds of times and their conclusion is that it's because it really helps their psyche in a similar way that a therapy would. Indeed, I'd say a 99,99% of the people who adore the Sound of Music don't find the words to express or understand the reason. But obviously, they keep on watching over and over because there is a positive essence that affects them in a nurturing way. The movie brings into spotlight purity and happiness as something totally possible and independent of personal circumstances. One can see in Maria, as Julie Andrews herself said, the person you'd like to be if things wouldn't be so rough in their own lives. Maybe that is why Julie's performance in the movie is timeless and fresh: so sincere and real, she really *wanted* to be Maria.As a big fan of the movie, I've found myself seriously reflecting upon one question. Does it deserve the place it has in my heart as the best movie ever? I am torn at the question, because I find myself comparing it to something so disparagingly as Citizen Kane, the movie that is heralded by most critics circles and serious polls as the greatest movie ever. Yes, Citizen Kane is perfect and genius from a technical point of view. Cinematography and photography are flawless. But it's a shallow classic even if it's perfect. As Ebert said in his comments to the movie, the appeal of the story is to the interest of people in gossiping and intruding in the lives of the famous. So the heart of the best movie of all times is this? This is what is represented by the Number one movie humankind has produced? Deep question indeed. Maybe I take it too seriously, but truth is I really love arts and I think they should be taken seriously cause they are some of the few things that will survive long after we all are gone.Now, although it's a completely different genre, the Sound of Music is Art. It's the movie that contains the most perfect balance of beauty I have ever found in any other film. The beauty of the soul of Maria, the positive ethics the story has, the joy that is underneath has nothing of sugary as many shallowly purport, but instead it's a soundless song by itself. The lovely and simple score with it's unforgettable songs is just natural because so much energy and youth as it is transmitted by the movie cannot be contained and bursts out naturally. The scenery of Austria gives the beauty a character and truthfulness. It's like a master painting that transmits and communicates directly even with the less sophisticated of the spectators and manage to make a direct bridge with their heart.The script is what keeps it all together, while it's not complex it is not superficial, it has humor, irony, and fast paced wit.It all put together seamlessly makes up for, what for me personally, is the greatest movie of all time. If indeed in one thousand years nothing is left of humankind, maybe The Sound of Music would by itself be a testimony of what is the best of the human spirit. That is love, beauty and art.This is something I am very thankful for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent family musical set in Salzburg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This musical exemplifies the meaning of the phrases ' timeless classic' and 'heartwarming family movie'. Although really sugary syrupy sweet, it never loses its appeal. Not normally a fan of musicals, I confess to preferring the two other famous ones of that era, My Fair Lady and Fiddler on the Roof. Yet, I still can't resist this old favorite every time it chances to be on TV.Of course it tells the story of the young postulant, Maria, who is sent as governess to the grand Salzburg manor of Captain Von Trappe, a retired Austrian naval officer with seven unruly children. Maria comes to care deeply for these motherless children and also their rigid, authoritarian father. Conflict arises as Maria has of course planned to take vows as a nun and the Captain is engaged to the Baroness, a lady of some sophistication. Both leading stars are brilliant in their roles, Julie Andrews as the outspoken young nun, and Christopher Plummer as the dashing Captain.This movie has it all...an engaging plot, touching love story, appealing children, political turmoil brewing, breathtaking mountain / lake scenery (Austrian Alps) splendidly photographed, and of course unforgettable music. My personal favorites are the inspiring 'Climb Every Mountain' and of course the touching 'Eidelweiss'.In terms of love stories, there are actually two of course. The more mature Captain and Maria declare their love ultra romantically (and musically) in a moonlit gazebo. Julie Andrews looks absolutely radiant in this scene. Also, there is the youthful romance between the Captain's oldest daughter, Liesl (who's '16 going on 17') and her young postman ('17 going on 18'). This classic prevails partly, in my opinion, because of the integrity of its leading characters. Maria strives to do God's will, even if it should mean turning away from the man she loves in order to pursue her convent vocation. Incidentally, I was impressed by the portrayal of the nuns in this movie (especially the Mother Superior) as kind, serene servants of God (and not without humor), unlike the trend in modern movies to generally denigrate the clergy or those related thereto. As for Captain Von Trappe, he is loyal to the spirit of his beloved Austria, denouncing the Nazi occupation even at great personal expense. The film leads one to contemplate the reaction to the Anschluss many Austrians of that day must have had, if only in their hearts.I was thrilled in 1975 for an opportunity to visit Salzburg myself, a beautiful and charming city, and to see in person many of the scenes, churches, fountain etc. used in the filming of this movie. The Sound of Music is definitely an immortal classic, especially one you won't want your children to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A journey into the musical world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I luckily was brought up in a family which is quite broad minded and my parents inculcated the love of music in my mind at a very early age.The Sound Of Music has been an all time favorite film for me. I grew up listening to Do-re-mi and You are sixteen going on seventeen. It was simply great. The reason why we like this movie is basically because it is simple. The storyline , the script are all very ordinary and so they appeal to us.The music has become famous the world over. Why ? Definitely because it is melodious and the other reason is - Because it is that kind of music which appeals to all. Sound of Music is a story which deals with the life of Maria a woman to be made a nun. But the others discover that she is very much unlike them and so she is sent to become a governess to the seven children of an officer . Later it is shown how Maria changes the lives of the children who live a spartan life by teaching them to dance and sing and play . And along with that changes the life of their father by showing him that life is beautiful and lovely. They unknowingly fall for each other and get married . The further part deals with their journey - how they escape from the clutches of the Nazis and then live a quiet life , but a musical one, in the mountains. It indirectly teaches us something. Life is not just living and then dying , but doing something remarkable that will make you be remembered forever. And the love of Maria for music and nature also makes us come close to nature. Her understanding of children makes her seem to be a very beautiful person. And it shows us that children are not brats who do not know anything but if taught with patience can do wonders. The music of this film is still heard by all the world over.And in this genre too. The photography is wonderful. It fills me with wonder to see a movie which can make an impact on people's mind. This film is not just an ordinary one or a one which deals with some issue. It is special because it delivers many messages to us as I already told. A movie to be viewed by one and all !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a classic, if ever there was one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of us who love the musical theatre and lament over the fact that the original star was not cast in the movie this movie is the supreme exception. I am sure Mary Martin was wonderful as was Australias leading lady June Bronhill but there is no denying that Julie Andrews is the perfect Maria. She is indeed practically perfect in every way. The opening when the camera pans over the glorious scenery and we see Maria singing the title song must be one of the great moments in film. It is up there with the shower sequence of Psycho. The whole cast is great. One performance that just get better and better each time I see it and lets face it we have all seen it dozens of times, is Eleanour Parker as the Baroness. She is wonderful. It was great to see Marni Nixon, the great voice but unseen in many a movie. It is a pity a few grumpy old critics could not see through their bias and take the film for what it is, a joyful celebration. It gets a ten from me and it always will. I read once that Christopher Plummer was not happy with his performance in the movie but in actual fact he gave a nicely restrained gentle performance. It is indeed the role he will be remembered for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TSOM, the butt of ridicule, but VICTORIOUS in the end!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are dozens of excellent reviews written about this film that to add another one filled with gushing praise would be redundant, albeit accurate. But what I would like to comment upon is a kind of nasty, mocking cult that has grown up around this classic film. I was just a teenager when this film was released, and even though back then we were avid rock &amp; roll fans and certainly were keenly aware of how terrible it was to be thought of as "square" (we worked as much at being "cool" as we did at anything else), our peers didn't point and laugh if we ventured to say that we thought TSOM was a spectacular film. There was not the almost insidious maligning of TSOM as a joke, as a totally uncool, corny film as had developed some years later. The need to mock TSOM as sport was at a peak I would say, however unscientifically, around the late 70s, early 80s. Recently it seems to have abated somewhat since those peak years, but remnants of it still doggedly persists, even to this day. It's irrational, it's peer-driven and it's sophomoric. My take on it, again, wholly unscientific, is that after the Watergate era, anything that had a happy ending was suspect. People wanted hard reality; the musical genre itself was totally out of favor. A format in which the characters burst into song was a suspension of disbelief that audiences could no longer sustain. Musicals, unless they were WOODSTOCK or LADIES AND GENTELMEN THE ROLLING STONES, were disdained by the young. THE SOUND OF MUSIC, MY FAIR LADY, THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN were a dying breed. I surmise that because THE SOUND OF MUSIC was *so* incredibly popular, it turned out to be the biggest target. The undeniable fact it had certifiably "cute" moments was a major detriment. We had become much to jaded to respond to it with anything but cynicism. Yet anyone who actually watches this film sans this prejudice, will easily see that there are dark undertones that grow louder as the film progresses. The Nazi threat is real and it isn't exactly the stuff that cute fluff is made of. We are lucky enough to be running a new print of this title next week in our outdoor venue in Prospect Park, Brooklyn NY (Celebrate Brooklyn), and so tonight we began running the coming attraction for it. Wouldn't you know it, some of our staff, all in their early twenties (and most of whom I guarantee have never seen this film on a real movie screen), were making derogatory comments about the "The Puke of Music" as one smartass called it. Then much to the embarrassment and chagrin of these MTV generation upstarts and despite that lingering cult that says to be cool you need to loudly mock the Robert Wise triumph, an audience of 3500 who watched the coming attraction broke into spontaneous, thunderous applause as the "Climb Every Mountain" chorus crescendo ended the trailer. So go ahead, all you oh-so-cool hiphop-sters, mock away -- but deep down, you and I both know that your protests are nothing but a great sham, and like 99.99% of the rest of the entire civilized world, you *love* THE SOUND OF MUSIC. Come out of the closet....we'll all welcome you with open arms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my all time favorite movie. I just love the story, the characters, the singing.. everything. And it makes it even better, that the story is true. It wasn't some rich Hollywood-fellow with a big cigar who invented this family. They are true! The songs are great, and after seeing the movie twice, you are able to sing along with most of them. I don't have a favorite song, because one song isn't a song without the others. Perhaps the love story is a bit phony, but that is how the romantics like it. It gives us a bit of hope, that love is out there, and we can get it too... even though we're only poor nuns, with a simple guitar ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is an awesome movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always loved musicals, and this movie is a great example of a great musical. It has great songs and great scenery (and awesome reviews!) and a great cast. Julie Andrews is an awesome actress (my personal favorite) and she did an awesome job. Some of my friends don't like it because they say it's too sappy or too sing-songy or too young, but it's got a wonderful plot and it's not too sappy at all, and I don't think that two people falling in love makes for a young movie at all. Some people I know don't like My Fair Lady for the same reason (did you know that Sister Sophia, the nun with the cute face, is the singing voice for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady?) but I adore My Fair Lady, too, though not as much as Sound of Music. Henry Higgins and Eliza fall in love but neither one really wants to admit it, because Henry Higgins said he'd never fall in love and is too proud to take back his words, and Eliza is understandably exasperated with his complacency and rudeness. Almost the same, the captain and Maria fall in love, but neither wants to admit it, Maria because she is training to be a nun and if she becomes one she can't have him and is a bit confused by her feelings, and the captain because he's engaged to the Baroness. (How he ever fell in love with Baroness Schraeder to begin with with somebody as gorgeous and nice as Maria right there is beyond me, but hey, all men are kind of stupid at times.) I just love this movie.</fullReview>

The Italian version is not so good, because both voices and lyrics are of a very low level, but I soon got the English version, and it was love at first sight! It is a film about love, and I believe in love! Music is wonderful, Julie Andrews and Chris Plummer give us a beautiful interpretation, Salzburg is a wonderful city...what else could I say? I don't like musicals, but this one is something different:music doesn't seem to enter by force or "by mistake" in this story! Everyone should see it, because it makes you dream, and makes you understand what love is.

		<fullReview>At age 45, I just sat through this for the first time (plus a solid HOUR of commercials) on ABC last night. After reading a few dozen IMDB reviews, I have to say that just about ALL the comments, good and bad, are fairly accurate. My personal favorite is indy-39's theory that Christopher Plummer's character has "caused more women to enter into dysfunctional relationships and lead lonely lives in search of an unattainable male (gay?) than any other character in film history." At last, a plausible explanation for the wasteland of my single years.I have nothing as profound to say, but here is what I can offer:1) I am devoted to Miss Andrews' "Mary Poppins" 2) I am devoted to Mr. Wise' "West Side Story" 3) I will see both of those films again and again before I kick off 4) I will not see "The Sound of Music" againCapiece?</fullReview>

In reaction scenes at the party, she appears convincingly distracted, since she saw her fiancee, The Captain (Christopher Plummer) dancing warmly with the nanny Maria (Julie Andrews). The sultry character is commonly labelled the villainess, but she traveled all the way from Vienna to marry her beau, only to be pushed aside by a (younger) charmer; of course the Captain was a willing participant, too. Acting, script, direction, score, photography still exemplary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 9/21/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Robert Wise): Excellent uplifting musical with good realistic storyline based on an actual troup of family singers who escaped Nazi reign in Austria just prior to World War I. There are many singable and recognizable songs in this movie, but there also are well-done characters brought to light by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Sometimes the story gets faded by melo-dramatic romantic moments, but what the heck(it is a musical, you know). Cinematically beautifully captured mountains and Austrian landscape also lend to the appreciation of this play brought to film. There definetly are not many movies like this that bring together drama and music so well. I guess this and many other reasons are why this movie will be loved for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All around great movie, but I don't know why it beat Dr. Zhivago for best picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sound Of Music is an all around classic, with the talented Julie Andrews (who will always be Mary Poppins in my mind) playing governess to the Von Trapp family. Mr. von Trapp is a retired captain of the navy, his wife died many years ago leaving him with seven kids and a bad attitude. Because of his lack of interest &amp; nurturing, the children try to win his attention by annoying the hell out of every governess he hires. The movie opens famously, with a camera descending upon the majestic austrian mountainside, capturing a gorgeous view, as Julie runs in the grass singing. Her character, Maria, is somewhat lost, she grew up wanting to be a nun but her mentors seem to think that the quiet life is not for her. They gather together in the abbey and sing about it of course, because this is a musical. The reverend mother tells Maria that she should first go out into the world and get a job so that she would have time to rethink things. So Maria winds up as the Von Trapps' governess. Inexperienced and awkward in her new position, she tries her best and eventually wins the hearts of the children and their trust. They learn to sing and go on many jolly holidays in the hills...until daddy finds out and has a hissy fit one day, when his snobby baronesss girlfriend is over with her plans to marry him and get rich. But soon (almost three minutes later in fact) Mr. Von Trapp's stone heart breaks when he walks in hearing his kids crooning. They hug and he makes up to them in a very memorable Kodak moment. He too apologizes to Maria and this is the beginning of a love thang between them. The Sound Of Music is among one of the best movie musicals, if not movies ever made. With its touching plot and gorgeous scenery along with the music...you have a real winner. But I will never forgive it for winning out against Dr. Zhivago for the Best Picture Oscar of 1965.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: Every subject possible. Austria as it enters WW2. A Nun as she enters a seven child, motherless, family. Life as it changes from traditional to modern. A family as they escape the Nazis. Based on a true story, but greatly changed from the real truth to create the best modern fairy tale for 200 years. This story will make you feel every emotion possible. It is the most perfect use of cinematography ever. Andrews &amp; Plummer's performances are so perfect that they will have you guessing for the rest of your life.Who should see this film: Everyone. Children (8yrs upwards) must see this film, it is a total education, but huge fun with it. Adults must see this film to get in touch with the joy &amp; point of the purpose of life. Afterwards you can read the Von Trapp book &amp; compare film with reality &amp; be totally amazed!! Both are so different, yet work!! Why?Rating: 10/10. Film does not get better than this. It has love, war, romance, tension, hate, youth, age, religion, music, singing, tradition, excitement, fear, brilliant props, fantastic Real scenic locations, hope &amp; genuine talent.Why should you see this film: You must see this to 'get' what the point &amp; scope &amp; range of film is. This is the ultimate film, nothing compares to it. You must watch this, for the same reason that everyone must read Shakespeare. You do it because you want to know what everyone is talking about or to be enlightened in a media field &amp; to gain from it's treasures. You can watch this film a thousand times &amp; never 'see' every frame of it!!! It is a filmic treasure, pure Gold. For fun, you can try to guess what became of the child stars &amp; what films did they end up in? We are privilaged to be able to experience the wonder of this film at all it's levels (some are rather deep or political). Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II I thank you, you are perfection. We mourn the current absence of your genius. Cinema is lost without you, sadly, it has not been able to emulate your intelligence. But, at least we have this film to realise how great cinema should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hills are most certainly alive with this masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think that in the history of film musicals there has been a greater or more enchanting piece then `The Sound of Music`. It is set in Austria, where the views are breath taking, and from the moment Julie Andrews comes waltzing into view, singing about the hills, to the very end, the film has the audience entranced. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are great in their roles as the novice nun and sea captain, and whoever said Andrews couldn't act obviously hadn't seen this film. The songs are great and you find yourself singing about deers and yodeling for days to come, and although the film is quite lenghty at nearly three hours, you barely realise, as the film never loses its pace for a minute. Anyone who hasn't seen this film, has obviously had a very deprived childhood, as its one of the greatest films of the 20th century, and will no doubt captivate audiences for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a cynical, apparently sophisticated twenty-something like me, watching the Sound of Music brings back tons of memories. I first saw it when I was about twelve, and developed an immediate (and huge) crush on Christopher Plummer, who is still one of my favorite actors. The film is great, if taken for what it is: a sweet, heartwarming family musical. Julie Andrews is wonderful (what I wouldn't give for a voice like that!) as Maria von Trapp, and the kids do a good job, although some of their dialogue seems a bit forced. Charmain Carr, as Liesl, was perhaps my least favorite part of the film. Surely a more talented actress could have been found for the role. All in all, though, the acting is good. The songs are pleasantly hummable; no, this isn't the most brillant music in the world, but not everything has to be a masterpiece to be enjoyable. "Edelweiss" is my personal favorite. The love story is believable and touching; the ending is suitably suspenseful. You genuinely care about the family making it safely to Switzerland. To be honest, I don't know anyone who doesn't like this movie. It's a part of our collective childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this film for the first time ( I have seen the play ) I expected it to be quite corny as most musicals of this time period are. Yes, there is a lot of kitsch intertwined in this film, however, taking very little out of the final product. This film is quite brilliant and the THX edition looks and sounds as if it were made during this decade.I loved the performances of Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews. Both give performances as they were meant to be and give the film the perfect flow. Plummer is one of my favourite actors and watching this film will give you a good idea of how talented he is. The best aspect of this film is the beautiful way it was shot. Robert Wise did a brilliant job giving this film even more character, making it more than just another musical. The opening sequence of the camera coming through the clouds into the wonderous mountains is just a taste of what is to come later in the film. The way the subtle whites and blues are used to give the film a special glow is something that has rarely ever been emulated.I give a full recommendation of this film and put it in the must-see category.8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can not remember how many times I have seen this beautiful movie just as I can not count the number of my students. I showed it to my students whenever I had the chance and everyone was happy with it. I asked my students to write about it after seeing the movie and some wrote with emotions. We love the title of the movie and we love the music of it. We love the songs Maria sang and songs sung by other people in the movie.We love the seven children of the captain and we love...everything it presented.I taught my son and niece and my nephew the song Doe-Ray-Me when they were only 2 years of age. I taught my new students Edelweiss the first time I met them and they sang it in their dreams (they got to like me because of this song!) I taught every song in the movie which I can sing. I will do that so long as I am still able to teach. It is so inspiring, so instructive,telling the audience what to love what to hate. For non-native English speakers, it is film that can bring motivation and desire to learn the language well. It is more than a movie.I found my own love with the songs in THE SOUND OF MUSIC. In 1986 a new teacher came to borrow the song book in which she found the song,the title of which I can not tell(the song words go like this: You are 16 going on 17...). She fell in love with the song and later with me. We were married one year later. And our son sings this song the best in his class.All I can say is that I love THE SOUND OF MUSIC.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening sequence of this movie ( which needs to be seen on the big screen)you know that you are to be taken on a fantastic journey.Robert Wise has created a fantastic motion picture which stands up remarkably well in the test of time. The casting is excellent nobody else except but Julie Andrews could have carried this film - her personality shines through with every frame.Christopher Plummer bounces off her perfectly and who could imagine a better Baroness than Eleanor Parker (especially the looks she gives Maria after the puppet show and during Edelweiss),Peggy Wood in a her last screen appearance as the Mother Abbess ( although she was dubbed for the film )she was also nominated for best supporting actress that year. And the kids who shine especially with their scenes with Maria and towards the end of the film they act like a real family when the nazi's are ready to escort Captain Von Trapp to the navy. This is a true story with a lot of fantasy thrown in for good measure but no musical flows as freely as The Sound Of MusicWhat a way to spend an evening being swept off to magical Salzburg with Andrews and Co.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic family musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fairly engaging - and classic - family musical, although not my favourite. Robert Wise's multi Oscar-winning production sees Julie Andrews unleashing her singing voice once more (after MARY POPPINS) during a true story about a large family living in 1930s Austria during the rise of the Nazi party.First, let's get the detractions out of the way. The film is a little overlong and gets bogged down in a syrupy romance around halfway through that drags it down. I've never been able to like Julie Andrews; there's just something twee and too perfect about her, and that opinion is reinforced here.On the plus side, there are some great and well-regarded musical numbers here, and they've stayed in the public consciousness for a reason. There's a wonderful supporting turn from Christopher Plummer, and the seven children are all fine and really give the film their all. Wise's direction is strong, and he manages a fine and suspenseful climax that works well in conjunction with the sugary stuff that's come before. In essence, THE SOUND OF MUSIC is essential viewing for musical fans, even if I don't agree that it's quite as brilliant as it's made out to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had low expectations but this was just wonderful, especially Julie Andrews.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sound Of Music is possibly the biggest film I hadn't seen. It just really didn't seem for me, too cheesy and too long. I thought it was going to be a chore to get through. So I'm especially pleased to find that it was an absolute delight from start to finish. This was mostly thanks to Julie Andrews terrific performance. Her character of Maria has the most wonderful charm about her in her flaws and her wit. The first hour of her is all-time worthy but I wish there was more focus on her for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, although it goes at a leisurely pace throughout the whole thing, it does lose a lot of momentum after that first hour and we appear to switch protagonists to Captain Von Trapp in a very unsatisfying way, especially given Christopher Plummer's, albeit appropriate, bitterness.It's a shame because the story could've still been told through Maria's perspective with everything else the same and it would've been much better. That or started with Von Trapp's perspective. Either way is great. The kids are rather irritating but fortunately they're infrequent when not singing. That does pose the issue of them feeling quite unnecessary, or at least the amount of kids there are. Story lines are raised or teased then dropped. Would've been a richer film to at least close their arcs. Although the first hour is lovely, I can see why this Best Picture winner lost out on a Screenplay nomination. Its story is stretched too thin over the three hours. But it's never a bore. The songs are still iconic and effective no matter how integrated into pop culture they are and the sweeping cinematography makes it a grand emotional epic. I just wish I watched The Sound Of Music sooner.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My advice--Ignore reality and just enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains LOTS of spoilers. My advice is not to read my review at all, as it will no doubt hinder your enjoyment of this wonderful film! I mean it--DON'T READ ON.....I adored "The Sound of Music" when I saw it for the first time when I was 16. I loved the film and was completely infatuated with Julie Andrews. Frankly, this isn't at all surprising as practically EVERYONE was in love with Julie Andrews after they watched the film! What wasn't to like?! The music was AMAZING, the story very romantic and the film uplifting throughout. However, I made a mistake. I loved the film so much that I read up on the real Von Trappe family--and it was little like the wonderful family in the film! The Captain was actually always a pretty nice guy and Frauline Maria wasn't exactly 'practically perfect in every way'! To make things MUCH worse, I traveled to Salzburg, Austria several decades later--and I learned THE TRUTH!!! The wonderful Von Trappe home in the film was actually a composite of about a half dozen different homes in the area! The gazebo was miles from the riverfront which was miles from the interior of the Von Trappe home--and the truth got worse! When we visited the cemetery where the family hid out at the end of the film, we were shocked (and VERY offended) at a memorial in this cemetery for the SS--the same folks that manned the death camps! All in all, this is a case where the truth really, really hurt. And, although I am a history teacher who loves historical accuracy, this is a case where I wish I'd never learned the truth. Heck, at the end of the film, you see the family escaping over the Alps to freedom--and in real life, they just took a train to Italy!! Hrmmph!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit to knowing the words of the songs before seeing the entire movie as a child. What a magical movie to watch as a child, and even more rewarding with your own children. You somehow get lost in the family and contradictions of war, song, lyrics and love. It flows like a musical at times, cutting from song to song, but manages to involve all the characters over time, and in great depth. Wonderful score and priceless performances. You can't take away any of the elements, and although I'm not sure how you could put them together again for another era? Julie Andrews was magnificent and for my daughter it has stuck with her for years. A must see for families and a beautiful introduction to movies made in that era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of cinema's most enduring family classics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can one say about a film that now, as it gears towards its next anniversary of a 50th birthday, is loved and adored by so many? It feels, to me at least, kind of redundant trying to even write a review of it now. So really I just want to say that as a mid-forties cinema loving man I revisited the film recently for the first time in about 15 years and found it still had a magical kind of hold over me. Yes I still think it's too long, but ask me what I would cut out of the film and I'm at a bit of a loss to answer.Over the last thirty years or so it has become something of a focal point for parody, somewhat diminishing the actual film's first time appeal. Then there are the charges of it being hackneyed, but they are misplaced and very unfair for The Sound Of Music is an ode to life and music, nothing remotely hackneyed there me thinks. Bookended by stunning Salzburg scenery {seriously the opening helicopter sequence is breath taking}, the rest in between is a series of brilliant set pieces and some unforgettable Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein tunes. Led by Julie Andrews &amp; Christoher Plummer, the cast delight throughout. Yes, not everyone is note perfect, but it's a moot point really. As a guy it's at the one hour ten mark where I get something to hang my coat upon, from there on in the Von Trapp family, and their gorgeous governess, have me hook, line &amp; sinker. The Sound Of Music, one of the greatest screen musicals ever. 9/10</fullReview>

And there lies the irony. Loosely inspired by the true story of Trapp Family Singers, this musical about singing Austrian family escaping Nazis is indeed insanely unrealistic. It is richly Technicolored, fancifully romantic, clean and entertaining, made with old-fashioned class and craftsmanship... old-fashioned, yes, and in the good way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a breakthrough, nor a disturbing masterpiece, but a masterful entertainment--a great musical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sound of Music (1965)Not a breakthrough, nor a disturbing masterpiece, but a masterful entertainment--a great musical!Rogers and Hammerstein need no praise from me, and their work for The Sound of Music is so embedded in everyone's head--do, re, mi--they border on timeless, without exaggeration. Starting as a smash 1959 Broadway musical and running for years (followed by years in London), it was only a matter of time before Hollywood put together a smash widescreen version. Director Robert Wise was a perfect choice in some ways. Despite years of making less fanciful movies (I Want to Live, for one), he had one notch on his belt worth noting: West Side Story. And so the 70mm cameras were pulled out and the Austrian Alps hosted the cast and crew for the location shooting (the rest was shot mostly in Hollywood). A legendary film was born, Julie Andrews rose higher into the firmament, and the whole world was singing "My Favorite Things." It doesn't get any better than that.As a movie--the editing, shooting, acting, and so on--it is surprisingly good without being one bit original or breathtaking. It is famously saccharine, and the question is mostly whether you can stomach some very very sweet (some would say goody-goody) scenes. But listen, this is a musical, and musicals are like that--false and arch and absurd and dreamy. That's one reason we make them and watch them. The plot is a terrific romance, really--it develops predictably, but slowly, with delicious restraint. And it has the best of antagonists, too--cold hearted Nazis. The famous ending, and I mean the very end, after the convent scene at night, is weirdly brief, and shot from so far away you only get the gist of things, not any actual faces or reactions. Maybe this makes its message of hope and perseverance more universal.But all this said, it is surely the music itself that makes this movie astonishing. I have seen the movie too many times to count, but hadn't seen it recently, and as one familiar song after another came up, I heard melodies that felt as right as a good hat, lyrics that rolled into the air like laughter. It is all easygoing stuff, for sure, but slyly sophisticated, much more difficult to pull off than you can imagine (ask Stephen Sondheim). And even if Julie Andrews isn't your cup of tea, she sings with such clear ease, and in tune, and without a lot of self-conscious warbling. The music, from her, permeates the movie as fully as the scenery.Is it a perfect movie? Oddly, it is perfect at what it does, which sounds like I'm saying "it is what it is" and I don't mean to be silly. I mean, it wants to be a family movie filled with sentiment and warmth and uncomplicated psychology. And lots of great music. And it does that to a tee. It's hard to complain that it doesn't raise social issues, or the photography is pretty but stiff as masonite, or the acting is clichéd, or the plot is saccharine (yes). All of these are true, but that's like complaining that the songs in a gangster film aren't sweet enough. The Sound of Music is an engrossing, perfect, heartwarming experience if you let it be. It's a musical, remember, just a terrific musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some films where you need one celebrity to make a film work. This is one of those films. If Julie Andrews wasn't in this film, this film would be screwed. Not screwed even, probably f*cked. Though, the film is fantastic anyways. This four time Oscar winning sensation is one of the best musicals of all time.Julie Andrews stars as Maria, a nun who is just so in love with the world. The nuns get tired of it, so they send her off to become the nanny of Colonel Von Trapp's house. There are tons of kids in the family. At first, the kids don't like her, but they soon start to. There are many things going on in the house. The oldest daughter is dating a Nazi. The father (Played by Christopher Plummer) is engaged to a bitch. Maria soon falls in love with the father, and the father soon falls for her.This three hour long musical is fantastic. It deserved best picture in my opinion. If I were alive in 1965 and I was running the Oscars, I would've voted for this film also. There are many great musicals. I even loved Mamma Mia. The Sopund of music is definitely one of the best.The Sound of Music:****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Goatherd Watches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the relative disaster of "Mama Mia," I watched this. I was convinced that the way that was made was drawn from old musicals like this. In particular the first number running through the woods was from this (and copied in countless other places).On watching this old gal, I was surprised both ways. Most of it is far worse than I remembered. I mean both that the cinematic methods seemed more tired now that we can see how limited it is. I also mean that the thing within, the story is meaningless. Is this how we think of falling in love today? Probably film romance comes through just as small an aperture now, but the notion here seems too direct.But it was also a surprise. There's one scene I had to watch over and over again. Its the scene where they give a puppet show to "The Lonely Goatherd." Its absolutely amazing, everything about it. Especially notable is the visual rhythm which is composed unlike anything else in the project and I assume was shot and edited by a different crew.Its a performance of a performance, which makes it unlike the rest of the film. The pace is managed differently for each of the three levels: puppeteers, puppets and viewers, but each pace is integrated into the others. Its a small achievement, but its sweet and compared to the rest of the film seems like "Lawrence of Arabia."Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has always been and will always be considered a triumph of cinema. And it should be.This was the first movie I ever truly loved as a child. It was my favorite for many childhood years, and even now in my late teens I still consider it in my top ten films of all time. And I'm positive it will never be removed from that list, for many reasons.First and foremost: Julie Andrews. She gives a masterful performance as Maria. This film literally made the world fall in love with her. I know I fall in love with her every time I see it. She's the kind of person you just want to hug. I hope to have the privilege of meeting her one day.Besides just that, the rest of the film seems quite perfectly cast as well. Christopher Plummer turns in a spellbinding performance as the Captain VonTrapp, and all of the children are adorable. Eleanor Parker is also of particular note for creating a character who you so want to hate, and yet still feel the pain of. Richard Haydn turns in nice work as well as all of the actresses who play the nuns.And then there's the songs. Songs that I've grown up with and set my life to. Songs that have touched not just my heart, but an entire globe in a very special way. The songs are simple, yet reach deep within us all. Not to mention they're impossible to stop humming and singing in your head.A masterpiece this film has been called, and a masterpiece it is indeed. It is a film that will continue to inspire me for the rest of my life. It will always hold a special place in my heart- it will always be one of my favorite things.Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hills are alive...with the sound of music!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am someone in my late teens, and yet some may wonder why I like this movie which came out in the 60s. Interstingly enough, it was actually during my past History classes where my History teacher mentioned about this movie. The Nazi era under Hitler was part of the syllabus in my History textbook then and it touched a little in the movie itself.Enough of history over there. So, actually this movie was shown here last year like days before the musical version of it arrives here. Given my family has the tickets to go watch the musical (we were being invited to go watch), it was me who was actually more excited than anyone else in the family when the movie came out here on the local television to maybe somehow coincide with the musical production.Based on the events of Maria and the Von Trapp family (they do exist in history), the viewers are taken to beautiful sights in Austria. Now that is only a part of the movie plot. Maria (Julie Andrews) was actually a nun in a convent when one day she was being sent to be a governess to a family of seven children. When she was there, she began to bring to joy and music in the house, which was what the head of the house Captain Von Trapp once told Maria about the latter. Music was what was missing in the house. Ever since the passing of his wife, he had turned his house almost like a military of sorts.Each of the seven children has their own characteristics. It's especially interesting to see the eldest child and daughter being the one who told outright that she does not need a governess given she is 17 or something (thus the song 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen' and also one of my favourites) but yet in the end, she accepted Maria.But, the joy in the house was soon marred by the incoming occupation by the Nazis from Hitler. Anschluss, as it's being termed in German as meaning the union between two countries (considering what I had learnt in History is almost becoming rusty, oops). Captain Von Trapp was never a Nazi supporter and he make it indirectly clear. Also at this time, he has actually met a baroness and wanted to marry her. His seven children had never like the baroness one bit. They rather prefer Maria over her. Soon the Captain understood his children's intentions and he marries Maria.Still, given the political situation in Austria is getting a little sticky with the intending Nazi occupation, the Von Trapp family plotted a way to escape after a singing competition. And they managed it successfully.I know indirectly I am telling the whole plot outline...but I cannot help it. This is one movie musical which is just a pure winner not only in terms of the songs, other than the plot outline which is based on real events. Everyone in the family will be able to enjoy, regardless of age! Definitely a classic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Springtime for Hitler" Ain't the Only Show with Singing Nazis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sound of Music" is easy to ridicule. It's sappy, corny and sentimental to the extreme. It hopelessly simplifies horrible world events, and makes it seem like all anyone needed to do to escape the iron fist of Hitler's regime was to schlep over some hills on a bright, sunny morning and say "hello" to Switzerland. But I'm still recommending this movie, because it is one of the most accomplished movie musicals ever made.Robert Wise knew how to make a stage musical feel cinematic on the screen, as evidenced here and by his earlier "West Side Story." He could open up stage musicals so that they felt right at home on screen, and he was expert at using on-location photography to enhance material rather than highlight its limitations. In "Music," the Austrian scenery is dazzling, and nearly becomes a character in itself. And the music sounds great, though it's not one of Rodger's &amp; Hammerstein's best scores (it falls well below "The King and I" and "Carousel.") Julie Andrews is perfect in the lead role; I can't imagine anyone else playing Maria. She had a knack for toning down overly-sentimental material until it almost became believable. And Eleanor Parker is the other stand out in the cast as the hilarious Baroness Schrader. My favorite moment comes when the family has burst into song for the umpteenth time and she leans over to Max (Richard Haydn) and whispers sarcastically, "Why didn't you tell me to bring along my harmonica?" I forgive anyone who thinks this movie is just too gag-inducing to bear, but I still get some pleasure from popping it in every now and then.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vast improvement over the stage show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether or not "The Sound of Music" is in fact a good musical has been something of an ongoing debate. It did in fact open to mixed reviews in it's original Broadway run and was panned in it's original London run. When it comes down to it, the score is mostly excellent, even if the songs don't flow in quite as naturally as they do in other R&amp;H shows. But where the show ultimately fails is by not joining together the three stories that go on in the show; Maria winning over the children; Maria and the Captain falling in love; and the Von Trapps Escaping from the Nazi takeover of Austria. The three stories pretty much just happen, rather than flow in.That being said, the film of the sound of music does manage to do just that, making it quite possibly the only film version of a stage musical that actually improves on it's source material. The film wisely rearranges songs to go in more sensible places, even though dropping both of Elsa and Max's songs is more questionable. The shots of Ausrtia are simply breathtaking, often disguising the weaknesses of the material. True, the two new songs written by Richard Rodgers (music and Lyrics) are not as sophisticated as those he wrote with Oscar Hammerstein, who died in 1960, but they are enjoyable none the less and do move the story along. Julie Andrews is perfect as Maria, having the youthfulness which Mary Martin lacked on stage, which allows Andrews to mature during her performance. Even though he has stated his dislike of the film, Christopher Plummer is excellent as the Captain. While "The Sound of Music" does not rank as one of the best musicals ever written, it's film incarnation certainly ranks as one of the best (if not the best) of it's kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw the movie in 1979 when I was just a child and then I saw it again and again and again... So many years have passed and I still have the same beautiful feeling when I see the movie again. The Sound of Music is the greatest movie ever! The music is very powerful and the story gets right to your soul! I believe that Julie Andrews did not only act in this movie; she was inspired and conveyed to us the message of love and of the true meaning of life. All the other actors were great too! I wish to meet Julie Andrews one day and tell her how much this movie has affected my childhood. I am happy that she was part of it.I also promise to visit Austria one day and see the same places where the movie was filmed.Julie Andrews, you are a Great Lady and the greatest actress!

She doesn't care what she looks like in the film and her acting is superb. It is the best film of all time. The thing that impressed me was how well they all sang.

		<fullReview>The Sound of MusicJulie Andrews stars in the film that set a course for future musicals and dramas.`The Sound of Music.'We all know the story. Julie Andrews plays a Catholic nun who becomes a nanny for Christopher Plummer's millions upon millions of children (not literally) in Austria. After a while she falls in love with Plummer's character. They sing. The children sing. We all sing for ice cream ? err, I mean?never mind.Anyway, that's how the story goes. Interesting to note that three whole hours revolve around just that. But it is also interesting to note that the film is incredibly good.Julie Andrews plays her character like it is she. She completely envelops her character. The role of Christopher Plummer turns out to be one of his only good performances.For people that do not know, Plummer calls the film `The Sound of Mucus.' He hates it. It's all because people remembered him for it, and he could probably never get any good jobs in film afterwards. So, of course, he purposely chose perverted roles or co-star roles. Shame on him. He should learn to live with the fact that this movie made him ? he wouldn't even be able to get `and Christopher Plummer as ____' roles.My only complaint about this film is that the children can't sing worth a darn. Every time they start to sing my ears go numb. They are miserably off tune. They also can't dance.I sometimes wonder if Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss, both of whom tried out for the roles of the children, would have been better? I wonder?wonder?wonder?DREYFUSS: A doe. A deer. A female?BOB?! BOB (Bill Murray): Dr. Marvin?! DREYFUSS: Don't you see? HE'S NEVER GONE! Even when I'M TEN YEARS OLD!!! BOB: Is this some kind of radical, new therapy? DREYFUSS: You see?!Okay. Maybe not. Still?he couldn't have done much worse than the kids in this movie.The cinematography is another thing worth noting about this film. It might not have been filmed in Austria, but I sure can't tell the difference.And also worth mentioning is the fact that `The hills are alive with the sound of music!' scene has spawned off countless rip-offs, spoofs and goofs. In fact, I was just watching `European Vacation' about a week ago, and they had a scene where Chevy Chase is singing, `The hills are alive with the sound of Griswald!' One of many countless spoofs on the scene.All in all, `The Sound of Music' is one of the most cherished and remembered films. Ever. Definitely worth seeing.It's a great musical, and a surprisingly entertaining one, too.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Classic Family Entertainment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sound of Music" is one of the best musicals ever filmed. It deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar for 1965 along with a number of other awards. Filmed largely on location in Austria, the scenery is simply breathtaking. Who can ever forget the beautiful opening sequence where the camera pans over the mountains before zooming in on star Julie Andrews singing the title song. And there's that unforgettable Rodgers and Hammerstein score. The story line is simple. A novice nun Maria, (Andrews at the peak of her career) is sent to be governess for a family of seven children ranging in age from 5 to 16. The family is that of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) a former naval hero. The story takes place during the 30s just prior to WWII. The Nazi influence is felt more or less as a background to the story until the final minutes of the movie. The songs are plentiful and memorable. My favorite is the rendition of "Climb Every Mountain" sung by the Mother Superior (Peggy Wood). But there are so many memorable songs. Plummer tries his best with "Eidleweiss" but the best that can be said about that, is that as a singer, Plummer makes a great actor. Andrews was born to play Maria and gives a marvelous performance in the Role. Richard Haydn as Uncle Max and Eleanor Parker as the Baroness are also in the cast. The children who also give memorable performances are played by talented youngsters too many to mention here. "The Sound of Music" has stood the test of time as evidenced by the recent release of a sing-a-long version to theaters. It is a true classic of family entertainment. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tills Were Alive in '65</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dragged to see this musical by a girlfriend whom I ultimately didn't marry, it was difficult to swallow the militaristic heel-clicking of what appeared, even in 1965 to be ?sweet' American stage children. The Austrian location photography somehow accentuated the movie's vulgar origins in American showbiz. Richard Rodgers' repeated following of the tonic with its diminished, for him proved big biz over the years. But even had the cast acted and sang in German, like the proverbial peroxide blond, this one's roots show. The principals' age range conforms to the formulaic American TV series model. Julie Andrews, romance hope of archetypal spinster and plain amateur-operettist wannabe; Christopher Plummer, the available knight in widower's armour; Daniel Truhitte [Rolf] and Charmian Carr [Leisal] the teen interest; and doler of dubious wisdom ?Climb Every mountain, ford every stream,' Peggy Wood [the Abbess], presumably the geriatric interest. Julie Andrews' ebullience may have helped rescue inanity from insanity but talent could not prevent the intrusiveness of big-gun, 70mm American six-track slickness in the Austrian Tyrol. The soft-pedalled historical baloney about Austrian invasion is nauseating. Austria was annexed not invaded by Nazis. Nazis were welcomed there with open jackboots because Austria was -and still is -full of Nazis. The Von Trapp Family were classicists, long past the doh-re-me stage. Having or not having confidence, solving problems, etc. are American not European predilections. One cannot resist the feeling that by escaping, these movie Von-Trapps did Hitler a favour. Whilst this musical may confirm who the star of MY FAIR LADY should have been, unfortunately Julie Andrews' runaway success ultimately deprived her of clothes and equilibrium, her eventual topless appearance in THE TAMARIND SEED [1974] doing for sexuality what headless chickens do for vegetarians. She never shone again, as perhaps she should have. Pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph! (Possibly a spoiler or 2)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is SO unbelievably good. It speaks volumes that after nearly 40 years people still love it and thousands of people still turn up to those sing-a-long things. It's just timeless in a way that nothing they turn out today is. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are perfect as the leading roles, they undergo such character development. The first half is mostly comedy, but the 2nd half takes a more dramatic turn, with scenes like the first kiss between Maria and Georg, the wedding (brings tears to my eyes - I WANT that dress!) and the symbolic mountain climbing. I agree with the person who said Maria and Georg's first kiss is very erotic. The way they kind of nuzzle is filled with sexual tension - they just want to jump each other's bones there and then! The photography is brilliant too. The scene that sticks in my mind is the overhead shot of the wedding, with Maria's huge train. It's magnificent. See it! If possible, go to the sing a long, they're so good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What Rodgers may lack of pure style, / He makes up for - well, once in a while - / By the way he can bluster / From the depths of lacklustre / To the almost transcendently vile.Apologies to John Ciardi, who composed a version of this limerick in honour of someone else - but it exactly sums up my attitude towards Richard Rodgers and, to a lesser extent, Oscar Hammerstein. Rodgers was never much of a musician. His spectacular box-office success makes little sense when you consider that his contemporaries included (at different times) George Gershwin, Kurt Weill and Leonard Bernstein - all composers who could blow him out of the water and who all, incidentally, wrote better songs. Rodgers and Hammerstein specialised in middlebrow inoffensiveness. But every so often they would leave this realm and enter that of the positively bad: `Surrey with a Fringe on Top', `A Gal Who Can't Say No', `Clam Bake', `I'm Gonna to Wash that Man Right out of My Hair' and `State Fair' are all songs with a pungent stink.`The Sound of Music' is their best work. It never stinks, it's heartfelt, and at any rate it avoids the air of calculated innovation and phoney bigness that pervades most of their other musicals. And this is a glorious transfer to the screen, it really is. (Note that Robert Wise was also responsible for the screen version of `West Side Story'.) Its weaknesses stem from weaknesses in the original. For instance:Too many songs occur in performances for the benefit of other characters - it's the old let's-put-on-a-show problem. By the end of `Lonely Goatherd' we are fidgeting and wondering when we'll ever be done with the impromptu theatrical productions, and if the story will ever be allowed to proceed. The lyrics for `Something Good' were written by Rodgers himself and they demonstrate that Hammerstein's job was much harder than it looked. `So Long, Farewell' is just too slight in every way to be worth staging - and it's staged TWICE, no less. And some dialogue that might work on stage plays cheezily on the screen.On the other hand, the Rodgers and Hammerstein style for once truly suits its subject. Many of the songs are children's songs, nursery songs (`My Favourite Things'), beginner's songs (`Do Re Me'), or simple patriotic folksongs (`Edelweiss'). Even more musically sophisticated things like the title song come off well. Yes, this musical isn't at all innovative, but then Rodgers was never GOOD at innovation - that kind of thing was better left to Gerwshin, Weill, Bernstein, et al.It's a pity that `The Sound of Music' is the only `epic' musical that many people see - `West Side Story' and `Fiddler on the Roof' are better examples of the genre, and at any rate give a more balanced view of what it's capable of. But I must side with those who say that it's nonetheless a great movie. The script is (mostly) sharp, the languid direction is appropriate and engrossing, and it simply LOOKS good. Besides, like everyone else, I've seen it more times than I can count. Does that mean anything?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maria (Julie Andrews) lives in Austria. She grew up in the mountains but now lives at a convent in Salzburg, where she is in study to become a nun. Yet, she is a "problem", as the older sisters say, for she sings at the wrong times, is often tardy and runs off to the mountains when she should be studying. Therefore, the Mother Superior decides that Maria should leave the convent for a short time and become the governess for a widower, the Naval Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). He has SEVEN energetic children! This opportunity will give Maria a chance to contemplate whether a life in the abbey is really suited for her. So, off she goes. The children, many times ignored by their grieving father, are brats and try to drive Maria away by putting a frog in her pocket and making her sit on a pine cone. But, they have underestimated their new governess. She points out their misbehavior in a subtle way and wins them over with her kindness. Soon, though, the father goes to visit Vienna, where he may be courting a baroness (Eleanor Parker). While he is gone, Maria makes the kids some play clothes, takes them on picnics and teaches them to sing, things their father has not done. The Captain returns with this new love interest and gives a grand ball in her honor. The kids love it. But, during the event, the Captain and Maria accidentally share a dance and look into each other's eyes. Scared of her feelings, Maria goes back to the convent on the sly. Both the children and their father are heartbroken, for she has become very important to them. Will she return? Will Maria admit her feelings for the gentleman and abandon plans to become a nun? With Hitler in power in Germany, too, will Austria be able to avoid the Nazi sweep across Europe? This beloved film was my childhood favorite. I adored the music, the photography, the cast and everything else about it. My parents even let me go the theater five times to see it, knowing how much I was entranced with the movie. My thanks go out to them. In such a light, its pretty much a given that viewers everywhere, from 4 to 90, will also delight in the flick. As stated, all aspects from the music to the acting to the direction and more, are of superior quality, making it a rare movie indeed. So, any day, any time, any season, seek this one out for you and all those you love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"My heart will be blessed?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1960s were a time of transition in cinema, when independent producers began to take control from the old studio moguls, neo-realist influences crept into Hollywood, foreign language films became trendy, and for the first time pictures were being made in black-and-white for artistic reasons rather budgetary constraints. And yet the most popular picture of the entire decade was a bright, joyous and epic musical, a product of old-fashioned studio professionalism, crafted for pure entertainment. And there is no shame in this fact, because The Sound of Music is a truly wonderful classic of the screen.Let's start at the beginning (a very good place to start) with the musical from which the movie was adapted. This was certainly the best of all the Rodgers and Hammerstein scores, the culmination of all their works prior to this. It demonstrates, in many instances, what was really exceptional about Richard Rodgers's tunes. His melodies have a subtle beauty which comes at you in ways you wouldn't anticipate. There are those sour blue notes in the title song, the haunting chord progression of "Edelweiss" through major and minor or, in "My Favourite Things", the shift from a minor key verse to a major key chorus while barely seeming to change melody at all. Filled with Oscar Hammerstein's deceptively simple yet rhythmically sensitive lyrics, this is music as gorgeous as the hills and mountains that provide the motion picture with its backdrop.The director is the highly versatile and under-appreciated Robert Wise. Wise began his career as a sound editor and he really understood the musical genre. He doesn't give The Sound of Music that very precise, choreographed look of say, a Vincente Minnelli musical or his own earlier picture West Side Story. Instead he has the performers doing very simple "dances" of realistic movement, for example Julie Andrews speeding up her walk as the song gathers pace for "I Have Confidence". He also gently and unobtrusively makes the image match the scope and style of the music, a great example of this being in the opening number. For the slow, broad opening of the song, we have Andrews against the backdrop of the mountains. Then for the busier but quieter section he has her walking among trees, skipping between their trunks like the notes of the song, before having her running out onto the hillside as the music swells up again.Star Julie Andrews, like Irene Dunne and Judy Garland before her, was one of those rare talents who could both sing and act. Of course her role here as an actress is mainly one of childlike earnestness, but the thing is she pulls it off with complete sincerity, never becoming too grating or too pathetic. And of course she is able to carry her acting performance through into the musical numbers, putting her character into every note and dance step. Male lead Christopher Plummer was reportedly not comfortable in his role, but he does an adequate job all the same. Apparently Richard Burton was also considered for the role, and he undoubtedly would have given an excellent performance, but he might have been a little too good, making the captain perhaps a bit too stern and menacing in those early scenes, so I'm glad the role went to the softer and more fatherly Plummer.One criticism that is often raised about The Sound of Music is that its story is rather weak and short on substance. It is true that it lacks the compelling drama of say, My Fair Lady, that it never really builds up any true sense of danger over the Nazi anschluss, and that perhaps it is at times a little overwhelmingly cheerful. And yet the fact is that the weight of this picture is not in its story, but in its music. This is something that is significant about Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals. Think about those lyrics. Most of these songs don't say anything very specific about the story or characters; most of them just play around with a little idea like saying "goodbye" or going through the notes in a scale. With the exception of "How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?" these are songs about feelings, not expositions. The songs do not exist to tie the story together, the story exists to present the songs. And these musical moments are powerful enough to send shivers down spines and send hearts soaring.</fullReview>

I just said "it's the worst R&amp;H show I've seen, I can't be bothered with the movie."It took until recently when I saw a DVD of it going very very cheap in a supermarket that I thought, well, my husband likes this movie, might as well add it to the collection - and of course we have visited Salzburg a number of times when staying in that area of Europe so it'd be good to see the city again. I expect I can sit through it OK....Instead I was entranced. It's wonderful, Julie Andrews was perfect and Christopher Plummer simply divine. To think I've missed out all these years.

		<shortDescription>An Exhaustive DVD Package and a Pristine Print Should Satisfy Fans of This Indisputable Musical Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's downright sacrilegious to say anything critical of this 1965 musical classic, and I have to admit I still love the movie like almost everyone else I know. Between the postcard-perfect Austrian scenery captured by Ted D. McCord's vibrant cinematography and the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein score, it's an irresistible entertainment with Julie Andrews ideally realizing the role of Maria, the young Salzburg novitiate nun who may be too independent to become part of the order. She is assigned by the abbey's Mother Superior to become a governess for the seven mischievous children of retired Navy Captain Von Trapp. The rest of the plot focuses on the burgeoning romance that develops not only between Maria and the Captain but also between the two principals and the children.A romantic triangle arises in the form of a Baroness who has her talons in the Captain until she realizes she cannot manipulate the inevitable, but the bigger conflict comes with the encroaching Nazi regime who attempts to strong-arm Von Trapp to serve in the Reich. A closer examination of the 174-minute movie really shows an odd imbalance to the narrative. The lighter first half is all told from Maria's perspective, and consequently, this is where most of the memorable songs are performed. After the intermission, Maria is pushed to the background when the Captain becomes engaged to the Baroness and then later when things heat up between him and the Nazi officials. Even though the story makes sense as presented, I've always thought this strange given the build-up of the story as Maria's personal odyssey.But no matter as the songs are beautifully staged and choreographed by Mark Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, in particular, the joyous Salzburg montage used for "Do Re Mi", the unintended slumber party for "My Favorite Things", the simplicity of the Captain's rendition of "Edelweiss", the gauzy gazebo duet "Something Good", the puppy love pas-de-deux in the same gazebo of "Sixteen Going on Seventeen" and of course, the how-can-it-be-topped opening title song. Besides the transcendent Andrews (is it a wonder why we all fell in love with her back then?), Christopher Plummer is far more dimensional as Von Trapp than I remember from my youth. Not only does he capture the sternness, but he brings a saucy sense of humor and fey quality in his performance. Looking regal the way Hollywood stars used to, Eleanor Parker plays the Baroness not so much as a vindictive man-handler but more as a convincingly insecure woman too comfortable with her exalted status in life.In stock roles, Richard Haydn provides comic relief as the cagey impresario Max, while as Rolfe, Daniel Truhitte, in his only movie role, transforms from smitten bike messenger to cold Nazi youth in record time. As the Mother Superior, Peggy Wood brings calming assurance, though her dubbed performance of "Climb Ev'ry Mountain" is a tad too operatic for my taste. The children are all well played, though I tend to think of Charmian Carr as a bit too Ann-Margret-kittenish as Liesl, especially as her singing voice does not sound remotely Tyrolean. Flaws aside, major credit should be given to director Robert Wise, who already performed similar chores on "West Side Story" and has somehow mastered the art of pacing such a marathon musical story. Wise's frequent collaborator, screenwriter Ernest Lehman, adapted the original stage book by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse with wit and heart and manages to tone down the innately saccharine tone of the story.The 2005 40th anniversary two-disc DVD package is obscenely full of extras which should satisfy the most persnickety aficionado. Still looking great at 70, Andrews provides brief introductions to both discs. First things first, the 2005 restoration effort and the transfer on the DVD have yielded a superb print, and it will not disappoint any fan of the movie. There are two commentary tracks, one done by Wise in a rather perfunctory fashion, the other a more anecdotal account by Andrews, Carr, Dee Dee Wood and the real Maria Von Trapp's youngest son Johannes. Then there is a very informative, 63-minute making-of documentary produced for the new DVD, "My Favorite Things: Julie Andrews Remembers" which thoroughly discusses the history of the Von Trapp family, the Broadway incarnation and the complicated transfer of the stage show to screen ? even though a number of participants provide recollections, not just Andrews.There are also two charming looking-back interview sessions. The first is a 20-minute conversation between Andrews and an especially acerbic Plummer, who seems to be ridiculing the original Maria in the Broadway version, stage legend Mary Martin, for her reputed megalomania. The second is a 33-minute group discussion among the seven actors who portrayed the Von Trapp children, all looking decidedly middle-aged (their ages now ranging from 47 to 62) and showing a friendly compatibility with one another in their remembrances. There is also a 22-minute featurette showing Carr revisiting the Salzburg locations, providing a history of the city and even joining in on The Sound of Music bus tour (I've done that one, too).Another short focuses on the current phenomenon of the sing-along screenings of the movie, this one a massive event at the Hollywood Bowl complete with extravagantly costumed viewers. Also included are a fascinating A&amp;E Biography special of the real Von Trapps, a text-driven demonstration of the restoration process, and a real howler ? scratchy screen test footage of an 18-year old Mia Farrow sounding particularly tone-deaf in her audition as Liesl (I only wish they had similar footage for others who auditioned like Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell and the Osmond Brothers). Lastly, there are a number of trailers and an exhaustive photo gallery. Whew. This really defines what a complete DVD package is all about, and in this case, it's perfectly justifiable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been watching The Sound of Music and other such musicals since I was a kid and adore them all, but nothing quite tops this wonderful musical.I know every word of every song off by heart (ask my house mates if you don't believe me)and will watch it at every chance I get because it never fails to cheer me up.I don't know what it is about The Sound of Music that I love so much, maybe its the singing and songs, maybe its the nuns or maybe its the kids and how naughty they are - they've done all the things that you wish you'd done as a kid, like putting spiders in their governess' bed, shimming up and down drainpipes, falling into rivers and running all over the Austrian hills singing... sounds like my idea of paradise! Its just a lovely film, my all time Fave! No one else could have even come close to Julie Andrews playing the part of Maria the fallen Nun.If you haven't seen it already - why not? Go on, go and get a copy and watch it now. You won't regret it - unless you hate musicals of course!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to question this Captain von Trapp character, a retired Naval officer, who is always acting to people around him, including his own children.He lets the kids under control by hired governess (Isn't it against the law not sending them to schools?), so he has time to fool around with rich baroness, an equally pretentious character. You can imagine how he supports his huge property without working. After the new governess, Sister Maria, appears in his premises, he finds her his new target and dumps the baroness, then succeeds in winning this innocent nun's love with another performance. (Look how he acts to Maria under the moonlight in the garden)I like all those music numbers and the family's three youngest girls in the movie very much, but this Captain von Trapp is really a phony. Plummer and director Wise should take most of the responsibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By all means, enjoy this movie as I have for many years. Never in any way did it merit holding the record as the top box office hit for as long as it did.All filmings of Rodgers and Hammerstein, with the exception of The King and I and the little known State Fair, present problems. Two neat numbers from the play are excised and replaced with two truly atrocious ones ("Confidence in Confidence Alone" and "I Must Have Done Something Good," which is the setting for what may be the most unintentionally laughable scene in all movie history, pace Ben Hur). There are other defects of detail. Why does Maria tell the children that the Laendler is an "Austrian" folk dance? They know that they are Austrian. They would also know about the dance by this time. The last choral "goodnight" in "So Long, Farewell" makes one want to gag. Then there's the literally sickening sugar-sweet plot, unique among R&amp;H major musicals, which usually have some kind of dramatic bite. Oh, well, they weren't the only ones to waste great numbers on a lousy book. Enjoy it for the justly famous numbers (forget Do-Re-Mi; it goes on forever, and the fifth degree is "sol," not "sew") and for the luscious scene where the captain and Maria dance the Laendler as a pas de deux.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen "The Sound of Music" in years, but my wife wanted to watch it the other night, so we threw it on. I'd forgotten how good it is.First, I hold a negative bias toward most musicals. Yes, there are exceptions ("Moulin Rouge", "Beauty &amp; the Beast" for example), but most of the time I just get annoyed when the filmmakers stop the story for a little song-and-dance routine, then crank it back up when the musical number's over.My recollection of "The Sound of Music" was simply of the songs -- but I'd completely forgotten how well the songs work in the narrative. Instead of halting the flow of the story, they actually help carry it along. A pleasant surprise.And I'd forgotten, too, how well the film steers clear of syrupy cornball territory -- something that could've easily mired it, especially when you consider the time period in which it was made. I appreciated the honesty of it, and the lack of melodrama and overacting you so often find in the films of yesteryear.The only drawback -- man, I can't stand it when Liesl goes "wheeeeee!" once Rolf runs out of the little gazebo after he's stolen a kiss from her. The punk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I once saw an article in a magazine (was it FHM or MAXIM, can't remember), that listed this movie as one of the 50 worst films of all time. I would have thought it was just a joke, but then the list also contained Batman and Robin. I guess I don't know much about acting, directing, producing or even criticizing movies. One thing I can objectively say is that this movie was for me the most 'rewatchable'. I could watch it over and over again without being tired of it (my sister could actually recite the whole movie word for word). After that article in the men's mag ( and the fact that no movie, no matter how highly rated on the IMDb, is without a negative comment), I am forced to say again that I don't know what makes a movie good. I can however boldly say that this movie should automatically accompany every purchase of a VCR or DVD player!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, the Sound Of Music (SOM) is not a masterpiece of cinema but it serves the purpose of entertainment with its jolly tunes, beautiful scenery and memorable characters. It's popularity as a movie has only increased with the years and, deservedly so. Go to Salzburg and you can see the places the movie was filmed! Tours run from the town centre which, alas, I could not fit in when visiting in 2004. There is little that is unpalatable about SOM except for the occasional flight of overacting from the junior members of the cast. But, in some ways that only adds to the ebullience and enthusiasm the movie radiates on so many levels. Everyone should view it at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sound of Music is an excellent movie, but one with big problems. First, the good news. Director Robert Wise, who's had an awesome career, is in top form: the movie is very well made and looks terrific throughout. The opening sequence is truly wonderful, with the beautiful Julie Andrews singing at 10,000' without gasping for breath. Christopher Plummer is good.Much of the music is good. My favorite numbers are "Do, Re, Mi" and "The Lonely Goatherd." Both are staged very well and are extremely hummable. Here's a fantasy of mine for "Do, Re, Mi." Part of the number is done along a road with a white fence. The fence has five horizontal rails, which reminded me of the staff on sheet music. The kids should have been positioned on the fence like notes on the sheet music, matching what was being sung. But they didn't do that.The wedding is impressively staged.But you come inevitably to the flaws, mostly ones of sentimentality. The song "So Long, Farewell" is awful. And its staging is bad. At the end, when all the dinner guests wave good-night to the kids, I want to throw up. "Maria," though tuneful, is a dumb song.There are soft spots in the cast. Eleanor Parker as the baroness is stagy. Charmian Carr as Liesl is stagy, and particularly bad in the dialogue leading up to "You are Sixteen" at the gazebo. She had a deservedly brief film career, making only one other movie, and it was for TV.Let's not forget the plot. This pretends to be a true story. But ... the von Trapps did not flee Austria one step ahead of the Nazis, climbing all those mountains (with the grass waving due to the helicopter carrying the camera) -- they just left. So all that stuff after the music festival is fiction. I believe, but I'm not sure, that the Nazis did not try to force Capt. von Trapp back into the armed forces, either.As good as Julie Andrews is (and I'm a big fan), there are some awkward moments. After she runs back to the convent in the beginning, she runs past this group of nuns, and does a lousy double-take when she's caught. Then she gives a bad speech about how nice it was in the country, "... and the sky was so blue ..." It rings hollow. Much later, her speech to Peggy Wood explaining why she left the von Trapps and returned to the convent is weepy and sounds forced.But in spite of the flaws, the movie is still a winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pretty dismissive of The Sound of Music for a long time, but when it was shown on TV on New Year's Day I thought I should dragoon my girlfriend into watching it for the first time. The knowledge that it's been showing in London for some years in a "singalong" version (alternate weekends with the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" - people cheer the nuns, boo the Nazis and so on) probably helped, also I've been seeing a lot of opera recently which probably gives one more of a handle on this sort of thing. Not to mention the bottle of sparking wine we had to hand. To cut a long story short we enjoyed the movie immensely.Bringing a sense of irony to this film, while not essential, certainly makes it a better viewing experience for adults. Let's face it; singing nuns, children lining up for inspection, lederhosen made out of curtains, grown men singing about small white flowers - this is funny stuff. Any sort of musical drama is inherently ridiculous but the best succeeds in spite/because of that and TSoM falls into that category.The music however is excellent on any terms; melodically and harmonically inventive - John Coltrane didn't cover too many songs from musicals, let's face it. Catchy tunes do have to be the most important thing in a musical and there is not a song in TSoM that lets the side down. My personal favourite this time round was "Sixteen Going On Seventeen" which not only has a lovely chromatic melody but has Liesl running emotional rings around Rolf in a way I didn't appreciate when I last saw the film many years ago.To complain about lack of realism is on a par with pointing out that the disguises in Cosi fan Tutti are unconvincing, or that Dick Van Dyke's English accent in Mary Poppins is a bit shaky - it's entirely missing the point. This movie is immense fun and anyone who says different should be forced to watch it repeatedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood should come up with more movies with songs and dance numbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie just a few days ago. I have seen a number of English movies, but this was special. I am from India and the movies here inevitably contain songs and dance numbers, barring a few exceptions. But as many as 10+ songs in a Western movie was something new for me, and it was unique. But I loved it. I showed the movie to my mother. She doesn't understand English very well, I had to keep interpreting the lines for her. But she too loved the movie. I had read somewhere, this is one movie, a copy of which should be there in every home on Earth. And i agree. It is an experience I wont ever forget. however, I wonder, why are musicals so rare in the west? we watch almost 100 Hollywood movies every year, and I have watched just two with songs. Movies from the west are good, I only wish they produce more of musicals, I am sure the world is ready for some of those. And I am sure, the west can make great musicals each month. I hope someone grants me my wish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Very Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie brings out the very best in people. It lifts the viewer even higher than the beautiful mountains around which the movie was filmed. I first saw SOM as a high school boy of 16 and immediately fell in love with Julie (I'm glad she left the convent - probably not kosher to be in love with a nun). Beautiful photography -outstanding music - while the script was charming, I think Julie's character was so sweet and so good that the experts believed that no one playing this role so well could EVER deserve to win an Oscar. These experts were probably friends of those "brilliant" people who didn't think Julie was photogenic enough - or "big" enough to play the lead in "My Fair Lady" (I'm sure Marni Nixon appreciated the work, however).As an active duty army officer living in Heidelburg, Germany, we made numerous trips to Salzburg. We loved visiting the different locations - running my daughters around the gazebo jumping from section to section just like in the movie. What joy we experienced as my family lived out this musical during my three year tour. As we drove around Austria listening to and singing the soundtrack on tape, I will always remember my six year old daughter (now 23) crying with sincere emotion each time the finale played as the Von Trapps crossed over the Alps to escape the Nazis. What precious memories these are to my wife and me! Some have said it is too sticky sweet - too sentimental. To them I say, sweet -YES! sentimental - YES! I'll take these sweet and sentimental memories to my grave!</fullReview>

People will laugh at it, and perhaps mock it. Perhaps they are afraid or they simply do not understand it's greatness. But what you have to recognise is that the film IS a musical and so you have to expect the songs. They are after all well-written, and have good melodies. Also, i must mention the impeccable acting from both the children and Maria/Captain Von Trapp etc. Although the film is a little outdated in some aspects (the teenage boys on maria's bed for example), you cannot help but love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Our Favorite Things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to see The Sound of Music on Broadway with the original cast minus Mary Martin, her part had been taken over by Martha Wright at that point. The production was good, but the thing I like best about The Sound of Music was how well Robert Wise transferred it to the screen. I defy anyone to show any trace of stage origin in this magnificently photographed film from that aerial opening with Julie Andrews singing the title song to the end with the Von Trapp family climbing every mountain.The main difference between the stage production and the screen version is that the role of the Baroness Elsa Schrader played by Eleanor Parker is a singing role. With the casting of Ms. Parker, a talented player but no singer, certain songs out of necessity had to be eliminated. Eleanor is fine in her role, but I do wonder if Robert Wise meant to cast a singer in her part originally. On Broadway the Baroness was played by Marion Marlowe.Julie Andrews who became a Broadway star in My Fair Lady and Camelot and didn't do either role for the screen, gives her greatest screen performance in a Broadway role originally written for someone else. There was some criticism that Mary Martin was too old to be playing Maria in the original play, but she certainly was guaranteed box office on Broadway. Julie Andrews was just right for the part and she's in great voice. I always marvelled listening to her at the perfect diction she was able to maintain hitting those high notes.Christopher Plummer took over the role that Theodore Bikel on Broadway and he too gained a signature role for his screen career. I've always felt that the talented Mr. Plummer has never been given the credit due him. He was a perfect Duke of Wellington in Waterloo and his portrayal of Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire is the highlight of that film. I like Christopher Plummer because he's also never taken himself seriously though he takes his art very seriously. I don't think too many other actors today could have played that comic villain in the Tom Hanks/Dan Ackroyd Dragnet movie and done it with such obvious zest and enjoyment.A real old timer got into this film with Peggy Wood playing the Mother Abbess at the Convent where Maria is a postulant. Ms. Wood's Broadway career dates back to 1911 and on stage she introduced songs by such people as Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern, Sigmund Romberg, and Noel Coward. You've got to be real good to get folks like that to write for you. And now her art is preserved in one of the most popular films of all time.The charm of the music and the leads and the kids sometimes obscures the anti-Nazi message that The Sound of Music conveys. The story takes place in Austria before and during the Anschluss. Christopher Plummer makes no secret of disgust for the Nazis and all they stand for. The Sound of Music makes it clear he is very much in a minority in terms of Austria uniting with Germany. Of course the irony is that Anschluss did not quite turn out for the Austrians as they hoped it would.The Sound of Music, it's story, it's music, it's lyrics and it's charm will stay with you and never leave after a hundred viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware the scorn of the heartless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teenager in the swingin' 60's, this movie was, to myself and every male contemporary, an object of derision, a sickly piece of confection for soppy girls and their mothers who had an unofficial competition running to find who had seen it the most times and consumed the most tissues.I finally came to it many years later in a moment of weakness, watching it alone, gratefully, as it was still suspect for a chap to have moist cheeks in a movie.The borderline between true sweetness and mawkish sentimentality in film is very hard to draw, but repeat viewings confirm that this is not a marginal case. The portrayal of that increasingly-scarce commodity, genuine innocence, is so finely played by the first-class cast that one can only marvel at how well they pull it off. This was a role that could have been made for showcasing the talents of Julie Andrews, and like most peak-of-career performances it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the part.The music of Rodgers and Hammerstein has been condemned for being below the standards of their contemporaries (Gershwins, Berlin, Bernstein et al), and although that is arguable, it is also incontrovertible that the majority of their musical offerings have withstood the test of time for the sheer rightness of time and place of the songs that assist the dramatic flow rather than stopping it in its tracks. And their innate 'hummability' continues to sustain both the amateur and professional musical theatre in countless revivals. Most modern musicals consistently fail to attract widespread support because while the writing may be more 'clever' in an often self-indulgent way, they lack the memorability of a single simple tune.I have just watched this film again with my daughters, 10 and 7, and while they have been unavoidably exposed to some of the harshness and cynicism of the 90's I was pleased to see that they accepted and enjoyed the film for what it is, an honest, highly agreeable telling of a story in words and music, that speaks of essential goodness amidst both bright and dark moments. This is the never-ending-story which will delight all those of cheerful heart for as long as films are shown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I possibly add to the many who have written about The Sound of Music, one of the most beloved musical films of all time? When I was 9 years old, my mother dragged me (kicking and screaming) to see this movie. It was for my birthday, but it was actually a movie she wanted to see and I knew it. Well, the movie unexpectedly enchanted me.And over the decades, I have seen it repeatedly, like everyone else I suppose. Even today, I don't pass when it is shown on television. But it goes beyond that. I know all the words to each song by heart. I visited the Von Trapp lodge in Stowe, Vermont, when I went skiing there. When I was in Salzburg not too long ago, I took a tour of the Sound of Music sights. (I've never done that for any other movie.) I've even been carrying a crush on one character for decades.How on earth can you explain all that? It's a movie with intense personal meaning to me, even though I saw it a lifetime ago. And I suspect it has had that effect on many people. This movie is a cultural force. This movie is an antidote to all the cynicism, negativity and complexity of the world. Having seen the film again for the umpteenth time, I can report that it still enchants and delights, from beginning to end. It's difficult to explain the appeal. Is it the nuns, the music, the mountains, the European charm? Is it art, creative genius, movie magic? Sure, Julie Andrews is the shining, perfect heart of this movie, but I imagine there were many people behind the development of the music, the musical and the movie. I hasten to add that for me the attraction is not the music or the musical per se. It's the movie.It's hard to decide which number is best: "Do-Re-Mi", "Edelweiss", "Sixteen Going on Seventeen", "My Favorite Things" or "Climb Every Mountain". When the cyberchildren of the internet and video game age watch this movie for this first time, are they as enchanted as the two generations before them? I hope so.I wonder whether Hollywood is still able to produce musicals with this kind of effect on people.When I give this movie a perfect score, it's my inner child doing the voting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do Re Mi Fa So ........... Only a very selected and unfortunate few will not be able to tie that to the movie which has gone down the years as a golden classic and an all-time favorite and a definite must watch. Are you still trying to guess the movie? Let me try again......How do you solve a problem like Maria? How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?Those who guessed it right, good on you. Those who still are clueless need to go grab a DVD or Blu Ray copy of THE SOUND OF MUSIC! Set during the latter1930s in Salzburg Austria is this heartwarming musical of the Von Trapp family and the hardships they had to live through during uprising of Hitler's empire. Inspired by true events of the highly decorated WW1 Austro- Hungarian Naval officer George Von Trapp , Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews along with the Von Trapp children will touch your hearts and take you back in time to when their newly united family is almost about to be separated by the evil clutches of war.Maria who is a postulant at the Nonberg abbey is absolutely as graceful as a swan and yet as lively as a chipmunk and has the voice of a nightingale. Her tendency of getting into constant mischief has the nuns doubting her future at the abbey. It is at this point that Maria is sent of as a governess to the Von Trapp estate. It is here that she changes the norms and once again brings within the Von Trapp mansion walls the sounds of music. Captain Von Trapp a decorated WW1 hero is a patriot of Austria and isn't timid about his beliefs and flies the nation's flag high at a time the Nazi revolution is sweeping across Europe.Wholesomely packed with marvel tunes as Edelweiss, My favorite things and Climb every mountain this musical extravagance is one of my favorite musicals of all time and absolutely has the potential to be yours as well. Whilst most of Julie Andrews singing was done by her, facts state that it isn't so with her co-star Christopher Plummer. Facts state that a lion's share of his vocals is done by invitee artists. Surprisingly this does not for a moment draw out any negativity towards the musical. Director the Late Robert Wise, a legend before my time, a legend whose work I have loved as a child. I recall the year as 1992 when I first watched this movie and my heartfelt respect goes out to the brilliant work of the late Mr. Wise. Sir your production will live on for many generations to come and I sincerely hope this piece of mine will help her journey at least in a minuscule manner.THE SOUND OF MUSIC has been selected by the United States Library of Congress for preservation in the national films registry. Thus unfolds this master of classics in the genre of musicals. Now you tell me if you should watch it or not?Title: The Sound Of Music Directed by: Robert Wise Starring: Christopher Plummer, Julie Andrews Rated: Rating: 09/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw This On My Eighth Birthday-Still a Classic 47 Years Later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My grandmother (God rest her soul) took me to see this movie on my eighth birthday, which was of course, in 1965; the year that it was released. Except for the thunderstorm scene, this was a great movie! The opening scene with Julie Andrews dancing through the Alps singing the title song still brings tears of joy to my eyes! They just don't make movies like this anymore. Even my grandmother loved it.Since this was filmed over in Austria, I always wondered how they filmed those thunderstorm scenes. Did they go out in an actual thunderstorm and film this? I also read that it did rain in Austria while they were over there filming this.I finally got the answer to that question: no. The interior shots were filmed at the 20th Century Fox studios in Hollywood. The first scene filmed was where Liesl (played by Charmian Carr) was coming in from a thunderstorm, with her dress all wet and dirty from the rain, and climbed into Maria's bedroom window. (She was outside in the gazebo with Rolf, played by Daniel Truitte, when it started to rain, and they ran into the gazebo.) Anyway, they sprayed Charmian Carr with water several times and she had to be wetted down for every take.Sadly, they just don't make movies like this anymore. Today's films are simply filled of sex, violence, and cursing. The Sound of Music was a huge success at the box office, and is still a timeless classic! It won five Academy Awards; including the Best Picture of the Year. The songs from the film are just memorable: "My Favorite Things", "Do-Re-Mi", "Edelweiss", "Climb Every Mountain", and of course the title song. In fact, "My Favorite Things" is played on the radio at around Christmas time; especially the version done by Diana Ross and the Supremes.It's a shame that Julie Andrews and Peggy Wood didn't win the Academy Award for their acting performances. And Christopher Plummer should have been nominated for Best Actor as well. They were just fantastic in this movie. In fact, every time I see Julie Andrews on TV, I always think to myself, "The best movie that she ever did was The Sound of Music", and believe me; it was.Forty-seven years after it's release, The Sound of Music is still a timeless classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based in Austria during the 1930's, The Sound of Music is about a girl Maria (Julie Andrews) who has a deep desire to become a nun. However, Maria has an aptitude for getting herself in trouble, and is therefore ordered to work as a governess for Navy captain Georg Von Trapp. The seven Von Trapp family children have scared away their past governesses, mainly due to their pranks and rudeness. Eventually, Maria wins the affection of the unhappy children as well as the strict captain. The once hostile household becomes one of laughter, kindness, and?of course?singing.Though The Sound of Music is a timeless love story, it is riddled with danger and suspense. Captain Von Trapp refuses to join the ranks of Nazii Germany, and his family is put in harms way as they attempt to evade the injustices of their country. Captain Von Trapp is considered a traitor by his ranks, but he is determined to do all he can to keep his family safe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sound of Music is great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sound of Music is an absolutely wonderful movie. It is great for both adults and children. I have watched this movie over and over again. One of my favourite scenes is actually the dinner table scene when all the children and the Captain are sitting at the table and Maria sits on the pine cone. I thought the food in this scene looked absolutely delicious. It took me a while to figure out but after looking and looking I realized that the food in my favorite dinner scene is actually just mashed potatoes with stuffed ham rolls and lettuce with dishes of croissants on the table and glasses of water. It still looks very tasty. Overall this is an excellent movie to stay at home any night alone or with others and watch. It is extremely entertaining and the songs are really great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hills are alive...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens with a long travelogue styled flight through the Alps, with little music and just the wind and the clear air for company, until we end up on that now famous hill top, where the sound of music soars high and loud. This was shot in one of the many rival formats of the day, in this case, TODD-AO, a dynamic 70mm frame, and projected onto a massive screen, to great effect.It is on that hilltop that we meet Maria, Julie Andrews, as she sings her way around the hills and Austria, unable to contain her musical aspiration or free spirit. We soon learn that she is finding it difficult to find her way as a nun, and is sent to work as a governess for Christopher Plummer's, Capatin von Trapp's, seven children.Once there, she manages to endear herself to the family and well, the rest is history. The film is based on a true story but there a are several differences, mainly surrounding the political situation to added effect and the names and ages of the children to name but a few.In the end the film looks great, with the von Trapp's villa set in a glorious location in Austria, relaxing a peaceful. There is a great sense of the family's interaction and growing bonds, both with the children and the Captain, whilst there is a gentle threat and tension from the baroness, the third party in the love triangle within the film, but there is little nastiness within the film, with the exception of the Nazi element, obviously.With memorable songs, beautiful surroundings and great direction from Robert Wise, this has more than earned its place within the annuls of Hollywood greatness and will no doubt continue to flourish for generations to come, as timeless is not the word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I was really young and didn't quite understand it. Then about 3 weeks ago I decided to watch it. At the time I was quite depressed and was going through some tough points in my life. I watched it and I was amazed! It made me happy so I watched it over and over again. The Sound of Music really is enchanting. It's about love in all aspects. It's just beautiful,and Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer have great chemistry on screen. It is now my favorite movie and probably will be for the rest of my life. There are moments in this movie that just touch my heart. Like when the Captain connects w/ his children through music and also the scene in the gazebo w/ Maria and the Captain. Also the music is amazing! It has a fabulous score put together by Rogers and Hammerstein. See this movie! It is wonderful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sound of Music; movie review/summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER!!!!! The movie The Sound of Music is a great introduction to singing as well as a heart-warming tear-jerker. Maria (Julie Andrews) is a young nun who just can't stop leaving the Abbey to sing freely in the mountains. Soon the other nuns of the Abbey decide something must be done about Maria through the humorous song 'How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?' Maria is then sent off to be the governess of the seven von Trapp children including the oldest, Liesl (played by Charmian Carr)(16) all the way down to five year-old Gretl (played by Kym Karath). The children play harmless pranks on Maria before they get to know her, but after she comforts them all during a fierce thunderstorm with her song 'My Favorite Things' they begin to warm up to her and soon the children and Maria have a bond that cannot be broken. She takes them to a picnic and teaches them all to sing again, something that has been banned by Captain von Trapp (played by Christopher Plummer) after his wife died, in the delightfully simple song 'Do-Re-Me.' The movie follows as Maria flees back to the Abbey after the Baroness informs Maria that she is in love. The children get her to come back by tracking her down at the Abbey. Finding that he is, indeed, in love with Maria, Captain von Trapp calls off his wedding with the Baroness, making you just want to cheer. Maria is soon married to the captain and mother of the children she has come to love when the Germans start invading. They are forcing the captain to command ships in the war, his old profession. Not wanting to help the enemies the von Trapps must think of something quick. So they are off to sing in a festival and, back-stage they escape and hide in the Abbey that has sheltered Maria. The nuns' loving nature welcomes them in. As they are hiding in the cemetery you will be leaning on the edge of your seat and laughing as the nuns confess 'Mother, we have sinned,' while holding up stolen car parts that make the Germans cars unable to run to catch the von Trapps. Without cars, the family goes by foot into the mountains to escape to Switzerland, a neutral territory where they will be safe. The movie closes as the von Trapps are climbing high in the mountains, over the border, singing all the way.</fullReview>

Back then, before VCRs, I never dreamed I would be able to own the film for home viewing. It was the first video I ever purchased in 1982. I lost count at 86 times seeing it and who knows how many hundreds of times I have seen it since. Every actor in the film was perfectly cast. I have felt as I were there with all the Von Trapp family and endured their lives as though it were my own. It is a CLASSIC and will be enjoyed by generations to come...Thanks to all the actors for bringing such joy to all who see it... !!

		<fullReview>I remember the first time I ever saw this movie. I was about ten, an avid Julie Andrews fan even at such an early age. (I still am, Long Live Dame Jools!) My aunt picked up this movie for me, but I didn't know that Julie was in it. Imagine my surprise when I popped it in the VCR and there's Julie, dancing and singing on those lovely Austrian Alps (by the way, the exterior shots WERE filmed in Austria). I screamed with glee and my grandmother came running, thinking I had hurt myself or something... anyway...What can I say but that I love this show? Julie is so excellent, and the children are charming, and even Chris Plummer seems to be a nice guy. The story, based on the true story of the Von Trapp Family Singers, strays a lot from the real Mrs. Von Trapps telling, but it is still charming none the less. And Julie shines, shines, shines! The songs never fail to bring a smile to my face. The emotions in this film, how you root for Maria and how you wonder if the Nazies will discover there escape, etc, etc... charming.Maybe not the deepest film, or the most poignant, and it certainly won't attact for sex, blood, guts or gore... but it is a signiture classic from the golden years of musicals... when Hollywood still had some poise.I love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, its not Lost Horizon!The Sound of Music is a colorful bloated bland musical that Julie Andrews does not really fit. I was never convinced she was a nun, or wanted to be a nun; she was just Julie Andrews pretending to want to be a nun.I don't know my history very well, but this was probably made after she lost the role of Elisa Dolittle in the movie version of My Fair Lady. I think she was still miffed.The movie is OK, its like a big loaf of white bread that has no texture.

		<shortDescription>Rich and gooey, Sticky and sugary sweet, but unavoidable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I come here to review "The Sound of Music", not to praise it. Yes, like the billions of other fans, I have seen this so many times I pretty much know it by heart. Like "The Wizard of Oz", I have seen it both on television and the big screen, and have decided that for at least the next 10 years, I am leaving it alone. Still, one cannot forget about it, no matter how hard one tries. With sing-along showings of it at the Hollywood Bowl, constant dredging up at piano bars and the many spoofs it has received, "The Sound of Music" has not died in my heart, just become momentarily dormant.I actually prefer the stage version (a 1995 revival) to the movie, as it was not overloaded with helicopter covered shots of the Alps or constant liederhosen clad kids, and basically stuck to the flour of the story rather than the frosting. Yet, there is something unshakable of Julie Andrews in her second big "Nanny" film as Maria Rainer Von Trapp, the former postulate who ends up marrying her employer and helps him escape from the Nazis.In the first dozen times I saw this, I of course was overwhelmed by the helicopter shot of the Alps that eventually closes in on Julie twirling around the mountainside. What I did miss was the opening verse of the title song, sung so simply by Mary Martin in the 1959 original and Rebecca Luker decades later. The opening is equivalent to that of director Robert Wise's other big movie musical, "West Side Story", even if the locations and mood are as far from each other as they can get. When the nuns sing of their issues with Maria (which includes a future "General Hospital" legend, Anna Lee, as well as movie musical dubber Marni Nixon), I am in delight, because like those nuns, I too am conflicted by her. So how will she deal with the seven bratty children of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his whistle blowing and his baroness fiancée (a cynical Eleanor Parker)? This sweet set-up, though, has serious overtones as World War II is blooming as much as the edelweiss, and after Maria and the Captain fall in love, the world changes from teaching the kids the notes to sing to finding a way to get out a country that while beautiful on the outside is in danger of becoming ugly on the inside. This changes the second half of the film (as it did the play) from a learning experience for all of these characters to a survival lesson where they must struggle to "Climb Every Mountain".Somewhat overproduced and certainly extremely long, it is still a crowd- pleaser that I can't recommend highly enough. Yes, my rating is not a "10", but that's from possibly too many viewings, sometimes too soon. Everybody shines in the film, although in a few particular moments, Plummer's phrasing and delivery of his dialog seems a bit awkward. It's nice to see Richard Haydn playing a character not as annoying as those he did in "The Late George Apley" and "Sitting Pretty"; He's obviously an opportunist and not afraid to admit it, yet in a few spots, shows definite heroism. Parker gets some great bitchy lines to deliver and adds some needed salt into the sugary proceedings.The heart and soul of the film, though, is Peggy Wood's Mother Superior, the equivalent in Rodgers and Hammerstein's cavalcade to "Oklahoma's" Aunt Eller, "Carousel's" Nettie, "South Pacific's" Bloody Mary and "The King and I's" Madame Thiang. She's not without some imperfections, and when she barrels out her line, "Are you in love with him?", it seems as if she's looking for a good piece of gossip. But when Anna Lee and Portia Nelson (later "All My Children's" long-time baby sitter Mrs. Gurney) admit they have sinned, her reaction is priceless and a proper send-off. "Family Guy" crudely spoofed this scene years later.As for Julie Andrews, how can you not like her? She didn't get to repeat her Broadway roles at all, but fortunately 20th Century Fox got her for this, and I must say, her Maria is certainly more appealing as a Nanny than her Mary Poppins. It's obvious that she loves these children, is humble and far from the other worldly creature of the role for which she had just won an Oscar.</fullReview>

When along comes "innocent nun wash out" Julie Andrews as another nanny (again), well you know she's not going to simply take care of children despite their attempts to rattle her. 174 minute running time and silly set up out of the way, I must admit that the music and sentiment are absolutely timeless as is the anti-Nazi theme patriotically defended on screen by Christopher Plummer, who tosses his selfish Austrian babe. Clearly he saw something in Maria that was lost on the rest of us, but never the less after singing, dancing and performing incredibly intricate marionette routines, I guess we owe the Von Tropps and their singing instructor a free pass over the mountain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was really liking it, until its final 30 minutes came along.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people are afraid to admit it but "The Sound of Music" remains one of the best and most classic musical movies ever made. I would also say that this is an almost perfect example of the genre but let me put some more emphasis on the word almost.Honestly, you could you not like this movie? It's cheerful, colorful and very charming. It's set in great colorful environments, features a sort of simple, no-worries type of story (untill its final 30 minutes) and some great and very memorable songs. It's a movie that can really lift your mood while watching it.To me this actually seems like a movie that can best be seen on the large silver screen. The nature environments, the sets, the colors, the camera-work, it all deserves to be seen on a large screen and it will make the movie no doubt look even better than it already does on an average sized television. There are still plenty of screening every year, so if you get the opportunity I really would recommend you to see this movie on the silver screen.Yes, it's a long sit, since the movie is almost 3 hours long but the movie is definitely worth it. It still is a bit odd to me though, that no matter how long the movie is, its ending still feels very rushed. Seriously, the whole WW II aspects got hardly mentioned at all in the first 2 hours of the movie and then boom! Suddenly there is a war going on. There is no real good build-up to it in its story, which in my opinion seems like a bit of a missed opportunity. The final 30 minutes feel really crammed in and rushed. Besides, in my opinion the movie never really reaches a fully satisfying conclusion. It still leaves a lot of questions open and has some loose ends in it, as if they were perhaps expecting to make a sequel to this movie some day.But this is not the only problem I had with the second half of the movie. I was really liking the movie for its cheerful atmosphere and uplifting story and characters but I did not at all see it's love story coming up. To me there was absolutely nothing at all that indicated that Maria and Captain Von Trapp were falling for each other and that these two persons were meant to be together. I was actually quite happy about it that for a change this looked to be a musical in which the two main characters wouldn't fall in love with each other. It pretty much came out of nowhere for me and it just didn't seemed to be something that this movie and its story needed.No complaints about the acting obviously. It still is Julie Andrews' most iconic and memorable role and Christopher Plummer also did a pretty good job. You probably wouldn't had recognized him, since he's still so very young and different looking in this movie. Can't also really complain about the child cast, though I should say that's its just a bit odd that none of the children really look alike. The one has blond hair and blue eyes, while the other dark hair with brown eyes. None of them really look they could be brothers or sisters in real life. But of course I understand that it would had been quite hard to find 7, singing, dancing and acting children, that also all look alike as well.With this movie Robert Wise once more showed his amazing versatility and talent as a director. Seriously, is there any genre this guy hasn't worked in? He of course had some practice already, with his other much acclaimed musical "West Side Story". But even when looking at just these two movies you'll notice how much different they actually are in its style and approach. Again, also this really shows how incredibly versatility and talented as a director Robert Wise was.All in all this remains a nearly perfect musical movie, that despite all my criticism of it, really remains a great and truly enjoyable watch.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escapist Entertainment, But Not Terribly Thought-Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sound of Music" was produced to entertain audiences and allow them to escape from reality for two hours. The vast majority of Broadway musicals produced in the middle of the 20th century were primarily leisure distractions. Only a handful of these offerings center around thought-provoking material, such as "Porgy and Bess", "South Pacific", "West Side Story", "The Man of La Mancha", even "My Fair Lady." But "The Sound of Music" was not designed to force radical contemplation of social issues. It was designed to make people feel happy about music, although depending solely upon the music in "The Sound of Music" to excite me about music would not really work.The release of "The Sound of Music" was the beginning of the end of Hollywood's love affair with the so-called Broadway musical that began with the advent of sound pictures. Between 1930 and 1960, the movie musical was a mainstream genre and represented a huge amount of the output of Hollywood. But after "The Sound of Music" in 1964, the movie musical began to disappear and films would go in varied directions. Many would focus on less escapist subjects, such as politics, dysfunctional relationships, even suicide. New genres entered the mainstream, such as science fiction and the action thriller. Fewer and fewer movie musicals would be produced, and none that I can think of would have the unparalleled success of "The Sound of Music".Most young people today are unaware that two of the biggest names in entertainment for about a third of a century were Rogers and Hammerstein who dominated musical theater in New York thereby influencing much of the output of Hollywood films shot in studios 3000 miles away from Broadway. Most if not all of the duo's musicals were green-lighted as movies. Their musicals were really fantasies with songs, light-hearted escapist fair designed to entertain, with little or no thought-provoking ideas or complex thematic writing. If you're looking for good old-fashioned entertainment, you need almost look no further. But if you want something that challenges your perspective, Rogers and Hammerstein have little to offer."The Sound of Music" was beloved by all who saw it when it was first released in 1965. It seemed the one movie everyone could agree they at least liked, if not loved. And it's reputation as everyone's favorite musical still persists, more or less, even today. But is it really as wonderful as everyone would have you believe? Is it worth some critical analysis? For today's younger audiences, "The Sound of Music" probably comes off rather dated. It is really a fantasy portending something deeper but doesn't quite get there, except for possibly a moment toward the end of the film. The story is an idealization of the history of the Von Trapp Family Singers and how their adopted mother, Maria, played with pleasurable innocence by the incomparable Julie Andrews, first met the children and their father. Andrews' singing voice is without question from the heavens and, along with her acting, holds the entire film together.Andrews' character, Maria, is at the beginning an Austrian nun in love with music and not so enamored with being in a convent. She keeps singing in the prayer halls. Realizing that Maria may not be fitting into the monastic life, the Mother Superior sends her to become the governess of the children of a widower and former naval captain who runs his household like Captain Bligh on the Bounty. At first not sure how to connect with this family, the young Maria uses music to bond with the children, and help them ultimately find the love of their father, played with militaristic fervor by Christopher Plummer, who finds himself reluctantly warming to the presence of Maria. The only real edge to the movie is toward the end when the Austrian annexation with Nazi Germany is briefly explored, an aspect that could have used further development.To enjoy this movie, you have to understand that the whole idea is escapist fantasy. The songs are sweet little corny tunes without much behind them, the likes of which would probably make Bach, Beethoven and/or Brahms cringe. They do what they are expected to do, and you might find yourself humming them afterward, but they do very little to spark the imagination. The title song "The Sound of Music" is probably Julie Andrews' best musical moment. It's really not that substantive a song by itself, but Andrews makes it great, which shows how exceptional a performer she really is. Simultaneously, you have to credit Rogers and Hammerstein for attempting the nearly impossible: writing a song about music without it lapsing into sentimental mush. At least the corniness of the title song is kept to a minimum. For me, the strongest songs are "Edelweiss", sung by Plummer about the flowers of Austria, and "Climb Every Mountain", sung by the Mother Superior to encourage Maria to find herself. I don't know if "Do a Deer" would really inspire young people today to explore music. The weakest number is a puppet show to the overlong "The Lonely Goatherd" which has no bearing on the story and goes on endlessly. Sort of reminds me of "Get Me to the Church on Time" from "My Fair Lady"."The Sound of Music" is not the easiest of movies to review without offending those who have so loved it. Pauline Kael's review of this movie was incredibly scathing, claiming the movie was purposefully designed to pull your heart strings in a single direction. I think Kael's assessment is a little unfair as every viewer must decide if the film touches them or not. Is it a good movie? Yes. Is it a bit corny? Perhaps, as it sacrifices substance in favor of sentimentality. That being said, if sentimentality is what you're after, "The Sound of Music" will definitely fit the bill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made cheese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly thought that I would never watch this film in a million years.I had seen many clips over the years and it didn't appeal at all.Then my girlfriend goes and says that she want's the DVD and I go and buy it for her birthday.My better half then insists that I watch the film with her.Of course,being the man of the house,I agree immediately.Guess what?I enjoyed the movie!!!! Of course,it is cheesy beyond belief at times.But when cheese is as well made as this it isn't really a problem.There are times when I had to stifle a chuckle.When the Mother Abbess bursts into 'Climb Every Mountain',I really struggled to take it seriously.But the story is charming,the acting is fine and the scenery is just stunning.The movie is also very well photographed with excellent lighting and fabulous interior shots.The songs don't all hit the mark,but are in general excellent.I especially liked 'The Lonely Goatherd','Do-Re-Me' and 'Edelweiss'.It has to be said though that the best thing in the movie is Julie Andrews,who shows again what a fine musical actress she was.Just as in 'Mary Poppins',she totally convinces as Maria and gives an excellent performance.She is sparky,dippy,strong and romantic and fits the role like a glove.So then,'The Sound of Music' isn't perfect.It is too long and there are cringe worthy moments.But all in all it is a fine family film with it's heart in the right place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AnschluB means 'joining' or 'connecting', not quite 'annexation'.Wise succeeds in making a movie out of the external scenery. The composition of landscapes and aerials, and that marvelous facade of the Von Trapp estate are the only cinematic bits. The actors are nicely scaled against the trees, then against the mountains.Once indoors, all we have are stages.The children's' farewell to the ball guests mirrors the escape from the Nazis...all it takes is a song to sweep us away.Julie won us with pure pluck and determination.Ideal family fare here.Interesting how comfortable our cinematic notions of the Nazis were then. Their worst perpetration here was impatience at the music festival, and we expected that. By the time of Spielberg's List, we got the psychopaths (which they were) that we expected. For uncomfortable cinematic notions, consider Polanski's Pianist; the notion that the culture that produced Bach, Beethoven, etc. could bomb the radio station broadcasting Chopin. Later, one of their own is swept away by the Sound of Music.</fullReview>

The initial sceneries are enthralling and create more interest for the movie. The roles were enacted superbly. Have seen it multiple times and enjoy it vividly every time i c it again. The music touches your heart and the lyrics are written very well. The direction and the locations are perfect. The characters apt.A simple movie which does not involve any thinking and can be enjoyed with complete relaxation. One of the Best dramas made. It has all the mixture in it and never in the movie is there a scene kept for the sake of keeping it, everything is just perfect.This is a masterpiece which gives boost to the movies of this kind. The new generation prefers thrillers actions and horrors and simply think these kind of movies to be slow and boring, but this one really contradicts them and is one movie where time passes by... The movie has a little bit of austrian patriotism and the climax dedicated to it.Overall an excellent movie to enjoy with family and a good movie to enjoy in lonely times :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has something magical in the sense that you could watch it over and over again without ever getting bored. Its powerful and compelling from beginning to end. The best thing about this movie is of course the songs; they have so much meaning and are perfect to the atmosphere in the movie at the time they are heard. The highlight is no doubt when Mother Superior sings 'Climb Every Mountain'. There is so much poignancy involved in that song that you begin to cry, laugh and just be stunned by the song at the same time. The only low point of this movie comes from Christopher Plummer's acting and especially his singing which lacks the quality of the other singers in the movie. If anyone's ever told you that this is an amazing movie, they couldn't be more right about it. Be prepared to experience many emotions in one movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is by far the best musical I've ever seen. I've seen this movie over and over and over again. The songs are legendary you're bound to have heard at least one of them if you haven't watched this movie. The songs are so catchy and the rhythm makes you want to dance and sing a long with the movie.Summary: This movie isn't just a musical, but it's also a love story, and a little suspense in the settings. I don't want to spoil ANYTHING, but the time setting is during WWII with Nazism. There is a little suspense, but it's mostly a love/musical story. If you classical catchy tunes, this is the movie to watch. I for one love watching this movie and I still watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching The Sound of Music, you are having a wonderful meal of music as there is a series of beautiful songs in it. The movie begins with the song ?®Maria?? and ends ?®Ev??ry Mountain??. During the movie, you can hear songs ?®The Sound of Music??, ?®My Favorite Things??, ?®You Are Sixteen, Going on Seventeen??, ?®Do??Re??Mi??, and so on. The whole story develops accompanied with music, that??s to say music is the main clue throughout the film. The music and the story have combined perfectly. It is a greatest success of the film.At the very beginning of the movie, Maria introduces herself by the song of ?®Maria??. We know more about her by the other nuns singing. She is hired to care for the seven children of the widowed Austrian captain Von Trapp. On her way to the captain??s villa, Maria is singing all the time in order to overcome her nervousness. It is music that makes her relax. At first, she does meet some difficulties. However, she estanblishes a bridge by musical material. The bridge leads her to the children??s hearts. It is music that makes the children change their attitude to her. During the following days, Maria and the children get well along with each other. Similarly, it is music that removes the obstacles in communication. Romanticly, Maria and the captain fall in love with each other. In a soft night, they come across to meet, taking that occasion, they express desires to each other by singing. It is so romantic that I wish I were Maria at that moment. Maria is no longer a nun. She is Von Trapp??s wife. Once again, it is music that changes Maria??s way of life.The song ?®Edelweiss?? strikes me deeply. It is a patriotic song. The song always recalls me of the scene the whole family fighting against the Nazis. They are very brave. They do not give in by the enemies?? enforcement. At the end, they manage to escape from trap by their excellent performance. What the Nazis armies do is in vain. It is music that lifts them out of danger.All of them are small pieces of Edelweiss, as the lines go ?®Edelweiss, Edelweiss, bless my homeland forever?­?­??In all occasions, we can hear music. In all conditions, we can sing songs. There is a Chinese saying that if it is no use to communicate with someone in talking, try singing. Maybe it is the reason that musics are so popular among people all over the world.It is the sound of music. It is the music of sound.</fullReview>

Really I love it so much that I cannot remember how many times I watch it. Maria, such a pretty and kind name and person for me now, is a tutor, but she love hr student just like her children and give them almost all her love. To free them and bring them out to the nature. She ignores the chitin??s military management on the children, which at last makes leave. Yes, she can do what she like, never gives up or accepts other??s will, even it will make her bad. She distinguishes right from wrong and understand how to maintain her rules .at last, she gains her reputation in the children and the trust and love of the chaptin. It is certain that what the classic is the well-known songs in it, which seems universal. If you ask me how do I think of the music in it, of course I love it. Why not?

However when I find that footman at the embassy ball to call each one of the guest's name such as "Miss Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering. Professor Higgins" is "Herr Zeller",I am shocked. And the Hungarian "Karpathy" is Theodore Bikel, who acts Captain von Trapp at the stage in 1959 or so. This make me feel........ Well, His figure is quite different from Christopher Plummer and when i hear his actually singing Edelweiss in CD i am nearly dizzy. Of course Mr Plummer's was dubbed and I am quite used to Bill Lee's. I don't know whether Mr Plummer's real voice is better than Bill Lee, but actually I don't like Theodore Bikel's singing, and, his flat figure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-a Review by thereturnoftheking-Starring: Julie Andrews (Maria) Christopher Plummer (Capt. Von Trapp) Richard Haydn (Max Detweiler) Peggy Wood (Mother Abess)Director: Robert Wise "The Sound of Music" is the timeless classic that in 1966 won a total of 5 Oscars from 10 nominations. It is based with songs of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and stars Oscar winning actress Julie Andrews as the free-spirited Maria who lives at a convent abbey in Salzburg, Austria. Maria is a young, wild, and free girl whom is called upon to become the governess of the retired Captain Von Trapp's seven children. The children have been known to play practical jokes upon the governess' causing them to leave. Maria plans to "guilt trip" the kids and then try and become friends with them. In this process she brings music back to a house where it has been silenced. A while later she and Captain Von Trapp marry. The Nazis take over Austria and order Captain Von Trapp to become a member of the navy. The family decides to flee accross the borders. When they learn of the closing of the borders, the decide upon living in the mountains. Before they can go they must sing in the Salzburg Festival.  On their way they are pursued by the Nazis and hide away in Maria's Abbey. When spotted they run and make it to the mountains with help from the nuns. The movie is very believable and seemed as if it was made just recently. The performances of Andrews and Plummer were Oscar worthy. It is very easy to fall in love with this Robert Wise production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "The Sound of Music." This is one film you cannot miss.Rating=(A-)(9/10)(a near masterpiece)</fullReview>

There is a lot of fun to be had especially for children &amp; big fans of musicals. If you are willing to forget some of the weaker story-lines (I get it it's a G movie) but the Nazi's hardly play any significant or actually scary bad guys even compared to other G-Rated films.

In fact, famed critic Pauline Kael was fired for daring to write a bad review of it when it first came out. Julie Andrews sure worked her mojo on that one.Funny thing is: The Sound of Music doesn't need protection from critics. Yes, it's schmaltzy, but it's not nearly as schmaltzy as, say, Titanic. Yes it has all those adorable kids and all those adorable songs and even a cute puppet show stuck right in the middle of it, but it also has grit, drama, and some harrowing moments. Hell, it's got Nazis racing around in big black cars! It is a total cinematic experience, and one that benefits greatly from technological advances that let you enjoy its lavish sights and sounds on a big TV screen with big surround speakers that make it feel like Julie Andrews is embracing your or the Nazis are sneaking up on you from behind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`The Sound of Music' has taken a great deal of flack for its corny musical ways. A lot of that flack is deserved. The songs are forced into the film with conspicuously bad results. The `choreography' is so despicably contrived that it isn't a wonder that stomachs turn at the sight of the infamous introduction. Lastly, Julie Andrews is a nightmare full of hot air.This film can pass family viewing standards for its cute plot, with cute children singing cute songs. However, only two things hold my interest as a mature viewer. The first is a dynamite performance by Christopher Plummer, the second is director Robert Wise. Still with momentum from his production of `West Side Story', Wise takes this silly musical and makes it into the memorable masterpiece it is today. No matter how ineffectual Julie Andrews is, or how Ernest Lehman's screenplay falls apart, the production remains remarkable. The cinematography is beautiful and complex in scope with Todd-AO film doing credit to the film.But just when it seems that Wise and company have been defeated by a bad plot, the film comes alive with maturity in the nick of time. First with a sensational romance then with a nail-biter of a dramatic finale. In the space of one hour I decided that I might actually recommend this film to someone over the age of 10.In fact this is a great film with something for everyone, and good luck getting those songs out of your head. 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nuns and Nazis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of "The Sound of Music" is a simple one; a postulant in an Austrian nunnery in the 1930s becomes the governess to the children of a widowed aristocratic naval captain and ends up falling in love with him. The two marry, but are forced to flee Austria when the Nazis invade in 1938. It is, very loosely, based on the story of the real Von Trapp family, although it takes many liberties with historical fact. In reality, Georg and Maria von Trapp fell in love in the twenties, not the thirties, were married in 1927 and had two children of their own by 1938. Maria was actually heavily pregnant at the time of her wedding, something tactfully omitted from the film. The family actually left Austria for America before, not after, the Anschluss. The film also differs somewhat, both in its plot line and its music, from the original Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical; when I first saw it in the theatre I was surprised to hear unfamiliar songs which do not feature in the film. One song, "Something Good", which was specially written for the film is now normally sung in stage productions, even though it was not included in the original.This was the Big Film of 1965 and the winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture. It was a great box-office success, and is sometimes credited with saving 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy after their huge losses on "Cleopatra". Nevertheless, it has a rather curious reputation today. It has not (unlike some films which were regarded as Big Films in their day) sunk into obscurity, but neither is it universally regarded as a beloved classic. There are of course some, especially among the older generation, who do think of it in that way, but for many it has taken on the status of a slightly naff guilty pleasure, something enjoyable if taken with a large pinch of irony. There is one cinema in London which hosts regular "Sound of Music" singalongs, with the audience encouraged to join in the songs and to dress up as nuns or Nazis. (I understand that on these occasions it is usual for the men to dress as Nazis and the women as nuns, although the opposite arrangement is by no means unknown).Certainly, this was a film I hated in my youth. I was first taken to see it as a child- it was the first film I ever saw in the cinema apart from a few Disney cartoons- and I didn't really understand what was going on. In my teenage years in the seventies and eighties it seemed to be on television ever Christmas, Easter and Bank Holiday, and I seemed to have to sit though every screening. (It was one of my mother's favourite films). In common with a lot of contemporaries I came to think of it as corny, sentimental and terminally uncool- a view shared by quite a few critics. Pauline Kael was allegedly dismissed from her job with McCall's magazine after writing a scathing review of it, and even its director Robert Wise originally described the story as "too saccharine". (He changed his mind after the director originally hired, William Wyler, dropped out). When in the mid-nineties the BBC included it in a season of "The 100 Greatest Films of All Time" one critic sneered that it did not even count as one of The 100 Greatest Musicals Set in Austria.Despite (or perhaps because of) that sneer I decided to watch that screening, and realised that the film was much better than I had previously given it credit for, an impression strengthened when I recently saw it again for the first time in about fifteen years. Of course, it does have its faults. Some of the songs- "My Favourite Things" in particular- really are too sentimental for words, and the film's schematic morality is a bit too black-and-white to be artistically satisfying. In the white corner you have nuns, cute children, true love and the power of music. In the black corner you have the Nazis. Not much room for a grey area there.Yet the film also has its virtues. The photography, of the magnificent Alpine scenery and of the architecture of Salzburg, is particularly fine. Richard Rodgers wrote some of his best music for the original stage-show, including songs like "Edelweiss", "Climb Ev'ry Mountain", and the title song, and the performers, especially Julie Andrews, do it full justice here. Andrews makes a likable heroine, combining musical ability with tenderness, practicality and religious faith. Christopher Plummer's Captain, however, is perhaps a bit too strict and authoritarian in the early scenes for his later transition into romantic hero to be altogether convincing, and he is too young for the part, appearing not only to have become a father while still in his teens but also to have served in the Austrian navy as a ten-year-old. I wouldn't rate the film quite as highly as Wise's other famous musical, "West Side Story", but then that is in my opinion, one of the greatest musicals ever. Despite the disdain in which it is held in some quarters, and the rather patronising post-modern irony with which it is regarded in others, "The Sound of Music" is a well-crafted, if now rather old-fashioned, piece of family entertainment. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really expected a lot from this film... I really did. I remember the jovial excitement popping the DVD in on Christmas Eve to view, from what I had heard, to be Rogers &amp; Hammerstein's Crowning Achievement. And, why should I have been led to think otherwise, when surveying all the evidence to be seen before me? Its immense popularity and following, the seemingly countless honors bestowed upon the film by AFI &amp; the Acadamy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences, the endless use of the songs in every medium of entertainment (be it homage or parody), etc. And, I admit, I recall being mesmerized by the amazing shot zooming across the breathtaking Austrian Mountains swooping in on an enthusiastic and lovely Julie Andrews. Just as grand as what I had been told to expect. However, as the film progressed, I sensed more than a couple things wrong with it that made it more than difficult to watch all the way through.Ultimately, "The Sound of Music" has difficulty asking itself the universal question that all great films do. Why does this story need to be told? Other alleged "great" musicals, such as "West Side Story", "Wizard of Oz", "King &amp; I", "Mary Poppins", heck even "Grease" are chief conveyors of how this can be done right and effectively. They are actually "about" something, and they make the viewers know it. "Sound of Music" seems content to simply sit back and settle for the typical "follow your heart" message. Even then, that hardly holds any weight at all by the end of the film, considering the decisions made by the Von Trapp family on behalf of themselves and their own safety, and no one else's. Everything wonderful about this film, it seems, stems from its success as a musical on Broadway and not from anything special in the film itself. The acting is wooden, the choreography unoriginal, the voice dubbing obvious and sloppy, the songs added for the film hardly memorable or containing the same kick as the ones written with Hammerstein's help (although, "I Have Confidence in Me" gets stuck in one's head quite easily). The cinematography is, admittedly, quite beautiful, but appearance isn't everything, you know. Looking under that thin layer of sparkling cinematography is nothing special or particularly complex, especially compared to "The King &amp; I", which has often drawn comparasin and which usually ends up taking a backseat to "Sound" in the "greatness" department for some odd reason. I would ultimately be content calling this a "good" film and accentuating all of its wonderful qualities if it did not already enjoy a massive following for those very reasons. It is not a horrible film, I am not calling it one. I am calling it overrated and certainly not one of the "greatest films" ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I survived the classic musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must stress yet again the fact that I don't like musicals, therefore I have avoided for years films such as this Academy Award winning 'classic'. Finally though, I have subjected myself to it, and survived.Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II have written some real show stoppers including the title track, "Do-Re-Mi", "My Favourite Things", "Climb Every Mountain" and the traditional "Edelweiss". All these catchy memorable tunes cannot dress up this predictable romance about an inept nun whose penchant appears to be with kids rather than for service to God in an abbey. Overlong and self-indulgent, it may have been the order of the day in the mid-60's, but not today. Only entertainment lies in Miss Andrew's splendid voice and the fun loving music.Political overtones may also be out of place, and if you want to get picky, though the cast do well, nobody portrays an Austrian very convincingly. Screenwriter Ernest Lehmann, along with director Robert Wise, has been very true to the stage musical, which undoubtedly pleased its legions of fans.Boris Leven's production design is grand, cinematography (Ted McCord and Paul Beeson) in the Austrian mountains is completely breathtaking, but the costumes are ridiculous.Saturday, October 7, 1995 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the respect for this movie's fans, but seriously I don't find it that great.For one thing, the biggest downside of this movie is its runtime. I mean, this movie is almost 3 hours long! It's too long and becomes tiring! A movie like this could be told in less 1 hour than this.The movie itself is nothing extraordinary either. But not everything is bad. It has some great moments which are really enjoyable.The opening sequence is perfect. It shows us all the beauty of big mountains, large lakes and a blue sky with clouds. Then Julie Andrews appears singing «The hills are alive with the sound of music». After that, the nice village of Salzburg (in Austria) is presented to us, which is another quality of the movie.Other great and memorable moments of this movie are the sequence "I'm sixteen, going on seventeen" and the part when Maria takes the 7 Von Trapp children for a walk in Salzburg and teaches them how to sing. This sequence has also the precious help of the naturally gorgeous backgrounds, surrounded by green places, giant mountains, a blue sky with clouds and a view to the village.I also enjoy when Captain Von Trapp finally accepts to bring back music to his life and his kids's lives. He even sings very well, like Julie Andrews does. More than that: from a cold and very serious man, he becomes a loving and nice man.The songs of this movie are all nice and classics.But the rest of the movie isn't that good. I think it has too many needless moments and perhaps that's why it becomes too long and even a bit boring. It naturally loses some of its enchantment and classic status. By the end, when the war starts, it becomes even slower.Julie Andrews and Cristopher Plummer play very well their roles and it's notorious that they really enjoyed making this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always thought that an operetta or a musical film should contain fairly fast moving action,choruses,humor, perhaps some uniforms,catchy music and singing talent. "The Sound of Music" contains only some of these.There are uniforms but not necessarily ones you'd want to run into.They're not Austrian Hussars,Russian officers,Mounties, but Nazis at the time of the Anschluss. Nor are they the most exciting voices: the Mother Superior exhorts,somewhat out of place, the "Climbing of every Mountain", the Baron (or Count),if he does at all, sings in an uninteresting bland voice; Julie Andrews is no Lily Pons or Kathryn Grayson, or even Jeanette MacDonald,but vocalizing in "Pediatric".walks us through her favorite places where "the dog bites" or "the bee stings". "When you're sixteen" etc. is rather insipid, and the nuns' chorus is on the juvenile side. The Baroness acts insecure rather than malicious and the whole cast of characters is not more than unidimensional. The photography and scenery are excellent,but apart from this I would feel that this is a children's picture; perhaps that was what was intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Songs but Just a Little Sappy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was probably "the" first blockbuster of my movie viewing period. I remember at the Academy Theater in downtown Minneapolis, it was the only movie that showed for over a year. People would come back to the small town I lived in and rave about. Because I was a kid with little money and no chance to tool around the big city, I didn't get to see it until it finished its initial run and made it out into the hinterlands. It was breathtaking on wide screen. That opening scene is really impressive. Everybody knows every song. Julie Andrews has always defined perkiness and energy and she carries it off magnificently. There is something missing somewhere. Despite all the great songs, the threat that was Naziism never quite comes through. They are there and they are the worst of the worst, but we never quite feel their power. Even the scene at the Abbey is a little hokey. Watching "Cabaret" which is certainly a totally different take, you see what these monsters could be. It is a musical with a little more depth, though not as mainstream. Still, how can you pass on the wonderful songs, the awesome production numbers, the visions of Austria, parading before us. It's a really good movie. I never quite got to the "great" part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get it; THIS is a classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't want to rain on anyone's parade here. I know TSOM is alleged to be one of the greatest musicals ever. That's why I (finally) watched it last week on DVD with my wife, who is a huge TSOM fan. Now that I have seen it, I don't get it. I admit up front that I have never been a big fan of musicals. When I was a kid and a song broke out in a cartoon, I usually lost interest. That hasn't changed.But even allowing for that, *this* is a classic film beloved by millions? Why? I mean, the setting is gorgeous, granted. And the actors do OK. But the plot, the pacing, even the music ... is this any better than most other musicals?My DVD player said this movie was almost three hours long. But *nothing happens* until you've watched it for 2 hours and 23 minutes (that's when the Nazi threat comes in). Until that point, here is the plot (and I don't think this is a spoiler for anyone, though maybe some people who haven't seen TSOM, like me until last week, might expect more): Former war captain who lives in inexplicably huge house in Austria with his seven kids and no wife meets former nun who starts as nanny and they fall in love and get married. That's it! More than two hours of kids singing, the nanny singing, the kids and nanny singing while they play, and increasingly loving looks and conversations between the captain and the nanny (though few of them compared to the singing). This plot could have occurred in less than an hour. There is very little original, or new, it. It is very, very slow. There is a minor B plot about a rich woman the captain is engaged to who bows to the inevitable and agrees to end the engagement. But that's all.There is no conflict (which most stories revolve around) until 2 hours and 23 minutes in, when the local townspeople who join the Nazis make a move. Then, when it gets interesting, the movie ends in less than 30 minutes after that point! Amazing! It ended with the family cresting a mountain and I said out loud, "That is IT?!" I expected much more. Watching a movie with no conflict (and the relationship between the nanny and the captain is hardly a conflict) is like idly following a river's current, with no destination in mind. If you like that kind of aimlessness, great. But if you want something that will hold your interest, and you don't enjoy aimless wandering, then TSOM isn't for you.Also, I thought the musical was amateurish in scenes that required background music. About 90 percent of the time, when two actors were having a discussion and music played in the background, that music was the melodies from various songs used elsewhere in the movie, one after another! So you are watching what is supposed to be a touching scene between the captain and the nanny outside at night, and under the dialogue is "The hills are alive, with the sound of muuuuuuuusiiiiccccc!" and "Edel-weisssss, Edel-weissssssss," and other tunes over and over. It was *extremely* distracting. I kept trying to listen to the dialogue but my mind was filling in the words to the melodies underneath it. Couldn't the film have used the same notes as background music but dropped the melodies? It seemed very odd. I can't remember ever hearing that before in a movie, or being so distracted by it.I'm puzzled by this love for TSOM. So many people care for this film, there must be *something* to it. But I'm not sure what it is. I do know that the people I know who like TSOM are all women. Most of my male friends haven't even seen it (other than snippets on TV now and then). Maybe it's a gender thing. In any case, I gave TSOM a 5. Don't shoot me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong on songs and location and charm; weak on passion!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That 'The Sound of Music' (SOM) is a greatly changed version of the true story of the Trapp Family Singers doesn't really matter much. It does not claim to be an accurate documentary ? what it is is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's (R&amp;H) finest musicals and like most of their work it has more to it than just the songs. From Oklahoma onwards R&amp;H created a series of musical plays all of which had semi-hidden dark undercurrents. So whilst SOM is at times rather over sweet there is enough substance to the story to make it rather more than a good couple of hours of jolly escapism. Robert Wise's film version moves at a cracking pace until the rather long drawn out denouement after the Salzburg concert. The Nazis search for the family in the Abbey just goes on and on! SOM is a love story and some may find that the falling in love of the Captain and Maria really does not fire particularly well. I realize that this is a family movie (and one made in 1965) so we cannot expect too much overt passion ? but neither Julie Andrews nor Christopher Plummer really convinces as a character suddenly consumed with romantic fervour! Their eventual embrace seems improbable and rather stagy. You certainly don't get the feeling that they are in a rush to rip one another's clothes off! Far sexier is the superb Eleanor Parker who not only looks fantastic as the Baroness but manages to convey a much earthier attraction for the Captain. Similarly Charmain Carr as Lisl ('Sixteen going on Seventeen') is actually very adult and appealing in her feelings for the telegram boy Rolf. Ms Carr was in fact twenty-two going on twenty-three when she performed the role and you fell that she could give some tips to Maria rather than the other way around!So although SOM is an unconvincing love story that does not seriously diminish its appeal as a movie. Julie Andrews is superb as the children's friend and the release from the straightjacket that she engineers for them is convincing. When she stands up to the Captain early on you feel that this is driven by a very genuine and almost innocent determination to set them free. There is no self-interest at play here - she does it because she thinks that it is right. Ms Andrews made SOM the year after Mary Poppins and frankly she continues the Mary Poppins character into Maria. Hence her performance works as the eccentric governess where it certainly does not as a portrayal of a young woman in love.You will want to see SOM because of the wonderful music and lyrics, the marvelous scenery in the location shots around Salzburg and the collective performance of the cast. The Oscars got it about right. Best picture, best direction, best editing, best music and best sound. But there were no actors Oscar's (although Julie Andrews and Peggy Wood were nominated) and, in truth, none of the individual performances is particularly worthy of much more than a special mention. No disrespect to Ms Andrews or Mr Plummer but the roles did really call for a bit more than they were able to give if we were to be convinced of the love that was supposed to be developing between them!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>She runs, she sings, she prances! Julie Andrews is back as another nanny (or, governess) to rambunctious children (this time 7), but her magical powers are confined to a guitar and a lilting soprano. The romance between she and Christopher Plummer doesn't work because his haughty decadence seems more in tune with Eleanor Parker's ice-poison beauty than with Andrews' overeager tomboy. Cast as Maria, a novice hired away from the convent, Julie isn't always the jovial Mary Poppins here; she's rather stern and overly precise, and when she returns as Plummer's wife, there's an awkward chasm between she and the family, as if they're asking, "Who is this new person?" The songs are fine, and the kids aren't offensive, but I can see why some refer to this as "The Sound of Mucus". It's ladled with indifference. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beloved, Very Likable Film, But Twice Was Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took me over 30 years to finally watch this film, something I did in 1998....and I could see why this is such a beloved film. I watched it one other time, about five years later on DVD, but didn't enjoy it as much and traded it for something else. However, I still have a high regard for the film. The film is a throwback to something you might see in the 1930s or '40s - a super-nice, old-fashioned movie led by Julie Andrews, who probably never again looked as pretty and wholesome as she did here. In fact, her image from this was so squeaky-clean that she went out of her way to play some sleazy parts in coming years. Too bad. At least here, she's a joy to watch. The kids are all nice, attractive and well-behaved, something else you don't see much anymore on film. Christopher Plummer is the male lead and once he loosens up, he's fine, too, as is the usually-funny Richard Haydn. Even the bad guys in this film - the Nazis (which include Eleanor Parker) - aren't prevalent. They don't have a lot of scenes in here even though they are an integral part to the story.The film is nicely photographed, too, and I don't mean just the Austrian Alps.I did think there were too many songs in here, something of them done twice. That's too much. Maybe that's what made me think two viewings were enough. (I'm not big into musicals.) On my second viewing, for some reason, I found the movie too boring in too many spots, which means a number of them since it's almost three hours long in total. It was slow-starting and I just couldn't get into it. I am glad at least I could enjoy this once.</fullReview>

I dislike all the merry singing in this film, really and I do not think that Julie Andrews is too good either, but there are some things I do really enjoy. I thought Christopher Plummer did a great job, especially in the beginning when he was still unhappy. I could really laugh at those grimaces he made. The parts of the story I like most are from when Maria (Julie Andrews) starts working at the von Trapp house until she leaves (mostly though the scenes with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer) and the part from the return of Capt. von Trapp returns from his honeymoon until the end. The rest is too merry and uninteresting. The movie is a bit too long as well, but heck it is not bad.6,5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I resisted watching "The Sound of Music" for many years. The plot sounded too sickly sweet to me. Once I finally broke down and watched this movie from beginning to end, I realized that the movie was sickly sweet, but it was also so compelling and the songs were so catchy that it was impossible to resist this movie. I know you just can not wait to hear me tell you whether you should have this movie in your collection, so I will tell you now that you should. This movie initially centers on Maria, played by Julie Andrews in one of her first film roles. Maria is a novitiate at an Abbey in Austria. Though Maria is earnest, being a nun seems a poor fit with Maria's outgoing and gregarious personality. The Mother Abbess, played by Peggy Wood in one of the final roles of her career, wisely decides that Maria needs a different perspective on life before facing the decision to take her vows. The Mother Abbess sends Maria to the Von Trapp family to be the children's governess. We quickly discover that Captain Von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, is a strict disciplinarian. We immediately see the primary conflict in this movie, one which can only lead to love and marriage as the two dominant personalities recognize that they need the strength of each other to survive in the world. However, before we get to the excitement that happens later in the movie, Maria needs to remind Captain Von Trapp that families are not armies, and that children need love, not marching and saluting. In the background of the main story is Nazi Germany's ambition of empire that led to the Anschluss or annexation of Austria into Greater Germany. Captain Von Trapp was a strong Austrian nationalist and was very opposed to the Anschluss. World events and Nazi Germany's insistence that Captain Von Trapp become a part of the German navy soon overshadow the honeymoon of Maria and Captain Von Trapp. The end of this movie must count as one of the most awe-inspiring endings ever filmed in a musical. Every scene with Julie Andrews is a treat. Andrews lights up the screen with her presence and her singing, fully justifying the Academy Award nomination she received for best actress in 1966 and the awards she won from BAFTA, the Golden Globes, and the Laurel Awards. Andrews' four octave singing voice is the vocal anchor that provides the basis for many of the charming and frequently beautiful songs. The songs range from soaring to sweet and catchy. Among these songs are "Edelweiss," "The Lonely Goatherd," "My Favorite Things," "Do-Re-Mi" and the title song. Though Julie Andrews was certainly a powerful force in this movie, the other stars helped complement Andrews' considerable talents. Christopher Plummer was outstanding as Captain Von Trapp, though he looks back on his role in this movie with distaste. The children were outstanding, and did an excellent job of singing and acting. Some of the children have gone on to extensive acting careers, others left acting after only this movie or a few roles to other activities. Eleanor Parker was awesome as Baroness Schraeder, the woman we all loved to hate because she came between Maria and the Children and the Captain. I will provide a brief word about the sound and the picture. I thought the sound was excellent, but I only have a 50" television with stereo speakers. I do not have surround sound connected. The sound was very good though I have some issues with lower frequency reproduction (I guess I need a subwoofer). I have a bigger issue with picture quality. The color keeps shifting between scenes. In some scenes the color is excellent. In other scenes, the color seems off. At first I thought something was wrong with my television, but I checked the quality of the picture against other inputs and realized that the problem was the DVD itself. The color shifts are often subtle, but in a few places they are annoying. I hope future releases have this problem fixed. This movie routinely makes top ten lists of the greatest musicals, as well it should. This movie may fall short of being a perfect movie, but I am unable to suggest how it could have been any better. I have watched multiple releases of this movie multiple times and regardless of the quality of the release, I watch each time almost as though I had never seen the movie before. You must have this movie in your collection, especially if you are a romantic at heart or have a family. Enjoy!</fullReview>

Beautiful and clean and sweet like chocolate-box, smelling with roses, Sound of music is well-made product of old-fashioned, skill-filled Hollywood. It is totally unrealistic escapism, and, according to Milan Kundera, movies like this are denying of crap. Oh, yes, Milan, so they are... so they indeed are!

		<fullReview>The greatest, best-known, most irritating and over-rated screen musical of all time - that's Rodgers and Hammerstein's last collaboration, 'The Sound of Music'. Julie Andrews is Maria, appearing on film again after her Oscar-winning triumph as Mary Poppins and her stage successes as Guinivere in Camelot and Eliza in My Fair Lady. Maria on stage had been the peerless Mary Martin, not quite as sugary as Andrews, but who could argue with this sweet-voiced screen version? Maria is in a convent but she isn't suitable material for a bride of Christ. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood, here I think dubbed for her rendition of 'Climb Every Mountain', considering her pure soprano years earlier) sends Maria out into the world to take charge of the Von Trapp children. Their father, the starchy Captain (Christopher Plummer) rules his household with perfect timing and has little love to give to his children - Maria is about to bring a ray of sunshine into their life.You know the big songs - 'Doh Ray Mi' (which seems to go on forever), 'The Lonely Goatherd' (while the children work with a puppet theatre), 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen' (lovely performances in a summer house from Charmian Carr as Liesl and Daniel Truhitte as Rolfe), and, of course, Julie Andrews spinning around a grassy hill singing the title song.Maria and the Von Trapps get caught in the second world war and have to ship out from the clutches of the Nazis pretty quickly. With the sugary musical backdrop to this war-torn drama stopping it working, this section of the film is sluggish in comparison to the joy of 'My Favourite Things'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Salzburg!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason for watching again this 1965 musical was the new release of the Blu-Ray DVD. Having seen at a young age the wonderful Broadway production starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, the movie version that followed greatly enhanced a work, that in its own merit, didn't need any improvement. As directed by Robert Wise, right after his triumphant "West Side Story", we were stunned to see how the director had opened up the film by placing the action just where it was supposed to have been taken place, the cinematic and gorgeous Salzburg.The new version we just saw is as splendid as when the film was originally released, but somehow in second viewing, we started to notice how sadly it has aged. Our first impression was much better than on second viewing because the original seemed larger than life. In fact, our copy of the film, even with the fine restoration cannot compare with the sensation of watching in a wide screen, which we believe was at the old Roxy where it played for quite a long time. Those were the days of exclusive engagements and this film qualified for it big time! Julie Andrews was at one of the highest points of her career, and as Maria her contribution to the overall enjoyment is invaluable. Christopher Plummer was an ideal Capt. Von Trapp. Eleanor Parker's Baroness has enough parts of charm and bitchiness seeing her man stolen by a novice in charge of those brats she would have inherited had she married the Captain.The real star of this production was Salzburg, that beautiful Austrian city that has kept its charm throughout history and the surrounding countryside is breathtaking. The film owes a lot to its cinematographer Ted McCourd who captured the magnificent locale in such a loving way. The music of Rogers and Hammerstein blends well within the context of the picture. It is a tribute to Robert Wise this film has endured the passing of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical Revisionism Masked as a Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I had an opportunity to watch "The Sound of Music" and within minutes I was wondering: "Why am I watching this movie?" This movie is corny, contrived, and deals with a story that not only I could not relate to, I couldn't care less what happened to the characters. When a movie suggests that non-Jewish Austrians were also victims of the Nazis, then that movie loses all credibility. The fact is that the Jews were the special targets of Nazi rage; other groups at least had the choice of conforming to avoid being targeted. The Jews did not have that choice. It's too bad the Von Trapps had it rough, but that's because they made it rough on themselves. And by the way, who told the Austrians to invite the Germans into their country? The Austrians welcomed Hitler as their savior and salvation. That is a matter of historical fact. So please don't tell me about an Austrian family that has to flee Austria, and is singing their way through the movie in the process. The Jews in Austria had to get out and so I can understand a movie about, let's say, a Jewish family having to flee for their lives. But a non-Jewish Austrian family, in which the father is a naval officer, having to flee? That's really missing the mark for gaining any kind of empathetic response. And although the musical numbers are catchy, they do not suffice to rescue this movie from the corniness that renders it suitable only for young children who want to learn catchy songs. But if you want to learn what really happened in Austria in 1938, and how Austria openly embraced Nazism, read any credible book on European history during the inter-war years, or better yet, read up on the life and times of three well-known Austrians associated with World War Two - Adolf Eichmann, Adolf Hitler and Kurt Waldheim - and then tell me about the "plight" of the Austrians. Indeed, one can only wonder what J. S. Bach or J. Strauss would have thought if they had been around to witness their country's pitiful decline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wholesome woman leaves Austrian convent and goes to be governess for a captain's children right before the Nazis take over Austria. Go figure! As it was, I spent most of "The Sound of Music" throwing out the sort of comments that Mike, Servo and Crow hurl at the grade-Z movies that Dr. Forrester sends them on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Seeing Christopher Plummer - who apparently called the movie "The Sound of Mucus" - I thought to myself: "So that's the guy from 'The Return of the Pink Panther', 'Dragnet', 'Dolores Claiborne', 'The Insider' and 'Syriana'?" As for Julie Andrews, she basically reprises her "Mary Poppins" role. And considering that it was Austria, we now probably will think that someone could have just gotten Arnold Schwarzenegger to come in and kick Nazi booty.For the record, one of the "Simpsons" comic books had Sideshow Bob and his brother Cecil spoofing famous musicals (including this one) with songs about killing Bart Simpson. And I read that after the Von Trapps fled Europe, they eventually settled in Vermont. I wonder, could Maria have gotten to know Ben &amp; Jerry? Anyway, "TSOM" isn't terrible; it just seems so hokey in the 21st century. I personally prefer to remember Robert Wise (RIP) for "West Side Story".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wouldn't hurt to understand politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is most interesting that just about everybody takes this movie as a romance. There is nothing further from the truth. It was and is a propaganda film.What is the story? Austrian girls are so naive, just sing in the mountains. It was easy to trick her into Nazism! Anybody noticed that the Austrian captain hates the Germans? He is 'The Lovable One' associated with all Austrians. And the highly emotional scene in the open-theatre when they escape ... don't you just feel for poor Austrians, they were tricked by the Nazis! The crowd just leans what the Nazis are doing! They go 'wow'! Their breath is broken! They didn't know nothing! They must be innocent! Austrians really are not so bad people - look, they are mostly like us! May be it's not true what they say about them. But yes, it is true. They were heavily Nazis even after the war. It was only in the mid 50s when they started to change. In the 60s the western politicians wanted to look at them as a bridge between the West and the East. And voil?! You had to accept them as part of the western world. You had to quickly forget you fought them in two world-wars, millions of you children bled to death to stop their absolutism! To please you and to satisfy your hatred the Germans are thrown into the lion's cage. Hate Them! They are evil!! Even if it is clear today that they didn't cause WWII. You want to live in a black-n-white world, we are good, they are bad, simple as that. And this movie plays on that.It is a well made propaganda film, far beyond anything Adolf could dream up. Psychology at best, no question about it. Works on you even today. Directing, performance, camera-work, everything beautifully done! A pearl of movie making. Its just that it's not a romance ...Greetings to the movie-lovers. You really can't see, this is a propaganda film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was an exchange student in the USA many years ago, my host-father showed me this film as being his favorite movie which he has seen in the cinema many times when it came out and still watches regularly ever since. I had never heard of that movie and since I am quite fond of musicals, I gave it a try.Now, I dearly love my host-father, but I really hate this movie. I have seen it twice so far, once with him to get to know it and once a few months ago when it was shown on German TV for the first time (!!). But the second time I only watched it to play Mystery Science Theater 3000 with some of my friends.The reason why this movie had never been shown on German TV before was because the German language track had been lost for many years and was only rediscovered by accident a while ago. But why did nobody in the German speaking region care to find the language track of this much beloved movie earlier? The main reason is that this movie, though it may have been successful in most parts of the world, was not so in Germany, Austria or Switzerland - and for good reason.Everything in this movie is just sooooooooooooooo terrible cliché! The cinematography, the dresses, the way everybody behaves.... ugh! If this is the way Americans look at Austria (or Germany and Switzerland, since I have the feeling that many do not really know the differences between these countries) than we really have a lot to do to correct this picture.But there is another reason, why I don't like this movie. It is really insulting to one's intelligence. The whole thing feels like it was made for kids (and done badly), everybody is virtuous, smiling all the time, bouncing around happily running through the countryside just enjoying being alive. Above all they sing songs that could come out of Sesame Street. Actually I was expecting a song that teaches you how to count to ten to pop up any minute. Come on! This is not beautiful, it is just plain dumb!There was a German oder Austrian movie made in the fifties called "Die Trapp Familie" and following its success, a sequel was produced later about their life in the US. The fifties in the history of German movies were notorious for the tacky "Heimatfilme" (homeland movies) that were produced in this era portraying Germany and Austria as happy beautiful places where happy people lived who did nothing but smile and enjoy the countryside all day long. "Die Trapp Familie" was one of these bad movies, but even this movie did not come close to the abomination that is "The Sound of Music". At least the former had some level, albeit small, of realism.I like Julie Andrews as an actress and singer, but this movie was not only not saved by her performance, but made even worse. I hope they put the German language track back on the dusty shelf where they found it and never show this movie in Germany again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's me, maybe it's because I spent 3 hours subjected to this musical and horrid happiness on a bus tour around Europe, which occurred just prior to people physically going ON the tour for this film...I appreciate everyone else's opinion of this movie, but frankly, I can't stand it.My review would be, if you like musicals, go for it. If you're an 80's kid who can't stand them...Well you get it.The coach I was had a decent setup, but the back of the bus was so loud I almost blew my ears off with my mp3 player, trying to drown Julie Andrews shrieks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musicals suck, and this dog is no exception. Let's review this mutt of a movie, shall we? A quirky nun gets a job as nanny to a covey of pompous brats. She's not bad looking, so the ship captain/father of the little ingrates wants to make a move on her, but he'll have to catch her in between tunes because she can't go five minutes without crooning poetic about the birds, the trees, and what's on the dinner menu for tonight. Musicals are the stupidest kinds of films. Two blubbering idiots talking gibberish until one of them bursts into song... what the hell? You can have 'em.If the captain had any brains, he would have grabbed that Baroness chick, jumped on a Love Boat cruise to a south sea island, and made her dance naked in a bamboo cage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's stop at the very beginning... a very good place to stop....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the breathtaking opening shots of the Alps, there's really nothing to like about this terrifyingly glib and overly jubilant movie musical about the struggle for freedom and love in Nazi Austria. Julie Andrews at least puts some effort into her character, but it doesn't work very well when she comes across as the one gold piece in the barrel full of tarnished pennies. Christopher Plummer is great at being domineering... but he's also great at taking in every scene for himself. And the children are just obnoxious. Every single one of them. Not to mention some of Rodgers and Hammerstein's most dismal songs, unimpressively choreographed dance scenes, and a snobby Baroness who finds a way to bring the movie down even further. I liked this only a few years ago. Oh, how naive I was then! Now, I realize that it is the pampered child of R&amp;H, while its more intelligent siblings are constantly berated in its shadow. I suppose it's all of those things (especially the way it overshadows its superiors) that make our hearts cursed with "The Sound of Music."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't anything to say about this drool to save it from the trash. I only hope that there is a version where the VonCraps freeze to death in an Alpine pass, OR even better yet Rolf shoots the pervert Capt. when he has the chance. I would have ! This movie is such dribble. NOW I have to write ten lines about it in order to submit my comment. Well here goes: I just get sick when Weasel screeches "WEEEE" after the stupidest of songs, "You are 16 .." She reminds me of the GEICO pig, "wee wee weeing" all the way home. Oh, need I mention the crappy dialog???The pidgin German? "Fraulein" used extensively while the rest of the dialect is in English!! AND tell me what good Austrian would take "Tea with Jam and Bread" over a literstein of fine lager and some WURST?? Do I have 10 lines yet? Yes,yes I do! Here's a few more. So what was the Capts. attraction to Maria?? Was it truly the pine cone up the rear that stole his heart? I would think that when you are engaged to a BARONESS with lots of money that some crummy, nun wanna-be would NOT be the woman of choice. BUT NO! VonKrap has his jib up for the novice and why?? Because she was probably a VIRGIN! Fresh Snow to muddy up. So he DUMPS his fiancé and sets sail for the Lady of the Cloth. ALL THE WHILE living in denial that his crummy country has not been annexed by Germany's Third Reich. Hiding behind that, he shurks his duty as a Naval Capt. and scampers with his new found squeeze to Switz. Visit my new site named "This movie sucks".

		<shortDescription>1 Fanciful Nanny + 7 Mildly Retarded Kids = The Worst Musical Ever Committed to Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't already know, let me tell you: I don't like musicals. I find them to be grating, poorly made, horribly uninteresting affairs. I've never quite understood the logic behind someone breaking into a song and dance routine and singing about their deepest, most secret feelings. If you're secretly in love, it might be best not to do a Bollywood number entitled "I'm in Love!" right in the middle of town. It kind of kills the secret. Also, musicals are always so damn fanciful. Why not do a realistic one? I can just see a musical with a number called "I Just Had an Abortion, and I Feel Fine". That, my friends, would be Academy Award gold.But no, musicals are never realistic. They tell stories about inner-city gangs who fight with their words and Plies', or nightclub whores for hire with TB who have hearts of gold. And, somehow, people eat this stuff up like it's going out of style, and fast. Honestly, if you've seen one musical you've seen almost all of them. So why do people go to them in droves? One musical in particular perplexes me most. "The Sound of Music" tells the tale of a naive nun who leaves her convent to raise seven children with a collected IQ so small that, if brains were gas, they couldn't power a motorcycle around the outside of a penny. Together the nanny and the kids sing and sing and sing pointless songs like "Do Re Mi" and the titular track, "The Sound of Music". There's also, "My Favorite Things" in which it is revealed that brown paper packages tied with string make people happy. Well, I suppose the brown paper and string couldn't possibly be as boring as this film."The Sound of Music" is not one of those films that is so bad it's good. It's one of the ones that's so bad it makes me want to burn the theater to the ground. If anything, it's the most offensively numb portrayal of World War II ever made. Here we see World War II as a swirling, candy-colored vortex of happiness. Instead of death and terror, the Nazis bring sunshine and lollipops to the world of Maria and the Von Trapp kids. Even in the middle of being chased by Nazi tanks, the Von Trapp clan have time to stop and sing an ode to their beloved hills. Apparently, Hitler had a soft-spot for musical numbers. Why else would the Nazi's stop chasing them long enough to hear "The hills are alive..."? Look, it's not like I'm saying I wanted a hard-hitting WWII epic, but I would prefer to not have my intelligence insulted. Even the simplest things in this movie are insultingly stupid. Look at Papa von Trapp. He's an Austrian naval officer. Sincewhen does Austria, a land-locked area, have the need for a Navy? Where is this guy sailing, the Olympic pool at the nearest five-star hotel?The addition of Julie Andrews into this horrific misfire only makes things worse. Of all the movie musical stars, Julie Andrews is the worst by far. She can't sing to save her life and she has the acting range of a less skillful Keanu Reeves. When you're less than Keanu, you know it's time to pack your bags and leave the business. The kids are no better. They're the kind of kid actors who strive way too hard to be cute. They are what I call Lipnickian children, in honor of Jonathan Lipnicki, the world's worst child star."The Sound of Music" was directed by Robert Wise, the recently deceased director of such films as "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" and the original "The Haunting". Somewhere in between those two classics, Wise managed to create this steaming turd. How a fine director like Wise got dragged into a project like this is beyond the realm of understanding.I don't know if Wise ever apologized for making this, but he should have because true fans of his other works would never have seen this coming and, if they're like me, they were not happy. Look at it like this: if Michael Bay, crappy action movie virtuoso, were to direct "Wicked: The Movie Musical", do you think fans of his "Armageddon" (should they exist) would be pleased?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Girl Asked Me to Take Her to See this Film on a Date. I Broke the Relationship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One commentator has said: "When I was young I used to picture the audience for this film as slightly deaf old women in surgical stockings and bad hats, and my attitude still holds." Does he know how close to the truth that statement is? I remember as a kid being dragged to see this film by the family. I had already heard some of the music from this film on the radio, and it was so sickly sweet that I had to continuously fight the urge to vomit. So I was dreading to see the film.So I sat in the stalls of the Dominion in Tottenham Court Road with the family, which included the aunts in the surgical stockings and bad hats, some of whom had seen the film as many as six - yes, six - times and had somehow resisted the urge to throw themselves off Charing Cross Bridge into the murky waters of the endless mighty Thames.All my worst fears were confirmed. This film was as bad as I thought it would be.From the moment that Julie Andrews first appeared on the screen singing that sickly song, and having to endure the shrieks of the Reverend Mother, we are introduced to the dysfunctional Von Trapp family.It did have one benefit. I began to grow up fast after that, so that I would be big enough not to be dragged by the family to watch Von Crapp like this.Judging by some of the later parts played by Julie Andrews, I got the impression, rightly or wrongly, that even SHE realised she had made a mistake in appearing in this film, and was taking on ever more raunchier roles to compensate.Apart from the story, the dialogue, the lyrics, the conception, there is nothing technically wrong with this film. But if you have any intelligence at all you will not bear to watch it. As to those who have seen it many times, they all have one thing in common: they are all Roman Catholic. Many of them even think that this is a religious film. (Oh, they do. They do.) Finally, to those who have read my summary above, and who do not believe that I turned down a date with a good-looking girl because she wanted to see The Sound of Music, I can say that that is what happened. Literally. I like my women to have something upstairs. This girl clearly had not.</fullReview>
